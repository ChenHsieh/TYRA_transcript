00:00.000 --> 00:20.500
So after I graduated from university, I think I did an RA, if I remember correctly, at Professor Chen's place, right?

00:20.500 --> 00:26.500
I did it for a year or two

00:27.500 --> 00:34.500
After that, I went to Canada's McMaster to study for my PhD

00:34.500 --> 00:40.500
When I was studying for my PhD, one of the tutors was Dr. Trenner

00:40.500 --> 00:47.500
He was doing a course on music perception and intuition

00:47.500 --> 00:55.500
If you're interested, you can ask him why he chose to do music

00:55.500 --> 00:58.500
or intuition and cognition

00:58.500 --> 01:04.500
I don't know much about intuition, but my impression is that

01:04.500 --> 01:08.500
doing visual psychology takes up a large portion of the work

01:08.500 --> 01:12.500
So why did I decide to do intuition? I think it's interesting

01:16.500 --> 01:20.500
I don't know, it's just my guess

01:20.500 --> 01:24.500
Yongyi has a website, you can go check it out, it's really scary

01:24.500 --> 01:28.500
The publications are as long as ghosts

01:28.500 --> 01:33.500
Other than the publications, there's also awards and media coverage

01:33.500 --> 01:35.500
I think that's really cool

01:35.500 --> 01:38.500
I hope one day I can tell my parents that I'm a journalist

01:38.500 --> 01:44.500
Without further ado, let's welcome Yongyi to share his research with us

01:45.500 --> 01:50.500
I'll turn off my mic so you can hear me

01:50.500 --> 01:53.500
Can you hear me now?

01:53.500 --> 01:55.500
I think it's okay

01:55.500 --> 01:58.500
I'm a little shy

01:58.500 --> 02:00.500
I don't even know if I have to give a score

02:00.500 --> 02:03.500
Today is July 8th, I'm guessing my highest score is 87

02:03.500 --> 02:05.500
I can't go any higher

02:05.500 --> 02:07.500
That's about it

02:07.500 --> 02:09.500
I can predict the results

02:10.500 --> 02:14.500
You have to turn on the audio so you can hear the laughter

02:14.500 --> 02:17.500
I don't think there's any feedback

02:17.500 --> 02:19.500
I think we need feedback

02:19.500 --> 02:21.500
Forget it

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500
It's pretty funny

02:23.500 --> 02:26.500
I'm being encouraged, I'm indeed a person who studies truth psychology

02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
It's different

02:28.500 --> 02:31.500
I'm probably just making things up

02:32.500 --> 02:36.500
I'm not really interested in hearing

02:36.500 --> 02:39.500
There's no deep reason

02:39.500 --> 02:42.500
First of all, I'm very interested in music

02:42.500 --> 02:45.500
I only found out later that most people do visual research

02:45.500 --> 02:47.500
Most people talk about intuition

02:47.500 --> 02:50.500
It's directly implied that it's visual research

02:50.500 --> 02:52.500
I only found out later

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
If you're doing hearing research

02:54.500 --> 02:56.500
You have to say it's particularly famous for auditory

02:56.500 --> 02:58.500
Otherwise people will get it wrong

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
It's pretty interesting

03:00.500 --> 03:03.500
I think there are some phenomena in hearing

03:03.500 --> 03:07.500
It's different when it comes to other senses

03:07.500 --> 03:11.500
There are some special problems to deal with

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
I think that's what makes hearing interesting

03:13.500 --> 03:15.500
It's a special place

03:15.500 --> 03:19.500
Okay, let's get into my presentation

03:19.500 --> 03:22.500
I'm going to start studying how to share my screen

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
Okay, while you're studying

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
Let me tell you

03:29.500 --> 03:32.500
Just in case there's feedback

03:32.500 --> 03:34.500
Let me turn off the microphone

03:34.500 --> 03:37.500
If you have anything you want to say

03:37.500 --> 03:40.500
You can type it in

03:40.500 --> 03:43.500
You can also speak

03:43.500 --> 03:44.500
Okay

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
Okay

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
Let's go

03:47.500 --> 03:49.500
Okay

03:49.500 --> 03:54.500
My PhD research topic is

03:54.500 --> 03:58.500
It's very vague

03:58.500 --> 04:00.500
Dynamic Auditory Communication

04:00.500 --> 04:02.500
It's vague

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
It's about how to change your hearing

04:04.500 --> 04:07.500
In a dynamic situation

04:07.500 --> 04:10.500
How to change your hearing

04:10.500 --> 04:13.500
In a dynamic situation

04:13.500 --> 04:15.500
This includes

04:15.500 --> 04:17.500
For example, you're listening to me now

04:17.500 --> 04:19.500
All my voices change at any time

04:19.500 --> 04:21.500
For example, every time I make a sound

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
There's a millisecond

04:22.500 --> 04:24.500
And then it disappears

04:24.500 --> 04:25.500
Or listening to music

04:25.500 --> 04:27.500
It's kind of like that

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
And then

04:28.500 --> 04:31.500
And what I want to share today is

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
My experiment

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
From a traditional laboratory

04:34.500 --> 04:35.500
Psychological laboratory

04:35.500 --> 04:37.500
And then do it

04:37.500 --> 04:39.500
More complicated

04:39.500 --> 04:41.500
We think it's closer to the real

04:41.500 --> 04:42.500
Interaction

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
Under the environment of human interaction

04:44.500 --> 04:45.500
That is

04:45.500 --> 04:48.500
From a small laboratory to a large laboratory

04:48.500 --> 04:49.500
Between each other

04:49.500 --> 04:51.500
There are some research methods

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
Needs to be adjusted

04:53.500 --> 04:56.500
And then I just want to explain today

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
Take our research as an example

04:58.500 --> 05:01.500
How do we do this

05:01.500 --> 05:02.500
So my sub-topic is

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
How do psychologists do research

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
And there is a step-by-step explanation

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
Explain

05:07.500 --> 05:09.500
What are the problems we encounter

05:09.500 --> 05:10.500
And then

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
We think

05:11.500 --> 05:12.500
In our situation

05:12.500 --> 05:13.500
How do we solve it

05:13.500 --> 05:14.500
And then

05:14.500 --> 05:15.500
By the way

05:15.500 --> 05:16.500
Just

05:16.500 --> 05:17.500
Just

05:17.500 --> 05:18.500
Please help everyone

05:18.500 --> 05:20.500
The place is

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
September

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
Taiwan's Science and Music Magazine

05:23.500 --> 05:24.500
There will be a

05:24.500 --> 05:27.500
A special special issue of music psychology

05:27.500 --> 05:28.500
And then

05:30.500 --> 05:31.500
I want to put this

05:31.500 --> 05:32.500
Related research

05:32.500 --> 05:33.500
It's a draft

05:33.500 --> 05:34.500
Go over there

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
As a

05:35.500 --> 05:36.500
A small topic

05:36.500 --> 05:37.500
Just share it

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
Just as a science book

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
Share it to readers in Taiwan

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
Then I didn't write it myself

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
The experience of doing a science book article

05:45.500 --> 05:46.500
Then if I hope

05:46.500 --> 05:47.500
That is to say

05:48.500 --> 05:50.500
I hope to make today's speech

05:50.500 --> 05:51.500
Into different fields

05:51.500 --> 05:52.500
People interested in science

05:52.500 --> 05:53.500
Can probably

05:53.500 --> 05:54.500
Psychologists

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
How do we do research

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
Especially in

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
How do we do research

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
In such a special situation

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
If you think

05:59.500 --> 06:00.500
On the content

06:00.500 --> 06:01.500
Or how to explain

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
How can it be adjusted better

06:03.500 --> 06:04.500
That is

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
I hope you can tell me

06:06.500 --> 06:07.500
Then

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
I will

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
I'm going to take the exam in two weeks

06:10.500 --> 06:11.500
So thank you very much

06:11.500 --> 06:13.500
If there is any help

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
OK

06:14.500 --> 06:15.500
it is good

06:15.500 --> 06:17.500
The nonsense should be over

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
First of all, I want to say

06:19.500 --> 06:21.500
Hearing has many domains

06:21.500 --> 06:22.500
Like for example

06:22.500 --> 06:24.500
You can know if the pitch is high or low

06:24.500 --> 06:26.500
What I want to focus on today is

06:26.500 --> 06:27.500
Focus on time

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
For hearing

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
Is a very important thing

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
In fact, time is for many senses

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
And the reaction is very important

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
For hearing

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
I think it is especially critical

06:37.500 --> 06:38.500
Why

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
If you record my voice

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
Then take it to

06:41.500 --> 06:42.500
In the software of the computer

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
Open it

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
Look at its radio

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
Its radio

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
It looks like

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
Almost like this

06:47.500 --> 06:48.500
Then you can of course

06:48.500 --> 06:49.500
Decode

06:49.500 --> 06:50.500
That is to say

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
What is my voice

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
Then

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
Our hearing is

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
We have to put it together

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
To become a meaningful sentence

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
Ah

06:58.500 --> 06:59.500
But it's hard for hearing

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
That is to say

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
Every message

07:01.500 --> 07:04.500
The time it appears is so short

07:04.500 --> 07:05.500
And

07:05.500 --> 07:07.500
It won't appear again

07:07.500 --> 07:08.500
Ah

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
Human beings have lived for so long

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
History

07:10.500 --> 07:11.500
The history of human communication

07:11.500 --> 07:12.500
Before the recorder was invented

07:12.500 --> 07:13.500
We have no chance

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
Listen again

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
What happened before

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
How is it

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
So human hearing

07:18.500 --> 07:19.500
A big problem

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
That is to say

07:20.500 --> 07:22.500
We have to be able to catch it quickly

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
Ah

07:23.500 --> 07:24.500
This message is displayed at any time

07:24.500 --> 07:26.500
And then accurately

07:26.500 --> 07:27.500
Awareness

07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
Feel it accurately

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
The content of this

07:29.500 --> 07:30.500
Then

07:30.500 --> 07:31.500
And another

07:31.500 --> 07:32.500
More demanding is

07:32.500 --> 07:33.500
That is

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
We are not just aware of this

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
And we have to

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
Make a quick response

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
For example

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
When you have a conversation with others

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
What are you hearing

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
You will be able to understand immediately

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
Then immediately

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
Be able to react

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
Then this skill

07:45.500 --> 07:46.500
When quarreling

07:46.500 --> 07:47.500
It's particularly important

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
Because if you slow down

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
If you slow down

07:49.500 --> 07:50.500
You lost the quarrel

07:50.500 --> 07:51.500
It's very

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
It's important to speak

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
Right

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
So you see

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
Human beings are like this

07:55.500 --> 07:56.500
No, I'm kidding

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
That

07:57.500 --> 07:58.500
Not only in conversation

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
In another situation

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
For example, you are listening to music

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
Ah

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
And for example, you are with

08:03.500 --> 08:04.500
You sing with others

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
Ah

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
Sing together

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
That

08:07.500 --> 08:09.500
I can't just listen to other people's music

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
Listen to this

08:10.500 --> 08:11.500
I'm going to

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
Sing my part

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
Because you are like this

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
No matter how fast your processing speed is

08:15.500 --> 08:17.500
There must be a time difference inside

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
That

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Ah

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
So

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
In fact, in many cases of hearing

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
We think it is

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
He keeps

08:24.500 --> 08:25.500
Keep predicting

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
What's going to happen next

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
Then let people

08:29.500 --> 08:30.500
Always

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
Let your intuition

08:31.500 --> 08:32.500
Let your nervous response

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Always in a

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
In a well-prepared situation

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
Then you can

08:35.500 --> 08:37.500
Precise intuition to this matter

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
And then

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
Quickly prepared

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
To make the next reaction

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
So I think hearing is on time

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
Ah

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
In fact, compared to other sensory domains

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
Is

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
More demanding

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
This is

08:50.500 --> 08:51.500
My task

08:51.500 --> 08:53.500
So I think time is very important to hearing

08:53.500 --> 08:54.500
Ok

08:54.500 --> 08:55.500
If you have any questions

08:55.500 --> 08:56.500
You can interrupt me in the middle

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
Then if there is no problem

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
I will continue

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Then

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
By the way because I

09:00.500 --> 09:01.500
Now

09:01.500 --> 09:03.500
I share the screen

09:03.500 --> 09:04.500
So if everyone

09:04.500 --> 09:05.500
If you leave a message in the chat

09:05.500 --> 09:07.500
I should not be able to see it now

09:07.500 --> 09:08.500
So everyone can

09:08.500 --> 09:09.500
Just turn on the microphone

09:09.500 --> 09:11.500
It has nothing to do with me

09:11.500 --> 09:12.500
Ok

09:12.500 --> 09:13.500
Ah

09:13.500 --> 09:14.500
I have a question

09:14.500 --> 09:15.500
Ok

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
Please say

09:17.500 --> 09:18.500
The

09:18.500 --> 09:21.500
The M-I-N-G-E-R above the waveform

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
What is that?

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
Oh, that's just an example I found on the Internet

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
I don't know what that is

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
Sorry

09:29.500 --> 09:30.500
Ok

09:30.500 --> 09:31.500
Ok, thank you

09:32.500 --> 09:34.500
It should be a project title

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
Yes

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
It looks like this

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
But I don't know

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
I haven't searched either

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
Alright

09:43.500 --> 09:44.500
Maybe it's doing something

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
Voice

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
Voice of the computer

09:46.500 --> 09:49.500
Some of the projects handled by the visual

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
I don't know

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
Sorry

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
Then I will talk about it first

09:53.500 --> 09:55.500
In traditional psychology and neuroscience

09:55.500 --> 09:58.500
How do we do this kind of research in the lab

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
If we want to know

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
What is the importance of time for hearing

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
How do we do research

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
For example

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
I

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
I will

10:05.500 --> 10:08.500
Design a series of hearing with a computer

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
A series of hearing that opens at any time

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Then for example

10:11.500 --> 10:12.500
Then for example

10:12.500 --> 10:13.500
I can

10:13.500 --> 10:14.500
A kind of audio file

10:14.500 --> 10:15.500
I put it

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
Every note

10:16.500 --> 10:17.500
Bop, bop, bop

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
All time

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
Every bop, bop, bop

10:20.500 --> 10:21.500
Between each tone

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
Its time is fixed

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
The same length

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
For example, it's 500 milliseconds

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
So this way you

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
It sounds like a decoder

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
Then you can keep going

10:33.500 --> 10:34.500
So this

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
This is a very regular time

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
Then you can have a

10:37.500 --> 10:39.500
An irregular time

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
For example, it's

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
Between your pain and pain

10:41.500 --> 10:42.500
Can be

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
For example

10:43.500 --> 10:44.500
Random 250 milliseconds

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
Between 750 milliseconds

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
So it might sound like this

10:46.500 --> 10:49.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

10:49.500 --> 10:50.500
Just

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
You don't know at all

10:51.500 --> 10:52.500
You

10:52.500 --> 10:54.500
When will the next pain appear

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500
And then

10:55.500 --> 10:57.500
In this different

10:57.500 --> 10:58.500
Under the circumstances

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
We can

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
Require the audience to do some

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
Intuitive answer

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
For example, we can make

11:05.500 --> 11:07.500
Some of them have sounds

11:07.500 --> 11:08.500
Most of these sounds

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
Most of them are exactly the same

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
There are some sounds

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
Maybe we'll just make it

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
It's a little bit higher or a little bit lower

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
We're on the frequency domain

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
To make some adjustments

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
And then the audience

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
Just

11:19.500 --> 11:20.500
To participate in the experiment

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
The college student has to listen to that sound

11:22.500 --> 11:23.500
If he hears a higher pitch

11:23.500 --> 11:24.500
He'll press a button

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
If you hear a lower pitch

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
Just press a button

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
It sounds like

11:27.500 --> 11:29.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

11:29.500 --> 11:31.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
You have to listen to the higher pitch

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
You have to react

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
And then the other

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Under the circumstances of irregular time

11:36.500 --> 11:38.500
You can also do this kind of manipulation

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
And then we can go and see

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
For example

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
Under the circumstances of regular time

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
The correct rate of his answer

11:43.500 --> 11:44.500
It's going to be higher

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
Under the circumstances of irregular time

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
Then we can

11:47.500 --> 11:48.500
Psychologists usually say

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
Oh, that's the regular time

11:50.500 --> 11:52.500
It can help you

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
Have a better sense

11:53.500 --> 11:55.500
Because you're better

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
Because your accuracy is higher

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
You can have a more accurate answer

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
In this case

12:02.500 --> 12:03.500
We can also do some

12:03.500 --> 12:05.500
Neuroscientific measurements

12:05.500 --> 12:08.500
For example, I can measure people's brainwaves

12:08.500 --> 12:10.500
This is a memory map

12:10.500 --> 12:12.500
It's because of the nervous response of the brain

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
The nervous response of the brain

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
It's all about the nerve

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
It's all about the neurotransmitter

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
To do the reaction

12:17.500 --> 12:18.500
Then we can put those

12:18.500 --> 12:20.500
For example, the ECG map

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
Or the sensors for measuring muscle position

12:22.500 --> 12:23.500
We'll put it on the scalp

12:24.500 --> 12:25.500
That's because of the nerve response

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
It's going to be that wave signal

12:27.500 --> 12:28.500
It's going to come out

12:28.500 --> 12:30.500
So we can put it on the surface of the scalp

12:30.500 --> 12:31.500
Record this signal

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
That's what we call it

12:32.500 --> 12:35.500
The signal of the brainwaves

12:35.500 --> 12:37.500
Then we can do some corresponding analysis

12:37.500 --> 12:39.500
We can see that the brainwaves are

12:39.500 --> 12:42.500
How to capture the regularity of this time

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
And then for example

12:43.500 --> 12:45.500
Let's do some complicated processing

12:45.500 --> 12:46.500
And then we'll get

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
Something like this

12:47.500 --> 12:48.500
The answer is

12:48.500 --> 12:50.500
We'll find out, for example

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
The brainwave

12:51.500 --> 12:54.500
It's going to adjust the speed of its vibration

12:54.500 --> 12:56.500
It's the same as the external stimulus

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
And then we just have to catch this

12:58.500 --> 12:59.500
In the brain

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
Imagine the nerve in the brain

13:00.500 --> 13:01.500
It's like a decoder

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
It's going to be able to accurately capture

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
How to produce the next second

13:05.500 --> 13:07.500
That's the traditional neuroscience

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
Or psychologically

13:08.500 --> 13:10.500
We're going to do this

13:10.500 --> 13:12.500
A study of orientation

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
But this study is actually quite

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
OK, please go ahead

13:16.500 --> 13:18.500
That's your time

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
That's the frequency

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
That cycle

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
How short can it be

13:24.500 --> 13:26.500
You mean the cycle of my voice

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
Or the cycle of the brainwaves

13:28.500 --> 13:30.500
The cycle of the voice

13:30.500 --> 13:32.500
And then there's the brainwaves

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
You're going to adjust it

13:33.500 --> 13:35.500
If it's the same as your external

13:35.500 --> 13:37.500
Does it have a limit

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
This is a good question

13:40.500 --> 13:42.500
Usually humans can catch the beat

13:42.500 --> 13:46.500
The shortest is the shortest between pain and pain

13:46.500 --> 13:47.500
It's 200 milliseconds

13:48.500 --> 13:50.500
I can't sing so fast

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
It's about the same speed

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
More than 200 milliseconds

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
You probably think

13:55.500 --> 13:57.500
It's almost a continuous sound

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
That's the slowest

13:58.500 --> 14:00.500
It's the longest between pain and pain

14:00.500 --> 14:04.500
It can be as long as 1,200 milliseconds

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
1.2 seconds

14:05.500 --> 14:07.500
After that

14:07.500 --> 14:09.500
You'll feel like every sound is independent

14:09.500 --> 14:12.500
You don't think it's a continuous rhythm

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
You just can't

14:13.500 --> 14:15.500
Know the pattern

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
What's interesting is that the brainwaves

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
Can only catch up

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
Such a speed range

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
It's slower than this

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
Or faster than this

14:24.500 --> 14:26.500
There's no way

14:26.500 --> 14:28.500
As for what causes what

14:28.500 --> 14:29.500
I don't know

14:29.500 --> 14:31.500
It's because the brain can't move so fast

14:31.500 --> 14:32.500
Move so slow

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
To make us instinctively

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
Can't catch up so fast

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Such a slow speed

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
I don't know

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
I can only say

14:37.500 --> 14:40.500
This is what we have now

14:41.500 --> 14:42.500
Thank you

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
Hello

14:44.500 --> 14:46.500
So I'd like to ask

14:46.500 --> 14:48.500
When you do this experiment

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
Do you have to eliminate

14:49.500 --> 14:52.500
Other noise interference?

14:52.500 --> 14:53.500
That's right

14:53.500 --> 14:55.500
We do this kind of experiment

14:55.500 --> 14:56.500
Because we want to be clean

14:56.500 --> 14:58.500
So we do it in the soundproof room

14:58.500 --> 15:00.500
And then we'll use headphones

15:00.500 --> 15:02.500
That is, we'll use those

15:02.500 --> 15:03.500
More special headphones

15:03.500 --> 15:05.500
Just send the sound

15:05.500 --> 15:06.500
Into the ear

15:06.500 --> 15:08.500
And it's very close

15:08.500 --> 15:09.500
The more inside, the better

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
And then the sound is transmitted

15:11.500 --> 15:12.500
It's all very clean

15:12.500 --> 15:13.500
I just want to reduce

15:13.500 --> 15:15.500
External interference

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
That's right

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
So when you say

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
The so-called hearing

15:18.500 --> 15:20.500
It means

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
Human beings

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
We can really

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
The sound we hear

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
Or include that

15:25.500 --> 15:26.500
Include that

15:26.500 --> 15:27.500
The frequency we can't hear

15:27.500 --> 15:29.500
It's also in the hearing

15:29.500 --> 15:31.500
For example, ultrasonic waves or

15:31.500 --> 15:33.500
Very low frequency

15:33.500 --> 15:34.500
That kind

15:34.500 --> 15:36.500
That kind of hearing

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
That kind

15:37.500 --> 15:38.500
That's what you're asking

15:38.500 --> 15:39.500
That is to say

15:39.500 --> 15:40.500
Physical stimulation

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
Does it stimulate psychological feelings?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.500
That's what we say

15:44.500 --> 15:46.500
Will ask questions like this

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
Of course

15:47.500 --> 15:48.500
Of course there are people

15:48.500 --> 15:49.500
Study such a question

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
That is to say

15:50.500 --> 15:51.500
Where is the limit of human hearing?

15:51.500 --> 15:52.500
Then you can see

15:52.500 --> 15:54.500
Where is the limit of frequency?

15:54.500 --> 15:55.500
But this is not me

15:55.500 --> 15:56.500
Today

15:56.500 --> 15:59.500
Is the main part of the discussion

15:59.500 --> 16:01.500
Maybe we'll wait

16:01.500 --> 16:04.500
Discuss again later

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
Like this

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
I don't know if it's like this

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
Or just

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
You can discuss it casually

16:08.500 --> 16:09.500
No no no

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
Because of me

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
I'm more curious

16:11.500 --> 16:12.500
When you say you want to eradicate

16:12.500 --> 16:13.500
That interference

16:13.500 --> 16:15.500
When noise interference

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500
That's how you eradicate that kind

16:17.500 --> 16:18.500
We don't know at all

16:18.500 --> 16:20.500
The kind of interference we hear

16:20.500 --> 16:22.500
For example, like ultrasonic waves

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
You are in that

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
What is that called

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
There is no noise at all

16:26.500 --> 16:27.500
That kind of interference

16:27.500 --> 16:28.500
In that kind of experimental environment

16:28.500 --> 16:30.500
You can't guarantee

16:30.500 --> 16:33.500
He won't be affected by the outside world

16:33.500 --> 16:34.500
OK OK OK

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
Then I know

16:36.500 --> 16:38.500
Of course we

16:38.500 --> 16:40.500
What we do is

16:40.500 --> 16:41.500
We already know

16:41.500 --> 16:43.500
Human hearing frequency range

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
It's about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
In the frequency range of this Hz

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
We

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
In fact, in the experimental environment

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Can still measure

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
In the case of measurement

16:53.500 --> 16:55.500
We will make a comparison

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
As for ultrasonic waves

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
We generally think it's human

16:59.500 --> 17:01.500
Physically, you can't hear it

17:01.500 --> 17:03.500
So

17:03.500 --> 17:05.500
So we don't care about his control

17:05.500 --> 17:07.500
So for example

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
There is an ultrasonic wave in the lab

17:08.500 --> 17:11.500
The sound of the ultrasonic wave

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
Or that kind of very, very, very high frequency

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
We don't care

17:15.500 --> 17:17.500
So it's based on an assumption

17:17.500 --> 17:19.500
Those things won't cause

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
It won't cause too much interference to humans

17:21.500 --> 17:23.500
Yes, it really won't

17:23.500 --> 17:24.500
And the other thing is

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
In the case of our experiments

17:26.500 --> 17:27.500
We don't say

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
One condition is to make a trial

17:29.500 --> 17:31.500
Of course we will do hundreds of trials

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
Thousands of trials

17:32.500 --> 17:33.500
Even if there is an effect

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
As long as it is with your experiment

17:35.500 --> 17:37.500
The program set by the computer

17:37.500 --> 17:39.500
If it's not related to each other

17:39.500 --> 17:41.500
Then the effect we observe

17:41.500 --> 17:44.500
These external effects

17:44.500 --> 17:46.500
It should be reduced a lot

17:46.500 --> 17:48.500
OK, thank you

17:48.500 --> 17:50.500
Then

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
Hey, copy it

17:51.500 --> 17:52.500
That is to say

17:52.500 --> 17:54.500
What about this POP process

17:54.500 --> 17:56.500
Of course you can decide for yourself

17:56.500 --> 17:58.500
See if you want to say

17:58.500 --> 18:00.500
To accept the middle question

18:00.500 --> 18:01.500
Or ask at the end

18:01.500 --> 18:02.500
Or open the discussion directly

18:02.500 --> 18:03.500
You can decide

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
Then but

18:04.500 --> 18:05.500
That is

18:05.500 --> 18:06.500
We

18:06.500 --> 18:08.500
The prediction is that you can

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
You can talk for about an hour

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
And then

18:11.500 --> 18:14.500
There will probably be a 20-minute discussion

18:14.500 --> 18:15.500
Ah

18:15.500 --> 18:16.500
That's it

18:16.500 --> 18:17.500
As for you

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
Cut it in half

18:18.500 --> 18:19.500
Or mixed together

18:19.500 --> 18:20.500
How do you decide

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
Just decide for yourself

18:21.500 --> 18:22.500
OK OK OK

18:22.500 --> 18:23.500
OK

18:23.500 --> 18:24.500
Let me tell you first

18:24.500 --> 18:26.500
I actually didn't prepare a lot of POP

18:26.500 --> 18:28.500
I only prepared about 18 pages

18:28.500 --> 18:29.500
So

18:29.500 --> 18:32.500
So the topic part will be finished in a moment

18:32.500 --> 18:35.500
If there are some related topics

18:35.500 --> 18:38.500
Sorry, I just didn't know what your question was

18:38.500 --> 18:41.500
If it's related to listening or other music

18:41.500 --> 18:43.500
We can wait until then to discuss

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
That if it has to do with the topic I'm talking about

18:45.500 --> 18:47.500
Of course we will raise it and discuss it live

18:47.500 --> 18:50.500
Sorry, I just didn't know what your question was

18:50.500 --> 18:51.500
With this

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
Where is the thing I'm talking about now

18:55.500 --> 18:56.500
OK

18:56.500 --> 18:57.500
Well

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
But

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
OK, I will continue

19:01.500 --> 19:04.500
I think the biggest problem in doing research in the lab

19:04.500 --> 19:05.500
Is that

19:05.500 --> 19:06.500
If what we want to know is

19:06.500 --> 19:08.500
How people interact with each other normally

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
For example, interacting with each other by listening

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
But in fact, the two kinds of information

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
Time-regulated and time-unregulated

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
This kind of experiment

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
The information I made in my computer

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
It doesn't exist in the natural world

19:18.500 --> 19:19.500
In the natural world

19:19.500 --> 19:20.500
You won't hear a

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
Such accurate information like a decoder

19:22.500 --> 19:23.500
You won't hear a

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
A completely random message

19:25.500 --> 19:26.500
You usually hear

19:26.500 --> 19:27.500
A little regular

19:27.500 --> 19:29.500
But it's not that regular

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
So if I do research like this

19:31.500 --> 19:33.500
What does it do to understand my human

19:33.500 --> 19:35.500
What is the real ability to help

19:35.500 --> 19:38.500
In fact, sometimes it is a bit biased

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
So

19:40.500 --> 19:42.500
In fact, there is a very interesting paper

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
It was just published recently

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
It's called Neuroscience Needs Behavior

19:45.500 --> 19:47.500
If you are interested in

19:47.500 --> 19:49.500
Related philosophy, scientific philosophy

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
If you are interested

19:50.500 --> 19:52.500
I highly recommend this paper

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
Then I will use the few pictures in it

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
To talk about

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
This research

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
The limitations of laboratory research

19:57.500 --> 19:59.500
Generally, we want to know

19:59.500 --> 20:00.500
It can be said

20:00.500 --> 20:03.500
For example, the neural pattern of the human brain

20:03.500 --> 20:06.500
What is the relationship between natural behavior

20:06.500 --> 20:08.500
Then you can take the neural pattern

20:08.500 --> 20:09.500
As a

20:09.500 --> 20:11.500
For example, the psychological process

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
The psychological inner process can also be

20:13.500 --> 20:15.500
This is what we want to know

20:15.500 --> 20:17.500
Then a better designed ideal experiment

20:17.500 --> 20:18.500
That is to say

20:18.500 --> 20:19.500
We can control

20:19.500 --> 20:22.500
We know which part of the psychological process

20:22.500 --> 20:23.500
Or neural response

20:23.500 --> 20:26.500
Corresponding to some of our natural behaviors

20:26.500 --> 20:27.500
We can have one-to-one

20:27.500 --> 20:29.500
Is the correspondence of one-to-one

20:29.500 --> 20:31.500
Or a simpler correspondence

20:31.500 --> 20:33.500
But like the experiment we just did

20:33.500 --> 20:34.500
In fact, the experiment just now

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
Is the experiment I did

20:36.500 --> 20:37.500
I did it myself

20:37.500 --> 20:38.500
Um, we

20:38.500 --> 20:40.500
I actually designed an experiment

20:40.500 --> 20:41.500
The situation is

20:41.500 --> 20:43.500
Humans are generally

20:43.500 --> 20:45.500
It's not going to happen

20:45.500 --> 20:48.500
Then we are studying his neural response

20:48.500 --> 20:49.500
Although we can know

20:49.500 --> 20:50.500
The relationship between these

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
But we can't answer directly

20:53.500 --> 20:55.500
What is human nature

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
We can't answer

20:56.500 --> 20:59.500
Human natural reaction

20:59.500 --> 21:00.500
So what we know is

21:00.500 --> 21:01.500
Some humans

21:01.500 --> 21:02.500
Supernormal ability

21:02.500 --> 21:04.500
It's beyond his usual ability

21:04.500 --> 21:05.500
but

21:05.500 --> 21:07.500
Our main research topics

21:07.500 --> 21:08.500
In fact, there is no direct understanding

21:08.500 --> 21:09.500
This is what I think

21:09.500 --> 21:10.500
Laboratory research

21:10.500 --> 21:11.500
Some big limitations

21:11.500 --> 21:14.500
Especially in other areas

21:14.500 --> 21:15.500
There is such a situation

21:15.500 --> 21:16.500
For example

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
If you want to manipulate social interaction

21:18.500 --> 21:19.500
You are in a very small laboratory

21:19.500 --> 21:20.500
Basically can't do this

21:20.500 --> 21:21.500
Because our lab

21:21.500 --> 21:23.500
Basically looks like this

21:23.500 --> 21:24.500
Just a person

21:24.500 --> 21:26.500
Sitting in a small space

21:26.500 --> 21:27.500
Because we have to

21:27.500 --> 21:28.500
Like I just said

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
Must control all external stimuli

21:30.500 --> 21:31.500
So

21:31.500 --> 21:32.500
I often sit alone inside

21:32.500 --> 21:33.500
In a very quiet situation

21:33.500 --> 21:35.500
Interact with the computer

21:35.500 --> 21:37.500
Then at the same time because

21:37.500 --> 21:40.500
Uh, our measuring tool

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
For example, uh, uh, uh

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
That side brain wave

21:44.500 --> 21:45.500
The length of the line

21:45.500 --> 21:46.500
He can only sit there

21:46.500 --> 21:47.500
He can't do anything

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
He can only use two fingers to react

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
So actually this is also

21:50.500 --> 21:52.500
Very unnatural

21:52.500 --> 21:53.500
Then this is some

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
Traditional laboratory environment

21:55.500 --> 21:57.500
Some restrictions given

21:57.500 --> 21:58.500
OK

21:58.500 --> 21:59.500
Come here

21:59.500 --> 22:01.500
Everyone agrees that there are actually quite a lot of restrictions

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
Then I

22:05.500 --> 22:06.500
What I want to say is

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
Then we

22:07.500 --> 22:09.500
In our laboratory

22:09.500 --> 22:11.500
How do we try to go

22:11.500 --> 22:13.500
Uh, extend to solve

22:13.500 --> 22:15.500
Such a barrier

22:16.500 --> 22:17.500
Uh, what I want to say first is

22:17.500 --> 22:20.500
Music can be a good research tool

22:20.500 --> 22:22.500
It can be a research tool

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
As a

22:23.500 --> 22:26.500
Uh, to help study human mind activities

22:26.500 --> 22:27.500
And neural reactions

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
He

22:28.500 --> 22:31.500
Uh, there are some very good ways

22:31.500 --> 22:33.500
For example, I can keep

22:33.500 --> 22:35.500
There is a good experimental situation

22:35.500 --> 22:37.500
For example, today I

22:37.500 --> 22:39.500
For example, look at this A picture on the far left

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
I can ask the subject

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
Ask someone to come in

22:42.500 --> 22:43.500
Then I'll give him a beater

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
I asked him

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
Press the key of the piano

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
Then the speed of pressing is exactly the same as the beater

22:49.500 --> 22:50.500
Then this is a

22:50.500 --> 22:52.500
A good control experiment

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
Then I can put this

22:53.500 --> 22:55.500
The conditions I control are getting more and more relaxed

22:55.500 --> 22:56.500
For example

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
I can ask

22:57.500 --> 22:58.500
The computer generates a beater

22:58.500 --> 23:00.500
But this beater is

23:00.500 --> 23:02.500
At the speed of your pressing keys

23:02.500 --> 23:03.500
Then he will go

23:03.500 --> 23:04.500
Follow your speed

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
To change his own rhythm

23:06.500 --> 23:07.500
Or you can say

23:07.500 --> 23:09.500
Let two people play together

23:09.500 --> 23:10.500
Multiple people play

23:10.500 --> 23:12.500
Even in the case of multiple people playing

23:12.500 --> 23:14.500
You and the audience are listening at the same time

23:14.500 --> 23:15.500
That

23:15.500 --> 23:17.500
Moving more and more to the right of the score

23:17.500 --> 23:20.500
That's what we call ecological interaction

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
Interaction

23:21.500 --> 23:22.500
Ecological validity

23:22.500 --> 23:24.500
That is to say, what you are studying

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
Is

23:25.500 --> 23:26.500
Can correspond to human

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
In the case of real life

23:28.500 --> 23:29.500
The more right-handed

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
That's what we think

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
More like real life

23:32.500 --> 23:33.500
Because when you play music

23:33.500 --> 23:34.500
You will also have an audience listening

23:34.500 --> 23:35.500
This can be understood

23:35.500 --> 23:37.500
But on the right side of the score

23:37.500 --> 23:38.500
In fact, your experimental control

23:38.500 --> 23:39.500
It's getting worse and worse

23:39.500 --> 23:40.500
So for example

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
When a group of people play music

23:41.500 --> 23:42.500
If they decide together

23:42.500 --> 23:44.500
To speed up or slow down

23:44.500 --> 23:45.500
What do you want

23:45.500 --> 23:46.500
This is not your experiment

23:46.500 --> 23:48.500
Things that can be decided in advance

23:48.500 --> 23:50.500
The information you get in the end

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
It will be difficult for you to explain

23:52.500 --> 23:55.500
That music can be a good tool

23:55.500 --> 23:56.500
Just because he can

23:56.500 --> 23:59.500
Get some kind of balance in the middle

23:59.500 --> 24:01.500
For example, when the two of them interact

24:01.500 --> 24:03.500
They may not be random

24:03.500 --> 24:05.500
Play the music they want

24:05.500 --> 24:07.500
I can give him a score

24:07.500 --> 24:09.500
Ask them to play according to the score

24:09.500 --> 24:10.500
And if they have

24:10.500 --> 24:12.500
If they play the wrong note

24:12.500 --> 24:13.500
In fact, we can

24:13.500 --> 24:14.500
From the recording afterwards

24:14.500 --> 24:16.500
To find out about this

24:16.500 --> 24:17.500
So we can know

24:17.500 --> 24:18.500
What did he do wrong

24:18.500 --> 24:19.500
I can also know

24:19.500 --> 24:20.500
What is the correct answer

24:20.500 --> 24:21.500
And we can set

24:21.500 --> 24:22.500
That is to say

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
What is the rhythm he wants to play

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
So we still have some control

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
But even under these conditions

24:27.500 --> 24:29.500
Their activities

24:29.500 --> 24:30.500
Still very

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
An activity that is very close to human behavior

24:32.500 --> 24:33.500
So we think music

24:33.500 --> 24:35.500
Can be a good tool

24:35.500 --> 24:37.500
To study human interaction

24:38.500 --> 24:40.500
But there is also auditory communication

24:40.500 --> 24:42.500
And it can balance

24:42.500 --> 24:44.500
Experimental control and ecological efficiency

24:44.500 --> 24:47.500
These two big problems

24:47.500 --> 24:50.500
And another advantage of music is

24:50.500 --> 24:53.500
You said music is a good research tool

24:53.500 --> 24:54.500
The reason is

24:54.500 --> 24:56.500
It sounds like it's because he can be

24:56.500 --> 24:58.500
That is, he can have this

24:58.500 --> 25:00.500
From experimental control

25:00.500 --> 25:02.500
To ecological interaction

25:02.500 --> 25:03.500
The whole spectrum

25:03.500 --> 25:04.500
But then you think

25:04.500 --> 25:05.500
What research tool

25:06.500 --> 25:07.500
Um

25:08.500 --> 25:09.500
How to research

25:09.500 --> 25:11.500
Is there no such thing as language?

25:11.500 --> 25:13.500
Language, can you

25:13.500 --> 25:16.500
Yeah, so I think I don't really understand

25:16.500 --> 25:17.500
That's why he's a special

25:17.500 --> 25:18.500
Good research tool

25:18.500 --> 25:19.500
I didn't say he was particularly good

25:19.500 --> 25:21.500
I said he could be a good research tool

25:21.500 --> 25:22.500
OK, good

25:22.500 --> 25:24.500
So I understood this time

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
What you mean is

25:25.500 --> 25:27.500
He can span the whole spectrum

25:27.500 --> 25:29.500
He can span the whole spectrum

25:29.500 --> 25:31.500
Language is of course

25:31.500 --> 25:33.500
You can communicate with the computer

25:33.500 --> 25:34.500
Language communication

25:34.500 --> 25:35.500
Or the language between people

25:35.500 --> 25:36.500
Communicate with others

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
Yes, language is also a good research tool

25:39.500 --> 25:40.500
My language is on

25:40.500 --> 25:41.500
There is a difficulty in neuroscience

25:41.500 --> 25:42.500
Because when you want to talk

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
Mouth to move

25:44.500 --> 25:45.500
And then actually

25:45.500 --> 25:48.500
It's a bit difficult to measure signals

25:48.500 --> 25:49.500
Of course, this is an externalization

25:49.500 --> 25:51.500
But I think language is also a

25:51.500 --> 25:53.500
It's still a good tool

25:53.500 --> 25:54.500
I understand

25:54.500 --> 25:55.500
I understand

25:55.500 --> 25:56.500
I didn't say music is the best

25:56.500 --> 25:57.500
He is one of them

25:57.500 --> 25:58.500
And then

25:58.500 --> 26:00.500
And another advantage of music is

26:00.500 --> 26:02.500
He is a special one

26:02.500 --> 26:03.500
A special activity

26:03.500 --> 26:05.500
But in fact, in each culture

26:05.500 --> 26:07.500
There are music activities

26:07.500 --> 26:08.500
And humans actually spend

26:08.500 --> 26:10.500
Spend a lot of resources

26:10.500 --> 26:11.500
In music activities

26:11.500 --> 26:12.500
A lot of time and resources

26:12.500 --> 26:13.500
In music activities

26:13.500 --> 26:15.500
So we think

26:15.500 --> 26:16.500
Research on music activities

26:16.500 --> 26:18.500
In fact, it can also be

26:18.500 --> 26:19.500
He is a reflection of a human being

26:19.500 --> 26:21.500
A very basic behavior

26:21.500 --> 26:22.500
With a capability

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
OK

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
So

26:27.500 --> 26:29.500
So you say music is a good research tool

26:29.500 --> 26:31.500
It means

26:31.500 --> 26:33.500
For example, you want to measure his brain

26:33.500 --> 26:34.500
How does the brain work

26:34.500 --> 26:36.500
You just play music for them

26:36.500 --> 26:37.500
Is it similar to this

26:37.500 --> 26:39.500
Is this a research method

26:39.500 --> 26:40.500
Play music for them

26:40.500 --> 26:41.500
Or let them

26:41.500 --> 26:43.500
Let them play music

26:43.500 --> 26:44.500
So that means

26:44.500 --> 26:45.500
You can have a

26:45.500 --> 26:46.500
A spectrum

26:46.500 --> 26:48.500
You can go from the far left

26:48.500 --> 26:49.500
Play music for them

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
I have already designed this music in advance

26:51.500 --> 26:53.500
All the way to the far right

26:53.500 --> 26:54.500
For example, you can

26:54.500 --> 26:55.500
Interact with the music

26:55.500 --> 26:57.500
For example, singing karaoke

26:57.500 --> 26:58.500
Or if there is no music

26:58.500 --> 27:00.500
Two people play music with each other

27:01.500 --> 27:02.500
OK

27:03.500 --> 27:04.500
Everyone has a question

27:04.500 --> 27:05.500
OK

27:05.500 --> 27:06.500
I have a simple question

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
It's like this

27:08.500 --> 27:09.500
Because it's said here

27:09.500 --> 27:10.500
We may start from here

27:10.500 --> 27:11.500
More and more

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
More and more

27:12.500 --> 27:13.500
About music as a

27:13.500 --> 27:14.500
Research tool

27:14.500 --> 27:15.500
So I want to clarify

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
A simple question

27:17.500 --> 27:18.500
What we are discussing now is

27:18.500 --> 27:20.500
Sound is a good research tool

27:20.500 --> 27:22.500
Or music is a

27:22.500 --> 27:23.500
A specific

27:23.500 --> 27:25.500
There is a clear subset

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
In the sound

27:27.500 --> 27:28.500
Or are we discussing

27:28.500 --> 27:30.500
Sound as a research tool

27:33.500 --> 27:35.500
I would say it's music

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
Because

27:38.500 --> 27:40.500
If I talk about sound

27:40.500 --> 27:41.500
It's just a definition

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
Because

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
Because sound

27:50.500 --> 27:52.500
Can you repeat your question?

27:53.500 --> 27:55.500
Yes, so my question is actually

27:56.500 --> 27:57.500
You are talking about music

27:57.500 --> 27:59.500
A good research tool

27:59.500 --> 28:00.500
What kind of sound

28:00.500 --> 28:01.500
Don't you think it's

28:01.500 --> 28:02.500
You want to use it as

28:02.500 --> 28:04.500
The definition of music

28:04.500 --> 28:05.500
Research tool

28:05.500 --> 28:06.500
I understand

28:07.500 --> 28:08.500
Yes

28:09.500 --> 28:11.500
I forgot to say before

28:11.500 --> 28:12.500
In fact, in traditional research

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
In terms of listening

28:14.500 --> 28:16.500
We will use computer synthesis

28:16.500 --> 28:18.500
That's a very

28:18.500 --> 28:19.500
It's like you pick up the phone

28:19.500 --> 28:21.500
To hear that kind of sound

28:21.500 --> 28:22.500
Or more than that

28:22.500 --> 28:24.500
A lot of noise

28:24.500 --> 28:25.500
These things

28:25.500 --> 28:26.500
We all know

28:26.500 --> 28:28.500
Basic listening

28:28.500 --> 28:30.500
Materials used

28:30.500 --> 28:31.500
But in general

28:31.500 --> 28:32.500
We don't use

28:32.500 --> 28:33.500
That kind of material

28:33.500 --> 28:34.500
And then we

28:34.500 --> 28:35.500
And

28:35.500 --> 28:36.500
In addition

28:36.500 --> 28:38.500
When we study listening

28:38.500 --> 28:39.500
Often we will present

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
A completely unchanging sound

28:41.500 --> 28:42.500
A complete array

28:42.500 --> 28:44.500
For example, show it for one second

28:44.500 --> 28:45.500
But in the natural world

28:45.500 --> 28:46.500
All the sounds

28:46.500 --> 28:47.500
It's probably the first time

28:47.500 --> 28:48.500
It's gone

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
It won't have the same stimulus

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
Repeat repeat

28:52.500 --> 28:53.500
And music

28:53.500 --> 28:55.500
It has another component

28:55.500 --> 28:56.500
That is, it has

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
More social interaction

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
It's not just about making sounds

29:00.500 --> 29:02.500
It's not just about making

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
I'm going to knock on the table today

29:04.500 --> 29:05.500
Make a sound

29:05.500 --> 29:06.500
Instead, people will

29:06.500 --> 29:07.500
According to your voice

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
And then he has a response

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
And then he makes a new action

29:16.500 --> 29:18.500
Does that answer the question?

29:18.500 --> 29:19.500
Yes yes

29:20.500 --> 29:21.500
Yes yes

29:21.500 --> 29:22.500
Thank you

29:22.500 --> 29:23.500
OK OK

29:23.500 --> 29:24.500
OK

29:26.500 --> 29:28.500
Everyone's questions are very good

29:28.500 --> 29:29.500
That

29:29.500 --> 29:30.500
In our study

29:30.500 --> 29:31.500
The example is

29:31.500 --> 29:32.500
We want to understand

29:32.500 --> 29:34.500
Play with music

29:34.500 --> 29:36.500
As an example of a model

29:36.500 --> 29:38.500
Is a model of social interaction

29:38.500 --> 29:40.500
How do we measure cooperation

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
And then we have to understand

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
Is the relationship between the leader and the follower

29:43.500 --> 29:44.500
And then we have to

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
What direction to go

29:46.500 --> 29:48.500
To do this research

29:48.500 --> 29:49.500
Ah this photo

29:49.500 --> 29:50.500
Is a photo of our lab

29:50.500 --> 29:51.500
Then I just found

29:51.500 --> 29:53.500
We have a short film before the lab

29:53.500 --> 29:54.500
OK

29:54.500 --> 29:55.500
Show it to everyone

29:55.500 --> 29:57.500
I hope everyone can hear the sound

29:57.500 --> 30:00.500
Uh, there's a two and a half minute introduction

30:18.500 --> 30:19.500
String quartet

30:19.500 --> 30:22.500
Is just as exciting and challenging

30:22.500 --> 30:24.500
Canadian cellist Adrian Fung

30:24.500 --> 30:26.500
And his colleagues are fitted with

30:26.500 --> 30:29.500
Specially designed caps and sensors

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
You put them in front of your shirt

30:31.500 --> 30:32.500
And wired to monitors

30:32.500 --> 30:35.500
That measure their brain activity and heart rate

30:35.500 --> 30:36.500
Motion capture cameras

30:36.500 --> 30:38.500
Record their movements too

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
Researchers are studying

30:40.500 --> 30:42.500
How the musicians communicate with each other

30:42.500 --> 30:44.500
During a performance

30:44.500 --> 30:46.500
Without using a single word

30:46.500 --> 30:47.500
How do they use movements

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
What gestures do the musicians make

30:49.500 --> 30:51.500
That make it possible for them

30:51.500 --> 30:53.500
To communicate with each other

30:55.500 --> 30:58.500
And to communicate with members of the audience

30:58.500 --> 31:00.500
They're all wired up too

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
To study how they respond

31:02.500 --> 31:04.500
Physically and emotionally

31:04.500 --> 31:06.500
To the performers on stage

31:06.500 --> 31:07.500
What's great about this

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
Is it affords us the ability

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
To see how effective we are as communicators

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
The theatre is state-of-the-art technology

31:14.500 --> 31:16.500
Including a sound system

31:16.500 --> 31:18.500
With incredible acoustics

31:18.500 --> 31:20.500
Here with just a tap on a tablet

31:20.500 --> 31:23.500
I'll make it extremely reverberant in here

31:23.500 --> 31:25.500
Sort of like a cathedral

31:29.500 --> 31:31.500
The room is transformed

31:31.500 --> 31:33.500
A cool feature that serves

31:33.500 --> 31:35.500
A wider, more scientific purpose

31:35.500 --> 31:37.500
One that could help researchers

31:37.500 --> 31:39.500
Design a better hearing aid

31:39.500 --> 31:40.500
For the hearing impaired

31:40.500 --> 31:42.500
So, ratting

31:42.500 --> 31:43.500
Ratting

31:43.500 --> 31:45.500
Background noise is coming out of all the speakers

31:45.500 --> 31:47.500
It's a multi-channel surround mix

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
And then we can test how well

31:49.500 --> 31:51.500
Does a person with a hearing aid

31:51.500 --> 31:53.500
Comprehend speech

31:53.500 --> 31:54.500
That's presented to them

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
In an environment like this

31:56.500 --> 31:58.500
Instead of in the quiet room

32:00.500 --> 32:01.500
But for now

32:01.500 --> 32:03.500
Most of the research is focused on music

32:03.500 --> 32:05.500
And its therapeutic powers

32:05.500 --> 32:07.500
Researchers hope their findings

32:07.500 --> 32:09.500
Will uncover how some rhythms

32:10.500 --> 32:12.500
Might help an autistic child

32:12.500 --> 32:14.500
Or why a musical beat

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
Can improve the gait of a patient

32:16.500 --> 32:18.500
With Parkinson's disease

32:18.500 --> 32:20.500
In order to understand

32:20.500 --> 32:22.500
What's going on in the brain

32:22.500 --> 32:24.500
We need to know how it's done

32:24.500 --> 32:25.500
In typical populations

32:25.500 --> 32:27.500
Once we understand that

32:27.500 --> 32:29.500
And we know that music

32:29.500 --> 32:31.500
Can help people with Parkinson's

32:31.500 --> 32:33.500
Or we know that music has an effect

32:33.500 --> 32:35.500
On children with autism

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
We can start to understand

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
The deep reasons for that

32:39.500 --> 32:41.500
We can perfect the therapies

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
That we give these people

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
And add to mounting evidence

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
That music is good medicine

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
For the brain

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500
Cass Roossey, CBC News, Toronto

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
Can everyone hear the sound

32:57.500 --> 32:59.500
From the video?

33:01.500 --> 33:03.500
Yes, we can

33:04.500 --> 33:06.500
We are lucky

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
Our lab

33:08.500 --> 33:10.500
Has built a music room

33:10.500 --> 33:12.500
With the same size

33:12.500 --> 33:14.500
With a stage

33:14.500 --> 33:16.500
And a seat for the audience

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
And those can be adjusted

33:18.500 --> 33:20.500
So in general

33:20.500 --> 33:22.500
Just like just now

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
Sorry, I don't know who asked

33:24.500 --> 33:26.500
In general

33:26.500 --> 33:28.500
We can't control a lot of environmental factors

33:28.500 --> 33:30.500
But in this case

33:30.500 --> 33:32.500
We can let a large space

33:32.500 --> 33:34.500
To be controlled

33:34.500 --> 33:36.500
And in this space

33:36.500 --> 33:38.500
We can do some precise measurements

33:38.500 --> 33:40.500
And experiments

33:40.500 --> 33:42.500
So our lab

33:42.500 --> 33:44.500
Can solve the trade-off

33:44.500 --> 33:46.500
Between experimental control

33:46.500 --> 33:48.500
And eco-efficient

33:48.500 --> 33:50.500
A little bit

33:50.500 --> 33:52.500
So this research

33:52.500 --> 33:54.500
Is done in this situation

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
And you can see

33:56.500 --> 33:58.500
The situation of this bottle

33:58.500 --> 34:00.500
You can see

34:00.500 --> 34:02.500
There is a ball

34:02.500 --> 34:04.500
It is a motion capture marker

34:04.500 --> 34:06.500
We can use the camera

34:06.500 --> 34:08.500
To capture the red light

34:08.500 --> 34:10.500
And we can build

34:10.500 --> 34:12.500
The body movement

34:12.500 --> 34:14.500
And the time

34:14.500 --> 34:16.500
And the location

34:16.500 --> 34:18.500
So when we measure

34:18.500 --> 34:20.500
The image will look like this

34:22.500 --> 34:24.500
It is a 3D image

34:24.500 --> 34:26.500
It is the body movement

34:26.500 --> 34:28.500
It is the shoulder

34:28.500 --> 34:30.500
It is the right arm

34:30.500 --> 34:32.500
And the head

34:32.500 --> 34:34.500
So our research is

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
Can we use

34:36.500 --> 34:38.500
The easiest index

34:38.500 --> 34:40.500
Like the body movement

34:40.500 --> 34:42.500
To understand

34:42.500 --> 34:44.500
The human interaction

34:44.500 --> 34:46.500
And the leader

34:46.500 --> 34:48.500
And the follower

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
We want to start

34:50.500 --> 34:52.500
From the easiest

34:52.500 --> 34:54.500
And the simplest

34:54.500 --> 34:56.500
So there are some questions

34:56.500 --> 34:58.500
If we want to do anything

34:58.500 --> 35:00.500
We do something

35:00.500 --> 35:02.500
The body must have a lot of movements

35:02.500 --> 35:04.500
Like playing music

35:04.500 --> 35:06.500
We can start from the simple

35:06.500 --> 35:08.500
For example

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
If I play the piano

35:10.500 --> 35:12.500
I can study the simple movements

35:12.500 --> 35:14.500
Like the time

35:14.500 --> 35:16.500
The difference between the time

35:16.500 --> 35:18.500
And the person

35:18.500 --> 35:20.500
We can see

35:20.500 --> 35:22.500
The difference between the time

35:22.500 --> 35:24.500
And the person

35:24.500 --> 35:26.500
But there is a big problem

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
When we do this research

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
The time of each player

35:30.500 --> 35:32.500
The time of each player

35:32.500 --> 35:34.500
The time of each player

35:34.500 --> 35:36.500
Is affected by the music

35:36.500 --> 35:38.500
And the music

35:38.500 --> 35:40.500
And the music

35:40.500 --> 35:42.500
So even if we measure

35:42.500 --> 35:44.500
The result

35:44.500 --> 35:46.500
We can only see

35:46.500 --> 35:48.500
The music

35:48.500 --> 35:50.500
And the performance

35:50.500 --> 35:52.500
And the performance

35:52.500 --> 35:54.500
We can't measure the actual

35:54.500 --> 35:56.500
Interaction

35:56.500 --> 35:58.500
This is a limitation

35:58.500 --> 36:00.500
Another interesting signal

36:00.500 --> 36:02.500
We can measure

36:02.500 --> 36:04.500
The whole body movement

36:04.500 --> 36:06.500
For example

36:06.500 --> 36:08.500
The body movement

36:08.500 --> 36:10.500
Is not only in the music

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
But also in the daily conversation

36:12.500 --> 36:14.500
If you measure

36:14.500 --> 36:16.500
The body movement

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
The body movement

36:18.500 --> 36:20.500
The index

36:20.500 --> 36:22.500
Is the addition of the whole body movement

36:22.500 --> 36:24.500
For example

36:24.500 --> 36:26.500
If I raise my arm

36:26.500 --> 36:28.500
My body needs to lean back

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
To balance the center

36:30.500 --> 36:32.500
Otherwise you will fall

36:32.500 --> 36:34.500
Another interesting thing

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
The music itself

36:36.500 --> 36:38.500
Doesn't require you to move your body

36:38.500 --> 36:40.500
When you talk

36:40.500 --> 36:42.500
But people will naturally do this

36:42.500 --> 36:44.500
So it's not limited to the music

36:44.500 --> 36:46.500
It's not limited to

36:46.500 --> 36:48.500
What you do

36:48.500 --> 36:50.500
It's not limited to

36:50.500 --> 36:52.500
What you say

36:52.500 --> 36:54.500
It's something that happens naturally

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
So it may reflect

36:56.500 --> 36:58.500
A psychological process

36:58.500 --> 37:00.500
We think it can be a good index

37:00.500 --> 37:02.500
So

37:02.500 --> 37:04.500
The first problem is

37:04.500 --> 37:06.500
We decide to measure

37:06.500 --> 37:08.500
The whole signal

37:08.500 --> 37:10.500
Don't just measure the finger

37:10.500 --> 37:12.500
The other problem is

37:12.500 --> 37:14.500
We know what to measure

37:14.500 --> 37:16.500
How do we use

37:16.500 --> 37:18.500
Traditionally

37:18.500 --> 37:20.500
We get this time series signal

37:20.500 --> 37:22.500
We can see the relationship

37:22.500 --> 37:24.500
Between the two signals

37:24.500 --> 37:26.500
We call it cross correlation

37:26.500 --> 37:28.500
A big limitation of cross correlation

37:28.500 --> 37:30.500
Is that it can only tell you

37:30.500 --> 37:32.500
How similar the two signals are

37:32.500 --> 37:34.500
But if today

37:34.500 --> 37:36.500
In the case of interaction

37:36.500 --> 37:38.500
Usually there will be a leader

37:38.500 --> 37:40.500
For example, four people move chairs together

37:40.500 --> 37:42.500
There must be a person shouting slogans

37:42.500 --> 37:44.500
Now 321 everyone moves together

37:44.500 --> 37:46.500
So if we want to know

37:46.500 --> 37:48.500
Social interaction

37:48.500 --> 37:50.500
The direction of social interaction is also important

37:50.500 --> 37:52.500
But cross correlation analysis

37:52.500 --> 37:54.500
Can't tell you the result

37:54.500 --> 37:56.500
The other analysis is

37:56.500 --> 37:58.500
Granger causality

37:58.500 --> 38:00.500
Granger causality

38:00.500 --> 38:02.500
It was originally invented by economists

38:02.500 --> 38:04.500
A mathematical method

38:04.500 --> 38:06.500
It mainly reflects

38:06.500 --> 38:08.500
A time series signal

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
To what extent

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
To predict

38:12.500 --> 38:14.500
A time series signal

38:14.500 --> 38:16.500
If it can predict

38:16.500 --> 38:18.500
We can say

38:18.500 --> 38:20.500
The first time series

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
It can affect time series B

38:22.500 --> 38:24.500
But it doesn't matter

38:24.500 --> 38:26.500
There are many

38:26.500 --> 38:28.500
Methodological disputes

38:28.500 --> 38:30.500
But we have to say

38:30.500 --> 38:32.500
We can measure

38:32.500 --> 38:34.500
How much of the first series

38:34.500 --> 38:36.500
Can predict the second series

38:36.500 --> 38:38.500
We can

38:38.500 --> 38:40.500
Reflect the direction of message transmission

38:40.500 --> 38:42.500
So we think

38:42.500 --> 38:44.500
Granger causality is more than traditional

38:44.500 --> 38:46.500
Related measurement

38:46.500 --> 38:48.500
Is to provide more human

38:48.500 --> 38:50.500
Interaction

38:50.500 --> 38:52.500
So now we know what to measure

38:52.500 --> 38:54.500
Then we know

38:54.500 --> 38:56.500
How to analyze

38:56.500 --> 38:58.500
The third question is what they want to do

38:58.500 --> 39:00.500
We just play music

39:00.500 --> 39:02.500
If so

39:02.500 --> 39:04.500
We just observe

39:04.500 --> 39:06.500
Scientific research

39:06.500 --> 39:08.500
We need to separate

39:08.500 --> 39:10.500
What we are interested in

39:10.500 --> 39:12.500
And what we naturally observe

39:12.500 --> 39:14.500
We need to know

39:14.500 --> 39:16.500
Will it affect our observation

39:16.500 --> 39:18.500
This is to understand

39:18.500 --> 39:20.500
What we are interested in

39:20.500 --> 39:22.500
So on the stage

39:22.500 --> 39:24.500
They will do

39:24.500 --> 39:26.500
This is just a summary

39:26.500 --> 39:28.500
It will have front and back movements

39:28.500 --> 39:30.500
We have to measure this

39:30.500 --> 39:32.500
Then we want it to play

39:32.500 --> 39:34.500
Bach's Hymn

39:34.500 --> 39:36.500
And while playing

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
We did one thing

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
It's a little different from normal music

39:40.500 --> 39:42.500
We will randomly point

39:42.500 --> 39:44.500
One of the people as the leader

39:44.500 --> 39:46.500
Usually in the case of music

39:46.500 --> 39:48.500
For example, rock band

39:48.500 --> 39:50.500
The lead singer is usually the leader

39:50.500 --> 39:52.500
Everyone has to follow the speed of the lead singer

39:52.500 --> 39:54.500
Follow the volume of the lead singer

39:54.500 --> 39:56.500
To make adjustments

39:56.500 --> 39:58.500
It's the same in the case of music

39:58.500 --> 40:00.500
Usually the first violin is the leader

40:00.500 --> 40:02.500
But in Bach's Hymn

40:02.500 --> 40:04.500
The advantage of this piece is

40:04.500 --> 40:06.500
The relationship between the leader and the follower

40:06.500 --> 40:08.500
So when we do experiments

40:08.500 --> 40:10.500
We tell them in addition

40:10.500 --> 40:12.500
For example

40:12.500 --> 40:14.500
We only play the violin today

40:14.500 --> 40:16.500
For example, the third row

40:16.500 --> 40:18.500
You are the leader today

40:18.500 --> 40:20.500
You are going to lead the other three people

40:20.500 --> 40:22.500
To play this music

40:22.500 --> 40:24.500
And while we are playing this music

40:24.500 --> 40:26.500
In order to

40:26.500 --> 40:28.500
Close to natural interaction

40:28.500 --> 40:30.500
So they play this music

40:30.500 --> 40:32.500
They have never rehearsed before

40:32.500 --> 40:34.500
This is the first time I saw this score

40:34.500 --> 40:36.500
Then they played for the first time

40:36.500 --> 40:38.500
Then ask them to interact

40:38.500 --> 40:40.500
And we

40:40.500 --> 40:42.500
When we point out who is the leader

40:42.500 --> 40:44.500
We also give him a note

40:44.500 --> 40:46.500
Everyone can only see their own role

40:46.500 --> 40:48.500
If you are the leader, of course you know you are the leader

40:48.500 --> 40:50.500
But if you are a follower

40:50.500 --> 40:52.500
Then you can only know that one of them is the leader

40:52.500 --> 40:54.500
Then I have to try to find

40:54.500 --> 40:56.500
Who is the leader and then I have to follow him

40:56.500 --> 40:58.500
It's a bit like a guessing game

40:58.500 --> 41:00.500
OK

41:00.500 --> 41:02.500
This is the part of our experiment

41:02.500 --> 41:04.500
We experiment on the society

41:04.500 --> 41:06.500
Who is the leader

41:06.500 --> 41:08.500
Who is the follower

41:08.500 --> 41:10.500
Then we hope

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
If our measurement is effective

41:12.500 --> 41:14.500
It should be able to reflect

41:14.500 --> 41:16.500
We follow the leader

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
A relationship of such manipulation

41:18.500 --> 41:20.500
It should be able to reflect our experimental manipulation

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
OK

41:22.500 --> 41:24.500
So the information we get is like this

41:24.500 --> 41:26.500
Their body movements

41:26.500 --> 41:28.500
Then for example, the relationship between the first step of the violin and the second step of the violin

41:28.500 --> 41:30.500
Then according to the measure

41:30.500 --> 41:32.500
That is to say

41:32.500 --> 41:34.500
The first violin

41:34.500 --> 41:36.500
How much to predict the second violin

41:36.500 --> 41:38.500
This body movement

41:38.500 --> 41:40.500
Then in the case of the four-axis

41:40.500 --> 41:42.500
We have 12

41:42.500 --> 41:44.500
The direction of possible message transmission

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
This is the direction of all message transmission

41:46.500 --> 41:48.500
Then

41:48.500 --> 41:50.500
Through our experimental manipulation

41:50.500 --> 41:52.500
For example, we are in a piece of music

41:52.500 --> 41:54.500
We call the first violin

41:54.500 --> 41:56.500
It says V1 on it

41:56.500 --> 41:58.500
Then

41:58.500 --> 42:00.500
So the direction of these three messages

42:00.500 --> 42:02.500
It will be the relationship between the leader and the follower

42:02.500 --> 42:04.500
The opposite direction is

42:04.500 --> 42:06.500
The relationship between the follower and the leader

42:06.500 --> 42:08.500
Then the rest of the direction

42:08.500 --> 42:10.500
Is the relationship between the follower and the follower

42:10.500 --> 42:12.500
OK

42:12.500 --> 42:14.500
Then I just use English to put it

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
Leader follower follower

42:16.500 --> 42:18.500
So that means we

42:18.500 --> 42:20.500
Through the manipulation of this experiment

42:20.500 --> 42:22.500
Everyone of us

42:22.500 --> 42:24.500
Interactive relationship between them

42:24.500 --> 42:26.500
Different situations

42:26.500 --> 42:28.500
Then if we are in the next situation

42:28.500 --> 42:30.500
For example, if the second violin is the leader

42:30.500 --> 42:32.500
Then all the colors of these arrows

42:32.500 --> 42:34.500
Will exchange

42:34.500 --> 42:36.500
Will exchange

42:36.500 --> 42:38.500
Is there a problem here?

42:38.500 --> 42:40.500
This is the more complicated part of the experimental manipulation

42:42.500 --> 42:44.500
I want to ask

42:44.500 --> 42:46.500
You just said that

42:46.500 --> 42:48.500
What is the tune of the performance

42:48.500 --> 42:50.500
I don't know about music, but what is it?

42:50.500 --> 42:52.500
That means

42:52.500 --> 42:54.500
Does it already exist in this world?

42:54.500 --> 42:56.500
That's right

42:56.500 --> 42:58.500
We let him find something to do

42:58.500 --> 43:00.500
Will it be like this?

43:00.500 --> 43:02.500
For example, these four people

43:02.500 --> 43:04.500
Someone in particular

43:04.500 --> 43:06.500
I've known this song for a long time

43:06.500 --> 43:08.500
Then it will affect the results of the study

43:08.500 --> 43:10.500
This is a good question

43:10.500 --> 43:12.500
So we are special

43:12.500 --> 43:14.500
Special is that we have confirmed with the musicians

43:14.500 --> 43:16.500
They haven't played these songs

43:16.500 --> 43:18.500
It's the first time

43:18.500 --> 43:20.500
Then these musicians

43:20.500 --> 43:22.500
We are looking for more professional musicians

43:22.500 --> 43:24.500
So they got these songs for the first time

43:24.500 --> 43:26.500
They can start cooperating right away

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
OK, thank you

43:28.500 --> 43:30.500
This is a good question

43:30.500 --> 43:32.500
This reviewer also asked

43:34.500 --> 43:36.500
Then the next thing is

43:36.500 --> 43:38.500
Get the result of our experiment

43:38.500 --> 43:40.500
The three points on the X-axis are different situations

43:40.500 --> 43:42.500
Then the Y-axis is

43:42.500 --> 43:44.500
The strength of Grand Jack Casualty

43:44.500 --> 43:46.500
The higher the Y-axis

43:46.500 --> 43:48.500
The higher the Y value

43:48.500 --> 43:50.500
The stronger the transmission in this direction

43:50.500 --> 43:52.500
Then this is the result of the experiment

43:52.500 --> 43:54.500
You can see it

43:54.500 --> 43:56.500
You can see it from here

43:56.500 --> 43:58.500
From the leader to the follower

43:58.500 --> 44:00.500
Their information

44:00.500 --> 44:02.500
The amount of transmission is the highest

44:02.500 --> 44:04.500
It's the highest compared to other situations

44:04.500 --> 44:06.500
OK, this is a

44:06.500 --> 44:08.500
The statistics show that

44:08.500 --> 44:10.500
And then we have another one

44:10.500 --> 44:12.500
The manipulation is to say that they are playing

44:12.500 --> 44:14.500
Can you see other people

44:14.500 --> 44:16.500
We found that

44:16.500 --> 44:18.500
This effect is relatively strong

44:18.500 --> 44:20.500
But even if you can't see it

44:20.500 --> 44:22.500
Even if it's just playing music

44:22.500 --> 44:24.500
There is no visual information

44:24.500 --> 44:26.500
You don't know what other people are doing

44:26.500 --> 44:28.500
You see what other people are doing

44:28.500 --> 44:30.500
You still have this effect

44:30.500 --> 44:32.500
OK

44:32.500 --> 44:34.500
This is our main finding of the experiment

44:34.500 --> 44:36.500
Basically it means

44:36.500 --> 44:38.500
The overall action can reflect the direction of information transmission

44:38.500 --> 44:40.500
Then see the other person

44:40.500 --> 44:42.500
Will this

44:42.500 --> 44:44.500
This communication is helpful

44:44.500 --> 44:46.500
OK

44:46.500 --> 44:48.500
This is the first result

44:48.500 --> 44:50.500
The second result is

44:50.500 --> 44:52.500
Sorry, you say

44:54.500 --> 44:56.500
I see your

44:56.500 --> 44:58.500
Non-seeing condition

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
I can't speak Chinese

45:00.500 --> 45:02.500
Follower

45:02.500 --> 45:04.500
This is the difference between FL and FF

45:04.500 --> 45:06.500
There is a difference in dark gray

45:06.500 --> 45:08.500
Is there any difference in light gray?

45:08.500 --> 45:10.500
No

45:10.500 --> 45:12.500
Oh

45:12.500 --> 45:14.500
This is quite interesting

45:14.500 --> 45:16.500
This means

45:16.500 --> 45:18.500
Leader actually ignores

45:18.500 --> 45:20.500
Not affected by Follower

45:20.500 --> 45:22.500
Relative to the relationship between Follower and Follower

45:22.500 --> 45:24.500
That's what it means

45:24.500 --> 45:26.500
And this is only in non-seeing

45:26.500 --> 45:28.500
Follower and Follower

45:28.500 --> 45:30.500
Need to coordinate with each other

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
But the leader doesn't need to adapt to Follower

45:32.500 --> 45:34.500
It will look like this

45:34.500 --> 45:36.500
But this is only

45:36.500 --> 45:38.500
In non-seeing

45:38.500 --> 45:40.500
An obvious effect

45:40.500 --> 45:42.500
The experience of non-seeing

45:42.500 --> 45:44.500
Maybe

45:44.500 --> 45:46.500
Make some noise

45:46.500 --> 45:48.500
Make it more difficult

45:48.500 --> 45:50.500
Not to be affected by Follower

45:50.500 --> 45:52.500
Of course this needs to be replicated

45:52.500 --> 45:54.500
This is a small difference

45:54.500 --> 45:56.500
Or did you analyze the interaction?

45:56.500 --> 45:58.500
Did you find it

45:58.500 --> 46:00.500
Sorry

46:00.500 --> 46:02.500
Your

46:02.500 --> 46:04.500
There is no difference between the two white bars

46:04.500 --> 46:06.500
There is a difference between the two dark gray bars

46:06.500 --> 46:08.500
Is there any difference in this difference?

46:08.500 --> 46:10.500
No

46:10.500 --> 46:12.500
I looked at all the interactions

46:12.500 --> 46:14.500
OK

46:14.500 --> 46:16.500
Thank you

46:16.500 --> 46:18.500
You're welcome

46:18.500 --> 46:20.500
We actually replicated this thing

46:20.500 --> 46:22.500
But you just said

46:22.500 --> 46:24.500
The difference between the two dark gray bars

46:24.500 --> 46:26.500
The difference between the two dark gray bars

46:26.500 --> 46:28.500
Actually did not appear in the replication

46:28.500 --> 46:30.500
So

46:30.500 --> 46:32.500
So

46:32.500 --> 46:34.500
We didn't explain too much on paper

46:34.500 --> 46:36.500
What is the reason

46:36.500 --> 46:38.500
Not very clear

46:38.500 --> 46:40.500
But basically it can be found

46:40.500 --> 46:42.500
The body movement can reflect the direction of information transmission

46:42.500 --> 46:44.500
Reflect the direction of information transmission

46:44.500 --> 46:46.500
But I don't think this is very interesting

46:46.500 --> 46:48.500
Because

46:48.500 --> 46:50.500
What does this have to do with playing music?

46:50.500 --> 46:52.500
Just a bunch of people moving around in the studio

46:52.500 --> 46:54.500
Who moves first

46:54.500 --> 46:56.500
Then we

46:56.500 --> 46:58.500
In fact, after they play every song

46:58.500 --> 47:00.500
We ask musicians to use a scale

47:00.500 --> 47:02.500
To evaluate how well you feel

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
Then

47:04.500 --> 47:06.500
We asked him to evaluate three items

47:06.500 --> 47:08.500
What is the overall quality of the performance?

47:08.500 --> 47:10.500
1 to 5 points

47:10.500 --> 47:12.500
Then the synchronization of time

47:12.500 --> 47:14.500
Is it very synchronized?

47:14.500 --> 47:16.500
Then the difficulty of the cooperation

47:16.500 --> 47:18.500
Is there a difference?

47:18.500 --> 47:20.500
Then we go to them

47:20.500 --> 47:22.500
The amount of Granger Casualty

47:22.500 --> 47:24.500
To do

47:24.500 --> 47:26.500
Then we found

47:26.500 --> 47:28.500
This X axis is

47:28.500 --> 47:30.500
For example, here is very good

47:30.500 --> 47:32.500
The far right is very good

47:32.500 --> 47:34.500
Then the Y axis is

47:34.500 --> 47:36.500
Basically

47:36.500 --> 47:38.500
The overall amount of information exchange

47:38.500 --> 47:40.500
Then we found

47:40.500 --> 47:42.500
In fact, the quality of this performance

47:42.500 --> 47:44.500
With causal density

47:44.500 --> 47:46.500
With the amount of information exchange

47:46.500 --> 47:48.500
The coupling of body movements

47:48.500 --> 47:50.500
Is related

47:50.500 --> 47:52.500
Then there is also some correlation with the synchronization of time

47:52.500 --> 47:54.500
But in my second time

47:54.500 --> 47:56.500
Replication

47:56.500 --> 47:58.500
Only the overall quality of the performance is related

47:58.500 --> 48:00.500
So that is

48:00.500 --> 48:02.500
The amount of information transfer

48:02.500 --> 48:04.500
This body movement

48:04.500 --> 48:06.500
Not only reflects the direction of information transfer

48:06.500 --> 48:08.500
Then the amount of information transfer

48:08.500 --> 48:10.500
It seems to be with the quality of cooperation

48:10.500 --> 48:12.500
Can reflect their quality of cooperation

48:12.500 --> 48:14.500
So that is

48:14.500 --> 48:16.500
Summarize what we learned

48:16.500 --> 48:18.500
That is to say

48:18.500 --> 48:20.500
Learned in a multi-person cooperation environment

48:20.500 --> 48:22.500
Can be observed from the body movement

48:22.500 --> 48:24.500
Direction of information transfer

48:24.500 --> 48:26.500
Then even if this is a

48:26.500 --> 48:28.500
Listening and action-based homework

48:28.500 --> 48:30.500
But can you visually see the other person

48:30.500 --> 48:32.500
It seems to be a very important communication channel

48:32.500 --> 48:34.500
Then the overall action

48:34.500 --> 48:36.500
Information flow

48:36.500 --> 48:38.500
By measuring the body movement

48:38.500 --> 48:40.500
The amount of information activity can reflect the quality of cooperation

48:40.500 --> 48:42.500
Then

48:42.500 --> 48:44.500
In fact, these three points

48:44.500 --> 48:46.500
For everyone

48:46.500 --> 48:48.500
In fact, if you don't do research, you will probably get this result

48:48.500 --> 48:50.500
Then we think the biggest value

48:50.500 --> 48:52.500
That is to say, we actually provide

48:52.500 --> 48:54.500
A very low-threshold research method

48:54.500 --> 48:56.500
As long as you don't have to be in our

48:56.500 --> 48:58.500
Such a laboratory for observation

48:58.500 --> 49:00.500
You can observe in any natural situation

49:00.500 --> 49:02.500
You can use imaging analysis

49:02.500 --> 49:04.500
To observe their

49:04.500 --> 49:06.500
Physical actions between people

49:06.500 --> 49:08.500
You may be able to observe in a natural situation

49:08.500 --> 49:10.500
The group behavior between people

49:10.500 --> 49:12.500
We are just in a better and more precise

49:12.500 --> 49:14.500
Under the control of the laboratory

49:14.500 --> 49:16.500
Prove that this effect should exist

49:16.500 --> 49:18.500
Should be an effective index

49:18.500 --> 49:20.500
Then I think that is

49:20.500 --> 49:22.500
Provided may follow-up researchers

49:22.500 --> 49:24.500
If you want to study complex social behavior

49:24.500 --> 49:26.500
At least

49:26.500 --> 49:28.500
He may now have a tool

49:28.500 --> 49:30.500
I have a question

49:30.500 --> 49:32.500
Sorry

49:32.500 --> 49:34.500
You said

49:34.500 --> 49:36.500
I don't understand the second point

49:36.500 --> 49:38.500
The third point is the second point

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
I thought the result was

49:40.500 --> 49:42.500
If they are facing each other

49:42.500 --> 49:44.500
So in the absence of

49:44.500 --> 49:46.500
This result is still the same

49:46.500 --> 49:48.500
Still have

49:48.500 --> 49:50.500
But its effect is weaker

49:50.500 --> 49:52.500
Then

49:52.500 --> 49:54.500
There is a main effect

49:54.500 --> 49:56.500
Simple main effect

49:56.500 --> 49:58.500
Leader to follower

49:58.500 --> 50:00.500
Leader to follower

50:00.500 --> 50:02.500
In this direction

50:02.500 --> 50:04.500
See each other

50:04.500 --> 50:06.500
Much better than not seeing each other

50:06.500 --> 50:08.500
But

50:08.500 --> 50:10.500
In fact, both sides are still effective

50:10.500 --> 50:12.500
So this is my

50:12.500 --> 50:14.500
The third question is

50:14.500 --> 50:16.500
What is the direction of causal relationship?

50:16.500 --> 50:18.500
For example

50:18.500 --> 50:20.500
This

50:20.500 --> 50:22.500
This communication channel is because of

50:22.500 --> 50:24.500
Communication on music

50:24.500 --> 50:26.500
Caused your body to move like this

50:26.500 --> 50:28.500
Following

50:28.500 --> 50:30.500
Or your body moves like this

50:30.500 --> 50:32.500
Caused the progress of music

50:32.500 --> 50:34.500
Because if

50:34.500 --> 50:36.500
If you can't see your body now

50:36.500 --> 50:38.500
Body sway or follow each other

50:38.500 --> 50:40.500
It means that it is not visual communication at all

50:40.500 --> 50:42.500
Is hearing

50:42.500 --> 50:44.500
Or the essence of music

50:44.500 --> 50:46.500
Caused by

50:46.500 --> 50:48.500
Natural body reaction

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
Is a real cause

50:50.500 --> 50:52.500
I didn't say it was a cause

50:52.500 --> 50:54.500
I just said it was a reaction

50:54.500 --> 50:56.500
Indicator

50:56.500 --> 50:58.500
I said it was

50:58.500 --> 51:00.500
When we play music

51:00.500 --> 51:02.500
Actually don't need

51:02.500 --> 51:04.500
Body to do this action

51:04.500 --> 51:06.500
But we still do

51:06.500 --> 51:08.500
Then this information seems to reflect

51:08.500 --> 51:10.500
Direction of information transmission

51:10.500 --> 51:12.500
And the quality of its cooperation

51:12.500 --> 51:14.500
So you don't think

51:14.500 --> 51:16.500
It is functional

51:16.500 --> 51:18.500
It's just a indicator

51:18.500 --> 51:20.500
It's just a indicator that you can measure

51:20.500 --> 51:22.500
I'm conservative

51:22.500 --> 51:24.500
I'm conservative

51:24.500 --> 51:26.500
I don't know

51:26.500 --> 51:28.500
I can't prove it yet

51:28.500 --> 51:30.500
There are other studies

51:30.500 --> 51:32.500
Some people are

51:32.500 --> 51:34.500
Block the whole person

51:34.500 --> 51:36.500
Then measure their time

51:36.500 --> 51:38.500
The time difference between each other's buttons

51:38.500 --> 51:40.500
It is true that the time difference between the buttons

51:40.500 --> 51:42.500
Will affect

51:42.500 --> 51:44.500
But I think

51:44.500 --> 51:46.500
The conclusion is

51:46.500 --> 51:48.500
My current research

51:48.500 --> 51:50.500
My current results can only say

51:50.500 --> 51:52.500
It can be reflected

51:52.500 --> 51:54.500
Maybe it's just a related indicator

51:54.500 --> 51:56.500
But its function

51:56.500 --> 51:58.500
Is it part of the communication itself

51:58.500 --> 52:00.500
Is it that I want to see other people's body movements

52:00.500 --> 52:02.500
Or part of it

52:02.500 --> 52:04.500
I don't know about this

52:04.500 --> 52:06.500
Because like you said

52:06.500 --> 52:08.500
Even if you can't see it, the body movements have this effect

52:08.500 --> 52:10.500
Understand

52:10.500 --> 52:12.500
I have another question with Zhang Ting

52:12.500 --> 52:14.500
I have another question with Zhang Ting

52:14.500 --> 52:16.500
But it's not directly

52:16.500 --> 52:18.500
About your research itself

52:18.500 --> 52:20.500
But we want something very interesting from your research

52:20.500 --> 52:22.500
If we

52:22.500 --> 52:24.500
This Baja

52:24.500 --> 52:26.500
Because you just emphasized

52:26.500 --> 52:28.500
Its four characters are actually relative

52:28.500 --> 52:30.500
What is that called

52:30.500 --> 52:32.500
Responsibility is more average

52:32.500 --> 52:34.500
So you can randomly assign who you are

52:34.500 --> 52:36.500
But if we change it to jazz four beats

52:36.500 --> 52:38.500
That kind of character is very strong

52:38.500 --> 52:40.500
You expect

52:40.500 --> 52:42.500
The effect size will become very strong

52:42.500 --> 52:44.500
Or will they break down

52:44.500 --> 52:46.500
Because they don't know who they are

52:46.500 --> 52:48.500
Suppose you don't assign

52:48.500 --> 52:50.500
I know

52:50.500 --> 52:52.500
This is our experiment 2

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
Actually we

52:54.500 --> 52:56.500
We also did it

52:56.500 --> 52:58.500
I didn't post it today, but this is experiment 2

52:58.500 --> 53:00.500
In the case of experiment 2

53:00.500 --> 53:02.500
We don't have that kind of jazz four beats

53:02.500 --> 53:04.500
We want them to play

53:04.500 --> 53:06.500
Mozart's music

53:06.500 --> 53:08.500
Mozart's music

53:08.500 --> 53:10.500
If you look at the score

53:10.500 --> 53:12.500
All the melodies are in the first minor

53:12.500 --> 53:14.500
The other parts are just beats

53:14.500 --> 53:16.500
But we still do exactly the same

53:16.500 --> 53:18.500
Even if we say the cello is just beat

53:18.500 --> 53:20.500
You still have to lead the cello

53:20.500 --> 53:22.500
To play his music

53:22.500 --> 53:24.500
So this is basically the same as you think

53:24.500 --> 53:26.500
The result is

53:26.500 --> 53:28.500
I go back to the previous slide

53:28.500 --> 53:30.500
This is what I just said

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
Replication

53:32.500 --> 53:34.500
There are still three lines above

53:34.500 --> 53:36.500
The following three lines are gone

53:38.500 --> 53:40.500
So we are in a task

53:40.500 --> 53:42.500
Is an unbalanced starting point

53:42.500 --> 53:44.500
We do manipulation

53:44.500 --> 53:46.500
Still see the above effects

53:46.500 --> 53:48.500
But he is actually weak overall

53:48.500 --> 53:50.500
Then we measure

53:50.500 --> 53:52.500
That is to say

53:52.500 --> 53:54.500
In the case of bassline

53:54.500 --> 53:56.500
Is the strength of the grunge causality between each other

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
How much

53:58.500 --> 54:00.500
We found that in the case of playing Mozart's music

54:00.500 --> 54:02.500
The bassline is more uneven

54:02.500 --> 54:04.500
In the case of playing Bach

54:04.500 --> 54:06.500
The bassline is average

54:06.500 --> 54:08.500
This is the effect of this bassline

54:08.500 --> 54:10.500
This effect

54:10.500 --> 54:12.500
It actually shows that this is functional

54:12.500 --> 54:14.500
Because you are in the case of non-sync

54:14.500 --> 54:16.500
When this music itself

54:16.500 --> 54:18.500
When there is no such message

54:18.500 --> 54:20.500
When this music itself has an obvious bias

54:20.500 --> 54:22.500
It's hard for you to have one

54:22.500 --> 54:24.500
For example, in the case of a cello

54:24.500 --> 54:26.500
Without seeing your body

54:26.500 --> 54:28.500
But

54:28.500 --> 54:30.500
When you see

54:30.500 --> 54:32.500
It still produces an effect

54:32.500 --> 54:34.500
It means he is

54:34.500 --> 54:36.500
Link

54:36.500 --> 54:38.500
I suddenly feel like I'm talking about

54:38.500 --> 54:40.500
Because although

54:40.500 --> 54:42.500
But we didn't

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
But the music itself is also

54:44.500 --> 54:46.500
Actually explained

54:46.500 --> 54:48.500
Then we

54:48.500 --> 54:50.500
I think it's a bit difficult

54:50.500 --> 54:52.500
difficult

54:52.500 --> 54:54.500
I think even if there is such a difference

54:54.500 --> 54:56.500
Just say there is this possibility

54:56.500 --> 54:58.500
But answer the question directly

54:58.500 --> 55:00.500
For example, I tied the musician

55:00.500 --> 55:02.500
Tied to the chair

55:02.500 --> 55:04.500
I can't move

55:04.500 --> 55:06.500
This is a direct manipulation

55:08.500 --> 55:10.500
Do you agree with me

55:10.500 --> 55:12.500
I don't know, I can't figure it out

55:12.500 --> 55:14.500
I have to think about it

55:14.500 --> 55:16.500
That is to say, I can't let you move today

55:16.500 --> 55:18.500
See if the quality of your performance will be reduced

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
You obviously have a lot of barriers

55:22.500 --> 55:24.500
You can't do that

55:24.500 --> 55:26.500
I'm still thinking

55:26.500 --> 55:28.500
The evidence just now is not enough

55:28.500 --> 55:30.500
He seems to be able to prove

55:30.500 --> 55:32.500
You still find this body

55:32.500 --> 55:34.500
The reaction is related to the cause and effect

55:34.500 --> 55:36.500
Follower

55:36.500 --> 55:38.500
This is related to the leader

55:38.500 --> 55:40.500
But the cause and effect of this relationship does not mean

55:40.500 --> 55:42.500
Music performance

55:42.500 --> 55:44.500
Cause and effect between body sway

55:44.500 --> 55:46.500
So it's not a good evidence

55:46.500 --> 55:48.500
Have you always been like this

55:48.500 --> 55:50.500
I'm a little confused

55:52.500 --> 55:54.500
I'm also confused

55:54.500 --> 55:56.500
When we wrote the paper

55:56.500 --> 55:58.500
In fact, different authors are thinking

55:58.500 --> 56:00.500
Some authors argue directly

56:00.500 --> 56:02.500
Body sway is communication

56:02.500 --> 56:04.500
But

56:04.500 --> 56:06.500
I don't think you have that evidence

56:06.500 --> 56:08.500
I think the evidence is not direct

56:08.500 --> 56:10.500
Then I'll be safe

56:10.500 --> 56:12.500
Then discuss

56:12.500 --> 56:14.500
But I don't know

56:14.500 --> 56:16.500
I think there are two causal relationships

56:16.500 --> 56:18.500
One causal relationship is the body sway of the leader

56:18.500 --> 56:20.500
Causing the body sway of the follower

56:20.500 --> 56:22.500
This is the analysis you are doing now

56:22.500 --> 56:24.500
As long as the bar on your left is higher

56:24.500 --> 56:26.500
It means that this causality exists

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
But

56:28.500 --> 56:30.500
You finish first

56:32.500 --> 56:34.500
But another causal relationship

56:34.500 --> 56:36.500
Music communication

56:36.500 --> 56:38.500
Causal relationship between body sway

56:38.500 --> 56:40.500
Is body sway

56:40.500 --> 56:42.500
Is the cause of music communication

56:44.500 --> 56:46.500
The first point

56:46.500 --> 56:48.500
About grunge causality

56:48.500 --> 56:50.500
I guess many listeners may know

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
It is actually argued

56:52.500 --> 56:54.500
Causality is a big problem

56:54.500 --> 56:56.500
Mathematically

56:56.500 --> 56:58.500
It can only say

56:58.500 --> 57:00.500
The amount of information transfer

57:02.500 --> 57:04.500
Is there really a cause?

57:04.500 --> 57:06.500
There must be some other situations

57:06.500 --> 57:08.500
For example, I have to sample

57:08.500 --> 57:10.500
The whole universe

57:10.500 --> 57:12.500
And you have to assume

57:12.500 --> 57:14.500
Anyway, there are some situations

57:14.500 --> 57:16.500
Anyway, it's conservative

57:16.500 --> 57:18.500
Mathematically, I can only say

57:18.500 --> 57:20.500
A predict B

57:20.500 --> 57:22.500
Can't say A cause B

57:22.500 --> 57:24.500
You can say causality

57:24.500 --> 57:26.500
Because it is the difference in time

57:26.500 --> 57:28.500
This message leads to this message

57:28.500 --> 57:30.500
What other factors do you have in body sway

57:30.500 --> 57:32.500
Will lead to this change

57:32.500 --> 57:34.500
There may be a third reason for music

57:34.500 --> 57:36.500
In short, I think

57:36.500 --> 57:38.500
Alternative is limited

57:38.500 --> 57:40.500
Not any possible hypothesis

57:40.500 --> 57:42.500
These alternatives sound

57:42.500 --> 57:44.500
Not very

57:44.500 --> 57:46.500
Not very convincing

57:46.500 --> 57:48.500
So I think even if it's a bit risky

57:48.500 --> 57:50.500
You can still argue

57:50.500 --> 57:52.500
But on the other hand

57:52.500 --> 57:54.500
What you really care about is

57:54.500 --> 57:56.500
Body movement response

57:56.500 --> 57:58.500
Is this message

57:58.500 --> 58:00.500
Is it music communication itself

58:00.500 --> 58:02.500
Does it cause better music quality

58:02.500 --> 58:04.500
Is it a good communication

58:04.500 --> 58:06.500
This sound

58:06.500 --> 58:08.500
But this seems to need other evidence

58:08.500 --> 58:10.500
That's right

58:14.500 --> 58:16.500
I'm conservative

58:16.500 --> 58:18.500
I think you are conservative

58:20.500 --> 58:22.500
My bubble is gone

58:22.500 --> 58:24.500
So everyone is welcome to discuss freely

58:24.500 --> 58:26.500
It doesn't matter

58:26.500 --> 58:28.500
I would like to ask you this experiment

58:28.500 --> 58:30.500
You are talking about this experiment now

58:30.500 --> 58:32.500
For example, how many groups do you want to do

58:32.500 --> 58:34.500
Is a group

58:34.500 --> 58:36.500
Or how many musicians

58:36.500 --> 58:38.500
There is a way to get one

58:38.500 --> 58:40.500
Is relatively unrecognized

58:40.500 --> 58:42.500
For example, the culture of the performer

58:42.500 --> 58:44.500
Or the level of training of the performer

58:44.500 --> 58:46.500
Is less disturbed by this aspect

58:46.500 --> 58:48.500
OK, I think you asked this question very well

58:48.500 --> 58:50.500
I think this is the weakness of this study

58:50.500 --> 58:52.500
Because first of all

58:52.500 --> 58:54.500
We are looking for very high-level musicians

58:54.500 --> 58:56.500
That is, you have to pay a lot of money

58:56.500 --> 58:58.500
The kind of concert to buy a ticket

58:58.500 --> 59:00.500
They will come

59:02.500 --> 59:04.500
Because of the financial restrictions

59:04.500 --> 59:06.500
We found two groups

59:06.500 --> 59:08.500
We found two groups

59:08.500 --> 59:10.500
In terms of statistical methods

59:10.500 --> 59:12.500
We think it's better to say

59:12.500 --> 59:14.500
We are all

59:14.500 --> 59:16.500
We call it within subject comparison

59:16.500 --> 59:18.500
Compare yourself to yourself

59:18.500 --> 59:20.500
That is, in the case of yourself

59:20.500 --> 59:22.500
How much stronger is this effect

59:22.500 --> 59:24.500
So even if

59:24.500 --> 59:26.500
The sample we took

59:26.500 --> 59:28.500
Is very limited, that is, two groups of musicians

59:28.500 --> 59:30.500
A total of eight people

59:30.500 --> 59:32.500
But within each person

59:32.500 --> 59:34.500
Their direction of effect is consistent

59:34.500 --> 59:36.500
Is it possible

59:36.500 --> 59:38.500
I took some very biased samples

59:38.500 --> 59:40.500
For example, these musicians do not represent all humans

59:40.500 --> 59:42.500
It is possible

59:42.500 --> 59:44.500
This is the weakness of this study

59:44.500 --> 59:46.500
How high is this representation

59:46.500 --> 59:48.500
I do not know

59:48.500 --> 59:50.500
I can only say from other current studies

59:50.500 --> 59:52.500
Musicians and normal humans

59:52.500 --> 59:54.500
The representation is actually

59:54.500 --> 59:56.500
It can represent

59:56.500 --> 59:58.500
Ordinary human beings

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
Other cultures

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500
This is also a matter of representation

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.500
It is also said that the representation is still OK

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.500
It is also said that the representation is still OK

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.500
It's just that I don't have direct evidence

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.500
Say this effect

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.500
Can it represent the effect of all humans

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.500
I don't know

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.500
Is it conservative

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.500
It's okay

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500
I have a question

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500
You ask first, you finish first

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500
It's okay, my next question has nothing to do with this

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
So you can continue to ask other questions

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500
You mentioned quarreling at the beginning

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.500
But quarreling

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500
It doesn't seem to be sung

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.500
I want to know

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500
It can also be sung

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.500
So I want to ask

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500
The question is

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500
The results are already here

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500
How big do you think it is

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.500
How big can it be

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.500
Let us predict

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500
Or provide us

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.500
Language communication

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.500
Knowledge

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500
What kind of implications

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500
What kind of implications

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500
If there are some

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.500
Weaknesses

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.500
Where it can't be inferred

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.500
Some research that may need to be supplemented

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.500
What will it be

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.500
To the part of speech

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.500
OK

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500
First of all

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.500
About body movements

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500
Most of the research is actually done in the case of speech

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.500
But what they do is

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500
In a small lab

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500
Two people

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500
Use relevant methods

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500
That

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500
There are other research around

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500
In fact

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.500
Music performance and speech

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.500
The psychological process they use

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.500
Actually very similar

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500
Then we are equal to

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
In the case of music, we also observed

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500
This body movement

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500
Of course it's not exactly the same effect

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500
Extend out

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.500
But the effect is the same

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.500
Effect

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.500
Although there is no direct evidence

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500
But I think

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.500
This effect should be in speech

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.500
It should be exactly the same

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500
This is my guess

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
Thank you

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500
I have a related question

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500
Can you plug in

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500
Is there a lottery number

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500
Someone said he had a problem

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500
I'm afraid I won't keep plugging in

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.500
I asked too many questions

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500
You just said language

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.500
In fact, I think

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.500
More broadly

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.500
Do you think these are all

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500
Is it the phenomenon of hearing?

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.500
Or is it actually a wider perception

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.500
Or is it a new way of operation

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.500
Or is it

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.500
Specific to the phenomenon of hearing

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500
For example, the experiment you just started is regularity

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Decide

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.500
You can anticipate

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500
How to deal with sensory information

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500
Obviously this is also the case in vision

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.500
Then there is your current music

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.500
The communication of cooperation

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.500
Is it really due to the performance of music

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.500
Or all the cooperation

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.500
All the cooperation

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.500
For example, the table you just raised

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.500
There are all the same phenomena

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.500
Does the sway of the body also affect

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.500
Or there are some more general mechanisms

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.500
For example, any synchrony

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.500
Any synchronicity

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500
Will help communicate

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.500
Can you remind me again

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.500
What is the first part

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.500
I thought it was all examples

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.500
The main question is

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.500
Do you think this is a domain-specific phenomenon

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.500
Specific to the phenomenon of hearing

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.500
Or is it a broader

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.500
New way of operation

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.500
I don't need a standard answer

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.500
I'm just curious

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500
Curious about my idea

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500
According to other studies

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500
Actually found

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500
Like this kind of time synchrony

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.500
For hearing

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.500
It's still a bit different from vision

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.500
Like

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500
The sense of rhythm of vision

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.500
In fact, it is relative to hearing

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500
Is quite difficult to trigger

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.500
The accuracy of his track time

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500
No

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.500
It seems that the results are not so high

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500
But someone has succeeded

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.500
Someone has succeeded

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.500
Vision still has this effect

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.500
In fact, it may not be the same

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500
The domain of hearing

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500
Obviously frequency and time

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.500
But in vision

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.500
It will be space and location

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.500
So

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.500
Translated, it becomes

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500
Like statistical learning

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.500
If there is a fixed pattern

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500
Can't speak Chinese

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500
If there is a fixed pattern

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.500
Repeatedly appear

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500
Your processing will be faster and better

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500
More accurate

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500
Is this a similar phenomenon?

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.500
Or there is a specialized

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500
Some

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.500
Processing in the brain

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.500
Processing in different areas

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500
I think the special process

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500
Because time is one dimension

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500
Although

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.500
It is a single direction

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.500
But you are always

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500
To the future

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500
That

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.500
For example

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.500
Visual

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.500
This pattern

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.500
This pattern is not the same

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.500
But it must be future-oriented

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500
Based on your existing knowledge

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.500
You keep guessing

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.500
What is the future information

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.500
And it is online processing

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.500
So

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.500
I think these details

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.500
Let time

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.500
For hearing

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500
The requirements become

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500
Different from other senses

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
Because his information is open at any time

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.500
Let me give you an example

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.500
Visual phenomenon

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.500
Also belongs to

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500
Temporal anticipation

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.500
For example

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500
You should know this experiment

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
Three

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500
Three random sounds

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500
Combination

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.500
This is the first time

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500
Language learning

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.500
For example, there are nine possible

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500
Tones

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.500
These things

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.500
Three

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.500
Always stuck together

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.500
Three

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.500
Always a pair

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.500
These sentences

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.500
Can be combined

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.500
But in fact

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500
If you use visual stimulation

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.500
Do the same experiment

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.500
All the results are the same

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500
This is also a future

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.500
Processing from the past and online

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.500
Anticipation for the future

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500
Affect your intuition

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.500
I know

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500
In each special case

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.500
Some cases are replicated

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.500
But there are many cases

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.500
It's hard to do

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.500
For example, the effect of rhythm

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500
Temporal grouping

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.500
I know you have done it in the lab

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.500
But their citation

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500
In fact, you can see

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.500
A lot of people failed

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.500
But it doesn't matter

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.500
I know I have done that multisensory

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.500
I know it's hard

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.500
It's super simple

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.500
You just need to present four tones

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.500
People will know

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.500
So you mean

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.500
It has a domain-specific part

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.500
Extract

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.500
Temporal regularity

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.500
What do you think

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.500
About regularity

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.500
What do you think is different

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.500
What is the difference between auditory regularity and visual regularity

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.500
I think

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.500
I think the effect is the same

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500
But maybe in processing

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.500
In the very early stage of hearing

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.500
Will start to deal with this matter

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.500
You will be in

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.500
Temporal coding

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.500
But visual

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.500
You may want to

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.500
Where domain

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.500
I'm not sure

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.500
The later process will deal with

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.500
This message

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.500
These mechanisms

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.500
That's why it's so noisy

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.500
For example

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.500
I don't know if it will affect auditory

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.500
Because of these phenomena

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.500
So auditory and visual

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.500
Basically there is a difference

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500
Ok

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500
I've been standing for too long

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.500
Can I guess

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.500
It's over, please say

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.500
I read a article before

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.500
He said

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500
This is a new one

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.500
He said if the stimulation material

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.500
The trigger material is used

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.500
Language or

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.500
Sound is the hearing

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.500
Trigger material

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.500
That

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.500
The subject

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.500
The abstract

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.500
Will be higher

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.500
Later he described this material

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.500
And so on

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.500
He will use a more abstract and psychological distance

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.500
To describe

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.500
Relative to visual stimulation material

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.500
I don't know this

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.500
Processing

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.500
Listening to music

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.500
Music and language

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.500
Are close

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.500
Relative to visual stimulation

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500
Because

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.500
Take the initiative to do

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.500
Prediction

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500
It feels like

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.500
My feeling is to be abstract

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500
When it's higher

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.500
I will do it

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500
Because if it's very concrete

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.500
Isn't it just

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.500
Just accept input

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500
You don't have to guess

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.500
Or is it like this

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.500
I don't know

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.500
But

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.500
I really don't know

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.500
I don't know how to do it

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.500
I don't know

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.500
I really don't know

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500
Hello

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.500
I just said I don't know

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.500
Sorry

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.500
Okay

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.500
Do you have any questions?

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.500
Someone is chatting

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500
Okay

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500
Can I ask a question?

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.500
Okay

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.500
Please

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.500
I was thinking

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.500
If you

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.500
When the musicians come

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.500
You tell them on purpose

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500
Three of you

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.500
Follow and one is leader

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.500
Now you are saying

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.500
When you are doing it

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.500
You give them two leaders and two followers

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.500
To see their

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.500
Will they fight?

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.500
Yes

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500
Actually we did this experiment

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.500
Our condition

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.500
Is called

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.500
Bitch I'm the leader

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.500
We

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500
We originally thought

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500
When your leadership assignment

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
Is a conflict

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500
How do we

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500
Choose a leader

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.500
Then

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500
That person becomes the leader

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500
We originally wanted to see this

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.500
But the result of the experiment

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.500
We found that only when

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500
Everyone can see each other

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.500
And everyone is assigned as followers

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.500
To solve this conflict

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.500
To be able to

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.500
At first everyone's coordination was bad

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.500
But after a while

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.500
Only when everyone is followers

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.500
And can see each other

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500
To solve this

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500
In other cases

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.500
For example, everyone is the leader

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.500
Or can't see each other

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.500
They can't solve it

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.500
So we call it bitch I'm the leader

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.500
Okay

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.500
Have you ever tried

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.500
Without a leader

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.500
For example

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500
If you tell them

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.500
One person is the follower

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.500
One person is the leader

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500
But no one gets the leader

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.500
That's right

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.500
We just said

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.500
Everyone is the follower

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.500
And can see each other

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.500
When no one is the leader

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.500
And they play

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.500
Gradually

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.500
Information flow

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.500
But only in a quartet

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.500
Only in Bach

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.500
In Mozart

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.500
If it's not balanced

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.500
It doesn't work

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.500
So we think

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.500
If everyone is the follower

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.500
Everyone follows Poussin

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.500
Follow Poussin

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.500
Once they find this conflict

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.500
Just follow Poussin

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.500
At the same time

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.500
After each performance

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.500
They have to guess who is the leader

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:38.500
They were forced to choose the other three

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.500
Even if they are all followers

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.500
You have to guess who

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.500
I think they are too good

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.500
After the performance

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.500
They wrote on the answer sheet

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.500
No leader

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.500
They were not fooled by us

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.500
So this part

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.500
The conclusion is not clear

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.500
And we avoid

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.500
In order to have no leader

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.500
In the case of no leader

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.500
Or in the case of all leaders

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.500
They will conflict at the beginning

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.500
Two seconds before the performance

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.500
We play the beat

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.500
Before the performance

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.500
The beat is removed

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.500
So they just have to follow the beat

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.500
So there will be no problem

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.500
Does anyone have any questions?

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.500
I have a question

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.500
If I understand correctly

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.500
You do this experiment with music

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.500
Because I hope this experiment can be close to

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.500
Social interaction

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.500
But in human interaction

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.500
For example, there are leaders and followers in group behavior

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.500
This often depends on

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.500
Personal characteristics

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.500
Personality

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.500
These things

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.500
In music, they have been closely trained

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.500
They may be able to express their personality

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.500
Their desire

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.500
Then follow the music

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.500
So they can't react to human society

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.500
Personal characteristics affect interaction

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.500
Do you think this will affect

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.500
Your research results

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.500
How to cover this part

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.500
I think these questions are too good

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.500
I can only say

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.500
In this case, this is also a weakness of our research

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.500
Because we are looking for a group

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.500
We are not

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.500
Go out and find two violin

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.500
Put them together

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.500
In this case, we can

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.500
For example, we look for

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.500
For example, a very strong first violin

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.500
Or a very strong cello

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.500
Then look at the relationship between their personalities

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.500
Relationship

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.500
Then see how they

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.500
What effect will this experiment have

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.500
I don't know about this, Zhang Yanping can do an experiment

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.500
You can come to us

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.500
I can only say that this is indeed a weakness of our research

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.500
Our research is currently

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.500
As a personality effect

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.500
We didn't study

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.500
We just don't look at it

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.500
Answer

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.500
I think

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.500
In your experiment

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.500
You have assigned leadership

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.500
Can't you argue

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.500
To a certain extent

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.500
Do you operate such a personality

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.500
Because when a person gets

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500
When this assignment

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.500
To a certain extent

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.500
That person

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.500
Is a strong personality

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.500
Of course, people who are not so strong

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.500
May not be able to get so much

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.500
But in general

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.500
That person

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.500
Should be taken out

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.500
It seems

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500
Right, this must be understood

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.500
I don't understand this

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.500
That's right

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.500
This leader

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.500
The operation of the follower is our experiment

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.500
I think it is

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.500
In a more unnatural situation

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.500
Just like the previous question

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.500
In general, everyone is

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.500
According to the personality

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.500
Then we experiment to manipulate

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.500
As for the effect of the operation and its original personality

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.500
I don't know

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.500
Just say we manipulate

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.500
It seems to be

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.500
In everyone

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.500
We still see

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.500
Even if I am the leader

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.500
I can influence others

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.500
The level of predicting others

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.500
Higher

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.500
Thank you

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.500
Do you have any questions?

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.500
We designed 10 experiments

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.500
To continue, right?

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.500
Not bad

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.500
Then we have to hang the author

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.500
Hang the author

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.500
Who will help me run the experiment?

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.500
Canada is a bit cold

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.500
Caltech is now 100 degrees

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.500
Almost hot

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.500
It's already 4.24

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.500
Then we officially

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.500
Come here

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.500
If you have any questions

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.500
Or want to continue with Andrew

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.500
Future interaction

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.500
Please remember to fill in the feedback form

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.500
You can leave your contact information

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.500
To YongYi

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.500
Then we will help you get it

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.500
Thank you

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.500
Especially the comment part

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.500
If there is a comment

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.500
Welcome

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.500
I think

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.500
I think it's good

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.500
And you turned to Chinese

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.500
Everyone is laughing

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.500
I was practicing 20 minutes before the speech

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.500
I can't speak a word of Chinese

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.500
I'm starting to chat now

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.500
So if you want to leave

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.500
You can leave

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.500
Because I

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.500
I talked about it in Taiwan University two months ago
