00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Let's start recording.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Okay.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Okay, I got it. Thank you.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Let's start.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Yanping.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm your host today.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
But I'll probably talk for a while

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
and then I'll be gone.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Because my wife's waist is twisted

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
to the point where she can't hold the baby.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
So...

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm going to have an emergency meeting later.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
So today,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
let's welcome Hanxi to share

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
with us...

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
He's the only one who has a webcam

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
so he's Hanxi.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
He's going to share

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
with us about the

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
law related to

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
public safety.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Because

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Hanxi...

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Is Hanxi right?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yes, that's right.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
My Chinese isn't very good.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Hanxi used to

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
study law.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
But then he went to the police station

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
to study...

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
He studied for a while

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
in Yang Ming's police station.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Then he came back to study law.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
His major is

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
the law related to

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
public safety.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Hanxi will share the details with us later.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
No problem.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
We're happy to have Hanxi here today

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
because he's probably our first law student.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Also, he's probably our first...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I guess,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
pure humanist.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
So we're happy that we can finally

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
expand to a more complete

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
academic field.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
There are people in all fields.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Without further ado,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
let's give a round of applause to welcome Hanxi.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm the only one in charge of filming.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Because

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
today's guest is not alone.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Today's guest is not alone.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Let me briefly introduce myself.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm a friend of Yuhui.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Let's get to know each other.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Why is my microphone

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
turned off all of a sudden?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
It's like

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
a small roundtable.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It's like a chat.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
It's not a formal report.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Since we have the opportunity,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
let's get to know each other.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm not sure

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
which school you're from.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So let's...

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Let me introduce myself.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Let me introduce myself.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I'm from UNC.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm from Beka.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm majoring in social psychology.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Who's next?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Hello.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Hi.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Let me introduce myself first.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm from DC.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm George Washington.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm majoring in mechanical engineering.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm majoring in

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
high-performance computing.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
It's related to supercomputers.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
It's related to supercomputers.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm doing an internship

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
in Tennessee.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
So you're not in DC.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I'll be back in September.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I'll be back in September.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Cool.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
So your name is

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Zhuang Ping...

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Bi Yue.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Zhuang Bi Yue.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Bi Yue Xuan Hua.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Let's switch to Caltech.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
We have two people here.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm Zhuang Ye You.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm working in Caltech

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
and NASA JPL.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm working on dark matter experiments.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm Yu Zhe Jing.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
You can call me Zhe.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm studying in Taiwan University.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm studying in Taiwan University.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm working in Caltech.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I used to work in chemical engineering.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm working in environmental engineering.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
That's cool.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
That's cool.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
So there's one more person.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
He left a comment

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
in the chat room.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Oh, okay.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
He's studying geography.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
He's studying geography.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
What field is he studying?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Geography is pretty broad.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It ranges from biology to natural science.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm pretty interested in this.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So we're going to

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
chat with Zhuang.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Physical Geography.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Okay.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
You've been to Charleston.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Okay.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm going to start.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm going to hand over my video.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm going to hand over my video.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Okay.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Hello, everyone.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm at Georgetown

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
studying law.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
If you have any questions,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
feel free to ask.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You can see my screen.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I think you can hear me.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
If you have any questions,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
feel free to ask.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm happy to share

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
my research topic with you.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I'm at Georgetown Law School.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm at Georgetown Law School.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It's a big classroom.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
The signal here is very good.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I'm preparing this topic

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
about obesity

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and soda tax.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm preparing this topic

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
about obesity

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
and soda tax.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I'm preparing this topic

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
about obesity

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
for the first time.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
For the first time.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I think I'm getting a little bit

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I think I'm getting a little bit

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
a little bit

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
a little bit

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
a little bit

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
a little bit

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
a little bit

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
a little bit

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
a little bit

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
a little bit

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
a really little bit

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
a really little bit

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
a really little bit

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
a really little bit

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
a really little bit

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
a really little bit

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
a really little bit

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
a really little bit

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
a really little bit

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
a really little bit

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
a really little bit

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
a really little bit

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
a really little bit

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
a really little bit

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
a really little bit

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
a really little bit

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
a really little bit

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
a really little bit

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
a really little bit

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
a really little bit

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
a really little bit

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
a really little bit

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I think the host just mentioned a little bit

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
but I can still give a brief introduction

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
to myself

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
to put it simply, it's actually a little bit

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
complicated, because I

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
like you guys who are watching this video

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I have studied in a lot of schools

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
and right now

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
George Student University is probably the fifth

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
so there might be some of you here

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
whether it's Taitung University or Yangming University

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
or even UW

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
University of Washington

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
In my field,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
on the one hand, I was born with a background in law

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
just like everyone is familiar with

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
well, law

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
and being a lawyer

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I was born with a background in law and training

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I also studied law

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
and now I am studying law

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
on the other hand, I am a little bit different

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
from other law students

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
in that I have my

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
medical background

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
and work experience

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
how should I put it

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
that is

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
my first full-time job

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
as you can see

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
my first full-time job

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
was in Seattle

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
ICHS

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
International Community Health Service

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
International Community

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Health Service

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
that was when I was

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
in UW

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
in 2007, after graduating from law school

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I went there to work

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
that was my first full-time job

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
before that, I was a lawyer in Taiwan

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
but I hadn't worked there

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
that was my first full-time job

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
for a lawyer in Taiwan

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
in my mindset

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
to work in a hospital

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
that was a big surprise

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
so that year

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
to some extent

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I got interested in medical law

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
and then

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I jumped out

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
when I came back to Taiwan

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I kept my medical background

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
so I kept my medical background

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
in the health law field

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
so

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
can everyone hear me?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
because

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
it's weird

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
because I can't hear everyone

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
we can hear you

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
so welcome

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
to speak up

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
it's my first time

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
feeling like this

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
you can't see anyone

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
it's like a speech

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
can you speak up?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I can't hear you

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
can you speak up?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
will it be better if I speak up?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
if you don't mind

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I can see your face

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
it's like a speech

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I'm not wearing any clothes

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
so I don't want to speak

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm not wearing any clothes

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
so I don't want to speak

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm not wearing any clothes

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm not wearing any clothes

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
there's an answer on the screen

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
no problem, thank you

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
we can

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
we can turn on the video

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
yes

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
you can turn off the sound

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
at least there's a video

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
it feels better

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
talking to a real person

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
ok, thank you

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
to put it simply

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm a lawyer

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
a lawyer from Taiwan

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
but I'm interested in public safety law

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
so I chose this topic

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
it's 6.20pm

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
it's 6.20pm

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
it's quite simple

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
my presentation will be divided into 3 parts

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
introduction

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
background

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
why we chose sugar

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
why we chose soda

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
and public safety intervention

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
and public safety intervention

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
second

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
case study

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
one of my research point

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
is the case of soda tax

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
last

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I want to talk about

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
soda tax

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Caltech is in LA

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Caltech is in LA

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
so if there are

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
students from San Francisco

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
or Berkeley

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
they are

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
in the area of soda tax

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
because there's soda tax in the city

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
it might feel better

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
but it's a trend

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
cities are moving towards it

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
so maybe

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
you will have the same problem

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I talked to LA

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
public safety

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
officer

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
it might not happen in a short time

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
but it's a trend

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
anyway

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
you can listen to

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
their opinions

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
after listening

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
there's pros and cons

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
you can discuss

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
ok

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
sorry

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I want to ask

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
what is the concept of soda tax

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
in California

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
California

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
California

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
California

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
California

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
city

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
city

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
city tax

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
city tax

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
city tax

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
city tax

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
city tax

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
city tax

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
city tax

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
city tax

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
city tax

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
city tax

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
city tax

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
city tax

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
city tax

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
city tax

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
city tax

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
city tax

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
city tax

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
city tax

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
city tax

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
city tax

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
city tax

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
city tax

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
city tax

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
city tax

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
city tax

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
city tax

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
city tax

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
city tax

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
city tax

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
city tax

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
city tax

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
I don't know if you will talk about it later

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I just want to ask

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Does the tax cover the range of hand-shaken drinks?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Like bubble tea

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
like bubble tea

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
For now

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
For now

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
This is a good question

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Because most of it

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Most of the tax

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Is based on that

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
The finished product of the drink

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
To tax

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
But

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
If it's a freshly made drink

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Freshly squeezed juice or freshly brewed

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
If it includes

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It doesn't look like it, but I can

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I think it depends on the definition

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It doesn't include

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
But I can check again

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
This is a good question

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Especially in Taiwan

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
If you want to pass

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Does this hand-shaken drink include

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I don't think it's in the definition

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But I can help you confirm this

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Thank you

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Okay

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Let's cut it into three parts

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
To discuss

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I'll do the introduction part first

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Okay

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I want to tell you

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Why did we choose sugar?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Why did we choose soda?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
This is a trend in the world

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
You may have noticed

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
You may not have noticed

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
But if you use Google

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Use Google as a keyword

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Search

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
This is what I did

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Yesterday

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
You can see

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
The anti-sugar fad

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Is now a trend

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Bloomberg

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
The anti-sugar fad

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Has become a trend

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Has become a trend

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It's a trend

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It's a trend

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
This is

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
For those who are not in New York

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
For those who are not in New York

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
This week

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
There is a company called

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Kind

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Kind

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000

16:56.500 --> 16:58.500
FDA

16:58.500 --> 17:00.500
FDA

17:00.500 --> 17:02.500
FDA

17:02.500 --> 17:04.500
FDA

17:04.500 --> 17:06.500
FDA

17:06.500 --> 17:08.500
FDA

17:08.500 --> 17:10.500
FDA

17:10.500 --> 17:12.500
FDA

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
FDA

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
FDA

17:16.500 --> 17:18.500
FDA

17:18.500 --> 17:20.500
FDA

17:20.500 --> 17:22.500
FDA

17:22.500 --> 17:24.500
FDA

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
FDA

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
FDA

17:28.500 --> 17:30.500
FDA

17:30.500 --> 17:32.500
FDA

17:32.500 --> 17:34.500
FDA

17:34.500 --> 17:36.500
FDA

17:36.500 --> 18:04.500
Coca-Cola, Pepsi and others agree to keep sugar in the drink in Singapore

18:04.500 --> 18:06.500
I have a question

18:06.500 --> 18:08.500
I think there's a catch

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
For example, Pepsi

18:10.500 --> 18:12.500
They don't want to reduce their sales

18:12.500 --> 18:14.500
Coca-Cola as well

18:14.500 --> 18:16.500
So they said reducing sugar

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
Is it really reducing sugar?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.500
And then change it into other sugar-containing types

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
Or do they have any strategies to change their ingredients and taste, etc.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.500
Or do they just want to keep it as it is?

18:24.500 --> 18:26.500
Or do they want to keep it as it is?

18:26.500 --> 18:40.500
Or do they just want to keep it as it is?

18:40.500 --> 18:45.500
In fact, the regulation of sugar in the sugar drink

18:45.500 --> 18:50.500
Has included artificial sugar

18:50.500 --> 18:52.500
So some parts have

18:52.500 --> 18:54.500
Like Diacok

18:54.500 --> 18:58.500
Some tags have included it

18:58.500 --> 19:00.500
So it's included

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
Of course, some cities don't have it

19:02.500 --> 19:04.500
So this is also a controversial point

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
Whether artificial sugar is included

19:06.500 --> 19:08.500
I think the question is good

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
Because if you look at the sales

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
If you look at the sales

19:12.500 --> 19:14.500
Now the consumer's preference is

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
Reduce sugar in some drinks

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
I think the manufacturers naturally develop this kind of thing

19:18.500 --> 19:20.500
I am following up

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
I think

19:22.500 --> 19:24.500
Even our school cafeteria

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
I think

19:26.500 --> 19:28.500
At least this half year

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
They sell sparkling water

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
And even the one with favor

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
The proportion of sparkling water is rising

19:34.500 --> 19:36.500
And then the proportion of traditional sugar-containing drinks

19:36.500 --> 19:38.500
Then I think this

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
According to some reports, this is a trend

19:40.500 --> 19:42.500
So for Coca-Cola

19:42.500 --> 19:44.500
In fact, Coca-Cola and Pepsi

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
There are actually a lot of drinks

19:46.500 --> 19:48.500
It can actually

19:48.500 --> 19:50.500
Adjust its proportion

19:50.500 --> 19:52.500
Or adjust the amount of each product

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
It can still

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
Find a way to maintain a certain profit

19:56.500 --> 19:58.500
As a manufacturer

19:58.500 --> 20:00.500
It has a lot of strategies that can be applied

20:00.500 --> 20:02.500
I think it should

20:02.500 --> 20:04.500
Indeed reduce the amount of Coca-Cola

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
Or it may launch more

20:06.500 --> 20:08.500
Like it now has this

20:08.500 --> 20:10.500
Different types of Coca-Cola

20:10.500 --> 20:12.500
Then do it like this

20:12.500 --> 20:14.500
The proper distribution is

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
I don't know if I answered your question

20:18.500 --> 20:20.500
Yes, thank you

20:20.500 --> 20:22.500
OK, you're welcome

20:22.500 --> 20:24.500
Ok

20:24.500 --> 20:26.500
We have seen this international trend

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
Basically for sugar

20:28.500 --> 20:30.500
For sugar-containing drinks

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
The next question is to ask

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
Why

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
Why do we want to fight this

20:36.500 --> 20:38.500
Sugar-containing and sugar-containing drinks

20:38.500 --> 20:40.500
What is the reason behind this

20:40.500 --> 20:42.500
The main reason behind the reason is

20:42.500 --> 20:44.500
Of course the health part

20:46.500 --> 20:48.500
In fact, sugar-containing drinks

20:48.500 --> 20:50.500
The two main issues

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
One is that traditionally

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
Everyone thinks of it as a tooth

20:54.500 --> 20:56.500
This is one of the issues

20:56.500 --> 20:58.500
But let's leave the tooth

20:58.500 --> 21:00.500
The most important part here is obesity

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
What is the problem with obesity

21:02.500 --> 21:04.500
Because of obesity

21:04.500 --> 21:06.500
I use this picture

21:06.500 --> 21:08.500
In fact

21:08.500 --> 21:10.500
There are several factors that cause obesity

21:10.500 --> 21:12.500
Probably sitting in front of the computer

21:12.500 --> 21:14.500
Like we don't move

21:14.500 --> 21:16.500
Inactive

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
This may cause obesity

21:18.500 --> 21:20.500
Lack of exercise

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
Another one is diet

21:22.500 --> 21:24.500
The ratio of the amount you eat

21:24.500 --> 21:26.500
What kind of food

21:26.500 --> 21:28.500
Then it will lead to obesity

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
What is the problem with obesity

21:30.500 --> 21:32.500
The following is what most people are talking about

21:32.500 --> 21:34.500
NCD

21:34.500 --> 21:36.500
Non-Communicable Disease

21:36.500 --> 21:38.500
In Chinese, it can be translated as chronic disease

21:38.500 --> 21:40.500
There are four main types of chronic diseases

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
The first one on the left is cardiovascular disease

21:44.500 --> 21:46.500
Heart disease

21:46.500 --> 21:48.500
High blood pressure

21:48.500 --> 21:50.500
The second one

21:50.500 --> 21:52.500
It's about blood flow

21:52.500 --> 21:54.500
Diabetes

21:54.500 --> 21:56.500
The second one is respiratory disease

21:56.500 --> 21:58.500
The last one is cancer

21:58.500 --> 22:00.500
Obesity

22:00.500 --> 22:02.500
It will lead to cardiovascular disease

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
Diabetes

22:04.500 --> 22:06.500
Risk factors for cancer

22:06.500 --> 22:08.500
Risk factors for cancer

22:08.500 --> 22:10.500
Even

22:10.500 --> 22:12.500
Leading to chronic disease

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
Especially diabetes

22:14.500 --> 22:16.500
Related to obesity

22:16.500 --> 22:18.500
One of the strongest

22:18.500 --> 22:20.500
OK

22:20.500 --> 22:22.500
What is the problem with obesity

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
OK

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
The main problem with obesity

22:26.500 --> 22:28.500
In fact, it is very realistic

22:28.500 --> 22:30.500
In addition to causing patients to suffer from this disease

22:30.500 --> 22:32.500
The main thing is for family care

22:32.500 --> 22:34.500
Because this is a chronic disease

22:34.500 --> 22:36.500
In addition to our whole society

22:36.500 --> 22:38.500
If it's really related to everyone

22:38.500 --> 22:40.500
The main thing is the increase in medical expenses

22:40.500 --> 22:42.500
It's realistic, whether it's the United States or Taiwan

22:42.500 --> 22:44.500
This chronic disease

22:44.500 --> 22:46.500
In fact, because it takes a long time

22:46.500 --> 22:48.500
Medical costs

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
The cost of care is very considerable

22:50.500 --> 22:52.500
In Taiwan, I can give an example

22:52.500 --> 22:54.500
Our annual budget for health insurance

22:54.500 --> 22:56.500
The cost is about 600 billion

22:56.500 --> 22:58.500
10% of it

22:58.500 --> 23:00.500
Is used to

23:00.500 --> 23:02.500
Diabetes patients

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
So the annual cost of health insurance

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
At least 60 billion is used for diabetes

23:06.500 --> 23:08.500
Diabetes

23:08.500 --> 23:10.500
Of course, there are many reasons for diabetes in Taiwan

23:10.500 --> 23:12.500
Maybe everyone knows

23:12.500 --> 23:14.500
Food with problems

23:14.500 --> 23:16.500
Detergent, pollution, etc.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.500
But diabetes

23:18.500 --> 23:20.500
The cost of diabetes is so high

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
This is a very direct reason

23:22.500 --> 23:24.500
So for each country

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
If you can control obesity

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
Can control

23:28.500 --> 23:30.500
Can greatly reduce these chronic diseases

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
Relatively reduce medical costs

23:32.500 --> 23:34.500
Why are we looking for this

23:34.500 --> 23:36.500
Sugar-free drinks

23:36.500 --> 23:38.500
Everyone is studying science

23:38.500 --> 23:40.500
This is probably a national high school

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
Natural science or chemistry

23:42.500 --> 23:44.500
I mentioned the dissolution of sugar

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
200 grams of sugar

23:46.500 --> 23:48.500
Can be dissolved in 100ml of water

23:48.500 --> 23:50.500
At room temperature

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
About this

23:52.500 --> 23:54.500
The picture on the left is also provided by netizens

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
Actually

23:56.500 --> 23:58.500
I was very surprised when I first saw it

23:58.500 --> 24:00.500
It's like Coca-Cola

24:00.500 --> 24:02.500
The smallest 350ml

24:02.500 --> 24:04.500
There is a sugar content of about 9 to 10 grams

24:04.500 --> 24:06.500
You can see

24:06.500 --> 24:08.500
The more

24:08.500 --> 24:10.500
This

24:10.500 --> 24:12.500
Or this

24:12.500 --> 24:14.500
Lemonade or some juice

24:14.500 --> 24:16.500
Ice tea, etc.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.500
If you drink a big can of cola

24:18.500 --> 24:20.500
You eat so much sugar

24:20.500 --> 24:22.500
Actually

24:22.500 --> 24:24.500
If you don't drink drinks

24:24.500 --> 24:26.500
You won't be crazy

24:26.500 --> 24:28.500
Eat a bunch of sugar

24:28.500 --> 24:30.500
But in the drink

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
It's a liquid

24:32.500 --> 24:34.500
It's easy to take too much at once

24:34.500 --> 24:36.500
More than

24:36.500 --> 24:38.500
Everyone should take an average of

24:38.500 --> 24:40.500
More than ten times

24:40.500 --> 24:42.500
This is why

24:42.500 --> 24:44.500
Why

24:44.500 --> 24:46.500
Hello

24:46.500 --> 24:48.500
I have a small question

24:48.500 --> 24:50.500
About this picture

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
The cola on it

24:52.500 --> 24:54.500
And the red cow

24:54.500 --> 24:56.500
Mountain Dew

24:56.500 --> 24:58.500
It's all man-made

24:58.500 --> 25:00.500
So I can understand that sugar is added by people

25:00.500 --> 25:02.500
But for example, the juice below

25:02.500 --> 25:04.500
The meaning of those sugar cubes

25:04.500 --> 25:06.500
Except for him

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
After extracting the juice

25:08.500 --> 25:10.500
After extraction

25:10.500 --> 25:12.500
Added so many sugar cubes

25:12.500 --> 25:14.500
That means

25:14.500 --> 25:16.500
There are so many sugar in that drink

25:16.500 --> 25:18.500
Including natural and

25:18.500 --> 25:20.500
The total amount of sugar

25:20.500 --> 25:22.500
You asked a very good question

25:22.500 --> 25:24.500
This is also

25:24.500 --> 25:26.500
This is also the United States

25:26.500 --> 25:28.500
I will talk about the FDA later

25:28.500 --> 25:30.500
In the new nutrition fact

25:30.500 --> 25:32.500
To make a distinction

25:32.500 --> 25:34.500
Is it this added sugar

25:34.500 --> 25:36.500
Or the sugar it already has

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
It lists two different things

25:38.500 --> 25:40.500
I believe the list here

25:40.500 --> 25:42.500
Basically all included

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
Is the original sugar

25:44.500 --> 25:46.500
Plus sugar

25:46.500 --> 25:48.500
But in fact

25:48.500 --> 25:50.500
In addition to the original

25:50.500 --> 25:52.500
If you look at the new nutrition fact

25:52.500 --> 25:54.500
It's still much more than natural

25:54.500 --> 25:56.500
In other words

25:56.500 --> 25:58.500
Real fruit sugar

25:58.500 --> 26:00.500
Compared to the drink

26:00.500 --> 26:02.500
To make you drink

26:02.500 --> 26:04.500
It's actually artificially added

26:04.500 --> 26:06.500
The ratio is much higher

26:06.500 --> 26:08.500
This is also his terrible place

26:08.500 --> 26:10.500
If the real lemonade comes out

26:10.500 --> 26:12.500
May be too sour

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
So you will attract everyone to drink

26:14.500 --> 26:16.500
He added a lot of sugar

26:16.500 --> 26:18.500
This is also what I will slowly introduce

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
Please say

26:20.500 --> 26:22.500
I think Zhang Yong just asked

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
The question is very interesting

26:24.500 --> 26:26.500
And let me think of another question

26:26.500 --> 26:28.500
But before you ask me a question

26:28.500 --> 26:30.500
Let me talk about this video first

26:30.500 --> 26:32.500
I think the two below

26:32.500 --> 26:34.500
Although it looks like juice

26:34.500 --> 26:36.500
But the two of them should not be natural

26:36.500 --> 26:38.500
So this question

26:38.500 --> 26:40.500
In these six specific cases

26:40.500 --> 26:42.500
Should not be established

26:42.500 --> 26:44.500
Because if you go to buy that drink

26:44.500 --> 26:46.500
You buy that lemonade

26:46.500 --> 26:48.500
It says on it

26:48.500 --> 26:50.500
How much is the real juice

26:50.500 --> 26:52.500
Very exaggerated

26:52.500 --> 26:54.500
So that's actually artificial

26:54.500 --> 26:56.500
But suppose we can find one today

26:56.500 --> 26:58.500
Find a juice

26:58.500 --> 27:00.500
For example, fresh juice

27:00.500 --> 27:02.500
In addition to the ingredients

27:02.500 --> 27:04.500
The difference in the amount of sugar

27:04.500 --> 27:06.500
In addition to the difference in the amount of sugar

27:06.500 --> 27:08.500
Will there be some differences in the type of sugar

27:08.500 --> 27:10.500
Because I always hear people say

27:10.500 --> 27:12.500
Because I don't study chemistry

27:12.500 --> 27:14.500
But I always hear people say that refined sugar

27:14.500 --> 27:16.500
With natural sugar in fruit

27:16.500 --> 27:18.500
Is actually a different thing

27:18.500 --> 27:20.500
This thing

27:20.500 --> 27:22.500
Is it considered

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
At the time of the law

27:26.500 --> 27:28.500
In the data I checked

27:28.500 --> 27:30.500
In terms of reality

27:30.500 --> 27:32.500
These sugar powder artificial sugar and natural sugar

27:32.500 --> 27:34.500
Is there a difference in the risk to the human body

27:34.500 --> 27:36.500
Is there a difference in the risk to the human body

27:36.500 --> 27:38.500
Is there a difference in the risk to the human body

27:38.500 --> 27:40.500
Everyone thinks there may be

27:40.500 --> 27:42.500
Even some people make some distinctions

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
Which is safer and which is not dangerous

27:44.500 --> 27:46.500
Like some artificial sugar

27:46.500 --> 27:48.500
Actually extracted from a plant

27:48.500 --> 27:50.500
Some are chemically synthesized

27:50.500 --> 27:52.500
The situation is not the same

27:52.500 --> 27:54.500
But these data

27:54.500 --> 27:56.500
There is no overwhelming evidence

27:56.500 --> 27:58.500
Can prove which is dangerous

27:58.500 --> 28:00.500
Which is safer

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
But we believe

28:02.500 --> 28:04.500
But we believe

28:04.500 --> 28:06.500
Indeed these sugar powder is different

28:06.500 --> 28:08.500
May have different effects

28:08.500 --> 28:10.500
But so far

28:10.500 --> 28:12.500
Scientific evidence

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
As far as I know

28:14.500 --> 28:16.500
Of course because I'm not a scientist

28:16.500 --> 28:18.500
The data I see

28:18.500 --> 28:20.500
It's not really clear

28:20.500 --> 28:22.500
Which is dangerous

28:22.500 --> 28:24.500
Which is safe

28:24.500 --> 28:26.500
Because it brings

28:26.500 --> 28:28.500
The main part is the heat

28:28.500 --> 28:30.500
This fat

28:30.500 --> 28:32.500
This fat itself is a risk

28:32.500 --> 28:34.500
Risk to the human body

28:34.500 --> 28:36.500
What you said

28:36.500 --> 28:38.500
The other additional risk

28:38.500 --> 28:40.500
I think there may be

28:40.500 --> 28:42.500
But so far

28:42.500 --> 28:44.500
It's not clear which is the highest risk

28:44.500 --> 28:46.500
Even without considering

28:46.500 --> 28:48.500
High sugar content

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
This is a problem

28:50.500 --> 28:52.500
You said there may even be additional risks

28:52.500 --> 28:54.500
In addition to causing

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
In addition to causing

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
Some artificial sugar powder

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
There may be additional risks of cancer

29:00.500 --> 29:02.500
I heard people say this

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
But there is no accurate evidence

29:04.500 --> 29:06.500
To prove that it is dangerous

29:06.500 --> 29:08.500
So when you say sugar

29:08.500 --> 29:10.500
The word sugar

29:10.500 --> 29:12.500
In your presentation

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
It covers basically all

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
I don't know

29:16.500 --> 29:18.500
Maybe it's just

29:18.500 --> 29:20.500
Something that can produce sweetness

29:20.500 --> 29:22.500
Yes yes

29:22.500 --> 29:24.500
Basically like this

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
Even for this

29:26.500 --> 29:28.500
We are talking about

29:28.500 --> 29:30.500
Soda tax, sugary, sweetened

29:30.500 --> 29:32.500
Beverage tax

29:32.500 --> 29:34.500
Most of the laws

29:34.500 --> 29:36.500
Include these

29:36.500 --> 29:38.500
In addition to 100% natural juice

29:38.500 --> 29:40.500
Will be excluded

29:40.500 --> 29:42.500
As long as you add artificial

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
Whether it's sugar

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
Will be included

29:46.500 --> 29:48.500
In the tax law

29:48.500 --> 29:50.500
Most of the definitions are included

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
Unless you sell

29:52.500 --> 29:54.500
100% natural juice

29:54.500 --> 29:56.500
If you don't add anything else

29:56.500 --> 29:58.500
Otherwise you will be taxed

29:58.500 --> 30:00.500
In many cities

30:02.500 --> 30:04.500
This is also what I said in the first video

30:04.500 --> 30:06.500
Because

30:06.500 --> 30:08.500
Everyone calls it soda tax

30:08.500 --> 30:10.500
It's easy to say

30:10.500 --> 30:12.500
This is a water tax

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
Or this is a cola tax

30:14.500 --> 30:16.500
In fact, the more correct statement

30:16.500 --> 30:18.500
With their official words

30:18.500 --> 30:20.500
Sugary, sweetened, beverage

30:20.500 --> 30:22.500
Sugary, sweetened, beverage

30:22.500 --> 30:24.500
Sugary, sweetened, beverage tax

30:24.500 --> 30:26.500
So you see

30:26.500 --> 30:28.500
This is a simple chart

30:28.500 --> 30:30.500
Oh, I forgot to say

30:30.500 --> 30:32.500
Disclaimer

30:32.500 --> 30:34.500
Many of these charts

30:34.500 --> 30:36.500
Are not my original

30:36.500 --> 30:38.500
I found it on the Internet

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
Because I don't have time

30:40.500 --> 30:42.500
To add the source

30:42.500 --> 30:44.500
Some are in my notes

30:44.500 --> 30:46.500
So this is a special statement

30:46.500 --> 30:48.500
But this is not my theory

30:48.500 --> 30:50.500
I will add it

30:50.500 --> 30:52.500
When the video is finished

30:52.500 --> 30:54.500
Because this is left

30:54.500 --> 30:56.500
For our private academic use

30:56.500 --> 30:58.500
So it is recommended to use it

30:58.500 --> 31:00.500
So you can see

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
Energy drink

31:02.500 --> 31:04.500
Red Bull, vitamin water

31:04.500 --> 31:06.500
Sports drink

31:06.500 --> 31:08.500
Gel powder

31:08.500 --> 31:10.500
We often drink sports drinks

31:10.500 --> 31:12.500
This is actually a lot of sugar

31:12.500 --> 31:14.500
Even juice

31:14.500 --> 31:16.500
A lot of juice sold on the market

31:16.500 --> 31:18.500
It is not 100% natural juice

31:18.500 --> 31:20.500
It may be naturally concentrated

31:20.500 --> 31:22.500
Then restore

31:22.500 --> 31:24.500
Add a lot of artificial flavors

31:24.500 --> 31:26.500
Colors and so on

31:26.500 --> 31:28.500
So just like the classmate said

31:28.500 --> 31:30.500
It is actually artificial juice

31:30.500 --> 31:32.500
Even including

31:32.500 --> 31:34.500
Ice tea

31:34.500 --> 31:36.500
Ice coffee

31:36.500 --> 31:38.500
It actually adds

31:38.500 --> 31:40.500
The sugar content is also very high

31:40.500 --> 31:42.500
Like we just saw

31:42.500 --> 31:44.500
Peach ice tea

31:44.500 --> 31:46.500
7 tablespoons

31:46.500 --> 31:48.500
Sugar

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
In fact, it is the same as Coca-Cola

31:50.500 --> 31:52.500
So these are all within the scope

31:52.500 --> 31:54.500
To be taxed

31:54.500 --> 31:56.500
Ok

31:56.500 --> 31:58.500
Then we have seen

31:58.500 --> 32:00.500
It was mentioned in the introduction

32:00.500 --> 32:02.500
Sugar and

32:02.500 --> 32:04.500
Soda are our target

32:04.500 --> 32:06.500
Because it will create fat

32:06.500 --> 32:08.500
Fat is what we want to avoid

32:08.500 --> 32:10.500
A major danger factor for leprosy

32:10.500 --> 32:12.500
Then next

32:12.500 --> 32:14.500
How to avoid

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
Intervention

32:26.500 --> 32:28.500
This is a picture on the Internet

32:28.500 --> 32:30.500
Including

32:30.500 --> 32:32.500
U.S. sugar consumption

32:32.500 --> 32:34.500
You can see a very obvious trend

32:34.500 --> 32:36.500
Almost a linear trend

32:38.500 --> 32:40.500
From 1822 to 2005

32:40.500 --> 32:42.500
The consumption of sugar

32:42.500 --> 32:44.500
Has been rising

33:04.500 --> 33:06.500
This is what I want to talk about

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
From the point of view of the law

33:08.500 --> 33:10.500
The government's intervention measures

33:10.500 --> 33:12.500
Can be divided into four categories

33:14.500 --> 33:16.500
The first is the so-called complete ban

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
As you are familiar with

33:18.500 --> 33:20.500
I use the picture of this drug

33:20.500 --> 33:22.500
For this drug

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
The government's way is to ban

33:24.500 --> 33:26.500
Even with criminal law

33:26.500 --> 33:28.500
Basically can't hold

33:28.500 --> 33:30.500
Can't sell, can't make

33:30.500 --> 33:32.500
Can't use such a thing

33:32.500 --> 33:34.500
This is the law

33:34.500 --> 33:36.500
Even in terms of drugs

33:36.500 --> 33:38.500
This kind of ban

33:38.500 --> 33:40.500
For example, we just talked about drugs

33:40.500 --> 33:42.500
In fact, there are different levels of drugs

33:42.500 --> 33:44.500
It may not be the same in all countries

33:44.500 --> 33:46.500
I don't know what's going on in your city

33:46.500 --> 33:48.500
But at least in Washington D.C.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.500
A while ago, it was a hot topic

33:50.500 --> 33:52.500
Legalization of drugs

33:52.500 --> 33:54.500
Basically you are here

33:54.500 --> 33:56.500
It's not a crime

33:56.500 --> 33:58.500
But in Taiwan

33:58.500 --> 34:00.500
Drugs are the second level of drugs

34:00.500 --> 34:02.500
Same thing

34:02.500 --> 34:04.500
So the first level

34:04.500 --> 34:06.500
Of course the first level is the most serious

34:06.500 --> 34:08.500
But the second level

34:08.500 --> 34:10.500
In fact, the relevant criminal law is also quite serious

34:10.500 --> 34:12.500
When I was a lawyer in Taiwan

34:12.500 --> 34:14.500
I just witnessed

34:14.500 --> 34:16.500
Especially foreigners

34:16.500 --> 34:18.500
The case of using marijuana in Taiwan

34:18.500 --> 34:20.500
Of course they all want to advocate

34:20.500 --> 34:22.500
In our country, marijuana is legal

34:22.500 --> 34:24.500
Some even say that he went to the Netherlands to use

34:24.500 --> 34:26.500
Then returned to Taiwan

34:26.500 --> 34:28.500
It was detected that there was marijuana

34:28.500 --> 34:30.500
Anyway, we can see

34:30.500 --> 34:32.500
This is the first way

34:32.500 --> 34:34.500
Then use criminal law to regulate

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
The second example

34:36.500 --> 34:38.500
I said it was a mode

34:38.500 --> 34:40.500
I said it was a restriction

34:40.500 --> 34:42.500
This is also easy to understand

34:42.500 --> 34:44.500
I use cigarettes and alcohol

34:44.500 --> 34:46.500
Everyone is familiar

34:46.500 --> 34:48.500
The government can regulate

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
You can only buy cigarettes or alcohol at the age of 18 or 21

34:50.500 --> 34:52.500
Even the purchase of cigarettes and alcohol

34:52.500 --> 34:54.500
Restrictions

34:54.500 --> 34:56.500
I don't know how you are in the city

34:56.500 --> 34:58.500
Like where I live

34:58.500 --> 35:00.500
It's actually Maryland

35:00.500 --> 35:02.500
I don't sell alcohol in the city

35:02.500 --> 35:04.500
Basically, you have to buy alcohol

35:04.500 --> 35:06.500
Go to the liquor store

35:06.500 --> 35:08.500
It's basically using that way

35:08.500 --> 35:10.500
Make you feel less convenient

35:10.500 --> 35:12.500
You want to go shopping

35:12.500 --> 35:14.500
By the way, bring a bottle of beer back

35:14.500 --> 35:16.500
It's quite difficult

35:16.500 --> 35:18.500
You need to drive to the store to buy

35:18.500 --> 35:20.500
Sometimes you think it's troublesome

35:20.500 --> 35:22.500
Reduce your drinking capacity

35:22.500 --> 35:24.500
Even for the behavior after use

35:24.500 --> 35:26.500
For example, you can't drive after drinking

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
Can't drive a plane

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
Can't drive a bus

35:30.500 --> 35:32.500
Restricted

35:32.500 --> 35:34.500
For example, cigarettes and alcohol

35:34.500 --> 35:36.500
The third one is more interesting

35:36.500 --> 35:38.500
I call it Nudge

35:38.500 --> 35:40.500
Why talk about this

35:40.500 --> 35:42.500
I don't know if everyone has heard of Nudge

35:42.500 --> 35:44.500
This is actually

35:44.500 --> 35:46.500
I use this picture

35:46.500 --> 35:48.500
It's actually a book cover

35:48.500 --> 35:50.500
It is almost

35:50.500 --> 35:52.500
One of the most famous law professors in the United States

35:52.500 --> 35:54.500
He is

35:54.500 --> 35:56.500
Case Sunstein

35:56.500 --> 35:58.500
He has been to Taiwan

35:58.500 --> 36:00.500
He advocated

36:00.500 --> 36:02.500
Nudge

36:02.500 --> 36:04.500
Nudge is actually not a novel

36:06.500 --> 36:08.500
It's not worth it

36:08.500 --> 36:10.500
He basically said

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
Use information to provide

36:12.500 --> 36:14.500
Environmental settings or speech

36:14.500 --> 36:16.500
To affect human behavior

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
The most famous example in his book

36:18.500 --> 36:20.500
The manager in the cafeteria

36:20.500 --> 36:22.500
As long as he changes the position of the vegetables

36:22.500 --> 36:24.500
Will affect the amount of vegetables

36:24.500 --> 36:26.500
The amount of vegetables for children

36:26.500 --> 36:28.500
In other words, if he moves it

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
To the front, the middle, where everyone sees it

36:30.500 --> 36:32.500
I saw it at the beginning

36:32.500 --> 36:34.500
It's easy for everyone to take more vegetables

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
I hate vegetables

36:36.500 --> 36:38.500
Anyway, the first time you see it, you will take it

36:38.500 --> 36:40.500
Will affect the amount

36:40.500 --> 36:42.500
This is actually not so much

36:42.500 --> 36:44.500
Because in fact

36:44.500 --> 36:46.500
All department stores, supermarkets

36:46.500 --> 36:48.500
Even the bookstore boss knows

36:48.500 --> 36:50.500
He wants to sell the most

36:50.500 --> 36:52.500
Put it in the best position

36:52.500 --> 36:54.500
But this mentioned

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
This is a bit

36:56.500 --> 36:58.500
I use information to provide

36:58.500 --> 37:00.500
Use position settings to change human behavior

37:00.500 --> 37:02.500
Unknowingly change human behavior

37:02.500 --> 37:04.500
But basically this is not really forced

37:04.500 --> 37:06.500
This is to let the parties

37:06.500 --> 37:08.500
Make decisions with their own free will

37:08.500 --> 37:10.500
It's just that his so-called free will

37:10.500 --> 37:12.500
Unknowingly received some of my default settings

37:12.500 --> 37:14.500
Or some of these

37:14.500 --> 37:16.500
Position settings

37:16.500 --> 37:18.500
Information provided

37:18.500 --> 37:20.500
Affects your own decisions

37:20.500 --> 37:22.500
This is the third mode

37:22.500 --> 37:24.500
I call it light push

37:24.500 --> 37:26.500
The fourth is actually

37:26.500 --> 37:28.500
Basically the government does not care

37:28.500 --> 37:30.500
Just open

37:30.500 --> 37:32.500
Fully provided by the market mechanism

37:32.500 --> 37:34.500
Like Taiwan

37:34.500 --> 37:36.500
If it is Taiwan's

37:36.500 --> 37:38.500
Just mentioned this

37:38.500 --> 37:40.500
Or these sugar

37:40.500 --> 37:42.500
There is no control at the moment

37:42.500 --> 37:44.500
You can add as much sugar as you want

37:44.500 --> 37:46.500
But it's possible because everyone is afraid of getting fat

37:46.500 --> 37:48.500
So the habit is to say less sugar, micro sugar, no sugar, etc.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.500
The government basically does not interfere

37:50.500 --> 37:52.500
So there may be

37:52.500 --> 37:54.500
These four modes

37:54.500 --> 37:56.500
These four modes

37:56.500 --> 37:58.500
Can actually be used

37:58.500 --> 38:00.500
For sugar-free drinks

38:00.500 --> 38:02.500
We want to reduce everyone's intake

38:02.500 --> 38:04.500
To achieve this

38:04.500 --> 38:06.500
Reduce fat

38:06.500 --> 38:08.500
That

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
That

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
Sugar is of course not difficult to understand

38:12.500 --> 38:14.500
The first one is of course not difficult to understand

38:14.500 --> 38:16.500
Or we will ban it

38:16.500 --> 38:18.500
Just mentioned

38:18.500 --> 38:20.500
Artificially added sugar

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
Even artificial sugar

38:22.500 --> 38:24.500
We can ban it

38:24.500 --> 38:26.500
Like anti-fat

38:26.500 --> 38:28.500
The fourth is also not difficult to understand

38:28.500 --> 38:30.500
Just open

38:30.500 --> 38:32.500
Basically the current situation

38:32.500 --> 38:34.500
Taiwan's situation is that sugar is not in charge

38:34.500 --> 38:36.500
In fact

38:36.500 --> 38:38.500
The more interesting thing is actually the second

38:38.500 --> 38:40.500
The so-called restrictions and the third light push

38:40.500 --> 38:42.500
The second restriction is actually like the example of Singapore

38:42.500 --> 38:44.500
They set 12% sugar content

38:44.500 --> 38:46.500
In fact, there are restrictions in the United States

38:46.500 --> 38:48.500
That is to say

38:48.500 --> 38:50.500
Many school vending machines

38:50.500 --> 38:52.500
Are not allowed to sell some sugar-free drinks

38:52.500 --> 38:54.500
He uses this place restriction

38:54.500 --> 38:56.500
Especially for elementary school students, middle school students, etc.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.500
Restrict their access to sugar-free drinks

38:58.500 --> 39:00.500
This possibility, etc.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.500
This is also a restriction

39:02.500 --> 39:04.500
About restrictions

39:04.500 --> 39:06.500
I want to introduce a case

39:06.500 --> 39:08.500
We don't have any students studying in New York

39:08.500 --> 39:10.500
There used to be a mayor in New York

39:10.500 --> 39:12.500
His name is Michael Bloomberg

39:12.500 --> 39:14.500
He is the boss of Bloomberg

39:16.500 --> 39:18.500
He used to be the mayor of New York City

39:18.500 --> 39:20.500
From 2002 to 2013

39:22.500 --> 39:24.500
This person is a billionaire

39:24.500 --> 39:26.500
Very rich

39:26.500 --> 39:28.500
I remember he didn't know the news

39:28.500 --> 39:30.500
Often take money out to do things

39:30.500 --> 39:32.500
He is also famous for public health

39:32.500 --> 39:34.500
Very enthusiastic

39:34.500 --> 39:36.500
This may be related to his undergraduate degree

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
But anyway

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
He invested a lot in public health

39:40.500 --> 39:42.500
Bloomberg Foundation

39:42.500 --> 39:44.500
Sponsored a lot of public health research

39:48.500 --> 39:50.500
He is also very concerned about obesity in New York

39:52.500 --> 39:54.500
Even for sugar-free drinks

39:56.500 --> 39:58.500
He came up with a way

39:58.500 --> 40:00.500
One of the ways

40:00.500 --> 40:02.500
This is called

40:02.500 --> 40:04.500
Potion cap

40:04.500 --> 40:06.500
Simply put

40:06.500 --> 40:08.500
Restrict these vegetarian restaurants

40:08.500 --> 40:10.500
Can't sell large cups of drinks

40:10.500 --> 40:12.500
Restrict the amount of drinks

40:12.500 --> 40:14.500
The size of the cup

40:14.500 --> 40:16.500
Simply put, you can buy a small cup

40:16.500 --> 40:18.500
No matter how many cups you want

40:18.500 --> 40:20.500
But the restaurant can't put such a large cup

40:20.500 --> 40:22.500
Sell ​​a large cup of drinks

40:22.500 --> 40:24.500
Restrict the amount of a cup

40:28.500 --> 40:30.500
In 2012, he proposed this policy

40:32.500 --> 40:34.500
This policy

40:34.500 --> 40:36.500
Later died

40:36.500 --> 40:38.500
You can imagine

40:38.500 --> 40:40.500
When it was first launched

40:40.500 --> 40:42.500
Many people are very angry

40:42.500 --> 40:44.500
Restaurant owners are very angry

40:44.500 --> 40:46.500
Because selling drinks is making money

40:48.500 --> 40:50.500
The biggest in the United States

40:50.500 --> 40:52.500
American Beverage Association

40:52.500 --> 40:54.500
Very powerful

40:54.500 --> 40:56.500
They also pay

40:56.500 --> 40:58.500
Advertisement etc.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.500
One of the most famous

41:00.500 --> 41:02.500
I drew a picture

41:02.500 --> 41:04.500
He was laughed at

41:04.500 --> 41:06.500
Old mother

41:06.500 --> 41:08.500
Nanny

41:08.500 --> 41:10.500
We don't need a nanny

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
Tell us how much cola to drink

41:14.500 --> 41:16.500
This example and this picture

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
Too famous

41:18.500 --> 41:20.500
Discuss relevant issues

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
Even in New York

41:22.500 --> 41:24.500
People often talk about this

41:24.500 --> 41:26.500
Why did this thing die later?

41:26.500 --> 41:28.500
The interesting part of the United States

41:30.500 --> 41:32.500
The interesting part of the public service law

41:32.500 --> 41:34.500
They are using the method of litigation

41:34.500 --> 41:36.500
They filed a lawsuit

41:36.500 --> 41:38.500
Challenge New York

41:38.500 --> 41:40.500
Administration

41:40.500 --> 41:42.500
The court basically believes

41:42.500 --> 41:44.500
Bloomberg is not

41:44.500 --> 41:46.500
Use through their parliament

41:46.500 --> 41:48.500
New York City Parliament

41:48.500 --> 41:50.500
To restrict this portion through the law

41:50.500 --> 41:52.500
It is used in a similar administrative order

41:52.500 --> 41:54.500
To stipulate the portion of the restaurant

41:54.500 --> 41:56.500
The court believes that this should be

41:56.500 --> 41:58.500
The facts stipulated by the law

41:58.500 --> 42:00.500
You can't do it directly with administrative regulations

42:00.500 --> 42:02.500
New York City's law

42:02.500 --> 42:04.500
New York City's law

42:04.500 --> 42:06.500
So it was postponed

42:06.500 --> 42:08.500
Anyway

42:08.500 --> 42:10.500
The case was lost

42:10.500 --> 42:12.500
But he had tried this

42:12.500 --> 42:14.500
New York City

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
Is it possible to add soda tax?

42:16.500 --> 42:18.500
I have a plan in my research

42:18.500 --> 42:20.500
I will interview public officials in New York

42:20.500 --> 42:22.500
They are proposing

42:22.500 --> 42:24.500
It won't happen so soon

42:24.500 --> 42:26.500
But they have tried

42:26.500 --> 42:28.500
Use this portion

42:28.500 --> 42:30.500
Another case

42:30.500 --> 42:32.500
This is a British case

42:32.500 --> 42:34.500
If you have been to the UK

42:34.500 --> 42:36.500
They called

42:36.500 --> 42:38.500
Traffic light system

42:38.500 --> 42:40.500
You can see

42:40.500 --> 42:42.500
He listed several items

42:42.500 --> 42:44.500
Fat

42:44.500 --> 42:46.500
saturated fat

42:46.500 --> 42:48.500
And this

42:48.500 --> 42:50.500
Sugar and salt

42:50.500 --> 42:52.500
He used this traffic light

42:52.500 --> 42:54.500
If the product contains sugar

42:54.500 --> 42:56.500
Or salt

42:56.500 --> 42:58.500
Far more than one person

42:58.500 --> 43:00.500
You have to mark a red light

43:00.500 --> 43:02.500
Remind everyone

43:02.500 --> 43:04.500
If it is normal, use yellow light

43:04.500 --> 43:06.500
If it is safe, use green light

43:06.500 --> 43:08.500
So you can buy a product

43:08.500 --> 43:10.500
You can see

43:10.500 --> 43:12.500
It is marked in the front

43:14.500 --> 43:16.500
So this is what we just talked about

43:16.500 --> 43:18.500
Nudge

43:18.500 --> 43:20.500
Let consumers decide

43:20.500 --> 43:22.500
Do I want to buy this product

43:22.500 --> 43:24.500
But

43:24.500 --> 43:26.500
It is a pity

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
Since 2013

43:28.500 --> 43:30.500
This policy is voluntary

43:30.500 --> 43:32.500
It is not mandatory

43:32.500 --> 43:34.500
In the UK

43:34.500 --> 43:36.500
You can provide information to consumers

43:36.500 --> 43:38.500
But there is no law

43:38.500 --> 43:40.500
Next is the US

43:40.500 --> 43:42.500
Nutrition facts

43:42.500 --> 43:44.500
