0	2000	Can you see me now?
2000	4000	Ok
4000	6000	Can you see my screen now?
6000	8000	Yes?
8000	10000	Yes, yes, yes
10000	12000	I will turn off my camera
12000	14000	So it will be smoother
14000	16000	Ok
16000	18000	Let me tell you
18000	20000	There are two more people here
20000	22000	One is here
22000	24000	One is over there
24000	26000	The camera may not be able to see
26000	28000	There are three people here
28000	30000	If they have any questions
30000	32000	Don't be surprised if they are real people
34000	36000	Sorry
36000	38000	There were some microphone issues
38000	40000	That's why we are delaying
40000	42000	The topic I am going to talk about
42000	44000	looks a bit
44000	46000	difficult to understand
46000	48000	Functional connectivity and dynamics
48000	50000	and burn organization
50000	52000	In short
52000	54000	The main purpose of my research
54000	56000	is to look at the functional connections
56000	58000	between neural networks
58000	60000	The so-called functional connections
60000	62000	are the neural signals
62000	64000	generated by neurons
64000	66000	during activation
66000	68000	How these neural signals
68000	70000	are transmitted between different brains
70000	72000	This is the main thing
72000	74000	I am going to talk about today
74000	76000	I will divide it into two parts
76000	78000	The first part is introduction
78000	80000	Introduction is a general
80000	82000	background idea
82000	84000	If you are not a neurologist
84000	86000	You need to know something
86000	88000	to make it easier for us to explain
90000	92000	This is one of the main research
92000	94000	The second part is
94000	96000	the current message
96000	98000	It is about a
98000	100000	special project
100000	102000	The last part is all about that project
102000	104000	The first part is
104000	106000	a little bit
106000	108000	scientific
108000	110000	The second part is more about
110000	112000	that research
112000	114000	I have seen
114000	116000	the comments
116000	118000	Some people are just
118000	120000	talking about science
120000	122000	So I want to talk about
122000	124000	what is neuroscience
124000	126000	I have seen
126000	128000	on the internet
128000	130000	Neuroscience is a
130000	132000	comprehensive research
132000	134000	It includes chemistry,
134000	136000	medicine, physiology, medicine
136000	138000	even computer science and engineering
138000	140000	There are a lot of subjects
140000	142000	From the perspective of
142000	144000	modern neuroscience
144000	146000	There are
146000	148000	cells
148000	150000	and neurons
152000	154000	If you
154000	156000	enlarge the scale
156000	158000	There are cognitive science
158000	160000	and behavioral science
160000	162000	Finally, there is transfer medicine
162000	164000	It is to apply the research
164000	166000	in the lab to clinical
166000	168000	If you want to
168000	170000	There are micro scale,
170000	172000	mesoscale and macroscale
172000	174000	The last part is
174000	176000	about the research
176000	178000	The first part is
178000	180000	between neurons
180000	182000	The research topic is
182000	184000	between neurons
184000	186000	Let me correct
186000	188000	The first part is
188000	190000	about single neurons
190000	192000	The second part is
192000	194000	between neurons
194000	196000	The last part is
196000	198000	between neurons
198000	200000	The biggest part
200000	202000	is what I have done
202000	204000	At the same time
204000	206000	What I have done
206000	208000	will cover the last part
208000	210000	I will use
210000	212000	a simple sentence
212000	214000	It is about
214000	216000	neural connectivity
216000	218000	You will hear
218000	220000	functional connectivity
220000	222000	It is about
222000	224000	the connectivity
224000	226000	of neurons
226000	228000	There is another point
228000	230000	We want to see
230000	232000	the connection of
232000	234000	human behavior
234000	236000	For example,
236000	238000	their behavior
238000	240000	in clinical
240000	242000	or in cognitive science
244000	246000	I will talk about
246000	248000	functional connectivity later
248000	250000	I will talk about
250000	252000	functional connectivity later
252000	254000	Some people
254000	256000	have studied
256000	258000	psychology or
258000	260000	cognitive science
260000	262000	They have heard about
262000	264000	some theories
264000	266000	I will give you examples
266000	268000	The left one is
268000	270000	Localization
270000	272000	Scientists
272000	274000	are studying
274000	276000	brain function
276000	278000	or human behavior
278000	280000	They want to
280000	282000	find out which part of the brain
282000	284000	is responsible for which function
284000	286000	This is a result of
286000	288000	FMRI
288000	290000	You can see
290000	292000	the three colored areas
292000	294000	This means that
294000	296000	when the subject is doing something
296000	298000	the neurons in these three areas are active
298000	300000	This is a more
300000	302000	traditional theory
302000	304000	They think
304000	306000	they need to
306000	308000	classify
308000	310000	which part of the brain
310000	312000	is responsible for which function
312000	314000	Another one is called
314000	316000	Distributed Brain Network
316000	318000	These two schools
318000	320000	have been fighting for a long time
320000	322000	But recently
322000	324000	because of some new research methods
324000	326000	Most people think
326000	328000	this is more like the human brain we expect
328000	330000	In this new school
330000	332000	their focus
332000	334000	is not on studying
334000	336000	a single brain area
336000	338000	but on the functionalities of the brain areas
338000	340000	This yellow arrow
340000	342000	For example, this brain area
342000	344000	may send a message to this area
344000	346000	and this area
346000	348000	may send a message to this area
348000	350000	So the brain area
350000	352000	receives feedback
352000	354000	and sends the signal
354000	356000	to this area
356000	358000	The picture on the right
358000	360000	is more like what I am doing now
360000	362000	This is the so-called
362000	364000	Functional Connectivity
364000	366000	This is the so-called
366000	368000	Functional Connectivity
368000	370000	This is the so-called
370000	372000	Functional Connectivity
372000	374000	So how do we
374000	376000	study it?
376000	378000	How can we measure
378000	380000	the so-called Functional Connectivity?
380000	382000	In statistics
382000	384000	or basic definition
384000	386000	Functional Connectivity
386000	388000	is like
388000	390000	describing two brain areas
390000	392000	or two different areas
392000	394000	in the same area
394000	396000	For example,
396000	398000	the picture on the right
398000	400000	is a brain
400000	402000	Let's say there are three areas
402000	404000	we call region of interest
404000	406000	1, 2, 3, 3
406000	408000	The blue, red, and green lines
408000	410000	refer to
410000	412000	the time course
412000	414000	I am using the example of FMRI
414000	416000	This is the signal change
416000	418000	caused by the activation of neurons
418000	420000	This is the signal change
420000	422000	We use these signals
422000	424000	as the basic research
424000	426000	It's a bit like the ingredients
426000	428000	of cooking
428000	430000	After you get these things
430000	432000	you start to use different methods
432000	434000	to see the relationship between them
434000	436000	Of course, you don't have to use FMRI
436000	438000	You can use many different machines
438000	440000	For example, the EEG of the brain
440000	442000	or the MEG of the brain
442000	444000	But I am using FMRI
444000	446000	for my research
446000	448000	So any so-called Functional Connectivity
448000	450000	based on FMRI
450000	452000	We call it
452000	454000	time course or time series
454000	456000	We use this data to do the research
456000	458000	Let's say you have three areas
458000	460000	of interest
460000	462000	The first thing you need to do
462000	464000	is to extract their signals
464000	466000	Then
466000	468000	what you need to do is
468000	470000	to use different methods
470000	472000	to calculate the relationship
472000	474000	between two brain areas
474000	476000	The most common is
476000	478000	Pairwise Correlation
478000	480000	If you use Pairwise Correlation
480000	482000	you will see a lot of values
482000	484000	For example
484000	486000	This is the relationship
486000	488000	between RI2 and RI1
488000	490000	If they are positive
490000	492000	For example, this is
492000	494000	about 0.5
494000	496000	This means that
496000	498000	this area and this area
498000	500000	are connected
500000	502000	Don't look at the
502000	504000	diagonal one
504000	506000	It means that
506000	508000	they are connected
508000	510000	But this is not a normal situation
510000	512000	This is because we are calculating
512000	514000	So usually after we calculate
514000	516000	and get this evidence
516000	518000	We will force the diagonal line
518000	520000	to become 0
520000	522000	This is mainly
522000	524000	the way we use
524000	526000	Of course, in this part
526000	528000	you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation
528000	530000	Many people use different methods
530000	532000	For example, Partial Correlation
532000	534000	There are many ways to use
534000	536000	It doesn't mean which method is better
536000	538000	It depends on
538000	540000	what you want to observe
542000	544000	After that
544000	546000	After we get
546000	548000	this evidence
548000	550000	we will be curious
550000	552000	what we are going to do next
552000	554000	Many people
554000	556000	find a big problem
556000	558000	There are too many signals
558000	560000	and too much information
560000	562000	So
562000	564000	what I'm going to talk about next
564000	566000	is to use some new methods
566000	568000	so that you
568000	570000	can
570000	572000	report some data
572000	574000	to let everyone know
574000	576000	how different these numbers
576000	578000	represent the whole matrix
580000	582000	Wait a minute
582000	584000	Ok
584000	586000	So just now we have
586000	588000	got the evidence
588000	590000	What I'm going to talk about
590000	592000	today is
592000	594000	Graph Theory
594000	596000	and Dynamic Functional Connectivity
596000	598000	Sorry
598000	600000	Let me interrupt
600000	602000	Ok
602000	604000	I just want to tell you
604000	606000	If you have any questions
606000	608000	you can
608000	610000	put them in the chat
610000	612000	and I will
612000	614000	find the time to ask
614000	616000	Or if you have any questions
616000	618000	you can also ask
618000	620000	and I will answer
620000	622000	the questions
622000	624000	I can't see the chat
624000	626000	so I don't know what you are asking
626000	628000	If you have any questions
628000	630000	you can ask
630000	632000	Ok
632000	634000	Before we talk about Graph Theory
634000	636000	do you have any questions?
640000	642000	If not, let's continue
642000	644000	Here we have a little bit
644000	646000	of abstract
646000	648000	I will try my best
648000	650000	If you have any questions
650000	652000	we can continue later
652000	654000	If you have studied Maths
654000	656000	you will know that Graph Theory
656000	658000	is a part of Maths
658000	660000	Its purpose is
660000	662000	to describe the relationship
662000	664000	between two points
664000	666000	to describe the relationship
666000	668000	between two points
668000	670000	In Neuroscience
670000	672000	Graph Theory is a good tool
672000	674000	In Graph Theory
674000	676000	you can get a lot of different values
676000	678000	Each value
678000	680000	represents a feature of the network
680000	682000	For example
682000	684000	we will talk about
684000	686000	some different values later
686000	688000	Some values may represent
688000	690000	how well the signal is integrated
690000	692000	in the brain
692000	694000	or how well it is integrated
694000	696000	in a single system
696000	698000	So there will be some different messages
698000	700000	When you are doing
700000	702000	Graph Theory
702000	704000	there are two important things
704000	706000	that you must get
706000	708000	The first one is Node
708000	710000	The other one is Edge
710000	712000	Node is the region of interest
712000	714000	On the right side
714000	716000	this is the information
716000	718000	of the actual recipient
718000	720000	I have 36 RIs
720000	722000	so there are 36 brain areas
722000	724000	Usually we put the left brain area
724000	726000	in the front
726000	728000	and the right brain area
728000	730000	in the back
730000	732000	So this whole matrix
732000	734000	represents the relationship
734000	736000	between each of the 36 brain areas
736000	738000	The so-called edge
738000	740000	is the connectivity matrix
740000	742000	which is this
742000	744000	Usually we get this matrix
744000	746000	which is the one you saw before
746000	748000	which is the one you saw before
748000	750000	which is the one you saw before
750000	752000	which is the one you saw before
752000	754000	which is the one you saw before
754000	756000	The one above this threshold
756000	758000	we think it actually has a connection
758000	760000	The one below this threshold
760000	762000	we force it to become 0
762000	764000	we force it to become 0
764000	766000	We don't look at these connections
766000	768000	We think it is weaker
768000	770000	maybe because of some miscommunication
770000	772000	So with these two files
772000	774000	you can run Graph Theory
774000	776000	This is what we talked about
776000	778000	at the beginning
778000	780000	When you run Graph Theory
780000	782000	you can get a lot of different values
782000	784000	which represent a certain specialness on the Internet
784000	786000	With these values
786000	788000	you can get to know the Internet better
788000	790000	you can get to know the Internet better
790000	792000	and you can also report
792000	794000	the differences between different things
794000	796000	For example, there are two groups
796000	798000	One is patient and the other is normal person
798000	800000	and you get this matrix
800000	802000	but if you just show this matrix to everyone
802000	804000	and say that the patient's matrix looks like this
804000	806000	and the normal person's matrix looks like this
806000	808000	But this matrix has too much information
808000	810000	It's hard for you to
810000	812000	find out which side is wrong
812000	814000	or which side is different
814000	816000	So if you use graph theory
816000	818000	So if you use graph theory
818000	820000	you can report a number
820000	822000	For example, how good is the overall information of the brain
822000	824000	Then the number of patients may be lower
824000	826000	or the number of normal people will be higher
826000	828000	This is one of the benefits of using graph theory
828000	830000	This is one of the benefits of using graph theory
830000	832000	So below
832000	834000	This is an example
834000	836000	That is, what kind of value do we have?
836000	838000	That is, what kind of value do we have?
838000	840000	Here you can see different colors
840000	842000	Here you can see different colors
842000	844000	The green part is the so-called integration
844000	846000	The green part is the so-called integration
846000	848000	If you have this value
848000	850000	It represents integration
850000	852000	It means that the signal
852000	854000	How well is it integrated in the brain
854000	856000	How well is it integrated in the brain
856000	858000	Then the blue one
858000	860000	It's called segregation
860000	862000	It's a bit like two different things
862000	864000	It's a bit like two different things
864000	866000	It means that in a single system
866000	868000	It means that in a single system
868000	870000	In a single system
870000	872000	how good the information is integrated
872000	874000	because you can see
874000	876000	If this is a system
876000	878000	This is another system
878000	880000	So-called integration is the relationship between the system and the system
880000	882000	So-called integration is the relationship between the system and the system
882000	884000	The yellow one is called loco majors
884000	886000	The yellow one is called loco majors
886000	888000	If you have 100 RIs
888000	890000	If you have 100 RIs
890000	892000	Then you will have 100 numbers
892000	894000	Each number represents this characteristic RI
894000	896000	The red one is called centrality
896000	898000	The red one is called centrality
898000	900000	In short, this is the importance of this point
900000	902000	In short, this is the importance of this point
902000	904000	In short, this is the importance of this point
904000	906000	These two
906000	908000	They are the same
908000	910000	If you have wrong graph theory today
910000	912000	If you have wrong graph theory today
912000	914000	A matrix will have several different numbers
914000	916000	Suppose it has 36 RIs
916000	918000	Suppose it has 36 RIs
918000	920000	So, this half side
920000	922000	is a matrix, only one number
922000	924000	no matter how many RIs it has
924000	926000	no matter how many RIs it has
926000	928020	Also, there is a black one here, called Hubs
928020	928020	
928020	930040	Also, there is a black one here, called Hubs
930040	932040	as in the middle
932040	934040	In the end, there will fastly be one
934040	936040	About Hubs
936040	938040	In short, you can have a lot
938040	940040	It's a bit like
940040	942040	connecting different systems
942040	944040	For example, this is a system
944040	946040	Here is another system
946040	948040	You may find signals fromone system to another
948040	950040	You may find signals fromone system to another
950040	952040	So the importance of Hubs becomes very important
952040	954040	So the importance of Hubs becomes very important
954040	956040	Its role is like connecting different systems
956040	958040	There is a picture at the end
958040	960040	We will briefly introduce
960040	962040	the Hubs that are recognized so far
962040	964040	the Hubs that are recognized so far
964040	966040	Here is the graph theory part
966040	968040	Here is the graph theory part
968040	970040	Next, this is called Dynamic Functional Converting Team
970040	972040	Next, this is called Dynamic Functional Converting Team
972040	974040	This is a bit newer
974040	976040	This is about 5 or 6 years
976040	978040	This is about 5 or 6 years
978040	980040	It's been about 4 or 5 years
980040	982040	More people are researching
982040	984040	We have already mentioned that
984040	986040	You can get a reference
986040	988040	You can get a reference
988040	990040	This reference represents
990040	992040	the relationship between different RIs
992040	994040	the relationship between different RIs
994040	996040	In the early days
996040	998040	In the early days
998040	1000040	Because this reference
1000040	1002040	It's the same in time
1002040	1004040	It won't change
1004040	1006040	But with a new method
1006040	1008040	You will find that it is constantly changing
1008040	1010040	You will find that it is constantly changing
1010040	1012040	The brain is not a stable system
1012040	1014040	The brain is not a stable system
1014040	1016040	It keeps changing
1016040	1018040	It's called non-stationary
1018040	1020040	This functional connectivity pattern
1020040	1022040	This functional connectivity pattern
1022040	1024040	It continues to change
1024040	1026040	The time is about a few seconds to a few minutes
1026040	1028040	The time is about a few seconds to a few minutes
1028040	1030040	From 26 seconds to 86 seconds
1030040	1032040	From 26 seconds to 86 seconds
1032040	1034040	Its reference looks like this
1034040	1036040	From 26 seconds to 162 seconds
1036040	1038040	It will look different
1038040	1040040	This is more than 400 seconds
1040040	1042040	This is more than 400 seconds
1042040	1044040	If you don't care about the time difference
1044040	1046040	If you don't care about the time difference
1046040	1048040	If you have less than 5 minutes
1048040	1050040	If you have less than 5 minutes
1050040	1052040	This is the average time difference
1052040	1054040	It looks like this
1054040	1056040	But you can find that they are all different
1056040	1058040	In addition to the difference in time difference
1058040	1060040	If you use the wrong graph theory
1060040	1062040	You will find that there are many points
1062040	1064040	Originally there is a connection
1064040	1066040	But at a certain point in time
1066040	1068040	There is no connection
1068040	1070040	For example, the first one is the visual area
1070040	1072040	At this point in time
1072040	1074040	It has a connection with the other two RIs
1074040	1076040	But you will find here
1076040	1078040	It has a connection with more RIs
1078040	1080040	This is completely gone
1080040	1082040	So you can know
1082040	1084040	It continues to change
1084040	1086040	It continues to change
1086040	1088040	Time and space are different
1088040	1090040	Time and space are different
1090040	1092040	Here is the relationship of time
1092040	1094040	Here is the relationship of space
1094040	1096040	Here is a video
1096040	1098040	Here is a video
1098040	1100040	Here is a video
1100040	1102040	Here is a video
1102040	1104040	Here is a video
1104040	1106040	You can see that it continues to change at different points in time
1106040	1108040	So this graph is not fixed
1108040	1110040	So this graph is not fixed
1110040	1112040	It keeps changing
1112040	1114040	It keeps changing
1114040	1116040	This is 300 seconds
1116040	1118040	This is 300 seconds
1118040	1120040	The duration is more than 300 seconds
1120040	1122040	The duration is more than 300 seconds
1122040	1124040	So you can see
1124040	1126040	At this point
1126040	1128040	There is a connection between the two ris
1128040	1130040	But it disappeared when we go to the next time
1130040	1132040	We can prove that
1132040	1134040	Functional connectivity continues to change
1134040	1136040	Functional connectivity continues to change
1136040	1138040	Why should we study this
1138040	1140040	What are the advantages
1140040	1142040	Some people have done research before
1142040	1144040	Some people have done research before
1144040	1146040	Sorry
1146040	1150040	It's because the flow of function connectivity
1150040	1154040	It's very much related to the human cognition
1154040	1156040	For example
1156040	1158040	Some people use cognitive features
1158040	1160040	and invite the objects
1160040	1162040	they ask them to do
1162040	1164040	Work in memory taste
1164040	1166040	when the brain of manabla
1166040	1166040	
1166040	1168040	their functional connectivity
1168040	1170040	is constantly changing
1170040	1172040	and when fuctional connectivity
1172040	1174040	become bigger
1174040	1178040	the performance of the host is getting better and better
1178040	1180040	So this is a piece of evidence
1180040	1182040	that tells us
1182040	1184040	Functional connectivity is constantly changing
1184040	1186040	and this change is actually
1186040	1190040	very much related to human cognition
1190040	1194040	In addition to the host doing things
1194040	1196040	When humans are resting
1196040	1198040	You can also observe
1198040	1200040	Functional connectivity is constantly changing
1200040	1202040	This is actually a bit like
1202040	1204040	the experiment I'm going to talk about
1204040	1206040	Because when I'm doing experiments
1206040	1208040	My data is mainly resting
1208040	1210040	And then
1210040	1212040	Next is
1212040	1214040	Okay, so far
1214040	1216040	I want to ask if there are any questions
1216040	1218040	Because the next one is for a specific experiment
1218040	1220040	Background
1220040	1222040	Hello
1222040	1224040	Hello
1224040	1226040	Yes, I heard
1226040	1228040	Hello, I would like to ask
1228040	1230040	If you imagine each node as a time series
1230040	1232040	Then the picture in front of you
1232040	1234040	Its edge is a direction
1234040	1236040	That thing should not be calculated by Pearson Correlation
1236040	1238040	Which one
1238040	1240040	You mean this one or the one in front
1240040	1242040	The part of the graph theory in front
1242040	1244040	It's like this direction in the brain
1244040	1246040	How do you get it
1246040	1248040	Oh yes
1248040	1250040	In the front
1250040	1252040	There is a picture of how we get the evidence
1252040	1254040	There is a place to tell you
1254040	1256040	Basically if you use
1256040	1258040	Pairwise Correlation
1258040	1260040	There is no so-called direction
1260040	1262040	But if you use other
1262040	1264040	For example, there is a so-called Bayesian Network
1264040	1266040	If you use that method
1266040	1268040	You can get the so-called
1268040	1270040	Relation
1270040	1272040	You see this one on the right
1272040	1274040	This curve is actually symmetrical
1274040	1276040	Because the method I use is Partial Correlation
1276040	1278040	With Simple Correlation
1278040	1280040	So here you can't see any relation
1280040	1282040	But if I use today
1282040	1284040	For example
1284040	1286040	Bayesian Model Network
1286040	1288040	It will tell you that I have two
1288040	1290040	RIE and RIE2
1290040	1292040	The relationship between them
1292040	1294040	Is it from 1 to 2 or 2 to 1
1294040	1296040	If you use Bayesian
1296040	1298040	You can get this information
1298040	1300040	But the one I use today
1300040	1302040	I can't tell you the relation
1304040	1306040	So it becomes
1306040	1308040	It depends on how you get the evidence
1308040	1310040	It will tell you
1310040	1312040	You are
1312040	1314040	In fact, there is also this
1314040	1316040	Your evidence
1316040	1318040	Can be used
1318040	1320040	There is directionality
1320040	1322040	There is no directionality
1322040	1324040	You can also use weighted or unweighted
1324040	1326040	That is
1326040	1328040	Each value represents a different strength
1328040	1330040	Or you can also turn it into
1330040	1332040	A binary matrix
1332040	1334040	There is only 1 and 0
1334040	1336040	1 means it is not connected
1336040	1338040	0 means it is not connected
1340040	1342040	Any other questions
1344040	1346040	Then I will continue
1348040	1350040	Okay, next one
1350040	1352040	It's more about
1352040	1354040	The experiment I'm going to talk about
1354040	1356040	Because I'm actually now
1356040	1358040	In
1358040	1360040	Our lab
1360040	1362040	There is a called
1362040	1364040	Pacific Parkinson's Research Center
1364040	1366040	So our
1366040	1368040	Most of the subjects are
1368040	1370040	Patients with Parkinson's
1370040	1372040	And some normal control
1372040	1374040	What we are mainly talking about
1374040	1376040	Is whether we can
1376040	1378040	Use functional connectivity
1378040	1380040	To find the so-called biological indicator
1380040	1382040	We call it biomarker
1382040	1384040	If we can find this biomarker
1384040	1386040	The first one is
1386040	1388040	Can increase the diagnosis rate
1388040	1390040	If you don't know
1390040	1392040	How sick this person is
1392040	1394040	You can scan his brain
1394040	1396040	Then use this method
1396040	1398040	You can roughly classify
1398040	1400040	Is he very serious
1400040	1402040	For example, today
1402040	1404040	There is a person
1404040	1406040	The diagnosis is early
1406040	1408040	But you want to know
1408040	1410040	For example, after 10 years or 5 years
1410040	1412040	How is his condition
1412040	1414040	Do we need to take some preventive measures
1414040	1416040	If we have this kind of information
1416040	1418040	We can also predict
1418040	1420040	What will happen in 5 or 10 years
1420040	1422040	In short
1422040	1424040	Because there were a lot of research
1424040	1426040	Also using
1426040	1428040	Racine state fMRI
1428040	1430040	These studies have reported
1430040	1432040	Whether you are using graph theory
1432040	1434040	Or so-called dynamic functional connectivity
1434040	1436040	You can find
1436040	1438040	Some differences between patients and normal people
1438040	1440040	These patients
1440040	1442040	Not just limited to
1442040	1444040	Parkinson's
1444040	1446040	For example, Alzheimer's
1446040	1448040	Or some depression
1448040	1450040	Or bipolar disorder, etc.
1450040	1452040	So what we mainly see today
1452040	1454040	Is if
1454040	1456040	We are purely talking about Parkinson's disease
1456040	1458040	Can we use
1458040	1460040	Racine state functional connectivity
1462040	1464040	Find a so-called biomarker
1466040	1468040	Before that, there are two important
1468040	1470040	Concepts to introduce first
1470040	1472040	Brain organization and dynamic functional connectivity
1472040	1474040	So actually this
1474040	1476040	I have talked about the previous background
1476040	1478040	Brain organization
1478040	1480040	You use graph theory
1480040	1482040	Then get a lot of numbers
1482040	1484040	Different numbers
1484040	1486040	Will represent different network features
1486040	1488040	These features
1488040	1490040	Also represent
1490040	1492040	So-called brain organization
1492040	1494040	There are two points here
1494040	1496040	For example, there are two principles
1496040	1498040	The first one is
1498040	1500040	Functional integration
1500040	1502040	It means to look at the message
1502040	1504040	Neural network message
1504040	1506040	In the whole system
1508040	1510040	Then the other one is
1510040	1512040	Functional segregation
1512040	1514040	In a single system
1514040	1516040	In fact, we can say
1516040	1518040	The human brain is in
1518040	1520040	A balance between segregation and integration
1520040	1522040	It's not all integration
1522040	1524040	But it won't
1524040	1526040	It's all segregation
1526040	1528040	Then I think
1528040	1530040	If you are doing
1530040	1532040	For example, when you are doing
1532040	1534040	Higher-level work
1534040	1536040	You need integration
1536040	1538040	Because you have different areas of the brain
1538040	1540040	To cooperate with each other
1540040	1542040	To complete this work
1542040	1544040	If you do it very simply
1544040	1546040	For example, I just need to reach out and get a drink
1546040	1548040	This action may be
1548040	1550040	Simpler, not too much effort
1550040	1552040	Then it's more like segregation
1552040	1554040	So we will say
1554040	1556040	This is the balance between these two things
1556040	1558040	The other one is the dynamic functional connectivity
1558040	1560040	We usually
1560040	1562040	We all say
1562040	1564040	We will use the so-called time-varying method
1564040	1566040	To measure dynamic functional connectivity
1566040	1568040	This method
1568040	1570040	There are many different
1570040	1572040	Different methods
1572040	1574040	One of the methods I will talk about later is called sliding window
1574040	1576040	It is one of the many different methods
1576040	1578040	Then that method is
1578040	1580040	So far
1580040	1582040	Most commonly used
1582040	1584040	Just like we just said
1584040	1586040	Because the brain is not a stationary system
1586040	1588040	So you need to know
1588040	1590040	How does it change in time?
1590040	1592040	Then in our research today
1592040	1594040	Do you want
1594040	1596040	The most interesting thing is to know
1596040	1598040	How does the brain connect with the disease?
1598040	1600040	How does the brain connect with cognitive functions?
1602040	1604040	Here is
1604040	1606040	The main method of this experiment
1606040	1608040	Let me adjust
1608040	1610040	it
1612040	1614040	There are a lot of parameters
1614040	1616040	This is a simple experiment
1616040	1618040	We have 10
1618040	1620040	There are 12
1620040	1622040	This is their
1622040	1624040	Demographic
1624040	1626040	Because
1626040	1628040	PD patients are usually
1628040	1630040	Old
1630040	1632040	50
1632040	1634040	More than 55 years old
1636040	1638040	Older people are more likely to have this disease
1638040	1640040	And
1640040	1642040	There are more male patients
1642040	1644040	So I usually see PD patients
1644040	1646040	It is not surprising that there are more male patients
1646040	1648040	And then
1648040	1650040	UBTRS
1650040	1652040	This thing
1652040	1654040	It's a bit like
1654040	1656040	From nature
1656040	1658040	The indicator of the disease
1658040	1660040	If this indicator is higher, it means that this patient
1660040	1662040	More serious
1662040	1664040	It's actually a bit like
1664040	1666040	Bigger
1666040	1668040	We actually
1668040	1670040	After this, we can divide it into
1670040	1672040	Many different indicators
1672040	1674040	Each indicator represents a certain
1674040	1676040	Symptoms
1676040	1678040	This means
1678040	1680040	How slow is the patient's action
1680040	1682040	Trauma
1682040	1684040	Tremor
1684040	1686040	Rigidity
1686040	1688040	PIGT
1688040	1690040	Postural Instability
1690040	1692040	And Gay Disorder
1692040	1694040	It means
1694040	1696040	His balance is not very good
1696040	1698040	Coordination between actions
1698040	1700040	HNY
1700040	1702040	This is another
1702040	1704040	If you want to know
1704040	1706040	This patient
1706040	1708040	How serious
1708040	1710040	Stage 2 to 5
1710040	1712040	2.5 is mild
1712040	1714040	Not very serious
1714040	1716040	The most serious is 5 to 6
1716040	1718040	That's more serious
1718040	1720040	Usually when we do the experiment
1720040	1722040	We need someone to cooperate
1722040	1724040	So we all follow the mild patient
1724040	1726040	About 2 to 3
1726040	1728040	And disease duration
1728040	1730040	How many days have they changed
1730040	1732040	This is their
1732040	1734040	Out of a dosage
1734040	1736040	Some people will
1736040	1738040	Do research on drugs
1738040	1740040	We usually record
1740040	1742040	Their condition
1742040	1744040	This is called apathy
1744040	1746040	It actually describes
1746040	1748040	Many patients with Parkinson's
1748040	1750040	They lost their usual mood
1750040	1752040	Become a couch potato
1752040	1754040	Don't want to do anything
1754040	1756040	Can't do anything
1756040	1758040	We call this condition apathy
1758040	1760040	Another one is depression
1760040	1762040	Although it is not
1762040	1764040	Mental disorder
1764040	1766040	It will cause depression
1766040	1768040	Or anxiety
1768040	1770040	We all record
1770040	1772040	The last one is
1772040	1774040	Montreal Cognitive Assessment
1774040	1776040	The main purpose is to measure
1776040	1778040	Their cognitive function
1778040	1780040	These are all the clinical data
1780040	1782040	What we will do later
1782040	1784040	Is to use
1784040	1786040	Graph theory
1786040	1788040	And dynamic function
1788040	1790040	To measure
1790040	1792040	Their
1792040	1794040	Function
1794040	1796040	And try to
1796040	1798040	Compare this function
1798040	1800040	With the clinical data
1800040	1802040	To see which data
1802040	1804040	Is related to their brain
1804040	1806040	I think
1806040	1808040	Let's talk about
1808040	1810040	Parkinson's disease
1810040	1812040	We call it
1812040	1814040	Neurodegeneration disease
1814040	1816040	It is caused by
1816040	1818040	Neurodegeneration
1818040	1820040	What is neurodegeneration
1820040	1822040	Dopamine depletion
1822040	1824040	It is caused by
1824040	1826040	Neurodegeneration
1826040	1828040	So
1828040	1830040	There is not enough dopamine
1830040	1832040	In the brain
1832040	1834040	Dopamine is a very important neurotransmitter
1834040	1836040	Without this substance
1836040	1838040	There will be a lot of behavior
1838040	1840040	Can't work normally
1840040	1842040	And so on
1842040	1844040	Where is this dopamine
1844040	1846040	There is a place called
1846040	1848040	Substantial Nigra
1848040	1850040	It will be here
1850040	1852040	The black part
1852040	1854040	In the middle of the brain
1854040	1856040	In a deep place
1856040	1858040	If you zoom in
1858040	1860040	It looks like this
1860040	1862040	This is a normal person's
1862040	1864040	Substantial Nigra
1864040	1866040	You can see the black part
1866040	1868040	Substantial Nigra
1868040	1870040	Latin means black
1870040	1872040	This is the place where dopamine is produced
1872040	1874040	This is the patient
1874040	1876040	You can see the black part
1876040	1878040	There is not much black
1878040	1880040	It means
1880040	1882040	The patient who produces dopamine is dead
1882040	1884040	So there is not much
1884040	1886040	Dopamine
1886040	1888040	The main symptoms
1888040	1890040	You can see resting tremor
1890040	1892040	If you tell them to relax
1892040	1894040	It will move
1894040	1896040	Even his shoulder blades will move
1896040	1898040	Brachycardia is very slow
1898040	1900040	For example, he walks very slowly
1900040	1902040	Take things
1902040	1904040	The whole action is not very slow
1904040	1906040	Rigidity is stiff
1906040	1908040	We usually bend our hands
1908040	1910040	Then we will lose strength
1910040	1912040	Then they bend back
1912040	1914040	In this process
1914040	1916040	You can feel that his action is very stiff
1916040	1918040	Then the other side
1918040	1920040	Postural problem
1920040	1922040	There will be problems with their balance
1922040	1924040	Many patients will fall easily
1924040	1926040	The body is also very uncoordinated
1926040	1928040	In addition, in recent years
1928040	1930040	Many people are very interested in
1930040	1932040	Non-motor symptoms
1932040	1934040	In addition to these
1934040	1936040	There are also some
1936040	1938040	Not so related to exercise
1938040	1940040	Not so related to action
1940040	1942040	For example
1942040	1944040	If you have seen
1944040	1946040	I forgot if it was science or nature
1946040	1948040	General scientific reports
1948040	1950040	They mentioned
1950040	1952040	Many people think Parkinson's disease
1952040	1954040	Has a lot to do with gastrointestinal diseases
1954040	1956040	There are many, many patients
1956040	1958040	Complaining about gastrointestinal diseases
1958040	1960040	Many people
1960040	1962040	Many patients
1962040	1964040	Complaining about gastrointestinal diseases
1964040	1966040	So there is also a vote
1966040	1968040	Researchers are now studying
1968040	1970040	Related to gastrointestinal diseases and Parkinson's disease
1970040	1972040	I am more interested in
1972040	1974040	cognitive functions
1974040	1976040	Although they
1976040	1978040	The main problem you see
1978040	1980040	Is action
1980040	1982040	But their cognitive functions
1982040	1984040	Changed a lot
1984040	1986040	The most obvious is
1986040	1988040	Concentration and execution
1988040	1990040	If you ask them to do
1990040	1992040	Very simple cognitive tasks
1992040	1994040	They can do very well
1994040	1996040	But if you ask them to do very complicated
1996040	1998040	Need to keep switching
1998040	2000040	Method
2000040	2002040	They are easy to fail
2002040	2004040	So this is a
2004040	2006040	Proof
2006040	2008040	Their cognitive functions
2008040	2010040	There is a little degradation
2010040	2012040	As for the data I used
2012040	2014040	Resistive Function MRI
2014040	2016040	A total of 8 minutes
2016040	2018040	Then I
2018040	2020040	There is one here
2020040	2022040	Tell you
2022040	2024040	How do we do the experiment
2024040	2026040	What is the so-called data
2026040	2028040	This picture is MRI
2028040	2030040	You see
2030040	2032040	MRI machine
2032040	2034040	Usually we ask the patient to lie on the examination bed
2034040	2036040	Then the doctor will put
2036040	2038040	In the middle, this is a button
2038040	2040040	Search for them
2040040	2042040	Then the bed will rise
2042040	2044040	Send the patient to the center of the entire machine
2044040	2046040	Because the magnetic field in the middle is more stable
2046040	2048040	Then we started
2048040	2050040	Scan
2050040	2052040	One thing you need to say
2052040	2054040	MRI's noise is very loud
2054040	2056040	So we will give the patient
2056040	2058040	Earplugs
2058040	2060040	Protect their hearing
2060040	2062040	Because it is a magnetic field
2062040	2064040	So there can be no metal on the body
2064040	2066040	For example, keys, wallets, rings
2066040	2068040	All have to be taken down
2068040	2070040	Including women's underwear
2070040	2072040	So for the time being
2072040	2074040	How to change clothes
2074040	2076040	Then this is the file
2076040	2078040	The image we got
2078040	2080040	In principle
2080040	2082040	We will scan two images
2082040	2084040	The most basic
2084040	2086040	One is called T1 Weighted Imaging
2086040	2088040	This is to provide you a structural image
2088040	2090040	You can see it clearly
2090040	2092040	This image will tell you where the brain is
2092040	2094040	Gray is gray
2094040	2096040	White is white
2096040	2098040	The empty place in the middle
2098040	2100040	There is water
2100040	2102040	Brain
2102040	2104040	These two are eyeballs
2104040	2106040	The middle is the air
2106040	2108040	This image provides you a very clear
2108040	2110040	Information on the structure
2110040	2112040	In addition, we will scan the functional imaging
2112040	2114040	We call Bolt Signal
2114040	2116040	Here is written
2116040	2118040	This image is physical
2118040	2120040	If you don't deal with it, you can't see anything
2120040	2122040	You can only see the middle
2122040	2124040	CSF
2124040	2126040	Next to it
2126040	2128040	You can't clearly define the brain
2128040	2130040	Gray and white
2130040	2132040	So when we analyze
2132040	2134040	The point is to analyze this image
2134040	2136040	Ok
2136040	2138040	Because actually
2138040	2140040	The principle of FMI is quite complicated
2140040	2142040	This is what I have found so far
2142040	2144040	I have seen the simplest and most powerful
2144040	2146040	A picture can be introduced to everyone
2146040	2148040	CSF is in
2148040	2150040	When the nervous system is active
2150040	2152040	It needs oxygen, oxygen and blood
2152040	2154040	So here is
2154040	2156040	Now the nervous system is active
2156040	2158040	The blood vessels near the nervous system
2158040	2160040	Start to increase blood flow
2160040	2162040	Fresh blood
2162040	2164040	To this place
2164040	2166040	So here you will find
2166040	2168040	A lot of fresh blood
2168040	2170040	Because oxygen needs to enter the nervous system
2170040	2172040	Fresh blood will come
2172040	2174040	There are a lot of different
2174040	2176040	There are a lot of new oxygen here
2176040	2178040	Then in
2178040	2180040	Exhaustive blood vessels
2180040	2182040	When interchanging
2182040	2184040	It will produce a signal
2184040	2186040	We can produce a signal
2186040	2188040	Because MRI is
2188040	2190040	Strong magnetic field
2190040	2192040	We used to learn that Faraday's law
2192040	2194040	Magnetic field
2194040	2196040	Because of the change in magnetic field
2196040	2198040	It will produce an electric signal
2198040	2200040	Will be just
2200040	2202040	Receive the electric signal
2202040	2204040	After that, it will go through a lot of
2204040	2206040	Different image processing
2206040	2208040	You will get it
2208040	2210040	You will see this image
2210040	2212040	In addition
2212040	2214040	Exhaustive and
2214040	2216040	Exhaustive blood vessels and
2216040	2218040	The imbalance of the oxygen blood vessels
2218040	2220040	Will cause the signal
2220040	2222040	So
2222040	2224040	The picture we just talked about
2224040	2226040	The so-called Tom Cruise
2226040	2228040	Is this thing
2228040	2230040	After we get this thing
2230040	2232040	We can start the follow-up analysis
2232040	2234040	Of course the story is not that simple
2234040	2236040	Because from you get the signal
2236040	2238040	You can analyze
2238040	2240040	There are a lot of things to do
2240040	2242040	To correct the difference in time
2242040	2244040	To correct the difference in space
2244040	2246040	Sometimes it may shake your head
2246040	2248040	You can't just take his data
2248040	2250040	You have to correct these things first
2250040	2252040	These things we call preprocessing
2252040	2254040	I didn't talk too much today
2254040	2256040	Just let you know
2256040	2258040	The difference in time and space
2258040	2260040	The focus part will be
2260040	2262040	How do you analyze them
2262040	2264040	Wait a minute
2264040	2266040	Is there any
2266040	2268040	Image acquisition
2268040	2270040	Can i ask a question
2270040	2272040	Is there any problem with the scene
2272040	2274040	Is the scene
2274040	2276040	Did you get this picture
2276040	2278040	You got this picture
2278040	2280040	Then you turn it like this
2280040	2282040	Then you use
2282040	2284040	Turn it into this picture
2284040	2286040	After sending this picture in
2286040	2288040	Then he will give you this
2288040	2290040	His
2290040	2292040	Regional interest
2292040	2294040	You have to set a few points on the picture
2294040	2296040	Then he will find it
2296040	2298040	How do you know
2298040	2300040	He asked you
2300040	2302040	If we get this picture
2302040	2304040	To this side
2304040	2306040	Basically how to get there
2308040	2310040	Because I omitted a lot of things
2310040	2312040	So
2312040	2314040	I'll talk about it now
2314040	2316040	If we do it in our lab
2316040	2318040	We will get this T1 and Bolt signal
2318040	2320040	Then we will throw T1
2320040	2322040	To a software called FreeSurfer
2322040	2324040	The purpose is to do so-called
2324040	2326040	That's why I got those
2326040	2328040	RIERR333
2328040	2330040	We take this T1
2330040	2332040	We put each brain area
2332040	2334040	Label up
2334040	2336040	Give him an ID
2336040	2338040	Then we put this at the same time
2338040	2340040	The image obtained by FMI
2340040	2342040	To do the pre-processing
2342040	2344040	After the pre-processing
2344040	2346040	We want to put this T1 with the label
2346040	2348040	Two FMI in place
2348040	2350040	Because they say
2350040	2352040	The subject's head won't move too much
2352040	2354040	But we still have to put these two images in place
2354040	2356040	To make sure
2356040	2358040	The one we see
2358040	2360040	For example, the area seen on T1
2360040	2362040	On FMI
2362040	2364040	Is the same area
2364040	2366040	So this is very important
2366040	2368040	When we put T1 and FMI in place
2368040	2370040	We told the computer
2370040	2372040	Let's define a few RIERR333
2372040	2374040	From T1
2374040	2376040	If there are 100
2376040	2378040	I told the computer
2378040	2380040	I want 90
2380040	2382040	All listed
2382040	2384040	There is a step called
2384040	2386040	Time course extraction
2386040	2388040	After we put these two in place
2388040	2390040	I said these 90 RIERR333
2390040	2392040	You go get their time course
2392040	2394040	For example, the first RIERR333
2394040	2396040	Here
2396040	2398040	I'll take his time course
2398040	2400040	Take it out
2400040	2402040	Then the second RIERR333
2402040	2404040	I'll take his
2404040	2406040	Just like this
2406040	2408040	How big is that RIERR333
2408040	2410040	How big can it be
2410040	2412040	Actually this depends on you
2412040	2414040	How to do cortical postulation
2414040	2416040	Basically
2416040	2418040	This
2418040	2420040	The resolution is 1x1x1mm
2422040	2424040	If there is
2424040	2426040	Some areas will be bigger
2426040	2428040	For example, if you have a prefrontal cortex
2428040	2430040	It's a big piece
2430040	2432040	If you want a very small one
2432040	2434040	Anterior cingulate cortex will be smaller
2434040	2436040	So that doesn't necessarily depend on your brain area
2436040	2438040	What do you usually decide
2438040	2440040	What do you usually decide
2440040	2442040	Ha ha ha
2442040	2444040	This is a very tricky question
2444040	2446040	Ha ha ha
2446040	2448040	If you look at this area
2448040	2450040	There is no change at all
2450040	2452040	It's in another area
2452040	2454040	So now most people
2454040	2456040	Tend to use
2456040	2458040	It's a bit like watching you do postulation
2458040	2460040	How many brain areas do you have
2460040	2462040	Usually
2462040	2464040	At least
2464040	2466040	There should be more than 90
2466040	2468040	I know there are more than 100 in FreeSurfer
2468040	2470040	A lot of people take out more than 100 brain areas
2470040	2472040	Because he doesn't know which one he wants to see
2472040	2474040	Just take out all the brain areas
2474040	2476040	Take out all the information
2476040	2478040	Some people are very specific
2478040	2480040	They assume
2480040	2482040	Which brain area has a special relationship with which brain area
2482040	2484040	They want to see
2484040	2486040	They will have a purpose
2486040	2488040	Select those brain areas first
2488040	2490040	But indeed
2490040	2492040	At the beginning, when I was writing articles
2492040	2494040	You write articles
2494040	2496040	The question that often comes back is why do you choose these brain areas
2496040	2498040	Ha ha ha
2498040	2500040	So now people
2500040	2502040	Because I think it's a bit of a avoidance
2502040	2504040	Plus you really don't know
2504040	2506040	Where is the change
2506040	2508040	All brain areas
2508040	2510040	Ha ha ha
2510040	2512040	Ha ha ha
2512040	2514040	Ha ha ha
2514040	2516040	Ha ha ha
2516040	2518040	Ha ha ha
2518040	2520040	Ha ha ha
2520040	2522040	In fact
2522040	2524040	It should be said that we already have
2524040	2526040	Different software and different
2526040	2528040	So-called templates
2528040	2530040	You will get different brain areas
2530040	2532040	In fact, this is indeed
2532040	2534040	There is a big problem in doing imaging
2534040	2536040	Generally speaking
2536040	2538040	My answer will be
2538040	2540040	You will
2540040	2542040	We will have a defined brain area
2542040	2544040	For example, you are doing free surfer
2544040	2546040	You must know
2546040	2548040	In FreeSurfer
2548040	2550040	The brain areas in that list
2550040	2552040	We want these
2552040	2554040	There is another one called AAL
2554040	2556040	Another template
2556040	2558040	In another software
2558040	2560040	If you say this is AAL template
2560040	2562040	We probably know what brain areas
2562040	2564040	In principle
2564040	2566040	I don't think they are too different
2566040	2568040	But there is a vote of people
2568040	2570040	People who specialize in so-called postulation
2570040	2572040	They will tell you which one
2572040	2574040	Different templates will have different
2574040	2576040	Disadvantages
2576040	2578040	Last year
2578040	2580040	I don't know if you have seen that report
2580040	2582040	There was a paper last year
2582040	2584040	Nature
2584040	2586040	There is a Human Connectome Project in the United States
2586040	2588040	They are a few thousand less
2588040	2590040	Then they
2590040	2592040	Use the information of those thousands of people
2592040	2594040	And at the same time it also includes
2594040	2596040	Different modalities
2596040	2598040	For example, MIT1 image has functional images
2598040	2600040	There is also T2
2600040	2602040	Or Proton Density Modeling
2602040	2604040	Many different images
2604040	2606040	All modalities are put together
2606040	2608040	Use all these modalities
2608040	2610040	To build another template
2610040	2612040	Then I remember
2612040	2614040	More than 100 brain areas than we currently know
2614040	2616040	More than 200
2618040	2620040	So this becomes
2620040	2622040	How do you define your brain area
2622040	2624040	It's a bit tricky
2624040	2626040	At present we can only say
2626040	2628040	Which template you use
2628040	2630040	Or which software you use
2630040	2632040	We probably know what your so-called brain areas are
2632040	2634040	Any other questions?
2634040	2636040	For example
2636040	2638040	For example, that area
2638040	2640040	If you have big or small
2640040	2642040	You can set big or small
2642040	2644040	For example, when you are small
2644040	2646040	Its signal is very strong
2646040	2648040	But when you have a large area
2648040	2650040	You have to remove the signal
2650040	2652040	Actually there is
2652040	2654040	I always don't believe
2654040	2656040	For example, there are some things in the brain area
2656040	2658040	Its signal is very, very bad
2658040	2660040	Because it happens to be interconnected with the air
2660040	2662040	You can see here
2662040	2664040	There is still a brain area here
2664040	2666040	This is the prefrontal cortex
2666040	2668040	But it is already close to the sinus
2668040	2670040	So it's very close to this place
2670040	2672040	It looks okay in T1
2672040	2674040	But in FMR, you can see it's super bad
2674040	2676040	Half of the frontal area is gone
2676040	2678040	For example, in the frontal area
2678040	2680040	Some very small areas
2680040	2682040	Such as the frontal pole
2682040	2684040	That area is very small and close to the air
2684040	2686040	So its FMR signal is super bad
2686040	2688040	I usually
2688040	2690040	My approach is
2690040	2692040	I don't want to look at that area
2692040	2694040	If your signal is already very bad
2694040	2696040	You see it again
2696040	2698040	What do you say
2698040	2700040	This is because
2700040	2702040	It's caused by the difference in FMR
2702040	2704040	Or is it because your own signal is bad
2704040	2706040	So my approach is
2706040	2708040	Put those too small areas
2708040	2710040	Or in that kind of signal
2710040	2712040	I don't want those areas
2712040	2714040	Is there any
2714040	2716040	Is there any area
2716040	2718040	Where the signal is bad
2718040	2720040	Frontal
2720040	2722040	The area closest to the frontal
2722040	2724040	Because it's too close to the air
2724040	2726040	There will be a so-called partial volume effect
2726040	2728040	If you look at this picture
2728040	2730040	The signal is bad in the front area
2730040	2732040	And then there is the orbital frontal cortex
2732040	2734040	This is close to the nasal cavity
2734040	2736040	There is a lot of air there, so the signal is bad
2736040	2738040	And then the other place is the temporal pole
2738040	2740040	Just a little bit in front of the temporal
2740040	2742040	And then there is the inferior temporal cortex
2742040	2744040	At the very bottom of the temporal
2744040	2746040	Because it's already close to the skull base
2746040	2748040	So those places
2748040	2750040	I usually see
2750040	2752040	If you actually see it
2752040	2754040	The whole information sharing
2754040	2756040	If you find that there is an important change
2756040	2758040	If it's there, I'll be a little hesitant
2758040	2760040	Then go back and see if my image blurring is good
2760040	2762040	Decide again
2762040	2764040	Do I believe him
2764040	2766040	Is there anything else
2766040	2768040	Ok let's go next
2768040	2770040	Ok this is a bit
2770040	2772040	Be a little patient
2772040	2774040	Because this is a bit
2774040	2776040	It's the background I just talked about
2776040	2778040	Background for this experiment
2778040	2780040	Now I'm going to talk about
2780040	2782040	The method used for this experiment
2782040	2784040	Then you will see
2784040	2786040	The first thing I want to talk about is
2786040	2788040	Dynamic Functional Connectivity
2788040	2790040	I use sliding window
2790040	2792040	This blue is the so-called fMRI time core
2792040	2794040	That's what we've been talking about
2794040	2796040	The most important thing when doing sliding window
2796040	2798040	The first step is that you have to define
2798040	2800040	Your so-called window length
2800040	2802040	How big is your window
2802040	2804040	I use 20 time points here
2804040	2806040	That is to say
2806040	2808040	I only include
2808040	2810040	The first 20 time points
2810040	2812040	Then I do
2812040	2814040	Correlation, I use Pearson's correlation here
2814040	2816040	Then I will get a metric
2816040	2818040	This metric means
2818040	2820040	I have 54
2820040	2822040	hri
2822040	2824040	Is the relationship between these 54 hri
2824040	2826040	After finishing here
2826040	2828040	I will move my window forward
2828040	2830040	Do the same thing
2830040	2832040	You will get the second metric
2832040	2834040	How long does a time point usually last
2834040	2836040	It depends on your MRI
2836040	2838040	Scanning parameters
2838040	2840040	We have two seconds here
2840040	2842040	Then you keep doing the same thing
2842040	2844040	Until you finish
2844040	2846040	All the fMRI time cores
2846040	2848040	After that, I have a total of
2848040	2850040	221 window correlation metrics
2850040	2852040	Then the next
2852040	2854040	One important thing is
2854040	2856040	I got so many metrics
2856040	2858040	Each one is not the same
2858040	2860040	How do I report
2860040	2862040	What is their variability
2862040	2864040	Here we calculate 7
2864040	2866040	I call it network feature
2866040	2868040	According to these
2868040	2870040	According to these metrics
2870040	2872040	I calculate some numbers
2872040	2874040	Each number represents
2874040	2876040	Variability
2876040	2878040	For example, the first one I call it
2878040	2880040	Network variation
2880040	2882040	The first one is very simple
2882040	2884040	We want to see the overall variability
2884040	2886040	The first one and the second
2886040	2888040	Correlation metrics
2888040	2890040	Take all the numbers and subtract them
2890040	2892040	Then for each
2892040	2894040	221 metrics
2894040	2896040	Do the same thing on average
2896040	2898040	So the numbers we get
2898040	2900040	It's a bit like
2900040	2902040	On average
2902040	2904040	The variability of your entire brain
2904040	2906040	Then the second
2906040	2908040	Network power
2908040	2910040	This is actually very simple
2910040	2912040	It mainly adds all the
2912040	2914040	On average
2914040	2916040	The purpose of this is to get
2916040	2918040	It's a bit like on average
2918040	2920040	The strength of your connectivity
2920040	2922040	Then here
2922040	2924040	These are very similar from C to G and A
2924040	2926040	But the difference is
2926040	2928040	A is measuring the whole brain
2928040	2930040	All numbers
2930040	2932040	All elements in this metric
2932040	2934040	But C to D
2934040	2936040	C to G is
2936040	2938040	For specific
2938040	2940040	For example, this is called
2940040	2942040	We only calculate
2942040	2944040	The connection between the opposite brain areas
2944040	2946040	Then
2946040	2948040	This is
2948040	2950040	Then this is
2950040	2952040	Same on the same side
2952040	2954040	Then divide it here
2954040	2956040	On the left and on the right
2956040	2958040	So you can see that the math
2958040	2960040	Actually quite similar
2960040	2962040	But when we count C to G
2962040	2964040	The value we get is
2964040	2966040	For example, when we count C
2966040	2968040	We take the right angle
2968040	2970040	Because the right angle represents
2970040	2972040	Connectivity from left to right
2972040	2974040	Then
2974040	2976040	Here is the sliding window
2976040	2978040	That's it
2978040	2980040	The other graph theory
2980040	2982040	I made it more fancy here
2982040	2984040	I have a little bit
2984040	2986040	The graph theory and the sliding window
2986040	2988040	Combined together
2988040	2990040	So in the front you will find that it is exactly the same as the sliding window
2990040	2992040	Until this step
2992040	2994040	All the same
2994040	2996040	The difference is that when I got this metric
2996040	2998040	I didn't just add or subtract it
2998040	3000040	Do some processing to calculate
3000040	3002040	The so-called network feature
3002040	3004040	Instead, I first apply a threshold
3004040	3006040	Above a certain threshold
3006040	3008040	I determine that these connections are real connections
3008040	3010040	Under this threshold
3010040	3012040	It's not, it's an imprecision
3012040	3014040	Then I put this
3014040	3016040	Thresholded edges
3016040	3018040	There is something called
3018040	3020040	Brain Connectivity Toolbox
3020040	3022040	This is a free download on the Internet
3022040	3024040	You can run it with MATLAB
3024040	3026040	After I throw it into the graph theory
3026040	3028040	Every window I will get two
3028040	3030040	Global Feature Measure
3030040	3032040	And a Local Measure
3032040	3034040	In fact, you can get more
3034040	3036040	I just use these three for the time being
3036040	3038040	The so-called Global Measure is
3038040	3040040	There will be a number for each indicator
3040040	3042040	Local Measure is
3042040	3044040	See how many RRI it has
3044040	3046040	How many numbers
3046040	3048040	After all done
3048040	3050040	I will have 221 stats
3050040	3052040	Then there are three numbers for each window
3052040	3054040	This is a bit complicated
3054040	3056040	But in a nutshell
3056040	3058040	I got a lot of different numbers
3058040	3060040	Or the so-called network features
3060040	3062040	Then the point is to see
3062040	3064040	Between patient and normal control
3064040	3066040	What's the difference
3066040	3068040	Then the next one
3068040	3070040	it is good
3070040	3072040	In fact, this is a bit
3076040	3078040	Is there a problem
3078040	3080040	It's okay, I want to ask this one
3080040	3082040	You can continue to talk
3082040	3084040	Don't ignore me
3084040	3086040	After the analysis of the RRI
3086040	3088040	We got the so-called
3088040	3090040	These are the numbers
3090040	3092040	When using the sliding window
3092040	3094040	We will get the power
3094040	3096040	The other
3096040	3098040	Specific connection
3098040	3100040	This is inter-hemisphere
3100040	3102040	Then here is cross-hemisphere
3102040	3104040	And in the same brain
3104040	3106040	The same brain
3106040	3108040	Then there is left and right
3108040	3110040	The so-called flexibility
3110040	3112040	In fact, we take the correlation value
3112040	3114040	The correlation value of two windows
3114040	3116040	Two minus and then equal
3116040	3118040	So
3118040	3120040	In the sliding window value
3120040	3122040	If the value is higher
3122040	3124040	It means its connectivity is more dynamic
3124040	3126040	The more mutable
3126040	3128040	Then dynamic graphical approach
3128040	3130040	Is what we just talked about
3130040	3132040	Combined graph theory and sliding window
3132040	3134040	It's the same global feature
3134040	3136040	I have two
3136040	3138040	One is global efficiency
3138040	3140040	The other is modularity
3140040	3142040	It may be difficult to explain here
3142040	3144040	I can't explain
3144040	3146040	If you don't know
3146040	3148040	You may need to check
3148040	3150040	I will show you a paper later
3150040	3152040	There may be a complete
3152040	3154040	It's easier to understand
3154040	3156040	In short, global efficiency
3156040	3158040	The way it is calculated
3158040	3160040	The shortest distance between these two points
3162040	3164040	Make them equal
3164040	3166040	Do the math
3166040	3168040	Then equal
3168040	3170040	This global efficiency represents
3170040	3172040	Information
3172040	3174040	The information of the neural network
3174040	3176040	In the whole brain
3176040	3178040	How well it is integrated
3178040	3180040	So it is also
3180040	3182040	An indicator of integration
3182040	3184040	Modularity is just the opposite
3184040	3186040	It is an indicator of segregation
3186040	3188040	Modularity is actually
3188040	3190040	Under this network
3190040	3192040	Will this network be
3192040	3194040	Will it be divided into
3194040	3196040	Several different
3196040	3198040	Small networks
3198040	3200040	Then it is
3200040	3202040	An indicator of segregation
3202040	3204040	This means
3204040	3206040	If the modularity value is higher
3206040	3208040	It means
3208040	3210040	In a single system
3210040	3212040	Will be better integrated
3212040	3214040	These two points are the opposite
3214040	3216040	Integration and segregation
3216040	3218040	Then another local measure
3218040	3220040	Betweenness centrality
3220040	3222040	This is the brain area
3222040	3224040	This RRI
3224040	3226040	How important it is in the whole network
3226040	3228040	That is to see
3228040	3230040	How many
3230040	3232040	The shortest path
3232040	3234040	Through this
3234040	3236040	This RRI
3236040	3238040	If this number is higher
3238040	3240040	It means that this brain area is more important
3240040	3242040	It may be the hubs we just talked about
3242040	3244040	After having these numbers
3244040	3246040	The first thing we do is
3246040	3248040	See the difference between the patient and the PD
3248040	3250040	See if there is any difference
3250040	3252040	In addition, these numbers
3252040	3254040	Do a linear regression with clinical indicators
3254040	3256040	See what happens
3256040	3258040	Then the next one
3260040	3262040	it is good
3262040	3264040	I have to go to the bathroom
3264040	3266040	This is the result
3266040	3268040	I can tell you
3268040	3270040	If you just do a two-sample t-test
3270040	3272040	I can't see any difference
3272040	3274040	Between the patient and the normal person
3274040	3276040	Those numbers are completely the same
3276040	3278040	But when we do simple
3278040	3280040	Peterson's correlation
3280040	3282040	You can find
3282040	3284040	This is the result of sliding window
3284040	3286040	Dynamic connectivity
3286040	3288040	You can find
3288040	3290040	Let's look at the above two
3290040	3292040	Age and network power
3292040	3294040	And I put a small picture
3294040	3296040	You can know which connection it is
3296040	3298040	Inter-dimensional connectivity is related
3298040	3300040	But I can tell you
3300040	3302040	I think this is more like
3302040	3304040	Normal human aging will occur
3304040	3306040	Because I see this on Parkinson's patients
3306040	3308040	But I also see it on normal people
3308040	3310040	So this one
3310040	3312040	We won't do so much discussion for the time being
3312040	3314040	But the more interesting thing is this
3314040	3316040	This is the postural instability
3316040	3318040	Gait disorder
3318040	3320040	That is, the number of their balance and body coordination
3320040	3322040	With
3322040	3324040	On the right
3324040	3326040	This is the right
3326040	3328040	Dynamic functional connectivity
3328040	3330040	Related to them
3330040	3332040	That is to say, the more serious the patient
3332040	3334040	His right connectivity
3334040	3336040	The harder it is
3336040	3338040	Can't change
3338040	3340040	Then this is the dose of the drug
3340040	3342040	It's the same
3342040	3344040	When the drug dose is higher
3344040	3346040	They are also with
3346040	3348040	This one
3348040	3350040	This connectivity is also more rigid
3350040	3352040	You can find
3352040	3354040	If it's based on these two relationships
3354040	3356040	We can roughly think
3356040	3358040	Parkinson's disease
3358040	3360040	Their
3360040	3362040	Connectivity is not so dynamic
3362040	3364040	More rigid
3364040	3366040	In addition, because this is just
3366040	3368040	Simple correlation
3368040	3370040	We want to do postural correlation
3370040	3372040	Is to remove some
3372040	3374040	Effect
3374040	3376040	For example, age
3376040	3378040	If our condition for age is
3378040	3380040	We remove the age
3380040	3382040	If we do correlation again
3382040	3384040	In fact, you will find that only this value
3384040	3386040	Related
3386040	3388040	The same thing is significant
3388040	3390040	Only this value
3390040	3392040	With these dynamic features
3392040	3394040	Related
3396040	3398040	Then next
3400040	3402040	This is what I just said
3402040	3404040	Dynamic
3404040	3406040	Graphical features
3406040	3408040	Graph theory and dynamics
3408040	3410040	Generally
3410040	3412040	Red is PD
3412040	3414040	Blue is normal control
3414040	3416040	You can find that PD patients
3416040	3418040	Generally
3418040	3420040	Higher global efficiency
3420040	3422040	This number also represents
3422040	3424040	Signal
3424040	3426040	How well the whole brain is integrated
3426040	3428040	You will find that overall
3428040	3430040	In fact, they are better than the patient
3430040	3432040	This is a bit
3432040	3434040	Make people feel
3434040	3436040	Why is the patient better
3436040	3438040	In fact, we think
3438040	3440040	This is the so-called compensator effect
3440040	3442040	Because
3442040	3444040	We just said
3444040	3446040	Because the patient's brain
3446040	3448040	Their connectivity is more rigid
3448040	3450040	Because it is more rigid
3450040	3452040	So they become the existing
3452040	3454040	Connectivity needs to be better integrated
3454040	3456040	To maintain normal brain function
3456040	3458040	Then next
3458040	3460040	This is the so-called local measure
3460040	3462040	That is, each subject
3462040	3464040	There are several numbers
3464040	3466040	Depends on how many RRI
3466040	3468040	Each RRI will give you a number
3468040	3470040	Because I am here
3470040	3472040	Do dynamic graph theory
3472040	3474040	So you can see that there are several different windows
3476040	3478040	Generally you can see
3478040	3480040	These brain areas
3480040	3482040	PD and normal control
3482040	3484040	There are significant differences
3484040	3486040	Brain area
3486040	3488040	A bit small
3488040	3490040	Blue is normal
3490040	3492040	Red is PD
3492040	3494040	Normal people
3494040	3496040	Most of them will show higher
3496040	3498040	Centrality
3498040	3500040	It means
3500040	3502040	These brain areas
3502040	3504040	Parkinson's patients
3504040	3506040	Become less important
3506040	3508040	Because between the centrality
3508040	3510040	This brain area
3510040	3512040	How important
3512040	3514040	You can find that all of these
3514040	3516040	Relatively low
3516040	3518040	Then there are significant differences
3518040	3520040	It is worth mentioning
3520040	3522040	The red one
3522040	3524040	They are called cortical hubs
3524040	3526040	Blue
3526040	3528040	The so-called cortical hubs
3528040	3530040	So that's why
3530040	3532040	I may have to jump out
3532040	3534040	Tell you what hubs are
3536040	3538040	The so-called hubs are actually
3538040	3540040	It's important
3540040	3542040	We are talking about
3542040	3544040	If you are from Vancouver today
3544040	3546040	Where we are now
3546040	3548040	If you want to travel to Hamburg, Germany
3548040	3550040	You have two options
3550040	3552040	For example, this is Hansa Airlines
3552040	3554040	You can take a plane to the most
3554040	3556040	The simplest
3556040	3558040	This is Zurich
3558040	3560040	Frankfurt or Munich
3560040	3562040	You transfer from there
3562040	3564040	Just turn once and you can go to Hamburg
3564040	3566040	Then the one below is
3566040	3568040	Airbus
3568040	3570040	If you take off from Vancouver
3570040	3572040	It's a bit small
3572040	3574040	But it's also Zurich
3574040	3576040	Frankfurt and Munich
3576040	3578040	You can go to Hamburg
3578040	3580040	In this case
3580040	3582040	Zurich, Munich and Frankfurt
3582040	3584040	The so-called hubs
3584040	3586040	On the plane
3586040	3588040	It's the so-called hubs
3588040	3590040	Because they have more
3590040	3592040	They have more different
3592040	3594040	Airways
3594040	3596040	Can go to different cities
3596040	3598040	Similarly
3598040	3600040	There are so-called hubs in the human brain
3600040	3602040	Here on the right
3602040	3604040	You can see
3604040	3606040	All of these points are cortical hubs
3606040	3608040	According to
3608040	3610040	Previous research
3610040	3612040	Then the yellow one
3612040	3614040	Functional hubs
3614040	3616040	In fMRI or other functional images
3616040	3618040	Hubs obtained
3618040	3620040	The red one
3620040	3622040	Functional and structural
3622040	3624040	In functional studies
3624040	3626040	You will see
3626040	3628040	Structural studies
3628040	3630040	Structural images can also be seen
3630040	3632040	The bigger one
3632040	3634040	Rich club
3634040	3636040	These big hubs
3636040	3638040	Between each other
3638040	3640040	Stronger
3640040	3642040	Stronger
3642040	3644040	More links
3644040	3646040	The point is to tell everyone
3646040	3648040	These hubs
3648040	3650040	Play an important role in the entire brain network
3650040	3652040	Because they have to
3652040	3654040	Like a logistics center
3654040	3656040	It has to distribute these messages
3656040	3658040	Then direct them to
3658040	3660040	The destination they need to reach
3660040	3662040	Then we slightly
3662040	3664040	Functional hubs and structural hubs
3664040	3666040	What's the difference
3666040	3668040	Someone here asked
3668040	3670040	If I use fMRI today
3670040	3672040	Graph theory
3672040	3674040	I can find hubs
3674040	3676040	Functional hubs
3676040	3678040	If I use
3678040	3680040	Structural images
3680040	3682040	Diffusion-weighted imaging
3682040	3684040	Or
3684040	3686040	DWI or DSI
3686040	3688040	Structural images
3688040	3690040	Hubs obtained
3690040	3692040	Structural hubs
3692040	3694040	The main difference is
3694040	3696040	One uses fMRI
3696040	3698040	Why
3698040	3700040	They are different
3700040	3702040	I asked someone
3702040	3704040	The researcher told me
3704040	3706040	His own suspicion is
3706040	3708040	fMRI
3708040	3710040	Very indirect measurement
3710040	3712040	The signal may contain
3712040	3714040	A lot of impurities
3714040	3716040	Blood vessels, breathing, heartbeats
3716040	3718040	He personally doubts
3718040	3720040	The signal in fMRI is too impure
3720040	3722040	So it will cause
3722040	3724040	Your hubs to be different
3724040	3726040	Hubs
3726040	3728040	Left and right symmetry
3728040	3730040	Another question
3730040	3732040	Hubs are left and right symmetry
3732040	3734040	Most of us think
3734040	3736040	Hubs are left and right symmetry
3736040	3738040	For example
3738040	3740040	This is
3740040	3742040	Superior frontal cortex
3742040	3744040	They are symmetry
3744040	3746040	If you find the left
3746040	3748040	The area on the right will also be hubs
3748040	3750040	But there may be a little
3750040	3752040	Slightly different
3752040	3754040	The left may be less obvious
3754040	3756040	But we think hubs are symmetry
3756040	3758040	So which hub
3758040	3760040	Will connect
3760040	3762040	The other question is
3762040	3764040	Which hub will connect
3764040	3766040	So far
3766040	3768040	We think this big
3768040	3770040	Rich club
3770040	3772040	There is a thing called rich club
3772040	3774040	Organization
3774040	3776040	These hubs
3776040	3778040	Can be called super hubs
3778040	3780040	Very powerful
3780040	3782040	So many different
3782040	3784040	So in these big hubs
3784040	3786040	They form another
3786040	3788040	Powerful network
3788040	3790040	So this is what we call
3790040	3792040	There will be interconnection
3796040	3798040	Can
3798040	3800040	Another last thing
3800040	3802040	I want to tell you
3802040	3804040	We can go back a little
3804040	3806040	We just mentioned here
3806040	3808040	The red ones are all hubs
3808040	3810040	Insula, Precuneus
3810040	3812040	Thalamus and Hippocampus
3812040	3814040	The next one you can find
3814040	3816040	Thalamus, Hippocampus
3816040	3818040	Insula
3818040	3820040	Just now
3820040	3822040	We saw on PDs patient
3822040	3824040	Those hubs are less important
3824040	3826040	So our result
3826040	3828040	Here is the whole conclusion
3828040	3830040	The first one we said
3830040	3832040	Can we use rich club function
3832040	3834040	As a bio-marker
3834040	3836040	I wrote potentially
3836040	3838040	There are a lot of things we haven't measured
3838040	3840040	For the current result
3840040	3842040	This is possible
3842040	3844040	Just now
3844040	3846040	We did a linear regression
3846040	3848040	You will find
3848040	3850040	PDs patient
3850040	3852040	Their function
3852040	3854040	Reduce dynamics
3854040	3856040	Especially with this number
3856040	3858040	PIGD is related
3858040	3860040	In addition
3860040	3862040	Because PDs patient
3862040	3864040	Most of the time they show
3864040	3866040	Global efficiency
3866040	3868040	Their connectivity
3868040	3870040	Is better integrated
3870040	3872040	As I said
3872040	3874040	This is the so-called
3874040	3876040	Compensatory effect
3876040	3878040	This is the result of local measure
3878040	3880040	You can see
3880040	3882040	On PDs
3882040	3884040	A lot of hubs
3884040	3886040	Lose their importance
3886040	3888040	This is actually
3888040	3890040	Similar to other people's research
3890040	3892040	Because they mentioned before
3892040	3894040	These hubs are actually more sensitive
3894040	3896040	They are more likely to be affected by diseases
3896040	3898040	So our research
3898040	3900040	It's a bit like
3900040	3902040	Even on PDs
3902040	3904040	These cortical hubs
3904040	3906040	Easier to be affected by diseases
3906040	3908040	Because they lost their importance
3908040	3910040	The only one that is not a hub
3910040	3912040	Pre-SMA
3912040	3914040	Somato
3914040	3916040	Pre-SMA is another
3916040	3918040	A little bit in front of the motor cortex
3918040	3920040	Brain area
3920040	3922040	I found a paper
3922040	3924040	A long time ago
3924040	3926040	This paper describes
3926040	3928040	Pre-SMA and SMA
3928040	3930040	The function of this area
3930040	3932040	Is to control
3932040	3934040	So-called body coordination
3934040	3936040	It's interesting that we found
3936040	3938040	Dynamics and body coordination
3938040	3940040	The PIGD indicator is related
3940040	3942040	So our final result
3942040	3944040	We proposed
3944040	3946040	It is possible
3946040	3948040	This pre-SMA
3948040	3950040	You can only see it on PD
3950040	3952040	Even if it is not a cortical hub
3952040	3954040	Its importance is also reduced
3954040	3956040	Maybe because it controls this function
3956040	3958040	On PD
3958040	3960040	Is affected
3960040	3962040	That's it
3962040	3964040	Thank you
3978040	3980040	Can I ask a question?
3980040	3982040	Yes
3982040	3984040	Thank you for your sharing
3984040	3986040	It's wonderful
3986040	3988040	I have a comment
3988040	3990040	On the conclusion
3990040	3992040	I have a comment
3992040	3994040	Ok
3994040	3996040	First of all
3996040	3998040	I am a EEG
3998040	4000040	I am not an FHI
4000040	4002040	But these
4002040	4004040	These analyses are quite common
4004040	4006040	I think it's quite interesting
4006040	4008040	But I think
4008040	4010040	Your first point
4010040	4012040	Your research
4012040	4014040	The fact is
4014040	4016040	You want to use this as a biomarker
4016040	4018040	In fact, I think
4018040	4020040	A little
4020040	4022040	A little bit of killing with a knife
4022040	4024040	What do you mean?
4024040	4026040	That is to say
4026040	4028040	In fact, the diagnosis method
4028040	4030040	All very clear
4030040	4032040	But if you continue to draw a
4032040	4034040	If you only pay attention to
4034040	4036040	If you only pay attention to the effect level
4036040	4038040	You have to spend so much energy
4038040	4040040	FMI
4040040	4042040	Then do these very complex analyses
4042040	4044040	Then
4044040	4046040	In fact, I think
4046040	4048040	A little bit of killing with a knife
4048040	4050040	That is
4050040	4052040	A simple thing
4052040	4054040	I think
4054040	4056040	This kind of function
4056040	4058040	Especially for me
4058040	4060040	Is Parkinson's subpopulation
4060040	4062040	I think it should be easier
4062040	4064040	Easier to do
4064040	4066040	Psychology
4066040	4068040	Life Function
4068040	4070040	Then
4070040	4072040	Why is it important?
4072040	4074040	Because it seems to be my own
4074040	4076040	Related
4076040	4078040	Music
4078040	4080040	Wait a minute
4080040	4082040	I can't hear it now
4086040	4088040	There is a child
4088040	4090040	Talking
4090040	4092040	The child is not on my side
4092040	4094040	The child is not on my side
4094040	4096040	The child is not on my side
4096040	4098040	Ok
4098040	4100040	Let me continue
4100040	4102040	I think
4102040	4104040	Take this set of tools to do subpopulation
4104040	4106040	May be more interesting
4106040	4108040	Because like
4108040	4110040	Some people
4110040	4112040	For example, there is a rhythm
4112040	4114040	To help Parkinson's disease
4114040	4116040	To help them control
4116040	4118040	Action control
4118040	4120040	Although it works very well for some people
4120040	4122040	But on another group of people
4122040	4124040	Some Parkinson's disease people
4124040	4126040	The effect is very poor
4126040	4128040	Then this aspect
4128040	4130040	I don't know why
4130040	4132040	Then I think
4132040	4134040	There may also be such a problem
4134040	4136040	Then I think
4136040	4138040	You can find more
4138040	4140040	General neuropsychological
4140040	4142040	Can't do
4142040	4144040	Then I think
4144040	4146040	Rather than saying this is a biomarker
4146040	4148040	I think
4148040	4150040	This purpose will be stronger
4150040	4152040	For me
4152040	4154040	Ok
4154040	4156040	Let me talk a little bit
4156040	4158040	Because I'm a little lazy
4158040	4160040	So I only put
4160040	4162040	May be a biomarker
4162040	4164040	In fact, we do this thing
4164040	4166040	There are other purposes
4166040	4168040	The first one is that I said at the beginning
4168040	4170040	The so-called disease prediction
4170040	4172040	The original
4172040	4174040	The ideal state is
4174040	4176040	Then build a very powerful
4176040	4178040	Then we can
4178040	4180040	Because of this statistical power
4180040	4182040	Can
4182040	4184040	Produce a
4184040	4186040	It's a bit like a disease model
4186040	4188040	Then if we have new patients
4188040	4190040	When we come in
4190040	4192040	We can put his data into this disease model
4192040	4194040	To try
4194040	4196040	Can we predict
4196040	4198040	What is the situation after five or ten years
4198040	4200040	Because we can't really wait for him
4200040	4202040	After five or ten years
4202040	4204040	Use some drugs to control
4204040	4206040	If we find
4206040	4208040	I knew it was possible
4208040	4210040	Will become more serious
4210040	4212040	Can we take some
4212040	4214040	Preventive measures
4214040	4216040	Then another
4216040	4218040	The purpose is
4218040	4220040	So far
4220040	4222040	Although the drug results can be controlled
4222040	4224040	Such as tremor
4224040	4226040	These can be controlled quite well
4226040	4228040	But there are a lot of patients
4228040	4230040	In fact, there is no way to use drugs
4230040	4232040	So recently there are some people
4232040	4234040	Spent a lot of effort
4234040	4236040	In the study of so-called cognitive training
4236040	4238040	They hope to use non-invasive
4238040	4240040	No need to use drugs
4240040	4242040	Just use training
4242040	4244040	Can treat Parkinson's
4244040	4246040	Obstacle to cognitive function
4246040	4248040	But before doing this
4248040	4250040	You have to know their cognitive function first
4250040	4252040	Their whole
4252040	4254040	What is the Cognitive Profile
4254040	4256040	And even which domain is most likely to be affected
4256040	4258040	Or which brain area
4258040	4260040	The brain area responsible for those cognitive functions
4260040	4262040	Is the weakest
4262040	4264040	Will be attacked
4264040	4266040	So this is why
4266040	4268040	When we do local measures
4268040	4270040	These brain areas are actually in Parkinson's disease
4270040	4272040	It's more dangerous and less likely to be attacked
4272040	4274040	That is, if we want to develop
4274040	4276040	Non-invasive
4276040	4278040	Treatment
4278040	4280040	We can say
4280040	4282040	For example, pre-SMA
4282040	4284040	We target this area
4284040	4286040	Design some cognitive functions
4286040	4288040	To strengthen the neural network of this area
4288040	4290040	It is possible to use this way
4290040	4292040	We can improve
4292040	4294040	Its cognitive function
4294040	4296040	A bit like this
4296040	4298040	This is more interesting
4298040	4300040	In addition
4300040	4302040	I know
4304040	4306040	My own research is
4306040	4308040	When listening to a more recent pattern
4308040	4310040	Pre-SMA disease is active
4310040	4312040	This is an externalization
4312040	4314040	Another question is
4314040	4316040	For example
4316040	4318040	In terms of signal interpretation
4318040	4320040	You mentioned
4320040	4322040	For example, a patient with Parkinson's disease
4322040	4324040	Compared to a person with typical control
4324040	4326040	Their signal
4326040	4328040	Will be stronger
4328040	4330040	Am I right?
4330040	4332040	But you mentioned
4332040	4334040	This is a conversation hypothesis
4334040	4336040	But I don't know what you're talking about
4336040	4338040	Because I've heard this hypothesis many times
4338040	4340040	In fact, this hypothesis is true
4340040	4342040	You can talk about it in reverse
4342040	4344040	If the signal is strong, it is a conversation
4344040	4346040	Where is the accuracy?
4346040	4348040	Do you understand what I mean?
4348040	4350040	I believe this is not my first question
4350040	4352040	What do you think of this question?
4352040	4354040	In fact, you asked this question
4354040	4356040	Many clinical researchers are asking
4356040	4358040	I would say
4358040	4360040	If you are single
4360040	4362040	For example, you only have fMRI data
4362040	4364040	Then you see
4364040	4366040	In theory, you expect patients to show
4366040	4368040	Lower value
4368040	4370040	But the result shows that the patient's value has risen
4370040	4372040	This may be a conversation effect
4372040	4374040	But if you want to talk about conversation effect
4374040	4376040	You need to have another piece of data
4376040	4378040	To support it
4378040	4380040	For example, you have behavior
4380040	4382040	When doing the same thing
4382040	4384040	The patient did better than normal people
4384040	4386040	In this case
4386040	4388040	Or there is no difference
4388040	4390040	We have another piece of data
4390040	4392040	We can say it is a conversation effect
4392040	4394040	In addition, in recent years
4394040	4396040	There is a rather popular topic
4396040	4398040	They are called male adaptation
4398040	4400040	When you see the value rise
4400040	4402040	It may not necessarily mean
4402040	4404040	It is just a so-called male adaptation
4404040	4406040	Maybe this connection
4406040	4408040	It is controlled by another network
4408040	4410040	But because of the disease
4410040	4412040	The network that controls this connection
4412040	4414040	It's not that good
4414040	4416040	It has no male function
4416040	4418040	It can't control that network
4418040	4420040	If you control that connection
4420040	4422040	Then you see the value of the connection
4422040	4424040	You think it may be
4424040	4426040	It may be a conversation effect
4426040	4428040	But maybe it's just because
4428040	4430040	The network that controls it
4430040	4432040	There is no way to do it properly
4432040	4434040	There may be a total pattern change
4434040	4436040	It's not just a problem with the connectivity
4436040	4438040	I think
4438040	4440040	The data dimension is very large
4440040	4442040	In fact, to explain
4442040	4444040	I think it's very difficult
4444040	4446040	I have another question
4446040	4448040	It's about signal processing
4448040	4450040	This is a more general connectivity issue
4450040	4452040	That is to say
4452040	4454040	If you use both signals
4454040	4456040	If you look at it
4456040	4458040	But since both signals are blood vessels
4458040	4460040	The signal at each point in the blood vessel
4460040	4462040	It's not independent
4462040	4464040	My blood vessels have upstream and downstream
4464040	4466040	My downstream signal is of course dependent
4466040	4468040	How do you know
4468040	4470040	How do you know
4470040	4472040	This is a neural signal
4472040	4474040	This is a neural connectivity signal
4474040	4476040	Not a blood vessel connectivity signal
4476040	4478040	I can tell you
4478040	4480040	I have no way to know
4480040	4482040	That's why I said before
4482040	4484040	It's a very dirty signal
4484040	4486040	It's very
4486040	4488040	Not direct
4488040	4490040	And very dirty
4490040	4492040	Its signal actually includes
4492040	4494040	For example, CBB, CBF
4494040	4496040	All these things will affect
4496040	4498040	Even the whole magnetic field
4498040	4500040	Homogeneity will also affect you
4500040	4502040	So frankly
4502040	4504040	I have no way to know
4504040	4506040	Many people use other
4506040	4508040	Mathematical models
4508040	4510040	For example, the balloon model
4510040	4512040	If you want to analyze more
4512040	4514040	More precise mathematical models
4514040	4516040	It's possible to tell you
4516040	4518040	In the end
4518040	4520040	If you split the whole signal into many parts
4520040	4522040	Which parts may not come from
4522040	4524040	Neural is from other
4524040	4526040	This is possible
4526040	4528040	But I didn't list the mathematical model
4528040	4530040	So at the moment I can only say
4530040	4532040	The changes I see
4532040	4534040	We can only assume
4534040	4536040	Most of it comes from neural
4536040	4538040	So we have to do a lot of pre-processing
4538040	4540040	To ensure that the signals we get
4540040	4542040	Are not artificial
4542040	4544040	Not fake
4544040	4546040	I have another
4546040	4548040	Sorry, the last signal question
4548040	4550040	Too often heard
4550040	4552040	I never had an expert to ask me
4552040	4554040	Sorry
4554040	4556040	In addition, the structural hub you mentioned
4556040	4558040	And the functional hub
4558040	4560040	Can be different
4560040	4562040	But I think there is a place
4562040	4564040	I find it difficult to understand
4564040	4566040	For example, if I have a functional hub today
4566040	4568040	There must be a neural connection in the middle
4568040	4570040	Right?
4570040	4572040	That means I'm in the structure today
4572040	4574040	For example, I went to scan the brain today
4574040	4576040	I scanned a bunch of highways
4576040	4578040	Then the neural highway does not go
4578040	4580040	They go to the local alley
4580040	4582040	Right?
4582040	4584040	You just say
4584040	4586040	I don't go to Taipei to Kaohsiung
4586040	4588040	I just cut from Taichung today
4588040	4590040	Cut to Hualien
4590040	4592040	Go there
4592040	4594040	Right
4594040	4596040	How do you explain
4596040	4598040	The difference between the two
4598040	4600040	In addition to the signal problem
4600040	4602040	How is it possible
4602040	4604040	Right
4604040	4606040	Actually, the question you asked
4606040	4608040	No, but this is a good question
4608040	4610040	There are a lot of things in this field
4610040	4612040	Unanswered
4612040	4614040	A lot of people spent a lot of effort to try to answer
4614040	4616040	Then this is one of them
4616040	4618040	Your question is actually discussing
4618040	4620040	The so-called
4620040	4622040	Connection between functional connectivity
4622040	4624040	Structural connectivity
4624040	4626040	This is a big
4626040	4628040	It's like a star and a big field
4628040	4630040	A lot of people are doing
4630040	4632040	Just like us
4632040	4634040	In theory
4634040	4636040	If A and B are these two points
4636040	4638040	There is a structural connection in the middle
4638040	4640040	For example, there is a connection in the middle of the white matter
4640040	4642040	So in theory
4642040	4644040	When you see the functional connection
4644040	4646040	In theory, you should also see the structural connection
4646040	4648040	This makes sense
4648040	4650040	Because you must have something to let you go
4650040	4652040	When doing analysis
4652040	4654040	We often see
4654040	4656040	For example, between A and B
4656040	4658040	There is a functional connection in the middle
4658040	4660040	But there is no functional connection in the middle
4660040	4662040	There are many different
4662040	4664040	There are many roles
4664040	4666040	There are many possibilities
4666040	4668040	For example, between A and B
4668040	4670040	For example, there is no white connection
4670040	4672040	But maybe
4672040	4674040	There is a third point C
4674040	4676040	It connects A and B
4676040	4678040	It is possible that the signal is from C
4678040	4680040	It is possible that the signal is from A to C
4680040	4682040	It is possible
4682040	4684040	In addition to the signal and the possibility
4684040	4686040	In addition to the signal and the possibility
4686040	4688040	We can't
4688040	4690040	We can't
4690040	4692040	Tell you why
4692040	4694040	This is why we have been trying
4694040	4696040	Want to understand the functional connection
4696040	4698040	The relationship between structural connection
4698040	4700040	I have an idea
4700040	4702040	Because like people
4702040	4704040	Generally outside
4704040	4706040	For example, our brain is being trained
4706040	4708040	General daily life training
4708040	4710040	For example, there will be a lot of complex visual and auditory scenarios
4710040	4712040	For example, there will be a lot of complex visual and auditory scenarios
4712040	4714040	You have to interact with a lot of people
4714040	4716040	These should be well
4716040	4718040	The brain has to deal with the most
4718040	4720040	But today you lie in the FMI
4720040	4722040	For example, it is a resting state
4722040	4724040	And listen to a bunch of noise
4724040	4726040	In fact, it is a very unnatural situation
4726040	4728040	In fact, it is a very unnatural situation
4728040	4730040	You just tell him
4730040	4732040	I just don't want you to walk the highway today
4732040	4734040	I just want you to walk a very strange one
4734040	4736040	Then lie down for a few minutes
4736040	4738040	So I think maybe
4738040	4740040	Is it because of this reason
4740040	4742040	Because it is not under the nature of nature
4742040	4744040	So I can't find the function
4744040	4746040	The same situation
4746040	4748040	This is also possible
4748040	4750040	This is also possible
4750040	4752040	There is a kind
4752040	4754040	In fact, when the resting state just came out
4754040	4756040	A lot of people are
4756040	4758040	There are a lot of discussions about this matter
4758040	4760040	There is another way
4760040	4762040	In addition to FMI
4762040	4764040	You can use EEG or MEG
4764040	4766040	Different modality
4766040	4768040	To measure its functional
4768040	4770040	EEG and MEG environment
4770040	4772040	Compared to functional MRI
4772040	4774040	Are closer to human normal living environment
4774040	4776040	So in this way
4776040	4778040	Maybe what you get
4778040	4780040	Will be closer to normal
4780040	4782040	Under the situation
4784040	4786040	I hope so. Thank you for your answer.
4786040	4788040	Sorry
4788040	4790040	OK
4790040	4792040	Any other questions?
4792040	4794040	Can I continue to ask questions?
4794040	4796040	Can I ask a question first?
4796040	4798040	Follow Andrew's question
4798040	4800040	OK
4800040	4802040	Do you want to ask other questions?
4802040	4804040	I might ask some
4804040	4806040	Everyone's questions
4806040	4808040	Then I will follow Andrew
4808040	4810040	You just said
4810040	4812040	How do you know
4812040	4814040	Now the correlation
4814040	4816040	Or any association
4816040	4818040	The nerve
4818040	4820040	Not the blood
4820040	4822040	If
4822040	4824040	I am not
4824040	4826040	The expert in this area
4826040	4828040	But I am thinking
4828040	4830040	Is it possible
4830040	4832040	It's a little strange
4832040	4834040	Something big
4834040	4836040	Into the blood vessel
4836040	4838040	So this thing
4838040	4840040	Will flow with the blood
4840040	4842040	But this thing cannot be used by the nerve
4842040	4844040	Then you can
4844040	4846040	Measure this thing
4846040	4848040	And cut it off
4848040	4850040	In fact, this is a bit like
4850040	4852040	I know
4852040	4854040	In fact, this is a bit like what we are talking about
4854040	4856040	Contrast Enhancement
4856040	4858040	In any image
4858040	4860040	In fact, this is often used in hospitals
4860040	4862040	If it is MRI
4862040	4864040	They will play a contrast called gadolinium
4864040	4866040	This thing will not be
4866040	4868040	Nerve-absorbed
4868040	4870040	It mainly flows with the blood vessel
4870040	4872040	Different places in the body
4872040	4874040	But there is a problem
4874040	4876040	If you are talking about
4876040	4878040	Functional MRI
4878040	4880040	You want to measure the nerve of the brain
4880040	4882040	But once you get to the brain
4882040	4884040	The so-called BBB is the blood vessel
4884040	4886040	There are a lot of drugs that can't get to the brain
4886040	4888040	So this is
4888040	4890040	The problem of contrast
4890040	4892040	In fact, another solution
4892040	4894040	There are a lot of people in the so-called multimodal modality
4894040	4896040	Because we all know
4896040	4898040	FMR has many shortcomings
4898040	4900040	So far we have not been able to
4900040	4902040	To overcome these shortcomings
4902040	4904040	Then we add another modality
4904040	4906040	The other modality
4906040	4908040	It has no FMR shortcomings
4908040	4910040	We hope to combine the advantages
4910040	4912040	For example, you often hear
4912040	4914040	The so-called FMR and EEG simultaneous recording
4914040	4916040	The so-called FMR and EEG simultaneous recording
4916040	4918040	That is, the veterinarian brings the EEG into the FMR at the same time
4918040	4920040	That is, the veterinarian brings the EEG into the FMR at the same time
4920040	4922040	Then you can go to the FMR signal at the same time
4922040	4924040	You can get EEG again
4924040	4926040	EEG signals are cleaner
4926040	4928040	It's less affected by the blood vessel
4928040	4930040	But at the same time
4930040	4932040	This method will cause the EEG signal to be very bad
4932040	4934040	Because as soon as you enter the FMR
4934040	4936040	It will often affect the signal
4936040	4938040	So I can only say
4938040	4940040	There is no absolute good way
4940040	4942040	But many people have tried
4942040	4944040	Want to solve the shortcomings of FMR
4946040	4948040	Okay, I'm done
4948040	4950040	My other question has nothing to do with this
4950040	4952040	So who asked first
4952040	4954040	My own background
4954040	4956040	Is doing machine learning and neuroscience
4956040	4958040	Then
4958040	4960040	I'm very curious about Mesoteli
4960040	4962040	I'm very curious about Mesoteli
4962040	4964040	Like you guys
4964040	4966040	For us
4966040	4968040	Because you use sliding windows
4968040	4970040	Then there is overlapping LAM
4970040	4972040	In a sense
4972040	4974040	You make the strong signal stronger
4974040	4976040	The weak signal becomes weaker
4976040	4978040	So the rest are those
4978040	4980040	Very strong connectivity nodes
4980040	4982040	Then you turn this connectivity
4982040	4984040	Then you turn this connectivity
4984040	4986040	Just look at the hub
4986040	4988040	You can catch some features
4988040	4990040	Then we have some cooperation here
4990040	4992040	The plan is to say
4992040	4994040	If we don't go to the feature part
4994040	4996040	We just use the connectivity matrix
4996040	4998040	To do features
4998040	5000040	Will it be better
5000040	5002040	So usually you will find this connectivity matrix very noisy
5002040	5004040	Then like we did
5004040	5006040	If we take the matrix between different patients
5006040	5008040	To do a distance computation
5008040	5010040	We wanted to predict the result
5010040	5012040	Is it possible to see it in our machine learning method
5012040	5014040	For example, people with Parkinson's
5014040	5016040	Brain activity will be more like
5016040	5018040	Then there is a non-connectivity
5018040	5020040	And distance will be farther
5020040	5022040	But it doesn't seem to have this effect
5022040	5024040	I want to ask you
5024040	5026040	Is there any theory
5026040	5028040	Or if it's different people, the brain operation is too different
5028040	5030040	So they all have Parkinson's
5030040	5032040	Their brain connectivity may not be the same
5034040	5036040	There is something called intersubject variability
5036040	5038040	This is actually
5038040	5040040	People who do clinical research often encounter
5040040	5042040	Headache problem
5042040	5044040	Although our current research is actually a bit
5044040	5046040	I think it's a bit oversimplified
5046040	5048040	We all say
5048040	5050040	A group of patients and a group of normal people
5050040	5052040	We often say that this is the patient group
5052040	5054040	We see this thing
5054040	5056040	But in fact, because of intersubject variability
5056040	5058040	Everyone's brain is different
5058040	5060040	Everyone is unique
5060040	5062040	The degree of illness
5062040	5064040	May not be the same
5064040	5066040	So this is a reason
5066040	5068040	Why you can't see
5068040	5070040	Because everyone is really different
5070040	5072040	This thing
5072040	5074040	In our lab and our research center
5074040	5076040	Many people encounter this problem
5076040	5078040	Another thing is
5078040	5080040	The method of sliding windows
5080040	5082040	Actually so far
5082040	5084040	Although sliding windows are the most commonly used
5084040	5086040	In fact, frankly, because it is the simplest
5086040	5088040	So everyone uses it, but it has a lot of problems
5088040	5090040	The first one is how long your window length is
5090040	5092040	Then the second one is if your overlap
5092040	5094040	How long is your overlap
5094040	5096040	These are all some problems
5096040	5098040	So now more and more people
5098040	5100040	Will propose different ways
5100040	5102040	To measure the so-called
5102040	5104040	Dynamic Functional Connectivity
5104040	5106040	For example, there seems to be one
5106040	5108040	What is it called
5108040	5110040	DCC
5110040	5112040	Conditional Correlation
5112040	5114040	I kind of forgot what it was doing
5114040	5116040	But a lot of people
5116040	5118040	Just go back
5118040	5120040	To use the so-called
5120040	5122040	Mathematical model
5122040	5124040	To calculate the so-called
5124040	5126040	Dynamic Functional Connectivity
5126040	5128040	Then I can ask
5128040	5130040	You said there is a step where you do some
5130040	5132040	Thresholding
5132040	5134040	What is the threshold
5134040	5136040	0.5 or something
5136040	5138040	Thresholding is a big problem
5138040	5140040	According to the information I showed you today
5140040	5142040	In fact, my threshold is 0.3
5142040	5144040	Because I use
5144040	5146040	Simple Correlation
5146040	5148040	Generally speaking, we think that 0.3 or more
5148040	5150040	Is the so-called mild
5150040	5152040	There is a correlation
5152040	5154040	0.3 or less is more like
5154040	5156040	It's hard to say
5156040	5158040	Is there really a correlation
5158040	5160040	But in fact, I have tried other methods
5160040	5162040	There is a
5162040	5164040	Proportional Thresholding
5164040	5166040	Its thresholding is actually not based on
5166040	5168040	Absolute value
5168040	5170040	It is based on the density of the entire matrix
5170040	5172040	That is, I take the front
5172040	5174040	For example, the front
5174040	5176040	30% density
5176040	5178040	In this case, it becomes
5178040	5180040	When you do graph theory
5180040	5182040	Every edge value
5182040	5184040	Every subject has the same value
5184040	5186040	This is actually
5186040	5188040	Strictly speaking, it is a fair way
5188040	5190040	But the drawback is
5190040	5192040	It may not be so sensitive
5192040	5194040	Some things it can't detect
5194040	5196040	Thank you
5196040	5198040	it is good
5204040	5206040	Have you tried
5206040	5208040	Is it better than treatment?
5208040	5210040	I'm doing this
5212040	5214040	Live
5214040	5216040	The question is
5216040	5218040	Is there a comparison of treatment before and after treatment?
5218040	5220040	Then I am currently running in the lab computer
5220040	5222040	That is, the information we receive
5222040	5224040	In fact, there will be
5224040	5226040	We will record
5226040	5228040	When they come
5228040	5230040	OnMedication and OffMedication
5230040	5232040	Ask them not to take medicine the night before
5232040	5234040	Come to us the next morning
5234040	5236040	Ask them to take medicine after scanning
5236040	5238040	Scan again in the afternoon
5238040	5240040	The purpose of this experiment is to see
5240040	5242040	Because they all take LipaDopa
5242040	5244040	It depends on this medicine
5244040	5246040	Will it affect their cognitive ability?
5246040	5248040	Then I just used
5248040	5250040	SlidingWindow method
5250040	5252040	I can tell you in a simple way
5252040	5254040	The simplest way
5254040	5256040	The result is
5256040	5258040	The result of taking medicine and not taking medicine
5258040	5260040	If you take medicine
5260040	5262040	It's hard for me to see
5262040	5264040	The patient who takes medicine is different from the normal person
5264040	5266040	On the contrary, the patient who does not take medicine
5266040	5268040	See a lot of difference from the normal person
5268040	5270040	But this is the problem
5270040	5272040	It sounds very normal
5272040	5274040	Because the patient took the medicine
5274040	5276040	Theoretically, it is more similar to the normal person
5276040	5278040	But if I use different methods
5278040	5280040	The result I see is completely different
5280040	5282040	So I'm still thinking about it
5282040	5284040	Find out which one is the real result
5284040	5286040	The nerve
5286040	5288040	It weakens
5288040	5290040	Maybe it takes a while
5290040	5292040	Or maybe it doesn't take a while
5292040	5294040	For example
5294040	5296040	If you take medicine for a period of time
5296040	5298040	Then
5298040	5300040	Before you take any medicine
5300040	5302040	Just
5302040	5304040	Because I think
5304040	5306040	For example, the nerve
5306040	5308040	It will die
5308040	5310040	It's over
5312040	5314040	So if you go to take medicine
5314040	5316040	It's hard to say
5316040	5318040	For example, it can have a long-term effect the next day
5318040	5320040	No
5320040	5322040	For PT patients
5322040	5324040	Their dopamine is dead
5324040	5326040	Bye-bye
5326040	5328040	The so-called levodopa
5328040	5330040	It's just that the drug will produce
5330040	5332040	Something similar to dopamine
5332040	5334040	They are called left-handed dopamine
5334040	5336040	Use these things
5336040	5338040	To temporarily control his illness
5338040	5340040	Then they
5340040	5342040	The effect of the drug is really hard to say
5342040	5344040	Everyone is different
5344040	5346040	Is there a way
5346040	5348040	Or something
5348040	5350040	Let the cell regenerate
5350040	5352040	Oh this is that
5352040	5354040	Signal plasticity
5354040	5356040	Isn't that what you are doing?
5356040	5358040	You said I misunderstood you
5358040	5360040	The question on the spot
5360040	5362040	Is with that
5362040	5364040	The so-called regeneration
5364040	5366040	Cell regeneration is related
5366040	5368040	Because he is doing plasticity
5368040	5370040	So he asked this question
5370040	5372040	To be frank
5372040	5374040	I'm not very clear
5374040	5376040	But at least so far
5376040	5378040	On the PT patient
5378040	5380040	I heard I haven't heard anything like that
5380040	5382040	But I know
5382040	5384040	Because of my own research
5384040	5386040	In addition to Parkinson's disease
5386040	5388040	Another one called multiple sclerosis
5388040	5390040	Multiple sclerosis
5390040	5392040	The biggest problem with him is that the water is dead
5392040	5394040	We call demyelination
5394040	5396040	There is a vote of people who are studying very seriously
5396040	5398040	Is it possible to remyelination
5398040	5400040	Let him die of water
5400040	5402040	Then come back
5402040	5404040	It should be said
5404040	5406040	Maybe there are some drugs
5406040	5408040	Or some special
5408040	5410040	Genetic treatment or something
5410040	5412040	But this result has not yet been widely accepted
5414040	5416040	Um
5426040	5428040	If you use cognitive functions
5428040	5430040	Indeed now some people will think
5430040	5432040	He developed a set
5432040	5434040	The so-called cognitive training
5434040	5436040	Then let the patient test this cognitive training
5436040	5438040	After a long time
5438040	5440040	This cognitive training can strengthen his
5440040	5442040	One kind of neural connection
5442040	5444040	Even if you don't have so many multiple sclerosis
5444040	5446040	If that neural connection is strengthened
5446040	5448040	To some extent
5448040	5450040	It can maintain your basic brain function
5450040	5452040	That's another one
5452040	5454040	Kind of like
5454040	5456040	Another kind of training
5456040	5458040	Um
5458040	5460040	I haven't seen much
5460040	5462040	Ok
5462040	5464040	Any other questions
5466040	5468040	I think we seem to be talking for a long time
5470040	5472040	Ok
5472040	5474040	Let me take a look
5476040	5478040	Oh
5478040	5480040	Let me take a look at that
5480040	5482040	question
5482040	5484040	Someone asked me to take off the outlier
5484040	5486040	Um
5486040	5488040	I didn't take off the outlier
5488040	5490040	Because I
5490040	5492040	If you look at the picture directly
5492040	5494040	There is no patient
5494040	5496040	It feels like
5496040	5498040	Very different from others
5498040	5500040	But when we are
5500040	5502040	I didn't talk about this experiment today
5502040	5504040	But in other plans
5504040	5506040	We do leave one out
5506040	5508040	That is, when we take the patient's information
5508040	5510040	To do
5510040	5512040	Related to statistics
5512040	5514040	Another thing called leave one out
5514040	5516040	Let's say we have 10 patients today
5516040	5518040	Then we only put 9 in
5518040	5520040	And then after this calculation
5520040	5522040	Take one of them away
5522040	5524040	And then put another one in
5524040	5526040	Just throw one person away at a time
5526040	5528040	And then get a new one
5528040	5530040	So in this case, our final result
5530040	5532040	The result we report is
5532040	5534040	That effect is
5534040	5536040	You will see it every time
5536040	5538040	This kind of effect
5538040	5540040	Strictly speaking, it can be removed
5540040	5542040	Ok
5542040	5544040	Machine learning? Yes
5544040	5546040	We have a group of people doing machine learning
5546040	5548040	But I'm not so familiar with machine learning
5548040	5550040	So I'm still learning
5550040	5552040	Next door
5552040	5554040	But I have one of my own
5554040	5556040	It's called CCA
5556040	5558040	Canonical Correlation Analysis
5558040	5560040	That CCA is actually not
5560040	5562040	It has nothing to do with any image
5562040	5564040	It is purely related to clinical data
5564040	5566040	That is a little bit of the most basic machine learning
5566040	5568040	We are doing that
5568040	5570040	Multi-Modality
5570040	5572040	Multi-Modality
5572040	5574040	Multi-Variant Analysis
5574040	5576040	CCA is two data
5576040	5578040	Trying to project to the same domain
5578040	5580040	You have two different groups of data
5580040	5582040	Oh, I don't have that
5582040	5584040	If you want to merge it
5584040	5586040	Do you have CCA?
5588040	5590040	I'm doing CCA
5590040	5592040	There is actually no different
5592040	5594040	That is purely
5594040	5596040	Two different data for patients
5596040	5598040	One is their demographic
5598040	5600040	That is their age
5600040	5602040	The other set is their cognitive scores
5602040	5604040	Only these two have no impact
5604040	5606040	Can I ask
