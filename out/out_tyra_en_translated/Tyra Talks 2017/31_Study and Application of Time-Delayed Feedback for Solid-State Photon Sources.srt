1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Wow, you should be able to see the screen now.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm starting to record now.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I can see it now.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In 2011, I started, I worked on several projects before I joined Professor Citrin's lab in 2014.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And mainly we have been focusing on two types of optics, two types of phenomena in optics.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Basically, nonlinear optics and quantum optics.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So this is my talk is arranged.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll first introduce my outline, why we care about this study and why we want to do this research.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then I'm going to move on to two other setups.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
One is a semiconductor laser with feedback.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And I'm going to introduce the setup and one of the applications that we have been working on last two years.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The next I'm going to discuss a single photon emitters as we are now capable of generating one single photon at a time.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And we're going to discuss when we place a single photon emitter in front of mirror with feedback, with time delay feedback,

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
but complex or maybe complex phenomena we are hoping to observe.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I'll just start with very, very basic discussions.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So this is a most fundamental feedback system.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's very general use in maybe like mechanical engineering.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
When people study about the control theory, when they place a signal in front of anything,

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and then use the measurement result to feed it back into the system and see what's the phenomena they will observe.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Most of people want to control them.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And this is a big deal in control theory when they try to study this dynamical systems.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So here we see like very, I try to reduce the amount of equation that I have.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is the most simple equations.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is equation of motions.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So equation of motions, instead of just the original experimental parameters,

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
there could be because we have feedback.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So we'll have the delay time.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We have the feedback strength or other things included in the study of the equation of motions.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So this could be applying optics.

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
On these slides, I show two different setups for optics.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:10,000
One on the left is an integrated photonic circuit included inside this small optical electronic component.

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So basically they generate the photon within the wave intensity to generate random numbers.

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So I'll discuss this in more detail later.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But it's a well-studied system.

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
People can use it to generate entropies and or other entropy source.

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So the one on the right is a very similar setup.

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you imagine the semiconductor laser, a laser diode is now replaced with a single photon emitters.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So if here anyone know about laser, you could imagine it's a cavity.

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And then you have a luminant source within the cavity and generate lights.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And when the cavity has the same wavelength or they have the wavelength couples to this quantum dot.

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Actually, this is a quantum dot in the system.

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They could able to generate very high, very pure and very identical indistinguishable photons once at a time.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And we're now interested in placing this single photon emitter in front of a mirror.

44
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And study how we can, how we are able to control it.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And or maybe we cannot control it.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And this will see very interesting dynamics.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So this, so I began with the semiconductor with feedback.

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is this system where typically we'll call this external cavity semiconductor laser.

49
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The system is shown on the right.

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We have a laser.

51
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We place it in front of the mirror.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And we found a simple but I think quite clever way to control this feedback strength feeding back into the laser.

53
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then we can measure the intensity using just a high speed photodiode.

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And while doing this, we're also measuring the voltage with the intensity.

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So in here we see the external cavity length.

56
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So that's another critical parameters in our study.

57
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So that length, well, two times of this length divided by C is the delay time, which we'll discuss later in this slide in the presentations.

58
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, so this is the theory describing the external cavity semiconductor laser.

59
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Basically it's, well, obviously it's called, it's developed by Len and Kobayashi, these two guys.

60
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We basically describe the system with three parameters.

61
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We have electric field.

62
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have optical phase when it's entering the, when the feedback light is entering semiconductors.

63
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And we have the carriers or carrier numbers, which related to voltage measurement as I described in the previous slides.

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So, in this system, there are, so we have, so basically with this model, we can, we have the three equations of motions.

65
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And typically when people study nonlinear dynamics, people will study the behavior near the equilibrium point or in near, well, yes.

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And in our case, it's called external cavity mode.

67
00:08:40,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Basically, when you set this three equations to zero, then you're able to solve a set of solutions that it's stable, or it's just equilibrium, it's equals to zero.

68
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So as I mentioned, we have the external cavity frequency.

69
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is related to the delay time.

70
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And we have the relaxation oscillation frequency.

71
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's some, that's related to the current, the drive current.

72
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And yes, we can move on.

73
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So, in the first step, one of the most interesting thing that we are looking for is looking for a bifurcation diagram bifurcation diagram is when we change one of the parameters.

74
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
In the increasing or decreasing, we'll see the dynamics change according to these parameters.

75
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And the two parameters, two figures below, these are showing the intensity as a function of these parameters.

76
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:20,000
These parameters could be the cup, the feedback strength, as I mentioned before, or you can change the external cavity length, or you can change the drive currents.

77
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And we see this bifurcation, you start very well, quite simple.

78
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is we usually call this continuous wave.

79
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Basically, we have the laser, but it might increase or decrease the light a little bit.

80
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Then we have a jump.

81
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Then we increase this to, we have this bifurcation branch.

82
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So this two branch, that's showing that there's two stable solutions.

83
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So in the intensity, we'll usually see periodic regions.

84
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Basically, we have a sine wave.

85
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then the next we'll have, we will enter two other branch.

86
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
At this point, we'll usually see quasi-periodic.

87
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The next, we'll see chaotic intensity.

88
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, which is usually a big blur or very random thing.

89
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And that's how we use it for random number of generations.

90
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So as we discussed in the previous slides, we now have very well-studied models for a semiconductor laser.

91
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But as most of you must know that a laser is just a bunch of photons.

92
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Even though we can describe the model in very well in electric field and carrier numbers.

93
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But when we are generating a single photon at a time, we might see different behaviors.

94
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So changing from semiconductor lasers to a single photon emitters.

95
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's the second part of my research.

96
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And the one I show on the right is a single photon emitters.

97
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We have a few layers of mirrors.

98
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They're called bright reflectors or just mirrors.

99
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You have a quantum dot embedded in the center of this, of this pillar.

100
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then, so we have the photons emitting or count very confined in three directions.

101
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And we can control the photon frequency a little bit, but not too much.

102
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We can control and how fast we want to excite or excite the quantum dot and get a very nice photon, a single photon.

103
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So I'll first start with some results I have for semiconductor lasers with feedback.

104
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll first describe the properties and then I'm going to discuss one.

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Only one of the applications that we have is called optoelectronic oscillators.

106
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So this is basically our experimental setup with the probe on the right.

107
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We can measure the voltage and the intensity at the same time, which is very, yeah, it's very interesting.

108
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But somehow it hasn't been studied in the last 10, 20 years.

109
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
People usually focus on the intensity, not optical intensity, but not the carriers.

110
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So now with this, we'll be able to get voltage and intensity at the same time.

111
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So this is one of the first few bifurcation diagrams in experiments.

112
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The one I showed you before is theoretical bifurcation diagrams.

113
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So because we're only taking the AC signals, so there's not very change.

114
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There's not that much change in the in the vertical directions.

115
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Only the oscillations are being observed here.

116
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So the parameters that we are changing is the feedback strength.

117
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
As we can see, as we increase the feedback strength, we start from a laser, basically just a CW laser.

118
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And then we have a quasi-periodic regime and then we enter a periodic.

119
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then the next we have chaotic signals.

120
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So we were also able to measure the optical spectra at the same time.

121
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We see that in the CW regions, there's only one optical frequency, meaning just the laser is very stable.

122
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You only have one frequency.

123
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The next we have quasi-periodic regimes, which more than one external cavity mode are being excited.

124
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Then the next we enter the periodic regimes.

125
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
When we see the period is separated by the relaxation oscillation frequency.

126
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The relaxation oscillation frequency, I probably haven't mentioned this.

127
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's depending on the different semiconductor laser, depending on the laser diode and current that you're applying to.

128
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The last, when we increase the feedback strength, we enter a chaotic.

129
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Chaotic region when all of these external modes are being excited.

130
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then in a later work, we'll have another slide showing other method when we characterize how chaotic it is.

131
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So I think I have...

132
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So I have prepared a very short...

133
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Sorry, sorry.

134
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Can you interrupt?

135
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay.

136
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's okay.

137
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, it's already running.

138
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think it's okay.

139
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Is it?

140
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think it's okay.

141
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think it's okay.

142
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think it's okay.

143
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Is it?

144
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's not very continuous, but I think it's okay.

145
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh.

146
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah.

147
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay.

148
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So basically, it's from what I just said, from CW to quasi-periodic to periodic, and then there are some different dynamical regimes.

149
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah.

150
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And this, the next one is, this is chaotic time series for both intensity and the voltage.

151
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think we have enough for this.

152
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay, so can I ask a question?

153
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sure.

154
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So my question is actually for the previous, the prior slide.

155
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So in there, the previous one.

156
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So in there, yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So you have four, not really four, but four graphs, colorful graphs here.

158
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So the D, can you explain that a little bit?

159
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because other three use amplitude for the Y, but this one, this D is for frequency, right?

160
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What does that mean?

161
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yes, so we have four graphs in here.

162
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So for part, for figure A and B, this figure A is the intensity, and figure B is for the voltage.

163
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So they have very similar behaviors, but some, because we have limited voltage resolutions, so some of the small features cannot be observed in the voltage.

164
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The C is just a zoom in of A.

165
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We've been from zero to 25%.

166
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So focusing on first half or first one third of the figure A, and we have, we also have the optical spectrum of the intensity at the same time.

167
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And yes, the four figures in the bottom are representing the optical frequency.

168
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So they are the optical frequency offset by the optical frequency of the laser.

169
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is that okay?

170
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

171
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Sorry about that.

172
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So we have two amplitudes representing the intensity and the voltage.

173
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:13,000
In C and D, we focus on the first half of the intensity and compare that to the optical frequency at the same time.

174
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So we have intensity changing, and also at the same time we can measure the optical frequency that's higher or below the, we usually call this CW frequency, but yeah.

175
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So, and also we see that this, there's a bright stripes that they are separate by the frequency of the relaxation oscillations, relaxation oscillation frequencies.

176
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hello.

177
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Hello.

178
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Uh, I can, I can ask a question.

179
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Is this picture, is this the picture of the bifurcation when we solve the ODE?

180
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes, yes, this is the bifurcation obtained in the experiment.

181
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Bifurcation, I remember because I learned it a long time ago.

182
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But I remember that there's a parameter that changes a little bit and then there's a completely different result. Is that the thing?

183
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's right. So what we've changed now is...

184
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So what's changed in here?

185
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What's changed is the feedback strength, which is how much you get back when you just shoot it out.

186
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh, oh.

187
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So it's, let me think about it, let me see if there's this, okay.

188
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Can you see this electric field, this one?

189
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Uh, 10?

190
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
There's a Kappa behind the electric field in the Opal Archimedes model.

191
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Uh-huh.

192
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's what we can actually change in practice.

193
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh.

194
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We've changed a lot of things later on, but nothing else.

195
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is the simplest and I think the most controllable.

196
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay, okay, thank you.

197
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So basically, we control feedback strength.

198
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And we can see that the bifurcation diagram looks like this.

199
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This diagram is...

200
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This diagram took me a long time to make, and I'm really bad at it.

201
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It took me a long time to make it.

202
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Anyway, okay.

203
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So next.

204
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So in this slide, I'm going to discuss only one of the applications of this system.

205
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So this is called an optical electronic oscillator.

206
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This is typical use when we need to generate very high frequencies, but...

207
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Sorry.

208
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
High frequency of RF signals.

209
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's very difficult for us to use a quartz oscillator,

210
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and use other multipliers to generate the same periodic frequencies.

211
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So on the top, this is for generating a periodic voltage signal,

212
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
because we have direct access to the voltage now.

213
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We have very high...

214
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Well, we have pretty high quality factors,

215
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and then we can get the phase jitter less than, I think, 10 to the minus 4 microseconds.

216
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So the frequency now we're generating at this, it's almost 10 gigahertz.

217
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay, so the ones below, these are to generate chaotic signals.

218
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
People usually ask, we usually want an RF signal, a periodic signal.

219
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Why we care about chaotic waveform or chaotic signals?

220
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So the answer is quite simple, actually.

221
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So people are trying to use...

222
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:57,000
In all the cryptographies, people use random number generations.

223
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But usually when we have the random number generations in electronic systems,

224
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
it's typically not a real random.

225
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
There are still some type of trace that we can find,

226
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and usually they are much slower.

227
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So in here, we generate the chaotic signal,

228
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and then we can use it as a type of random number generations.

229
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
There are other characterization methods for how randomness,

230
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,000
what's the randomness or how chaotic we are for the signal.

231
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This is one of the results.

232
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So this is called largest Lyapunov exponent.

233
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
As someone mentioned, sorry, I didn't catch your name.

234
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,000
As someone mentioned before, this is the separation when two signals at time equals zero

235
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and time equals sometimes.

236
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And then the separation of these two signals in its state space,

237
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
if this signal, the space or the distance they are separating

238
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
is proportional to time,

239
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
there is a very exponent and you take the log,

240
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and then you can see if this is chaotic,

241
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
you will have a positive largest Lyapunov exponent.

242
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This is a very, one of the simple way,

243
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:01,000
well studied way to study how chaotic a signal is.

244
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So next I'm going to discuss what happens if we place a single photon emitters with feedback.

245
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think maybe Leo is here.

246
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He also have few publications on feedback for waveguides.

247
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So for me, I'm just going to discuss feedbacks,

248
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
a single photon feedback in optical regimes.

249
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'll first discuss why feedback loop is important in quantum limits.

250
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:49,000
As I showed before, this is basically how a feedback system looks like.

251
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
There are two methods of feedback loops,

252
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
where we try to prepare quantum states.

253
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So the one in figure A, this is a measurement-based feedback loop.

254
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So you measure something, you want to prepare either zero or one,

255
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and then you measure it.

256
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
If it's not a target state,

257
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
you just apply a Z gate or minus something times Z gate

258
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to feed it back into the quantum system and prepare the state as you wish.

259
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It has been done experimentally, shown in figure C.

260
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So this is just a feedback for, I think, single ions, I believe.

261
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So it's easy to prepare an ion within a cavity.

262
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So the other method, which I'm more interested,

263
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
or most people are more interested in,

264
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
is called coherent feedback.

265
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Without making the measurement,

266
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
if we put a mirror in front of this photon source,

267
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,000
we can actually prepare the quantum dot in one of the target states.

268
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So the important of this is,

269
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
or the major difference is, with coherent feedback,

270
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,000
we can actually prepare the dot in the superposition states.

271
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Unlike the measurement-based feedback,

272
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
we can usually target in zero or one.

273
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I think not many people are.

274
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Anyway, so again, we have

275
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
the equation of motions.

276
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Feedback schemes are control schemes using time delay.

277
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So they are period guess, type feed control,

278
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
rhythmic control, and extended time delay feedback.

279
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So here, the coherent feedback can be used as period guess type control

280
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
to eliminate the unstable orbit.

281
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Okay.

282
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So the advantage of period guess type feedback is to provide,

283
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
of course, feedback instantly.

284
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It can be applied in every regime to stabilize a system.

285
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's non-invasive.

286
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And one of the best thing is if the delay time,

287
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
which should be a controllable parameter,

288
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the delay time, if it's matching the intrinsic orbital period,

289
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
it actually has a stabilizing effect.

290
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And the last is it's preserving the coherent state

291
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
without making the measurement.

292
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This is probably one of the most important for quantum systems.

293
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So before we start on the study of feedback,

294
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm going to discuss a little bit,

295
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
just introduce how a single emitter looks like.

296
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So this, the figure on the right, bottom right,

297
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
this is a single photon emitters that our collaborating,

298
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that our collaborator are manufacturing in the laboratory.

299
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Basically, it's three, five semiconductor materials

300
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
with embedded quantum dot inside in the center.

301
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
They have very clever way to etch out the parts

302
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
that's outside of the regions.

303
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So all they left is very well-defined micro pillars.

304
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And they have the optical frequency matched to this frequency,

305
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
to the transition frequency of the quantum dots.

306
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And we have two other parameters,

307
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
that's the coupling strength and the decay rate of the quantum dot.

308
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Basically, if the decay rate is too high,

309
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
we call this a weak coupling regions

310
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
that the photon emits,

311
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:17,000
they emit the photon outside of the desired optical frequencies.

312
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So, okay.

313
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So for one single photon with feedback,

314
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,000
we will have studied the behavior of a single photon feedback.

315
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So, on the right, we have three figures.

316
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The first is without the external cavity, without feedback.

317
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So that's emitting a single photons.

318
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The next when we have certain condition match

319
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
for the external cavity length or the delay time

320
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
with the transition time or the rapid frequency

321
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
in the quantum dot,

322
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
we can drive the system,

323
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
even though it's in a weak coupling regions,

324
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:26,000
we can drive them in a very periodic way.

325
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So the one that I produce in the bottom is,

326
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I use the same method to generate the same result.

327
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So I can compare with their result in the future.

328
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So we can generate very long periodic signals with feedback.

329
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
As I mentioned before, the way that,

330
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
so the figure on the left, this is classical.

331
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
When we have the delay time,

332
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:14,000
that is a multiple of the period,

333
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
intrinsic period of a system.

334
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
When this system match to the frequency of the delay time,

335
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
they will have very high repetitions.

336
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Basically, the orbit is more or less stabilizing itself.

337
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So they have level one, two, three, four, five, something.

338
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That's the multiple of these two matching.

339
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The one on the right,

340
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I use it for a quantum.

341
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This is the same feedback in quantum regions.

342
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Basically, we have the similar process,

343
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:15,000
but the decay or the repetition of two signals are decreasing much faster

344
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
than periodic feedback.

345
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
These are just a demonstration of how it looks like.

346
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We have the delay time at three different colors

347
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
in the color figures.

348
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know how to say this.

349
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The top in figure C,

350
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
we see that if the delay time is not multiple of this,

351
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,000
the orbit is not very repetitive.

352
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
As we increase the delay time,

353
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
we see the orbit is trying to match to the intrinsic orbit.

354
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's very repetitive as we change the delay time.

355
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Next, I'm going to discuss stability analysis.

356
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This is a very common study to study any dynamical system,

357
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
especially with feedback.

358
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
When we have the feedback,

359
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:56,000
we'll try to calculate if a system is stable or it's a repeller,

360
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
it's stable, or it's a saddle point.

361
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The criteria or the typical method is first to find the stationary state

362
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
or equilibrium states where all the equation of motions are being zero.

363
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The next is to find the Jacobian.

364
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Then to study the stability,

365
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
we find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian.

366
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:39,000
For a stable system,

367
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
the eigenvalue of the Jacobian will be the negative,

368
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
or the real part of is negative.

369
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Repeller, we have a positive real part.

370
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The saddle point will have some of the eigenvalues being positive

371
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and some of them being negative.

372
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Okay, so how do we study such system in a quantum system?

373
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
How do we study such dynamical behavior

374
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
that we describe usually in a classical system,

375
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
in a quantum system?

376
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:31,000
First, it's simple because we already have the equation of motions.

377
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The one we have here,

378
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
the phi is a superposition of three states.

379
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We have excited quantum dots being CE,

380
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and we have micro cavity photons being CG,

381
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
or I think I labeled CC here, sorry.

382
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We have a photon in the external cavity being CGK.

383
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So we can, it's not that hard to,

384
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
and then we have the Hamiltonian that describe these interactions.

385
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So we can just apply this wave function to the Hamiltonian,

386
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and then we can get, well, in Schrodinger's picture,

387
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and then we can get the equation three, well, equation of motions.

388
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Interestingly, because this G of KT is describing the coupling element

389
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
between each mode,

390
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
the population in, sorry,

391
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:04,000
the population in the external cavity is the superposition of infinite mode, right?

392
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So this G of KT spans from negative infinity to positive infinity,

393
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
basically describe the coupling between the micro-pillar cavity

394
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and the external cavity modes.

395
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So we think that we have only three equation of motions,

396
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but actually the third one is actually,

397
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,000
it's like infinite dimension of equation of, sorry,

398
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
of the modes that have very high dimensions.

399
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So we see this in the denominators here,

400
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:10,000
C of CK and the summation of that going back into the micro-cavity.

401
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
As I mentioned before, what's the first, what's the steps that we have?

402
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So first we find the equilibrium point.

403
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So because we, so that's our showing here.

404
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
If C of C, if the, oh, shit, sorry.

405
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:43,000
If we design the initial conditions of CE, CG and CK in this very specific ways,

406
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
we'll have them all being stationary.

407
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's actually a stationary state and they have its own oscillating frequencies,

408
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
minus GT, minus GT.

409
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And for this, for the state in the external cavity,

410
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:14,000
each of them, they rotate along this K axis at different rate.

411
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But this is actually very easy to imagine if it's, so, okay, sorry.

412
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So if you see the expression for C of CK for the stationary states,

413
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
this is a sinc function.

414
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:41,000
A sinc function is actually a Fourier transform of a square function.

415
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So this is just a square, a steady state in the external cavity length.

416
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It's have the same optical intensity if you imagine in this way.

417
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So the next step is obviously try to find the Jacobian.

418
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
For that, we apply small signal models.

419
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Again, this is a Jacobian of infinite dimensions.

420
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It's almost infinite dimensions.

421
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Of course, in simulations, I'll be able to only trace down a few of them.

422
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Well, many of them actually.

423
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So by applying small signal models, we can find the Jacobians.

424
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
With the Jacobians, we'll be able to calculate the eigenvalues.

425
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well, here we have make a small replacement

426
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
by just letting us to calculate the eigenvalues more easily.

427
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The next step is actually to calculate the eigenvalues itself.

428
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So from the result that we have,

429
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
we can write out the function of determinant of this Jacobian.

430
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Next, we can able to calculate the eigenvalues on the top.

431
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
So there are three different case.

432
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:29,000
The first case is we have the optical frequency of our photons, right?

433
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So if the external cavity length match to multiples of the wavelength of the photons,

434
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:49,000
we'll have the Jacobian as a function of r, which I forgot to write here.

435
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
r is you can imagine as a feedback rate.

436
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But r is actually the rate of decay rate over the coupling strength.

437
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So it's actually 4 gamma over g.

438
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Let me remind you and remind myself what gamma and g is.

439
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So it's 4, OK, sorry, 4 gamma over g.

440
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,000
That's how we characterize a good or a bad cavity.

441
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:35,000
So with that, we can plot all these eigenvalues.

442
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So the one on the in case one, we have these conditions.

443
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We have, well, so they look very similar.

444
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But if you plot them in the same graph, they are different.

445
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So we can have, and this is the imaginary part of this Jacobian of the J tilde,

446
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:23,000
which is, we care about this because the eigenvalues of J tilde times C over L times the I, imaginary part,

447
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:31,000
will have the real eigenvalues of the J delta.

448
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So OK, so basically what I'm trying to say is if we have eigenvalues for imaginary tilde or pi,

449
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:57,000
this value being positive will have a stable system and vice versa, of course.

450
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:12,000
The one on the bottom, this is the real part of the eigenvalues and the imaginary part of the eigenvalues,

451
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:22,000
but plotted as different value of R, different value of this R values.

452
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Again, when we have eigenvalues in the upper half, we have a stable and the ones in the bottom is unstable.

453
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
What I'm trying to do here is to see if this is stable.

454
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Then we're trying to see if this can work as a stabilizer.

455
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So if this has stabilizing effect for a state that's in superpositions,

456
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I think I should mention here.

457
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,000
As I briefly discussed in previous slides,

458
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:22,000
the coherent feedback are able to prepare the quantum states in superposition states,

459
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
which is not accessible for measurement-based feedback loop.

460
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:39,000
OK, so this is typically how we draw, we call this black sphere,

461
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
but typically this is characterized how, what's the superposition of two states.

462
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:58,000
If it's here on the black sphere, it's well superposition states.

463
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So we chose different initial conditions,

464
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and we see that they are trying to stabilizing itself.

465
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Well, the red curve is help you, just to help to guide the eyes.

466
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:29,000
We see that this stabilizing or the rate that this probability is decaying

467
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
match to the positive parts of the eigenvalues.

468
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So these values actually match perfectly with this decay rate.

469
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So we see that this, and we see this, we call this bit error.

470
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
This is, usually we want half probability of a state,

471
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
half probability for one state and half for the other.

472
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But most of the time, when we cannot prepare them perfectly,

473
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
we have this bit error.

474
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:20,000
In this study, I'm showing you that this bit error can be stabilized as time goes.

475
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
This bit error could be stabilized.

476
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And the next is to study the non-linearity of the excitation state or Fock state.

477
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Okay, anyway, it's called Fock state.

478
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Basically study how many photons are there in a quantum system.

479
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Because in here, I only study only one excited states.

480
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And the next step is obvious to study the different number of states.

481
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So at this point, I only have one single excitation and two excitation states.

482
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But good thing is we have the same Hamiltonians.

483
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So it is possible to write out the equation of motions as we did before,

484
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
and to study the stability from there.

485
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But that hasn't been done.

486
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That's one of my future works.

487
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
The other thing is if this stabilize the phase error,

488
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,000
the phase error is demonstrated when all these initial states are aligned on the chidal.

489
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And then we see if they are fake.

490
00:53:48,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So on the figure A, this is showing they start in equal probability,

491
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
but they have different phase.

492
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What's the dynamics of this initial states?

493
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
We see that it doesn't look like it's stabilizing,

494
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:24,000
or it might have very slow stabilizing rate that's not shown here.

495
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yes, so we reached the conclusions.

496
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I show two different types of optical feedbacks.

497
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
First, I study the external cavity semiconductor lasers.

498
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And we show the voltage and intensity bifurcations diagrams.

499
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
We are able to demonstrate one of the applications.

500
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It's called optical electronic oscillators for generating periodic and chaotic waveform.

501
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And then we can plot the phase portrait as we change the feedback strength,

502
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
which also haven't been done before.

503
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Then, yeah, I forgot to show the other slides.

504
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And then we move on to optical feedback in single photon regimes.

505
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So we have very good results that match with other people's work.

506
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:41,000
We are able to show coherent feedback of single photon emitters.

507
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:55,000
We study the effect of external cavity length, or the delay time as

508
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
of the effect of the stabilizations.

509
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Next, we have studied nonlinearities for single photon emitters,

510
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
where we have maybe one or two photons at the same time.

511
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The next I show also show the stabilizing stability analysis for single excitation states.

512
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
We can improve the theoretical models that we have,

513
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
mostly in the two excitation states,

514
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and see how we can get equilibrium states in that case.

515
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And we're looking to study the stability analysis for two excitation states.

516
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And we want to see, possibly, well, we are hoping to see,

517
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
in two or more higher excitation numbers,

518
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
are we going to transition to quantum chaos,

519
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
or maybe it's always stable.

520
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Okay, thank you.

521
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Yes, that's all.

522
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That's an hour and more.

523
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Hi, everyone.

524
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Thank you, Jianyuan.

525
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Let me ask a question first.

526
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Sorry, everyone.

527
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Let me ask a question first.

528
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
This question might be a little...

529
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Can you talk about the application of this?

530
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Because I think when you're talking,

531
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
you've been...

532
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I might have missed it.

533
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You've been talking about how to stabilize it.

534
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
But what does it do?

535
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Do you know what I mean?

536
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yes, I do.

537
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
What you're probably trying to ask is,

538
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
in quantum mechanics,

539
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
what are the benefits of being able to stabilize?

540
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yes.

541
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
What are the benefits of quantum mechanics?

542
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
The first one is,

543
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
the method that most people want to use to stabilize

544
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
is this one.

545
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
The one in the upper right corner,

546
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
the C graph.

547
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
You can stabilize it,

548
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
but you might...

549
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I'm not sure if you guys know much about quantum mechanics.

550
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
If you want to stabilize...

551
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I don't know.

552
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I don't know.

553
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You can only stabilize it in 0 or 1 state.

554
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Hello?

555
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Hello, I'm listening.

556
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Usually, the state we need is called K-state.

557
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Or what is it called?

558
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
GHZ state.

559
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Anyway, it wants to be in a superposition state.

560
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
In quantum mechanics,

561
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
a lot of things want to be in 0 or 1 superposition state.

562
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But if you use measurement-based,

563
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
you can't stabilize it.

564
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But now people say,

565
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
let's use coherent feedback.

566
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But we don't know why coherent feedback can stabilize it.

567
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Or what kind of parameters does coherent feedback need

568
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
for it to be stabilized.

569
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Oh, I understand.

570
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Our goal is to make it in 0 or 1 superposition state.

571
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
This is 0 or 1 superposition state.

572
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yes.

573
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Okay, I understand.

574
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Does anyone have any questions?

575
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I also want to ask a low-level question.

576
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I don't have a low-level question.

577
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
We need to stabilize it.

578
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
But if I remember correctly...

579
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I haven't taught for a long time,

580
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
so I don't remember.

581
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
But if you use feedback,

582
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
control theory should use feedback.

583
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Hello, I'm still online.

584
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Hello, can you hear me?

585
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Use feedback to control theory.

586
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Yes, yes, yes.

587
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Feedback, then control theory to correct.

588
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Then get feedback to correct.

589
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But in quantum mechanics,

590
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
the so-called state should be called...

591
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
You can get that state right away.

592
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Is there a way to keep correcting

593
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
to get the final state we want?

594
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Because in quantum mechanics,

595
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
when we want something to be in a certain state,

596
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
shouldn't we want to get it right away?

597
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I know...

598
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I know a little about control theory.

599
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But I know in control theory,

600
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
it uses passive and active control.

601
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I remember in passive control...

602
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
In fact, this should be considered

603
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
a kind of passive control.

604
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
But because it's not...

605
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Because the point is, like I said,

606
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
this coherent feedback,

607
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
its advantage is...

608
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Suppose this is active feedback,

609
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
how much does it measure?

610
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Maybe use a PID loop

611
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
to add or subtract how much

612
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
to make it into the state you want.

613
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But in quantum mechanics,

614
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
basically,

615
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
what it can use is limited.

616
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
So in fact,

617
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
the coherent feedback here

618
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
is more of a passive feedback.

619
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
As long as you don't...

620
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
As long as you don't...

621
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
You don't have this measurement process.

622
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You can't say you're measuring

623
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
positive 0.1 or negative 0.1,

624
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and then you feedback a negative 0.1 back.

625
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Because the point is,

626
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
if you do this measurement,

627
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
it will affect the time

628
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
in its superposition.

629
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I think everyone

630
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
should have heard of something like this.

631
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
If you do the measurement,

632
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
it will affect the state

633
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
of the superposition.

634
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I see.

635
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
So it's not measuring,

636
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
but there's feedback,

637
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and you want to reach

638
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
a stabilized state.

639
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
This is what I've been discussing

640
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
in the second half.

641
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I see.

642
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Thank you.

643
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Let me ask another question.

644
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
If...

645
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
If...

646
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
If you can now

647
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
increase its

648
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
stability,

649
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
theoretically,

650
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
can you calculate

651
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
the same...

652
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
the same...

653
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I can hear you.

654
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
If...

655
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
If you can now increase

656
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
its stability,

657
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
theoretically,

658
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
you can now

659
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
calculate the same time

660
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
or whatever unit,

661
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
can you increase

662
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
its certainty?

663
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I don't know much about

664
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
content information.

665
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

666
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Increase its certainty.

667
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Because now

668
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
it's between 0 and 1,

669
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
it's not uncertain, right?

670
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
In the past,

671
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
you've stabilized it between 0 and 1,

672
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
so it's uncertain.

673
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Am I right?

674
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
No, you're not.

675
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But here,

676
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
its...

677
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
What?

678
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Let me think.

679
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
What's your question?

680
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Right.

681
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
But...

682
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Can you

683
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
repeat your question?

684
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

685
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Maybe I didn't understand it

686
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
correctly, but I heard

687
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
someone say

688
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
content information

689
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
has a quality

690
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
that you can't

691
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
calculate

692
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
accurately.

693
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
But you can get to a certain

694
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
probability, you know what I mean?

695
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
It has intrinsic

696
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
uncertainty or something like that.

697
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Right.

698
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
This thing...

699
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
If I understand

700
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
what you said

701
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
correctly,

702
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
this thing...

703
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
They're talking about

704
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
how to measure the final result.

705
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
To measure the final result,

706
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
because you

707
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
measured it 10 times,

708
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and there were 7 times...

709
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Let's say there were 7 times.

710
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
If 7 times is 1,

711
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
you'd think

712
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
you'd write it as

713
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
density matrix, right?

714
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You'd think it's 0.7.

715
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But it's actually wrong.

716
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Because this thing

717
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
called quantum tomography...

718
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's too detailed.

719
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I don't know how to explain it.

720
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Quantum tomography

721
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
uses the maximum likelihood

722
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
method.

723
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
In fact, it's not

724
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
0.7.

725
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
In quantum system,

726
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
in quantum computation,

727
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
it's a very difficult

728
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
problem to measure.

729
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But

730
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
it's different

731
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
from what you asked.

732
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You have to ask

733
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
if the stabilization

734
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
can be reversed.

735
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I think it can.

736
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's actually very easy.

737
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
If you really

738
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
implement this system,

739
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
you can...

740
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Let me think

741
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
which picture is better.

742
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
This one.

743
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You can prepare

744
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
a type,

745
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and measure how long it takes.

746
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
In fact,

747
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
you just do a bunch of measurements

748
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
to see if it matches the service.

749
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I think it can

750
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
reverse the type.

751
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
In fact,

752
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
it can verify

753
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
if what I do

754
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
is correct.

755
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I hope it's correct.

756
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
But

757
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
it depends on

758
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
whether someone can do it.

759
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I think it can.

760
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Okay, thank you.

761
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Hello.

762
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Is this Yan Yong?

763
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Who? Zhang Yong?

764
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Zhang Yong is not here.

765
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Is Zhang Yong here?

766
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Okay.

767
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Zhang Yong

768
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
just joined

769
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
and then disappeared.

770
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I don't know what happened to him.

771
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Okay, ignore him.

772
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
California hasn't

773
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
woken up yet.

774
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I tried to

775
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
see if California woke up.

776
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
California didn't seem to wake up.

777
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's Taiwanese anyway.

778
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Thank you.

779
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Who is in Taiwan?

780
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Actually, I just arrived in Taiwan

781
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
so I'm still awake.

782
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I just returned to Taiwan today.

783
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
What's your name?

784
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Zhang Ying.

785
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
My name is Zhang Biyue.

786
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Biyue.

787
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Okay.

788
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Where are you studying?

789
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I'm in DC, George Washington.

790
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
George Washington University.

791
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Which one?

792
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
George Washington.

793
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
George Washington.

794
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Okay.

795
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I happened to be there for a while.

796
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Yeah.

797
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
What are you studying?

798
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Mechanics.

799
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Oh.

800
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I've been watching a lot of

801
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
mechanical stuff lately.

802
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I watched Control Theory.

803
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It's going crazy.

804
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Because

805
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Control Theory is a very important...

806
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah.

807
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Before that,

808
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I was calculating

809
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
controllability.

810
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Then

811
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I went to study those things.

812
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I think Control Theory is really interesting.

813
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yeah.

814
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'm not doing Control Theory.

815
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I'm doing fluid mechanics.

816
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So I did Control Theory

817
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
about 10 years ago.

818
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I know.

819
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I think you should...

820
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah.

821
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I just found out

822
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
that Control Theory

823
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
has such a difficult problem.

824
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
It's really interesting in math.

825
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah.

826
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But

827
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I just heard

828
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
that I was on

829
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Quantum Computing a while ago.

830
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I remember he said

831
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
in Quantum,

832
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
now computers are 1 and 0.

833
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
In Quantum Computing,

834
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
for example, 70% is 0

835
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
and 30% is 1.

836
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
It's a superposition.

837
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
That's right.

838
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Is it like

839
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Quantum Computing at Kyo University in Japan?

840
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm just asking.

841
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I don't think so.

842
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think it's from the U.S.

843
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I'm sure it's a professor

844
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
from a university in the U.S.

845
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So you want to stabilize

846
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
that I want to produce

847
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
a group of states

848
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
that are 70% 0 and 30% 1.

849
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So you want to stabilize

850
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
that I want to produce

851
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
a group of states that are 70% 0 and 30% 1.

852
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Is that what you mean?

853
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
That's right.

854
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
You're right.

855
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's a superposition.

856
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
It's a superposition.

857
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
The first thing

858
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
in the feedback loop

859
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
is that if it's just 0 and 1,

860
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
we call it pure state,

861
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
it's easy to do.

862
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It's easy to do it with the feedback loop.

863
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But if you make it 50%

864
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
0 and 50% 1,

865
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But if you make it 50% 0 and 50% 1,

866
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
you can't do it.

867
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
You can't do it.

868
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
You can't do it.

869
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
You can't do it.

870
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
You can't do it.

871
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
So superposition

872
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
is a new way

873
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
to stabilize.

874
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
is a new way to stabilize.

875
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
In fact,

876
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
in quantum computing,

877
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
there's a lot of research

878
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
in quantum computing.

879
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Because...

880
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I don't know if you...

881
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
In quantum computing,

882
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
did you get error correction later?

883
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
No, I only gave up after two weeks.

884
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
No, I only gave up after two weeks.

885
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Anyway,

886
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
error correction is a very difficult problem.

887
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
error correction is a very difficult problem.

888
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Because you can't do both sides.

889
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Because you can't do both sides.

890
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Because it's easy to do error correction

891
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
One is 1.

892
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
You repeat it 3 times

893
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
and it becomes 11111111.

894
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
You repeat it 3 times and it becomes 111111.

895
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
If it becomes 101,

896
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
you know the middle is wrong.

897
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
If it becomes 101, you know the middle is wrong.

898
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
But you can't do it that way.

899
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Because there's

900
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
non-cloning theory,

901
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
you can't do the copy

902
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
so you need

903
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
You need

904
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
quantum correction.

905
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It's a huge research.

906
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It has

907
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
surface code, color code,

908
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
super math.

909
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I've

910
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
seen some before

911
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
and I think it's super hard.

912
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I haven't finished yet.

913
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Error correction

914
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
can only

915
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
correct

916
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
discrete errors.

917
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
But what we usually

918
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
do is

919
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
correct

920
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
continuous errors.

921
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
It's not

922
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
that hard.

923
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It can

924
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
do continuous

925
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
stabilizing.

926
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I can

927
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
continuously

928
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
stabilize it

929
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
instead of

930
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
doing something

931
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
to stabilize it.

932
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Like you said,

933
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
quantum itself

934
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
can't be measured.

935
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It can't measure accurately.

936
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
No matter what experiment you do today,

937
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
you need to measure

938
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
to know what you get.

939
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Or quantum computing

940
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
needs to measure

941
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
to know

942
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
what signal it receives.

943
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Or error correction

944
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
needs to measure

945
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
to know if it

946
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
receives the wrong signal.

947
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Like you said,

948
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
it's hard to measure.

949
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Is there

950
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
enough

951
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
technology

952
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
to measure

953
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
or is it still

954
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
lacking?

955
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Your question

956
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
has

957
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
two parts.

958
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
One is

959
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
generally

960
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
readout

961
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
can be done.

962
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
But if you

963
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
reverse the

964
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
superposition

965
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
with readout,

966
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
it's hard.

967
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
We need to separate

968
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
these two parts.

969
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Generally,

970
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
readout is easy.

971
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I can't say that.

972
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It depends on

973
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
your system.

974
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
QuantumDot

975
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
or IronTrap.

976
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
IronTrap's readout is the easiest.

977
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
The other two

978
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
are a bit harder.

979
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But in fact,

980
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
we all know

981
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
how to do it.

982
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
But

983
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
the result you measure

984
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
is

985
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
0 and 1.

986
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
But

987
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
if you want to

988
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
measure the state,

989
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
you need to do it

990
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
10 times.

991
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
7 times is 0.

992
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
7 times is 0.

993
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
You can't

994
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
reverse it.

995
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
It's 0.7 or 0.3.

996
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Right.

997
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
This is

998
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
because

999
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
you usually

1000
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
measure

1001
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
more than one qubit.

1002
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It's not hard

1003
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
to measure a qubit.

1004
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
But you need

1005
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
thousands of qubits.

1006
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
You need to

1007
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
do it

1008
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
many times

1009
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
to

1010
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
have enough confidence

1011
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
that the result is right.

1012
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You need

1013
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
thousands of qubits

1014
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
to

1015
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
measure

1016
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
a qubit.

1017
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Then you can reverse

1018
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
the result.

1019
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
It's hard.

1020
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And there will be

1021
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
some error.

1022
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
The error

1023
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
is different from

1024
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
the number of times you need to measure.

1025
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Anyway.

1026
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
OK. Thank you.

1027
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Any questions?

1028
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
If no,

1029
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
let's give

1030
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
a round of applause.

1031
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Thank you.

1032
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Thank you.

1033
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Come on, Taiwan.

1034
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
OK.

1035
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
That's all.

1036
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
You can leave now.

1037
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
OK. Bye.

1038
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Thank you.

1039
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Nice to meet you.

1040
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Nice to meet you.

1041
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Nice to meet you.

1042
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Nice to meet you.

1043
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Let me say something.

1044
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I'll post the video

1045
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
in the blog.

1046
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Only the members can see it.

1047
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
If you have any questions,

1048
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
you can send it to me.

1049
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Or you can contact him directly.

1050
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Or you can email him.

1051
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
OK.

1052
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
If

1053
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
you want to join

1054
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
me,

1055
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
it's catchang.

1056
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Yes.

1057
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Or you can

1058
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
see if you can

1059
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
tag me in the blog.

1060
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Or add me.

1061
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Yes.

1062
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
It's easier for everyone to contact.

1063
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And

1064
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I forgot.

1065
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Pingyuan.

1066
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Pingyuan.

1067
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Hello.

1068
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Hello.

1069
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
If you have any questions,

1070
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
we can talk about it.

1071
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
If you're interested,

1072
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I'm going to apply for a blog post.

1073
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I'm looking for a blog post

1074
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
for quantum computing.

1075
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
You can ask me any questions.

1076
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
OK.

1077
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm doing

1078
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
maybe not a direct relationship,

1079
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
but it's still computing.

1080
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Supercomputing.

1081
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yes.

1082
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It's really hard.

1083
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Yes.

1084
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Yes.

1085
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
The so-called

1086
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
quantum...

1087
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Sorry.

1088
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
It's my wedding photo.

1089
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'm going to cover it.

1090
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
It's a big field

1091
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
called quantum simulation.

1092
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I don't know if quantum simulation

1093
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
can simulate

1094
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
some of the characteristics

1095
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
of chemical molecules.

1096
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I don't know if

1097
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
other systems

1098
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
can simulate

1099
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
in the future.

1100
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Yes.

1101
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It's a big field.

1102
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Yes.

1103
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
OK.

1104
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
OK.

1105
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Talk to you later. Bye.

1106
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Bye.
