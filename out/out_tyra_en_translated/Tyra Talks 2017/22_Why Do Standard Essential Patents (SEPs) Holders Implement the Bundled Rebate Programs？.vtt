00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome to this week's Tera Talk. I'm your host, Yu-Wei Lin.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm pleased to welcome our speaker today, Louis.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
He is currently a Ph.D. student at St. Louis University of Washington.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
His main research projects include intellectual property rights, law, anti-Thorax law, and economic analysis.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Before he was a Ph.D. student, he was an intern at Winston & Stone, a law firm in Taiwan and abroad.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
He also analyzed the legal process of Taiwan clients and non-authorized individuals in the U.S. and East Texas courts.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Louis is also passionate about entrepreneurship.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
He is a member of the China Entrepreneurship and International Exchange Association.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
He regularly holds conferences and talks in Taiwan to promote entrepreneurship.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Today's topic is based on his background in law and entrepreneurship.

00:51.000 --> 01:01.000
Louis, please turn on your microphone.

01:01.000 --> 01:20.000
Thank you, Yu-Wei, and thank you, Tera, for inviting me.

01:20.000 --> 01:44.000
Last year, I also talked about copyright issues in my talk.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Today's topic is completely different.

01:48.000 --> 02:02.000
This topic has a little to do with my graduate thesis, but it is not all of my graduate thesis.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Instead, I use different angles to analyze the case study of my graduate thesis.

02:08.000 --> 02:24.000
As you can see on the screen, my graduate thesis is co-authored by a friend from Shanghai Fudan University's School of Management.

02:25.000 --> 02:47.000
My thesis focuses on the use of bundling in the market.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
The main details of my thesis will take about 30-40 minutes.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
This topic has a background, so I will talk about it in detail.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm just curious about what kind of people are listening to my talk today.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I will talk about it in detail.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
In fact, it is not so difficult to compare things in the Department of Sociology and Law.

03:43.000 --> 03:52.000
Today, I will use some mathematical things, but I will not show you the whole process.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I don't think I need to show off.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
I just want to show you what our results are.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I don't have much to say.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Some of the things I study need to be understood by everyone.

04:05.000 --> 04:15.000
If some of you are interested in this industry or already know it very well, please add it if I am wrong.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
What I want to talk about today is actually related to modern chip.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Modern chip is the so-called communication chip industry.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
In fact, I found this Samsung Galaxy S4 on the Internet.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
The structure of the picture is like this.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
One of them is modern chip.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
What are the benefits of modern chip?

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
The advantage is that after I installed this modern chip in my mobile phone today,

04:44.000 --> 04:55.000
For example, as we all know, the communication standards of 2G, 3G, and 4G will not have the so-called problems that cannot be used in different countries.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Just imagine that if you buy an iPhone today, whether it is iPhone 4, iPhone 5, or iPhone 6,

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
The result may be that your communication standards are different today, or your communication bandwidth is different.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
In fact, this is very blind.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
How to solve this difference in bandwidth or communication standards?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Modern chip plays a very important role.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Another example is that everyone is in the United States.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
I assume that everyone is in the United States.

05:31.000 --> 05:41.000
For example, if you run to some remote places with your mobile phone, it is not 4G that covers the range, but 3G or even 2G.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
But you can still make calls and you can still go online.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It's just that it's very slow.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
How is this function done?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
In fact, this is the function of modern chip.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
It can still operate under different standards and under different levels.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
However, its operating function is limited.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
This is the function of modern chip.

06:03.000 --> 06:12.000
It can be seen that a mobile phone has a lot of functionality.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
But the value of a smart phone is to be online.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Modern chip plays a very important role.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
What I want to discuss today is a small communication chip problem.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Let's take a look at the situation of this industry.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
This is a total of 1.2 years.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
From 2007 to 2012, there were several leading companies in the modern chip industry.

06:45.000 --> 06:55.000
We can probably see that Qualcomm has been playing a leading role in this field.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2007 to the 4G in 2012.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Later, I will show the state of the 5G patent layout.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role.

07:11.000 --> 07:25.000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2012 to the 5G in 2012.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
This is the current state of the industry.

07:28.000 --> 07:43.000
From 2012 to now, we can see that the green part of the patent is high-speed communication.

07:43.000 --> 07:56.000
In fact, it occupies a very high position in the patent layout of modern chip, including radio front, modulation, and core networking.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
From these pictures, we can see the current state of the industry.

08:02.000 --> 08:10.000
For example, InterDigital and BlackBerry have all disappeared.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
These are all in the past.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
The former dragon head is no longer in use.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
You can see that there is a lot of communication in the green part.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
The gray part is Intel, which we will discuss today.

08:26.000 --> 08:35.000
In fact, it is not as good as Qualcomm in terms of patent layout, especially 5G.

08:35.000 --> 08:46.000
So we can simply summarize that Qualcomm is almost in monopoly in the modern chip industry.

08:46.000 --> 08:56.000
Because most of the chips are in the patent layout of most of the modern chip sales, and the quality of its products is maintained.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
So the state of its maintenance is very good.

08:59.000 --> 09:20.000
Most of the big manufacturers, including Apple users, mostly use Qualcomm's modern chip for their important suppliers from iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, and iPhone 7.

09:21.000 --> 09:34.000
But the problem is that these so-called communication standards, which I just mentioned, such as 2G, 3G, and 4G standards.

09:34.000 --> 09:44.000
In fact, these standards have a lot of patent layout behind them, and the negotiation process of each party.

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
You always have to decide which standard to use. It must be of good quality and easy to promote. I think everyone can understand this.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
In fact, there are these international standard organizations behind the standard promotion.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
So back to the picture just now, let's come here first.

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
I think this picture is very important in the background of my law school.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
Why is it important? Because it explains the relationship between people of different levels.

10:18.000 --> 10:29.000
Because on my left is IEEE, ITU, and ETSI. These three are very important technical standards organizations that designate 4G and even 5G.

10:29.000 --> 10:37.000
These technical standards organizations play a role in promoting technical standards.

10:38.000 --> 10:51.000
The core concept is that I want my 4G standard or 5G standard in the future to be able to be used by many people.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
It's not that I only let a group of people use it. A small group of people using it is not a standard.

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
So it must be that everyone can recognize this thing. Yes, it's good, it's easy to use, and it's efficient.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
The standard of 5G and 4G can be slowly promoted because the industry recognizes it.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
But behind it, as I said before, it involves a lot of different patent layouts.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
Because it is impossible for a company to have all the patents of technical standards.

11:22.000 --> 11:32.000
It must be segmented. It must be cut into many segments. Some companies specialize in that.

11:32.000 --> 11:43.000
For example, now everyone sees Radio Front End. Although the patents of Ericsson and Qualcomm are similar, it also means that there are many things that Qualcomm can't do.

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
So today I want to talk to you about this kind of industry.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
Such patents are called SEP.

11:58.000 --> 12:07.000
SEP stands for Standard Essential Patents.

12:07.000 --> 12:22.000
Those who have SEPs, such as the manufacturers I mentioned earlier, including Ericsson, Qualcomm, and Intel, are considered SEPs.

12:22.000 --> 12:33.000
Everyone will think that if everyone in the world uses this standard, then he can raise the price.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Because people all over the world use it, then I'm not turning over.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
In order to prevent this from happening, it should be said that preventing it from turning over is one point.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Another point is that it can take advantage of the position of patents in the market.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
Because patents are a kind of legal monopoly, everyone can understand it this way.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Most people may not study law.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
If you ask me how to understand patents, the way to understand it is very simple.

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
A patent is a legal right for you to have this kind of monopoly.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
It allows you to have the right to monopolize within a period of time for your technology and patent.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
So it is a limited monopoly.

13:22.000 --> 13:34.000
After these people have patents, if these patents or technologies are used as standards, then they can raise their prices indefinitely.

13:34.000 --> 13:42.000
Isn't that against the purpose of these technical standards organizations that I just mentioned?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Because the price is too high, no one can use it.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
If I want to pay so much, who will think about my rights?

13:48.000 --> 14:01.000
So, in this atmosphere, in this concept, all technical standards organizations in the process of setting standards,

14:01.000 --> 14:14.000
remember that this structural organization requires all SEPs to provide an LOA.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
LOA is the condition that you have to accept the conditions provided by the technical standards organization.

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
For example, you want to become a 3G standard, or a 4G standard, or a 5G standard in the future.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
But your patent price must be within a certain range.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
But we call this range of conditions FRIEND.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Let me stop for a moment.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Because I really can't see everyone's conversation.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Does anyone have any questions now?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Let's take a look.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
It seems that no one has asked me a question.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
If you have any questions, you can ask me at any time, it doesn't matter.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
If there are no questions, I will continue to talk.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
Because I found that there is no social science background, I have to speak particularly slowly.

15:03.000 --> 15:13.000
The full name of FRIEND is Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory Licensing.

15:13.000 --> 15:21.000
FRAND is included in the conditions provided by all technical standards organizations.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
This condition actually includes a lot.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
If you are interested, you can check it.

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
One of the most important conditions is that your patent must be used as a standard.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
Your technology must become my 5G standard.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
You submit your patent application.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
But you must accept the restrictions of FRAND.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
Because, as I said, you can't raise the price too high.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
If the price is too high, no one will use it.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Another point is the following box.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
The following box is the implementer.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
What I mean by implementer is, for example, our great HTC.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
HTC may have some patents, but it is not a player.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
HTC is not the patent holders we saw in the picture just now.

16:17.000 --> 16:25.000
It's just that I'm an authorized person, and I use the technical standards they have, and I use the technology.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
We call it implementer.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
It is not a person who develops modern chips.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Simply put, HTC is also.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Apple is also.

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
Of course, if you are concerned about this industry, Apple has already released a message that it wants to step in.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It also wants to make its own chips.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
If you are interested in this in the future, you can talk to me.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
It's a matter of whether you can do it or not.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
There are still some entry barriers.

16:49.000 --> 16:58.000
Back here, you have to accept that you have to become a technical standard.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
You have to accept FRAND.

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
Second, the condition of FRAND will not be limited to the relationship between you and the technical standard organization.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It will have a third-party interest.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
We call it a third-party interest contract.

17:14.000 --> 17:26.000
This third-party interest contract means that after I make these terms with the technical standard organization today, the efficiency of these terms will affect the third person.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
The meaning of the third person is that it includes HTC, because it is not an owner of SEP.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
It is not an owner of SEP, but its efficiency will affect the third person.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
So everyone can enjoy the benefits of FRAND.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
In other words, the third party, for example, HTC, I also have to use these technical standard organizations.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
These 3G, 4G, or 5G patents.

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
You can't because I'm not in this technical standard organization, or I'm not part of this technical standard organization.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
So these SEP owners raise my price very high.

18:04.000 --> 18:23.000
Basically, these SEP owners join the technical standard organization and submit their patents to the technical standard organization as a prerequisite for 5G standards.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
The problem is that you have to accept these two conditions.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
The first is that the price of your patent must be within a reasonable range.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
The second is that it will affect the third party.

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
As long as everyone wants to use this technical standard, everyone can enjoy the benefits of FRAND.

18:43.000 --> 18:50.000
Instead of saying that because you are in a technical standard organization, I will give you a discount, and no one else will.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
But here I make a signal.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
That is, my research is in this area.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
The source of all the problems is here.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Because there will be so-called market monopoly problems.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Why?

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
Think about it, who are the members of all the technical standard organizations?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Isn't it the so-called industry leaders?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Because who sets the technical standards?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It must be the industry leaders, right?

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Among these industry leaders, if everyone gathers together to have a meeting.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
But Taiwanese people may not know much about this law.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
It seems that many manufacturers sit in line together to eat and discuss things.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
It seems very simple, there is no legal problem.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
I tell you, the problem is here.

19:37.000 --> 19:47.000
The problem is that the U.S. Anti-Trust Law and the so-called EU Competition Law strictly prohibit this matter.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
Because this prohibition is actually the so-called joint pricing behavior.

19:52.000 --> 20:00.000
Because the U.S. has a lot of different review standards in the so-called Anti-Trust Law.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
In fact, the most taboo thing is like the joint pricing I just said.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
A bunch of competitors in the same industry.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
For example, we just said that Ericsson also has a patent.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
It is also in the ETSI, ITU, and IEE.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Qualcomm is also a member.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Because everyone submits their patents and then joins their members.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
So this group of people are all competitors in the same industry.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
All set standards here.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
Of course, as a government role, the government will be very worried about this matter.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Are you guys doing it?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Why? Think from another perspective.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Friend is what we just talked about.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
The problem with Friend is that I promised you today.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
I promised you to set the price of Friend.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
But this is a requirement for all SEP holders.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
And this technical standard organization is afraid.

21:00.000 --> 21:08.000
For example, if I ask for 5%, I ask for the price of Friend.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
It is called 5% of each product sale.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
5% may be too high.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
1% is called Friend.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Think about it.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
If this is the case.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
What is the price of Friend?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
What is the price of reasonable and non-discriminatory?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
All people can only charge 1%.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
In fact, from the perspective of the government, you will find it strange.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Why did you all create this RATE together?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Is there a joint pricing behavior?

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
This problem is stuck in the technical standard organization.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
I abbreviate SSO to make it easier for me to say.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
SSO will be worried.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
If everyone is investigating me.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Everyone is doubting me.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Am I doing joint pricing?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Because I said a sentence.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
The price of Friend is called 1%.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Am I being investigated all day?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
So the problem is here.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
Although it is a very important organization.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
It created Friend.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
It requires everyone to accept Friend.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
But it is not responsible for the so-called pricing behavior.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Because of this, what is Friend?

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
I can report to you.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
What is Friend?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
In the legal circle.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
There are many discussions in the paper of the Chamber of Commerce.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Because no one dares to go to court.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
The court itself or the government unit.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
It has never dared to respond positively to this matter.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Includes its definition.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
It has its own method of calculation.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
But every court in the United States.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Are using different methods of calculation.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
So this thing is actually complicated.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
In fact, today I will introduce this kind of background to you first.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Because I think this thing needs to be explained to you first.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Then his background state.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Then I can get into what we are studying.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Because of this, everyone will have the so-called level playing field.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Everyone has a rough idea of ​​this matter.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
I know what I am studying.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm getting into my stuff.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
This is easier for everyone to understand.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Before we officially start talking.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Before this very interesting case.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Let me ask you first.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
The simple industry I just introduced.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Or some knowledge background.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Is there any problem with the introduction?

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
5 seconds.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
No problem so far.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
No problem, very good.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
But if you have any questions, you are welcome.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I also want to train.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Talk to people in the legal field.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
See what you think.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
After having such background knowledge.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
We know that the technical standards have many patents.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
It is authorized to be restricted by the FRIEND regulation.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Then it has a third-party regulation.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
So everyone can enjoy FRIEND.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Then there is that we all know.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
When selling, there are usually a lot of patents behind.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
The problem has appeared.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
We all know that I just mentioned.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Qualcomm is an industrial leader.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Its modern chip quality is very good.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
It is also an Apple long-term supplier.

24:41.000 --> 24:48.000
But at the beginning of 2017.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
FTC, the Federal Trade Commission of the United States.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And Apple itself.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Apple is its downstream manufacturer.

24:57.000 --> 25:04.000
It has sued Qualcomm for violating the Antitrust Law.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
Specifically, it has many claims.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
It has advocated many things.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
What I want to focus on today is.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Qualcomm is on the so-called contract.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
With everyone playing a so-called.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
It uses its market position.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
To achieve its goal of making profits.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
How does it do this?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
First of all, everyone sees this picture.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
This picture is actually public.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I didn't do it, it's not so beautiful.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
This picture is when Apple is suing Qualcomm.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
It added its content of this lawsuit.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And its analysis chart.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
How does Qualcomm violate the law?

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Basically, Qualcomm.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
Its practice is actually divided into two stages.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Today, because of a little more time.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I don't know how much time I have.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
But I'll talk slowly.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
It is actually divided into two stages.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Qualcomm's two-stage behavior is the first.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Qualcomm in 2007.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Before officially becoming an Apple supplier.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
In fact, it is with Apple.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Uh, other assembly lines.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Uh, including the so-called.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
We refer to this Fuskang.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I take Fuskang as an example.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Fuskang is Apple's.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
This assembly line.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
It is actually Qualcomm itself.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Uh, the assembly line of Apple.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
There is already a contract.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Why? Because you want to assemble.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
You will also use Qualcomm's patent.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Because Qualcomm's patent layout is very wide.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
We just.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
In fact, I just gave a simple example.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
In fact, if you look at it.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Qualcomm's patent layout.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
It has exceeded the scope of the modern chip itself.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
It contains the entire technical standard.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
OK, this is what he said.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Uh, I also believe that.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Because if you go to check Qualcomm.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
This company was established in 1985.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Then continue to be in.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Uh, the communication chip industry continues.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
To do research and development.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Then continue to.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Uh, expand his career.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
So he actually.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
The impact is not just in the modern chip itself.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
It also includes the whole.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
It also includes itself.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Uh, it also includes technical standards.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
OK.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
So he was originally Qualcomm.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
He is cooperating with Apple suppliers.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Ah, because Apple suppliers.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
For example, I just said Fuskang.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Fuskang, he actually does more than Apple products.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
He also does other.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Do HP, right?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You do other products.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
HP's, for example.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Will also use Qualcomm's chip.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Uh, it will also use Qualcomm's patent.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Or technology also needs to be done.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Uh, patent authorization.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
So it becomes.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
In fact, Qualcomm already has.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
With other Apple suppliers.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
To do cooperation.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
So why did I mention Apple suppliers?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
His complexity is here.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Because Qualcomm, he did one.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
The fun thing is that he is.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Before becoming an Apple supplier.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
He told this Apple supplier.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I just said.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I signed a contract with you.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I put this.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
You want to assemble this Apple product.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Okay, I'll take this patent with you.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
But what about the content of this patent?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
The scope is not the content.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Specific details.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
How is it?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Uh, it's NDA.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Non-disclosure agreement is not open.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
OK, what about other things?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
If I think I'm because of this.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
The relationship is actually a bit complicated.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
To put it simply.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Qualcomm, I'm with Apple today.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Uh, the assembly plant of Apple.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Ah, and then the patent authorization.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Ah, these assemblies.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
He can actually come back and ask Apple for this.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Want this reimbursement.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
That is to say, because the assembly plant.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
He doesn't think he has to.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Take more of this responsibility.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Because this contract is actually negotiable.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
But in the real world.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I can tell you.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Report to everyone.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
In fact, most of the money.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Uh, there are a lot of parts.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
A lot of money has become.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Apple to squeeze.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
But of course Apple will say.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I didn't squeeze them.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Of course, in this case.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Qualcomm is Qualcomm.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Uh, Qualcomm claims.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Oh, I have been with these assemblies today.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Cooperation.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I asked them to pay these.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Give me the rights to patent authorization.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
If you don't want to.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
You can go back to Apple.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You don't have to pay for this.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Does Apple pay for you?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
But the fun thing is here.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Qualcomm, I just said that Qualcomm.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
He is SEP.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
In fact, his SEP is a.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
There must be a range.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
His range is the so-called.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
This friend.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
He is more than that.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Fair and reasonable.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
He must be reasonable.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
And not discrimination.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I went to these assemblies.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Signed the NDA.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
If you are Apple.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Then there is a result.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I want to use.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
For example, I want to use Qualcomm chips.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Then the result.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I use Qualcomm chips.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
All those assemblies below me.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Have been asking me for money.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Qualcomm has already collected more money from me.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Then you have to compensate me.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Then how much compensation.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Then how much according to the contract.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Why is this price?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Those assemblies.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Apple asked those assemblies.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Why is this price?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I can't tell you.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Because Qualcomm said this is NDA.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I can't tell you.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
So this is wonderful.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
The first stage is to say.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Qualcomm went to Apple's assembly plant.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Wanted a sum of money.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Then the source of this money is.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
NDA is not public.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That becomes.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Because the account is there.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Qualcomm asked me for so much money.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Then Apple.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Transferred to Apple.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Then Apple.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I can only admit it.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Apple thinks it's strange.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Is this price reasonable?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Ask my assembly plant.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
He can't say.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
That's weird.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Apple actually wants to get rid of this.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
How much did I pay Qualcomm?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I don't know.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
I don't know my source.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I don't know my calculation method.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I just kept paying for it.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
He thinks it's unreasonable.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Feel the price.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
His internal manager.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Or lawyers or lawyers.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Think this price may be unreasonable.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Qualcomm wants too much money.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
He decided to talk to Qualcomm directly.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
So this picture is later.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Apple talked to Qualcomm.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
After he talked.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Apple said I can sign a contract with you.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
The gray part below.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
BCPA, TA, FTA, SDA, ASDA.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
These are all abbreviations of this contract.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
BCPA, for example.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
His full name is.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
TA is Transition Agreement.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Anyway, he is an abbreviation.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Anyway, he is an abbreviation.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
In these contracts.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Qualcomm and Apple.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
They went to talk.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Apple feels bad.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
You go through the middle.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I want to talk to you directly.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I want to talk to you directly.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Qualcomm agreed.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
After he agreed, he signed these contracts.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
But he added some conditions in these contracts.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
But he added some conditions in these contracts.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
These conditions are fun.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
What you see now.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Rebate Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
These two.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It sounds very simple.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
In fact, the specific content looks like this.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
This is the lawsuit.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
This is mentioned in Apple's lawsuit.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Of course, it contains a lot of confidential documents.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I don't know what confidentiality is.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I don't know what confidentiality is.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Mainly these two.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
One is that you have to promise me.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
You want me to provide.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
You want me to provide you with chips.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
You want me to provide you with chips.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
He is the US Federal Trade Commission.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
He is the US Federal Trade Commission.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
No license.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
No chip.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
No license.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
No license.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
He said.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
You want me to supply my high-quality modern chip.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
But you have to accept the price.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
But you have to accept the price.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
But you have to accept the price.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
You have to accept the price of my SEP.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
You have to accept the price of my SEP.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Then he found out inside Apple.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
It seems to be a bit higher than the market.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
But Qualcomm said.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
But Qualcomm said.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
What can you do?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
If you don't accept this price.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Then I can't provide you with this modern chip.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
These two are bundled together.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
The so-called bundled together.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I'm going to sell you a modern chip today.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
But you have to accept.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Apple's own claim.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
In fact, this case is still running.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
In fact, this case is still running.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
The so-called price is not FRIEND.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
The so-called price is not FRIEND.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
The so-called price is not FRIEND.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
But because Qualcomm has good quality.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And then he is a market leader.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And then there's a lot of patent planning.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
So Apple has to accept this.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So Apple has to accept this.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
This is the first point.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
The so-called no license, no chip policy.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
The so-called no license, no chip policy.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Apple must accept his contract terms.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Apple must accept his contract terms.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
In exchange, you say, okay, you want me to use his.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I use Qualcomm's modern chip.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I use Qualcomm's modern chip.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
But I have to accept a higher FRIEND price.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
But I have to accept a higher FRIEND price.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
You want me to supply this, right?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I didn't treat you badly.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
He provides a rebate.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
He provides a rebate.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
This rebate is a fixed amount of price.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
This rebate is a fixed amount of price.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Because you've been my client for a long time.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Because you've been my client for a long time.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Use my communication chip.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Then I'll give you a discount.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Then I'll give you a discount.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Then I'll give you a discount.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Because everyone is not learning law or business.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Because everyone is not learning law or business.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
All the discounts in the mall.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
All the discounts in the mall.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'll give you a sum of money.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
In fact, there are conditions.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Qualcomm said yes.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Apple said yes.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
You give me a discount.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
But Qualcomm said yes.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I'll give you a discount.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
But you have to accept the following conditions.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
The following conditions are two.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
The following conditions are two.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
The following conditions are two.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
What are the conditions?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
You have to use my communication chip.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
You have to use my communication chip.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
You can't jump the grass.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
You can't use Intel.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
You can't use Samsung.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
You can't use Samsung.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
You can't use my competitor's chip.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
You can't use my competitor's chip.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
It sounds reasonable.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
It sounds reasonable.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
The second point is that it's fun.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
You can't go to any government unit.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
You can't go to any government unit for investigation.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
You can't make a lawsuit.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Let's start the debate.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
First, I provide a discount

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
First, I provide a discount

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
But you have to use my chip.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
But you have to use my chip.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Second, he says,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Second, I provide a discount

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Second, I provide a discount

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
But you can't sue me.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
But you can't sue me.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
These are two points.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
One is that you can't investigate me.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Completely lock you up.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
The other point is that

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You can't jump to another place.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
You can't jump to another place.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
You can't make a patent lawsuit.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
You can't make a patent lawsuit.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
This makes Apple very upset.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I can't use other people's chip.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I can't use other people's chip.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I can't use other people's chip.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Qualcomm uses the so-called

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Qualcomm uses the so-called

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
No license, no chip.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
The price is so high.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I don't know what you're doing.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I don't know what you're doing.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
You are a market monopoly.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
You are a market monopoly.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
The whole thing is mixed up.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
The whole case is mixed up.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Let Apple jump.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.500
And caused a lot of

37:23.500 --> 37:25.500
And caused a lot of

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
European Union.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
And China-Taiwan.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.500
Taiwan, you probably heard of it.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
He was also investigating this case.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
US and the U.S.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
The United States Trade Commission is investigating the whole thing.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.500
What is his legitimacy?

37:39.500 --> 37:41.500
What is his legitimacy?

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
We want to investigate.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.500
Qualcomm is doing this.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.500
What is the reason behind this?

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
Why does Qualcomm

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
Why does Qualcomm

37:57.500 --> 37:59.500
Bundle Rebate?

37:59.500 --> 38:01.500
Bundle Rebate?

38:01.500 --> 38:03.500
You can think about it.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.500
If Qualcomm's quality is so good.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
If Qualcomm's quality is so good.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.500
Good quality, good market monopoly status.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
Why does he provide a return to Apple?

38:11.500 --> 38:13.500
Why does he provide a return to Apple?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.500
Because I'm lying down.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.500
Apple is coming.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
You can think about it.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.500
If you are a market monopoly status.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.500
If you are a market monopoly status.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.500
Basically, everyone's products

38:25.500 --> 38:27.500
Almost use my modern chip.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.500
Almost use my modern chip.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.500
People can't catch up with me.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
People can't catch up with me.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.500
For example, he mentioned Intel.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.500
For him, Intel is nothing.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.500
He can't catch up with me at all.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.500
He can't catch up with me at all.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
I don't know if you have learned this.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
I don't know if you have learned this.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.500
The cost of investment is very high.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.500
So this question has always been a question of ours.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.500
So this question has always been a question of ours.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
So this question has always been a question of ours.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.500
The core question is if Qualcomm

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
If Qualcomm is in a market monopoly status.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.500
If Qualcomm is in a market monopoly status.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
In market leadership.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.500
He is so wide in his specialist.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
OK, and the quality of products is also very good.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.500
Why does he provide this return to Apple?

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
What's going on in society?

39:09.500 --> 39:11.500
What's going on in society?

39:11.500 --> 39:13.500
And provided with this return.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
And provided with this return.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
This period is not just a year or two,

39:17.500 --> 39:19.500
Perhaps a period of 3 to 5 years.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.500
Perhaps a period of 3 to 5 years.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.500
So he's actually still providing this rebate.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
So he's actually still providing this rebate.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.500
Then provide such a return to Apple.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.500
Then the two requirements are that

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
Then the two requirements are that

39:31.500 --> 39:33.500
And then you can't investigate me.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.500
And then you have to accept mine.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.500
Then issue

39:41.500 --> 39:43.500
Is the value of Friends justified?

39:43.500 --> 39:45.500
I'm not in today's report.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
I'm not in today's report.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.500
Because you say everything.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
Apple says you are not a friend.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
Qualcomm says I am a friend.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.500
Because I have the whole patent I authorize to you.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
Because I have the whole patent I authorize to you.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
This know-how

39:59.500 --> 40:01.500
And this so-called technical standard.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.500
Of course, the price is so high.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.500
Of course, the price is so high.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.500
This is the problem of the industry.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.500
This is the problem of the industry.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.500
Today's problem is on this rebate.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
So today I will tell you briefly.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.500
That is to say, today I focus on the point.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
Also this paper.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
The point I studied with that classmate is.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
Why Qualcomm

40:21.500 --> 40:23.500
He will be so persistent.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
To provide rebate this matter.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
OK

40:27.500 --> 40:29.500
I'm pausing again.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.500
I'm pausing again.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
See if you have any understanding of this case.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
See if you have any understanding of this case.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.500
Do you understand this story I just said?

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
Do you understand this story I just said?

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
Do you understand this story I just said?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
Does anyone not understand?

41:03.500 --> 41:05.500
What is the link that you don't understand?

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
If you don't understand.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.500
Can you tell me which link you don't understand?

41:37.500 --> 41:43.500
OK, no one responded.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
Just pretend to understand.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.500
On the basis of this knowledge,

41:47.500 --> 41:51.500
we know that the hatred between Apple and Qualcomm has spread like this.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.500
I was sued like this last year.

41:53.500 --> 42:03.500
For me, this paper is a cross-sectional, cross-field cooperation paper.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.500
I am responsible for the part of legal analysis.

42:05.500 --> 42:10.500
My partner is responsible for the study of the Gantt theory model,

42:10.500 --> 42:16.500
and the analysis of this whole thing from a commercial and economic perspective.

42:16.500 --> 42:19.500
First of all, everyone is very curious.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.500
From my point of view,

42:21.500 --> 42:23.500
is there a similar case in the past?

42:23.500 --> 42:28.500
Or how did they judge this rebate case?

42:28.500 --> 42:31.500
Or what is the result of their judgment?

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
Let me report to you.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.500
Simply put, this thing, this problem,

42:37.500 --> 42:41.500
even the court itself is difficult to handle.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.500
The red part you see on the screen

42:48.500 --> 42:51.500
represents that the court is the red part.

42:51.500 --> 42:55.500
The red case is the court's judgment.

42:55.500 --> 43:02.500
The defendant, a company like Qualcomm, is illegal.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.500
The black part is that I didn't mark it.

43:04.500 --> 43:07.500
The black part of these cases

43:07.500 --> 43:10.500
is considered legal by the court.

43:10.500 --> 43:12.500
It's like a bond rebate.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.500
You have to accept this.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.500
If you want to use it,

43:16.500 --> 43:18.500
just like the state of communication I just talked about.

43:18.500 --> 43:21.500
If you want to use my stuff,

43:21.500 --> 43:24.500
you want to become my supplier,

43:24.500 --> 43:26.500
or I want to supply you with good stuff,

43:26.500 --> 43:28.500
but you have to accept my conditions.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.500
You can buy it,

43:31.500 --> 43:33.500
but you have to buy a certain amount.

43:33.500 --> 43:34.500
After you buy a certain amount,

43:34.500 --> 43:36.500
I'll give you a rebate.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.500
It's a similar concept.

43:37.500 --> 43:40.500
It's a similar trading model.

43:40.500 --> 43:42.500
I've sorted out these six cases.

43:42.500 --> 43:45.500
Since none of them are legal,

43:45.500 --> 43:47.500
I won't go over them one by one.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.500
In fact, based on the results,

43:49.500 --> 43:51.500
the results are divided.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.500
The reasons are also divided.

43:53.500 --> 43:54.500
The three red dots

43:54.500 --> 43:57.500
are the different courts

43:57.500 --> 44:01.500
for these cases.

44:01.500 --> 44:02.500
So you can see

44:02.500 --> 44:04.500
a very special phenomenon.

44:04.500 --> 44:07.500
On the issue of rebate,

44:07.500 --> 44:09.500
or bond rebate,

44:09.500 --> 44:11.500
different courts have different reasons

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
and different results.

44:15.500 --> 44:16.500
I'll talk about it later.

44:16.500 --> 44:18.500
Qualcomm actually used this point.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.500
It's not a use.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.500
It should have seen this point.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.500
We infer that he saw this point

44:24.500 --> 44:27.500
and it may have become his reason

44:27.500 --> 44:32.500
to continue to use his bond rebate to Apple.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.500
This is our inference.

44:34.500 --> 44:36.500
I'll talk about it later.

44:36.500 --> 44:37.500
This is my preliminary investigation.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.500
I found that

44:41.500 --> 44:42.500
if the defendant

44:42.500 --> 44:45.500
is illegal in the red case,

44:45.500 --> 44:47.500
and legal in the black case,

44:47.500 --> 44:48.500
I'll see

44:48.500 --> 44:49.500
what common features

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
the red case has.

44:51.500 --> 44:53.500
First, those illegal cases

44:54.500 --> 44:55.500
in the red part.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.500
I just showed you the red part.

44:57.500 --> 44:58.500
These defendants

44:58.500 --> 45:03.500
actually have some market monopoly.

45:03.500 --> 45:09.500
So if you are a market monopolist,

45:09.500 --> 45:12.500
it is likely to violate the antitrust law.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.500
This is in our legal school.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.500
If you learn this antitrust law,

45:18.500 --> 45:21.500
basically this probability is very high.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.500
If you have this market monopoly,

45:23.500 --> 45:27.500
it is basically easy to violate the antitrust law.

45:27.500 --> 45:30.500
This is very normal.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.500
OK.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.500
In the context of this bond rebate,

45:33.500 --> 45:35.500
it is not an exception.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
But we have seen

45:37.500 --> 45:39.500
the second point is very interesting.

45:39.500 --> 45:40.500
We see legal.

45:40.500 --> 45:42.500
We compare these legal cases.

45:42.500 --> 45:45.500
In the black cases,

45:45.500 --> 45:46.500
we found that

45:46.500 --> 45:49.500
the defendant may still be legal.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.500
Why?

45:50.500 --> 45:52.500
Just imagine.

45:52.500 --> 45:57.500
In the black cases,

45:57.500 --> 46:00.500
why do some judges

46:00.500 --> 46:02.500
think they are legal

46:02.500 --> 46:04.500
in the same situation?

46:04.500 --> 46:06.500
Because they do not have

46:06.500 --> 46:08.500
the effect of exclusion.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.500
OK.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.500
In general,

46:10.500 --> 46:11.500
let's put it simply.

46:11.500 --> 46:13.500
Antitrust law is actually

46:13.500 --> 46:17.500
a law of corporate behavior.

46:17.500 --> 46:18.500
OK.

46:18.500 --> 46:19.500
It is the law of market economy

46:19.500 --> 46:20.500
and corporate behavior.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.500
So the market economy

46:22.500 --> 46:24.500
should maintain a competitive attitude

46:24.500 --> 46:26.500
instead of letting a person monopolize

46:26.500 --> 46:28.500
or show a state of monopoly.

46:28.500 --> 46:29.500
But imagine

46:29.500 --> 46:31.500
if he was originally today.

46:31.500 --> 46:32.500
Although he is a

46:32.500 --> 46:35.500
through his sales behavior

46:35.500 --> 46:37.500
and then his innovative business model

46:37.500 --> 46:39.500
to achieve his market leadership position

46:39.500 --> 46:41.500
but not monopoly leadership position

46:41.500 --> 46:43.500
and then he wants to continue

46:43.500 --> 46:45.500
to increase his market share

46:45.500 --> 46:48.500
he may let other competitors

46:48.500 --> 46:51.500
have some problems

46:51.500 --> 46:52.500
or what is the situation.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.500
The effect of his exclusion

46:54.500 --> 46:55.500
may make some

46:55.500 --> 46:56.500
for example,

46:56.500 --> 46:57.500
competition or something

46:57.500 --> 47:00.500
he may let other competitors

47:00.500 --> 47:01.500
he can not come in

47:01.500 --> 47:03.500
or potential competitors

47:03.500 --> 47:04.500
for example,

47:04.500 --> 47:05.500
as I just mentioned

47:05.500 --> 47:06.500
Intel

47:06.500 --> 47:08.500
Intel in the so-called

47:08.500 --> 47:10.500
this computer CPU

47:10.500 --> 47:11.500
everyone should know

47:11.500 --> 47:12.500
are doing very well

47:12.500 --> 47:13.500
this Pentium

47:13.500 --> 47:14.500
Pentium series are doing very well

47:14.500 --> 47:15.500
and then with this

47:15.500 --> 47:16.500
Microsoft

47:16.500 --> 47:18.500
in the late 90s

47:18.500 --> 47:19.500
is almost

47:19.500 --> 47:20.500
this is almost

47:20.500 --> 47:22.500
very few computers

47:22.500 --> 47:23.500
but he is in

47:23.500 --> 47:24.500
the communication chip inside

47:24.500 --> 47:26.500
he just can not stand

47:26.500 --> 47:27.500
he is not

47:27.500 --> 47:29.500
the so-called position

47:29.500 --> 47:32.500
that he is coming in today

47:32.500 --> 47:34.500
but in fact

47:34.500 --> 47:35.500
he wants to come in

47:35.500 --> 47:37.500
as long as he invests enough money

47:37.500 --> 47:38.500
in fact, Intel

47:38.500 --> 47:39.500
if you go to check

47:39.500 --> 47:40.500
in fact, he is also doing

47:40.500 --> 47:41.500
just keep doing bad

47:41.500 --> 47:42.500
OK

47:42.500 --> 47:43.500
but not to say

47:43.500 --> 47:44.500
he can not do

47:44.500 --> 47:45.500
this is the difference

47:45.500 --> 47:46.500
that is

47:46.500 --> 47:47.500
I'll talk about

47:47.500 --> 47:48.500
this is the difference

47:48.500 --> 47:49.500
that is the so-called can not do

47:49.500 --> 47:50.500
that is to say

47:50.500 --> 47:51.500
I used some business behavior

47:51.500 --> 47:52.500
for example, I

47:52.500 --> 47:53.500
I join all the people

47:53.500 --> 47:54.500
I do not provide you material

47:54.500 --> 47:55.500
you can not do

47:55.500 --> 47:56.500
this is not

47:56.500 --> 47:57.500
this must be against

47:57.500 --> 47:58.500
this anti-trust law

47:58.500 --> 47:59.500
because this is against

47:59.500 --> 48:00.500
this

48:00.500 --> 48:01.500
this market competition

48:01.500 --> 48:02.500
that is

48:02.500 --> 48:03.500
the current situation

48:03.500 --> 48:04.500
is to say

48:04.500 --> 48:05.500
we observed

48:05.500 --> 48:06.500
the first few

48:06.500 --> 48:07.500
black cases

48:07.500 --> 48:08.500
we found that

48:08.500 --> 48:09.500
those cases

48:09.500 --> 48:10.500
Why is it legal

48:10.500 --> 48:12.500
because those potential competitors

48:12.500 --> 48:13.500
he was not excluded

48:13.500 --> 48:14.500
into this market

48:14.500 --> 48:15.500
he can still

48:15.500 --> 48:16.500
enter this market

48:16.500 --> 48:17.500
competition

48:17.500 --> 48:18.500
means that

48:18.500 --> 48:19.500
his entry barrier

48:19.500 --> 48:20.500
is low

48:20.500 --> 48:21.500
that entry barrier

48:21.500 --> 48:22.500
low, then

48:22.500 --> 48:23.500
the court saw

48:23.500 --> 48:24.500
low entry barrier

48:24.500 --> 48:25.500
that is to say

48:25.500 --> 48:26.500
that you

48:26.500 --> 48:27.500
may come in today

48:27.500 --> 48:28.500
but you choose not to come in

48:28.500 --> 48:29.500
or you

48:29.500 --> 48:30.500
may have other

48:30.500 --> 48:31.500
commercial considerations

48:31.500 --> 48:32.500
but not come in

48:32.500 --> 48:33.500
so

48:33.500 --> 48:34.500
before

48:34.500 --> 48:35.500
I go back

48:35.500 --> 48:36.500
before

48:36.500 --> 48:37.500
these black cases

48:37.500 --> 48:38.500
Why would be

48:38.500 --> 48:39.500
legal

48:39.500 --> 48:40.500
these Bundle

48:40.500 --> 48:41.500
Rebate

48:41.500 --> 48:42.500
because

48:42.500 --> 48:43.500
other competitors

48:43.500 --> 48:44.500
he

48:44.500 --> 48:45.500
was not excluded

48:45.500 --> 48:46.500
he still came in

48:46.500 --> 48:47.500
he still joined

48:47.500 --> 48:48.500
this industry

48:48.500 --> 48:49.500
continue to compete

48:49.500 --> 48:50.500
with these defendants

48:50.500 --> 48:51.500
for example,

48:51.500 --> 48:52.500
if the defendant

48:52.500 --> 48:53.500
is Gaotong

48:53.500 --> 48:54.500
he still

48:54.500 --> 48:55.500
come in

48:55.500 --> 48:56.500
this industry

48:56.500 --> 48:57.500
to compete

48:57.500 --> 48:58.500
that is

48:58.500 --> 48:59.500
like we

48:59.500 --> 49:00.500
discussed today

49:00.500 --> 49:01.500
Gaotong

49:01.500 --> 49:02.500
is not the only

49:02.500 --> 49:03.500
one

49:03.500 --> 49:04.500
to provide

49:04.500 --> 49:05.500
Samsung

49:05.500 --> 49:06.500
also has

49:06.500 --> 49:07.500
Huawei

49:07.500 --> 49:08.500
also has

49:08.500 --> 49:09.500
OK

49:09.500 --> 49:10.500
so

49:10.500 --> 49:11.500
you

49:11.500 --> 49:12.500
know

49:12.500 --> 49:13.500
that

49:13.500 --> 49:14.500
although Gaotong

49:14.500 --> 49:15.500
in this market

49:15.500 --> 49:16.500
is based on

49:16.500 --> 49:17.500
monopoly status

49:17.500 --> 49:18.500
based on this

49:18.500 --> 49:19.500
leadership position

49:19.500 --> 49:20.500
and then

49:20.500 --> 49:21.500
may have

49:21.500 --> 49:22.500
some monopoly

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
power on

49:23.500 --> 49:24.500
sales

49:24.500 --> 49:25.500
because

49:25.500 --> 49:26.500
the quality of

49:26.500 --> 49:27.500
his product

49:27.500 --> 49:28.500
is good

49:28.500 --> 49:29.500
but

49:29.500 --> 49:30.500
other people

49:30.500 --> 49:31.500
are still

49:31.500 --> 49:32.500
inside

49:32.500 --> 49:33.500
right

49:33.500 --> 49:34.500
other players

49:34.500 --> 49:35.500
are also

49:35.500 --> 49:36.500
inside

49:36.500 --> 49:37.500
other

49:37.500 --> 49:38.500
manufacturers

49:38.500 --> 49:39.500
are also

49:39.500 --> 49:40.500
inside

49:40.500 --> 49:41.500
but

49:41.500 --> 49:42.500
you get

49:42.500 --> 49:43.500
this market

49:43.500 --> 49:44.500
leadership position

49:44.500 --> 49:45.500
is my

49:45.500 --> 49:46.500
development ability

49:46.500 --> 49:47.500
is strong enough

49:47.500 --> 49:48.500
my innovation is enough

49:48.500 --> 49:49.500
my patent

49:49.500 --> 49:50.500
quality is good enough

49:50.500 --> 49:51.500
so everyone

49:51.500 --> 49:52.500
likes to use my

49:52.500 --> 49:53.500
product

49:53.500 --> 49:54.500
and produce

49:54.500 --> 49:55.500
this normal

49:55.500 --> 49:56.500
market leadership

49:56.500 --> 49:57.500
position

49:57.500 --> 49:58.500
you can't

49:58.500 --> 49:59.500
punish this

49:59.500 --> 50:00.500
behavior

50:00.500 --> 50:01.500
otherwise

50:01.500 --> 50:02.500
if antitrust

50:02.500 --> 50:03.500
if this

50:03.500 --> 50:04.500
antitrust law

50:04.500 --> 50:05.500
is operated

50:05.500 --> 50:06.500
like this

50:06.500 --> 50:07.500
who wants to

50:07.500 --> 50:08.500
innovate

50:08.500 --> 50:09.500
this

50:09.500 --> 50:10.500
antitrust law

50:10.500 --> 50:11.500
in the United States

50:11.500 --> 50:12.500
is actually a

50:12.500 --> 50:13.500
very sensitive

50:13.500 --> 50:14.500
law and sensitive

50:14.500 --> 50:15.500
topic

50:15.500 --> 50:16.500
because

50:16.500 --> 50:17.500
a

50:17.500 --> 50:18.500
accident

50:18.500 --> 50:19.500
may

50:19.500 --> 50:20.500
have a

50:20.500 --> 50:21.500
competitive

50:21.500 --> 50:22.500
market

50:22.500 --> 50:23.500
attitude

50:23.500 --> 50:24.500
and

50:24.500 --> 50:25.500
the aftermath

50:25.500 --> 50:26.500
is actually

50:26.500 --> 50:27.500
very big

50:27.500 --> 50:28.500
because

50:28.500 --> 50:29.500
you may

50:29.500 --> 50:30.500
accidentally

50:30.500 --> 50:31.500
punish

50:31.500 --> 50:32.500
the right

50:32.500 --> 50:33.500
person

50:33.500 --> 50:34.500
if you

50:34.500 --> 50:35.500
punish

50:35.500 --> 50:36.500
the right

50:36.500 --> 50:37.500
person

50:37.500 --> 50:38.500
so

50:38.500 --> 50:39.500
I

50:39.500 --> 50:40.500
personally

50:40.500 --> 50:41.500
think

50:41.500 --> 50:42.500
Taiwan

50:42.500 --> 50:43.500
can't

50:43.500 --> 50:44.500
judge

50:44.500 --> 50:45.500
antitrust

50:45.500 --> 50:46.500
so soon

50:46.500 --> 50:47.500
the reason

50:47.500 --> 50:48.500
is here

50:48.500 --> 50:49.500
I

50:49.500 --> 50:50.500
want to

50:50.500 --> 50:51.500
share

50:51.500 --> 50:52.500
with

50:52.500 --> 50:53.500
you

50:53.500 --> 50:54.500
I

50:54.500 --> 50:55.500
don't

50:55.500 --> 50:56.500
know

50:56.500 --> 50:57.500
if

50:57.500 --> 50:58.500
this

50:58.500 --> 50:59.500
is

50:59.500 --> 51:00.500
good or

51:00.500 --> 51:01.500
not

51:01.500 --> 51:02.500
but

51:02.500 --> 51:03.500
I

51:03.500 --> 51:04.500
think

51:04.500 --> 51:05.500
it's

51:05.500 --> 51:06.500
worth

51:06.500 --> 51:07.500
talking

51:07.500 --> 51:08.500
about

51:08.500 --> 51:09.500
since

51:09.500 --> 51:10.500
there are

51:10.500 --> 51:11.500
so many

51:11.500 --> 51:12.500
people

51:12.500 --> 51:13.500
in this

51:13.500 --> 51:14.500
industry

51:14.500 --> 51:15.500
and

51:15.500 --> 51:16.500
why

51:16.500 --> 51:17.500
they are

51:17.500 --> 51:18.500
punished

51:18.500 --> 51:19.500
you have

51:19.500 --> 51:20.500
to give

51:20.500 --> 51:21.500
a

51:21.500 --> 51:22.500
legitimate

51:22.500 --> 51:23.500
reason

51:23.500 --> 51:24.500
the

51:24.500 --> 51:25.500
United

51:25.500 --> 51:26.500
States

51:26.500 --> 51:27.500
is a

51:27.500 --> 51:28.500
public

51:28.500 --> 51:29.500
country

51:29.500 --> 51:30.500
so

51:30.500 --> 51:31.500
this

51:31.500 --> 51:32.500
thing

51:32.500 --> 51:33.500
has not

51:33.500 --> 51:34.500
been

51:34.500 --> 51:35.500
judged

51:35.500 --> 51:36.500
even

51:36.500 --> 51:37.500
as I

51:37.500 --> 51:38.500
said

51:38.500 --> 51:39.500
the red

51:39.500 --> 51:40.500
case is

51:40.500 --> 51:41.500
still

51:41.500 --> 51:42.500
illegal

51:42.500 --> 51:43.500
so

51:43.500 --> 51:44.500
it has

51:44.500 --> 51:45.500
legal

51:45.500 --> 51:46.500
risk

51:46.500 --> 51:47.500
under

51:47.500 --> 51:48.500
this

51:48.500 --> 51:49.500
legal

51:49.500 --> 51:50.500
risk

51:50.500 --> 51:51.500
why

51:51.500 --> 51:52.500
will

51:52.500 --> 51:53.500
it

51:53.500 --> 51:54.500
continue

51:54.500 --> 51:55.500
to

51:55.500 --> 51:56.500
implement

51:56.500 --> 51:57.500
this

51:57.500 --> 51:58.500
bundle

51:58.500 --> 51:59.500
rebate

51:59.500 --> 52:00.500
this is

52:00.500 --> 52:01.500
our

52:01.500 --> 52:02.500
cooperation

52:02.500 --> 52:03.500
paper

52:03.500 --> 52:04.500
to

52:04.500 --> 52:05.500
use

52:05.500 --> 52:06.500
so-called

52:06.500 --> 52:07.500
competition

52:07.500 --> 52:08.500
theory

52:08.500 --> 52:09.500
model to

52:09.500 --> 52:10.500
do

52:10.500 --> 52:11.500
that

52:11.500 --> 52:12.500
this is

52:12.500 --> 52:13.500
from him

52:13.500 --> 52:14.500
I

52:14.500 --> 52:15.500
will briefly

52:15.500 --> 52:16.500
introduce

52:16.500 --> 52:17.500
you

52:17.500 --> 52:18.500
can leave

52:18.500 --> 52:19.500
me a

52:19.500 --> 52:20.500
message

52:20.500 --> 52:21.500
to me

52:21.500 --> 52:22.500
and

52:22.500 --> 52:23.500
I will

52:23.500 --> 52:24.500
explain

52:24.500 --> 52:25.500
not

52:25.500 --> 52:26.500
explain

52:26.500 --> 52:27.500
is that

52:27.500 --> 52:28.500
I will

52:28.500 --> 52:29.500
ask my

52:29.500 --> 52:30.500
friends

52:30.500 --> 52:31.500
and see if

52:31.500 --> 52:32.500
I can

52:32.500 --> 52:33.500
answer

52:33.500 --> 52:34.500
this

52:34.500 --> 52:35.500
question

52:35.500 --> 52:36.500
and

52:36.500 --> 52:37.500
then

52:37.500 --> 52:38.500
we will

52:38.500 --> 52:39.500
see what

52:39.500 --> 52:40.500
we see

52:40.500 --> 52:41.500
in the

52:41.500 --> 52:42.500
model and

52:42.500 --> 52:43.500
then we

52:43.500 --> 52:44.500
will

52:44.500 --> 52:45.500
say

52:45.500 --> 52:46.500
maybe

52:46.500 --> 52:47.500
behind these

52:47.500 --> 52:48.500
models

52:48.500 --> 52:49.500
what kind

52:49.500 --> 52:50.500
of behavior

52:50.500 --> 52:51.500
is possible

52:51.500 --> 52:52.500
so

52:52.500 --> 52:53.500
this

52:53.500 --> 52:54.500
model is

52:54.500 --> 52:55.500
such a

52:55.500 --> 52:56.500
situation

52:56.500 --> 52:57.500
and

52:57.500 --> 52:58.500
from the

52:58.500 --> 52:59.500
business

52:59.500 --> 53:00.500
point of

53:00.500 --> 53:01.500
view

53:01.500 --> 53:02.500
and

53:02.500 --> 53:03.500
MD

53:03.500 --> 53:04.500
cry

53:04.500 --> 53:05.500
ah

53:05.500 --> 53:06.500
yes

53:06.500 --> 53:07.500
MD

53:07.500 --> 53:08.500
cry

53:08.500 --> 53:09.500
ok

53:09.500 --> 53:10.500
MD

53:10.500 --> 53:11.500
does not seem to

53:11.500 --> 53:12.500
be within

53:12.500 --> 53:13.500
this

53:13.500 --> 53:14.500
range of

53:14.500 --> 53:15.500
modern

53:15.500 --> 53:16.500
chip

53:16.500 --> 53:17.500
ok

53:17.500 --> 53:18.500
so

53:18.500 --> 53:19.500
he

53:19.500 --> 53:20.500
I do not know

53:20.500 --> 53:21.500
MD

53:21.500 --> 53:22.500
is not really

53:22.500 --> 53:23.500
doing

53:23.500 --> 53:24.500
modern

53:24.500 --> 53:25.500
chip

53:25.500 --> 53:26.500
may not

53:26.500 --> 53:27.500
have

53:27.500 --> 53:28.500
ok

53:28.500 --> 53:29.500
not at all

53:29.500 --> 53:30.500
in the

53:30.500 --> 53:31.500
patent

53:31.500 --> 53:32.500
so

53:32.500 --> 53:33.500
I just

53:33.500 --> 53:34.500
simply talk about

53:34.500 --> 53:35.500
this math

53:35.500 --> 53:36.500
we use

53:36.500 --> 53:37.500
some of the

53:37.500 --> 53:38.500
math because

53:38.500 --> 53:39.500
we just

53:39.500 --> 53:40.500
finished listening to

53:40.500 --> 53:41.500
our story

53:41.500 --> 53:42.500
so

53:42.500 --> 53:43.500
listen to

53:43.500 --> 53:44.500
our story

53:44.500 --> 53:45.500
after

53:45.500 --> 53:46.500
these

53:46.500 --> 53:47.500
mathematical

53:47.500 --> 53:48.500
model

53:48.500 --> 53:49.500
assumptions

53:49.500 --> 53:50.500
I think

53:50.500 --> 53:51.500
it should

53:51.500 --> 53:52.500
not be

53:52.500 --> 53:53.500
very complicated

53:53.500 --> 53:54.500
ok

53:54.500 --> 53:55.500
first of all

53:55.500 --> 53:56.500
we design

53:56.500 --> 53:57.500
this game

53:57.500 --> 53:58.500
for the

53:58.500 --> 53:59.500
theory of

53:59.500 --> 54:00.500
game

54:00.500 --> 54:01.500
so

54:01.500 --> 54:02.500
this game

54:02.500 --> 54:03.500
is divided into

54:03.500 --> 54:04.500
the so-called

54:04.500 --> 54:05.500
exotic and

54:05.500 --> 54:06.500
non-exotic

54:06.500 --> 54:07.500
ok

54:07.500 --> 54:08.500
ah

54:08.500 --> 54:09.500
exotic

54:09.500 --> 54:10.500
I will explain

54:10.500 --> 54:11.500
to you

54:11.500 --> 54:12.500
that is

54:12.500 --> 54:13.500
as I just

54:13.500 --> 54:14.500
said

54:14.500 --> 54:15.500
this

54:15.500 --> 54:16.500
friend

54:16.500 --> 54:17.500
problem

54:17.500 --> 54:18.500
is the

54:18.500 --> 54:19.500
so-called

54:19.500 --> 54:20.500
price

54:20.500 --> 54:21.500
problem

54:21.500 --> 54:22.500
that

54:22.500 --> 54:23.500
why

54:23.500 --> 54:24.500
will have

54:24.500 --> 54:25.500
friend

54:25.500 --> 54:26.500
you think

54:26.500 --> 54:27.500
reasonable

54:27.500 --> 54:28.500
I think

54:28.500 --> 54:29.500
unreasonable

54:29.500 --> 54:30.500
ok

54:30.500 --> 54:31.500
you provide me

54:31.500 --> 54:32.500
inside

54:32.500 --> 54:33.500
the

54:33.500 --> 54:34.500
price

54:34.500 --> 54:35.500
sales

54:35.500 --> 54:36.500
price

54:36.500 --> 54:37.500
should be

54:37.500 --> 54:38.500
included

54:38.500 --> 54:39.500
patent price

54:39.500 --> 54:40.500
ah

54:40.500 --> 54:41.500
ok

54:41.500 --> 54:42.500
this is a bit

54:42.500 --> 54:43.500
tricky

54:43.500 --> 54:44.500
I say

54:44.500 --> 54:45.500
again

54:45.500 --> 54:46.500
is

54:46.500 --> 54:47.500
Apple

54:47.500 --> 54:48.500
will think

54:48.500 --> 54:49.500
you

54:49.500 --> 54:50.500
provide

54:50.500 --> 54:51.500
me

54:51.500 --> 54:52.500
modern

54:52.500 --> 54:53.500
chip

54:53.500 --> 54:54.500
ok

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
you

54:55.500 --> 54:56.500
this is a

54:56.500 --> 54:57.500
price

54:57.500 --> 54:58.500
say

54:58.500 --> 54:59.500
when

54:59.500 --> 55:00.500
you

55:00.500 --> 55:01.500
give me

55:01.500 --> 55:02.500
a patent

55:02.500 --> 55:03.500
patent

55:03.500 --> 55:04.500
law

55:04.500 --> 55:05.500
there is a

55:05.500 --> 55:06.500
basic concept

55:06.500 --> 55:07.500
that I simply

55:07.500 --> 55:08.500
emphasize

55:08.500 --> 55:09.500
this

55:09.500 --> 55:10.500
you do not have

55:10.500 --> 55:11.500
a patent

55:11.500 --> 55:12.500
law

55:12.500 --> 55:13.500
concept

55:13.500 --> 55:14.500
is that

55:14.500 --> 55:15.500
once

55:15.500 --> 55:16.500
my

55:16.500 --> 55:17.500
product

55:17.500 --> 55:18.500
contains

55:18.500 --> 55:19.500
my patent

55:19.500 --> 55:20.500
together

55:20.500 --> 55:21.500
sold out

55:21.500 --> 55:22.500
if

55:22.500 --> 55:23.500
this

55:23.500 --> 55:24.500
thing

55:24.500 --> 55:25.500
again

55:25.500 --> 55:26.500
bought by

55:26.500 --> 55:27.500
the

55:27.500 --> 55:28.500
patent

55:28.500 --> 55:29.500
sold to me

55:29.500 --> 55:30.500
he put

55:30.500 --> 55:31.500
this

55:31.500 --> 55:32.500
patent

55:32.500 --> 55:33.500
price

55:33.500 --> 55:34.500
sold to me

55:34.500 --> 55:35.500
why

55:35.500 --> 55:36.500
Foxconn

55:36.500 --> 55:37.500
to be

55:37.500 --> 55:38.500
pulled

55:38.500 --> 55:39.500
once more

55:39.500 --> 55:40.500
wool ah

55:40.500 --> 55:41.500
right

55:41.500 --> 55:42.500
course

55:42.500 --> 55:43.500
do not

55:43.500 --> 55:44.500
use

55:44.500 --> 55:45.500
the core

55:45.500 --> 55:46.500
concept

55:46.500 --> 55:47.500
is

55:47.500 --> 55:48.500
the

55:48.500 --> 55:49.500
concept

55:49.500 --> 55:50.500
is

55:50.500 --> 55:51.500
that

55:51.500 --> 55:52.500
he will

55:52.500 --> 55:53.500
have

55:53.500 --> 55:54.500
this

55:54.500 --> 55:55.500
controversy

55:55.500 --> 55:56.500
is because

55:56.500 --> 55:57.500
that

55:57.500 --> 55:58.500
high school of course

55:58.500 --> 55:59.500
think that

55:59.500 --> 56:00.500
I do not

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
authorize you

56:01.500 --> 56:02.500
or say I

56:02.500 --> 56:03.500
sell you

56:03.500 --> 56:04.500
a patent

56:04.500 --> 56:05.500
that I

56:05.500 --> 56:06.500
contain

56:06.500 --> 56:07.500
only a small

56:07.500 --> 56:08.500
part of my

56:08.500 --> 56:09.500
patent

56:09.500 --> 56:10.500
patent

56:10.500 --> 56:11.500
combination

56:11.500 --> 56:12.500
there are many

56:12.500 --> 56:13.500
patents

56:13.500 --> 56:14.500
you did not

56:14.500 --> 56:15.500
use

56:15.500 --> 56:16.500
so you have

56:16.500 --> 56:17.500
to pay

56:17.500 --> 56:18.500
extra

56:18.500 --> 56:19.500
money

56:19.500 --> 56:20.500
that everyone

56:20.500 --> 56:21.500
should understand

56:21.500 --> 56:22.500
it

56:22.500 --> 56:23.500
is

56:23.500 --> 56:24.500
why we

56:24.500 --> 56:25.500
design

56:25.500 --> 56:26.500
some of

56:26.500 --> 56:27.500
this

56:27.500 --> 56:28.500
game

56:28.500 --> 56:29.500
because

56:29.500 --> 56:30.500
I originally

56:30.500 --> 56:31.500
give you

56:31.500 --> 56:32.500
this

56:32.500 --> 56:33.500
modern

56:33.500 --> 56:34.500
chip

56:34.500 --> 56:35.500
should be

56:35.500 --> 56:36.500
all the

56:36.500 --> 56:37.500
prices

56:37.500 --> 56:38.500
include

56:38.500 --> 56:39.500
patent

56:39.500 --> 56:40.500
prices

56:40.500 --> 56:41.500
this is

56:41.500 --> 56:42.500
Apple's

56:42.500 --> 56:43.500
idea

56:43.500 --> 56:44.500
that

56:44.500 --> 56:45.500
Qualcomm

56:45.500 --> 56:46.500
do not

56:46.500 --> 56:47.500
think so

56:47.500 --> 56:48.500
Qualcomm

56:48.500 --> 56:49.500
think that

56:49.500 --> 56:50.500
I only

56:50.500 --> 56:51.500
give you a

56:51.500 --> 56:52.500
part of

56:52.500 --> 56:53.500
you have

56:53.500 --> 56:54.500
a lot of

56:54.500 --> 56:55.500
money

56:55.500 --> 56:56.500
why he dare

56:56.500 --> 56:57.500
talk about this

56:57.500 --> 56:58.500
condition

56:58.500 --> 56:59.500
because he dare

56:59.500 --> 57:00.500
say you

57:00.500 --> 57:01.500
even if I

57:01.500 --> 57:02.500
supply you

57:02.500 --> 57:03.500
modern chip

57:03.500 --> 57:04.500
I have other patents

57:04.500 --> 57:05.500
you have not

57:05.500 --> 57:06.500
used so you

57:06.500 --> 57:07.500
have to pay more

57:07.500 --> 57:08.500
money

57:08.500 --> 57:09.500
that is not

57:09.500 --> 57:10.500
gone

57:10.500 --> 57:11.500
this is the

57:11.500 --> 57:12.500
so-called

57:12.500 --> 57:13.500
one-stage

57:13.500 --> 57:14.500
non-exhaustive

57:14.500 --> 57:15.500
non-exhaustive

57:15.500 --> 57:16.500
this will

57:16.500 --> 57:17.500
mean that

57:17.500 --> 57:18.500
a game

57:18.500 --> 57:19.500
exhaustive

57:19.500 --> 57:20.500
contract

57:20.500 --> 57:21.500
game

57:21.500 --> 57:22.500
it is based on

57:22.500 --> 57:23.500
Apple's

57:23.500 --> 57:24.500
two-stage game

57:24.500 --> 57:25.500
this is interesting

57:25.500 --> 57:26.500
we will go to

57:26.500 --> 57:27.500
two stages

57:27.500 --> 57:28.500
of two stages

57:28.500 --> 57:29.500
to run

57:29.500 --> 57:30.500
this model

57:30.500 --> 57:31.500
this game

57:31.500 --> 57:32.500
3 model

57:32.500 --> 57:33.500
that

57:33.500 --> 57:34.500
inside the game

57:34.500 --> 57:35.500
exhaustive

57:35.500 --> 57:36.500
we just mentioned

57:36.500 --> 57:37.500
that

57:37.500 --> 57:38.500
because

57:38.500 --> 57:39.500
this Apple

57:39.500 --> 57:40.500
thinks

57:40.500 --> 57:41.500
you give me

57:41.500 --> 57:42.500
modern chip

57:42.500 --> 57:43.500
is all

57:43.500 --> 57:44.500
all

57:44.500 --> 57:45.500
include all

57:45.500 --> 57:46.500
patents

57:46.500 --> 57:47.500
price

57:47.500 --> 57:48.500
OK

57:48.500 --> 57:49.500
because it

57:49.500 --> 57:50.500
includes all

57:50.500 --> 57:51.500
patents

57:51.500 --> 57:52.500
price

57:52.500 --> 57:53.500
100%

57:53.500 --> 57:54.500
non-exhaustive

57:54.500 --> 57:55.500
that

57:55.500 --> 57:56.500
may be

57:56.500 --> 57:57.500
because

57:57.500 --> 57:58.500
this high-speed

57:58.500 --> 57:59.500
he thought

57:59.500 --> 58:00.500
that

58:00.500 --> 58:01.500
the patent

58:01.500 --> 58:02.500
inside the

58:02.500 --> 58:03.500
modern chip

58:03.500 --> 58:04.500
is only

58:04.500 --> 58:05.500
part of me

58:05.500 --> 58:06.500
OK

58:06.500 --> 58:07.500
so

58:07.500 --> 58:08.500
I

58:08.500 --> 58:09.500
I have

58:09.500 --> 58:10.500
many other

58:10.500 --> 58:11.500
patents

58:11.500 --> 58:12.500
have not

58:12.500 --> 58:13.500
given you

58:13.500 --> 58:14.500
so

58:14.500 --> 58:15.500
I

58:15.500 --> 58:16.500
also add

58:16.500 --> 58:17.500
this money

58:17.500 --> 58:18.500
there is

58:18.500 --> 58:19.500
the whole

58:19.500 --> 58:20.500
technology

58:20.500 --> 58:21.500
this is

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
I think

58:22.500 --> 58:23.500
Apple to pay

58:23.500 --> 58:24.500
what is

58:24.500 --> 58:25.500
Apple

58:25.500 --> 58:26.500
to pay

58:26.500 --> 58:27.500
the whole

58:27.500 --> 58:28.500
market value

58:28.500 --> 58:29.500
value

58:29.500 --> 58:30.500
is not just

58:30.500 --> 58:31.500
cheap

58:31.500 --> 58:32.500
OK

58:32.500 --> 58:33.500
so

58:33.500 --> 58:34.500
this model

58:34.500 --> 58:35.500
in

58:35.500 --> 58:36.500
price

58:36.500 --> 58:37.500
is the

58:37.500 --> 58:38.500
P

58:38.500 --> 58:39.500
above

58:39.500 --> 58:40.500
the basic

58:40.500 --> 58:41.500
method of

58:41.500 --> 58:42.500
calculation

58:42.500 --> 58:43.500
of

58:43.500 --> 58:44.500
this

58:44.500 --> 58:45.500
base

58:45.500 --> 58:46.500
is not

58:46.500 --> 58:47.500
the same

58:47.500 --> 58:48.500
OK

58:48.500 --> 58:49.500
that

58:49.500 --> 58:50.500
in

58:50.500 --> 58:51.500
how much

58:51.500 --> 58:52.500
percentage

58:52.500 --> 58:53.500
to calculate

58:53.500 --> 58:54.500
but it

58:54.500 --> 58:55.500
is not

58:55.500 --> 58:56.500
supposed to

58:56.500 --> 58:57.500
use the

58:57.500 --> 58:58.500
whole

58:58.500 --> 58:59.500
market

58:59.500 --> 59:00.500
price

59:00.500 --> 59:01.500
to calculate

59:01.500 --> 59:02.500
OK

59:02.500 --> 59:03.500
this is

59:03.500 --> 59:04.500
our two

59:04.500 --> 59:05.500
different

59:05.500 --> 59:06.500
game

59:06.500 --> 59:07.500
his

59:07.500 --> 59:08.500
calculation

59:08.500 --> 59:09.500
price

59:09.500 --> 59:10.500
P

59:10.500 --> 59:11.500
this

59:11.500 --> 59:12.500
price

59:12.500 --> 59:13.500
above

59:13.500 --> 59:14.500
is not

59:14.500 --> 59:15.500
the same

59:15.500 --> 59:16.500
that

59:16.500 --> 59:17.500
came

59:17.500 --> 59:18.500
two

59:18.500 --> 59:19.500
stages

59:19.500 --> 59:20.500
in

59:20.500 --> 59:21.500
the

59:21.500 --> 59:22.500
first

59:22.500 --> 59:23.500
stage

59:23.500 --> 59:24.500
I

59:24.500 --> 59:25.500
know

59:25.500 --> 59:26.500
that

59:26.500 --> 59:27.500
this

59:27.500 --> 59:28.500
is a

59:28.500 --> 59:29.500
very interesting

59:29.500 --> 59:30.500
point

59:30.500 --> 59:31.500
in

59:31.500 --> 59:32.500
Qualcomm's

59:32.500 --> 59:33.500
complaint

59:33.500 --> 59:34.500
is that

59:34.500 --> 59:35.500
I do not

59:35.500 --> 59:36.500
know if

59:36.500 --> 59:37.500
one

59:37.500 --> 59:38.500
year

59:38.500 --> 59:39.500
or

59:39.500 --> 59:40.500
one

59:40.500 --> 59:41.500
year

59:41.500 --> 59:42.500
one

59:42.500 --> 59:43.500
year

59:43.500 --> 59:44.500
one

59:44.500 --> 59:45.500
year

59:45.500 --> 59:46.500
I

59:46.500 --> 59:47.500
forgot

59:47.500 --> 59:48.500
which

59:48.500 --> 59:49.500
device

59:49.500 --> 59:50.500
I

59:50.500 --> 59:51.500
started

59:51.500 --> 59:52.500
complaining

59:52.500 --> 59:53.500
about

59:53.500 --> 59:54.500
is because

59:54.500 --> 59:55.500
Apple

59:55.500 --> 59:56.500
but it

59:56.500 --> 59:57.500
breaks the

59:57.500 --> 59:58.500
rule

59:58.500 --> 01:00:17.500
went to

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500
Apple

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.500
will not accept

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.500
the

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.500
Bundle Rebate

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.500
and

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.500
Core Comp

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.500
most important

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.500
role

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.500
it

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500
is there a reason

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.500
to provide

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.500
this rebate

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.500
is our basic

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500
GAP

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500
and

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500
that

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.500
math model

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500
we have a few

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500
assumptions

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.500
are actually

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.500
based on our

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.500
story

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.500
so actually

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.500
quite intuitive

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.500
first

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.500
we assume

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500
it is a

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.500
very

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500
market

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.500
quality

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.500
and

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.500
higher than

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.500
Intel

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.500
in the first

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.500
stage

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500
should be able to

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.500
understand

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.500
the

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.500
recent years

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.500
so

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.500
that

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.500
and

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.500
these

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.500
Apple

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.500
Apple

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.500
and

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.500
Qualcomm

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.500
these

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.500
are actually

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.500
a

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.500
standard

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.500
for their

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.500
companies

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.500
is that

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.500
I want to

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.500
get the

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.500
third

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.500
it

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.500
is that

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.500
we play

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.500
the game

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.500
a bit like

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.500
Apple is a

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.500
follower

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.500
because Apple

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.500
it did not produce

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.500
the so-called

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.500
modern chip

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.500
it did not

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.500
create a

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.500
modern chip

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.500
so

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.500
it is a

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.500
bit like

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.500
this game

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.500
is the

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.500
first

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.500
Qualcomm

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.500
it provides

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.500
a contract

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.500
which

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.500
includes

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.500
Bundle

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.500
Rebate

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.500
so

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.500
we play the game

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.500
is that

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.500
Apple accept

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.500
or not

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.500
accept

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.500
it

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.500
for Qualcomm

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.500
what is its

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.500
profit

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.500
and

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.500
what is the

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.500
profit of

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.500
Apple

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.500
does not

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.500
accept

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.500
Qualcomm's

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.500
profit

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.500
how to

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.500
change

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500
Apple's

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.500
profit

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.500
how to

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.500
change

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.500
so

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.500
we use

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.500
this

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.500
Pi

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.500
to

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.500
game

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500
is a

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.500
game

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500
is

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.500
the

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500
game

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.500
that

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.500
is

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.500
the

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.500
game

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.500
this

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.500
game

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.500
is

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.500
the

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.500
game

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.500
that

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.500
is

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.500
a

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.500
game

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.500
that

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.500
is

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.500
a

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500
game

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.500
so

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500
we

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.500
use

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.500
this

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.500
game

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.500
with

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.500
that

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.500
game

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.500
so

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.500
let's

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.500
say

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.500
if

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.500
we

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.500
say

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.500
if

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.500
galaxy

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.500
part

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.500
is

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.500
a

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.500
game

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.500
that

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500
is

01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.500
a

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.500
screen

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.500
over

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500
the

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.500
screen

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.500
so

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.500
a

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500
game

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.500
is

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.500
a

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.500
screen

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.500
that

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.500
a

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.500
is

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500
a

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.500

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.500
that

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.500
a

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.500

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.500
over

the

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500
screen

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500
so

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.500
when

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.500
the

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.500
game

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.500
is

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500
a

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.500
part

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.500
of

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.500
it

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.500
we

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.260
say

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.260
when

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.260
the

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.260
game

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.260
is so

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.260
long

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.260
so

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.260
long

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.260
but

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.260
it's

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.260
a

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.260

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.260
over

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.260
the

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.260

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.260
so

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.260
when

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.260
the

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.260
game

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.260
is

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.260
so

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.260
long

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:54.260
but

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.260
it's

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.260
a

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.260
a

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.260
screen

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.260
over

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:53.260
the

01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:54.260
screen

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.260
so

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.260
when

01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.260
the

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.260
game

01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.260
is so

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.260
long

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.260
but

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.260
it's

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:03.260
a

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.260
screen

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:05.260
