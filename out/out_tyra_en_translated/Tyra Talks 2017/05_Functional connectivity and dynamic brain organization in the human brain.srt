1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Can you see me now?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ok

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Can you see my screen now?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, yes, yes

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I will turn off my camera

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So it will be smoother

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ok

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let me tell you

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There are two more people here

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One is here

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
One is over there

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The camera may not be able to see

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There are three people here

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If they have any questions

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't be surprised if they are real people

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sorry

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There were some microphone issues

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's why we are delaying

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The topic I am going to talk about

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
looks a bit

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
difficult to understand

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Functional connectivity and dynamics

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and burn organization

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In short

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The main purpose of my research

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
is to look at the functional connections

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
between neural networks

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The so-called functional connections

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
are the neural signals

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
generated by neurons

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
during activation

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How these neural signals

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
are transmitted between different brains

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is the main thing

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am going to talk about today

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will divide it into two parts

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The first part is introduction

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Introduction is a general

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
background idea

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If you are not a neurologist

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You need to know something

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to make it easier for us to explain

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is one of the main research

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The second part is

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the current message

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It is about a

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
special project

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The last part is all about that project

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The first part is

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
a little bit

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
scientific

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The second part is more about

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that research

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have seen

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the comments

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Some people are just

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
talking about science

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So I want to talk about

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
what is neuroscience

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have seen

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
on the internet

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Neuroscience is a

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
comprehensive research

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It includes chemistry,

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
medicine, physiology, medicine

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
even computer science and engineering

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There are a lot of subjects

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
From the perspective of

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
modern neuroscience

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There are

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
cells

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and neurons

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
enlarge the scale

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There are cognitive science

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and behavioral science

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Finally, there is transfer medicine

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It is to apply the research

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
in the lab to clinical

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you want to

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There are micro scale,

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
mesoscale and macroscale

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The last part is

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
about the research

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The first part is

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
between neurons

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The research topic is

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
between neurons

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let me correct

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The first part is

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
about single neurons

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The second part is

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
between neurons

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The last part is

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
between neurons

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The biggest part

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
is what I have done

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
At the same time

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What I have done

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
will cover the last part

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will use

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
a simple sentence

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It is about

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
neural connectivity

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You will hear

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
functional connectivity

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It is about

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the connectivity

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
of neurons

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There is another point

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We want to see

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the connection of

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
human behavior

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
For example,

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
their behavior

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
in clinical

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
or in cognitive science

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I will talk about

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
functional connectivity later

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will talk about

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
functional connectivity later

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
For example,

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
some of you

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
have studied psychology

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
or cognitive science

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You may have heard

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
some theory

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I will give you some examples

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The left one is called localization

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In short,

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
scientists study

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
brain function

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
or human behavior

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They want to

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
target some function

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
in a specific area

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is the result

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
of an FMRI

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
on the Internet

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can see

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the three colored areas

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It means that

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
when the subject is doing something

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the neurons in these three areas

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
are active

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is a more traditional theory

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
They think

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
they need to

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
classify

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
which brain area

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
is responsible for which function

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The other one is called

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
distributed brain networks

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
These two schools

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
have been fighting for a long time

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But recently

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
because of some new research methods

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
most people think

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
this is more like the human brain we expect

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In this new school

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
their focus

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
is not on studying

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
a single brain area

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Instead,

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
they focus on

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the function between

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
different brain areas

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For example,

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
this brain area

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
may send a message

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to this area

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This area

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
may send a message

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to this area

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This area

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
may send a message

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to this area

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This is a way

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
for them to communicate

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
between neurons

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is a way

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
for them to communicate

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
between neurons

185
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is a way

186
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
for them to communicate

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
between neurons

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
About

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
how to study

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and measure

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
functional connectivity

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
From statistics

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
from different areas

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
For example

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is a brain

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's say

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you have 3 regions

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
1,2,3

199
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The blue, red, and green lines

200
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The blue, red, and green lines

201
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
are the time course

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
are the time course

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm using FMRI

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is the signal change

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
caused by the activation

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
of a neuron

207
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
FMRI is used as basic

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
FMRI is used as basic

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
ingredients for cooking

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
ingredients for cooking

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
When you get the signal

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can see the relation

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
between neurons

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can use different machines

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can use different machines

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can use different machines

217
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You can use different machines

218
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I used FMRI for my research

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I used FMRI for my research

220
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Every functional connectivity

221
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I use FMRI for my research

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I use FMRI for my research

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Time series

224
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I use FMRI for my research

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you have 3 regions

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you have 3 regions

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The first step is

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to extract the signal

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You start sending signals

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You start sending signals

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
using different methods

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
to estimate the relation

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to 2-3 brain regions

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
to estimate the relation

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you use Pairwise Correlation

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You will see a lot of values

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
For example

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This represents

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the relation between

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Ri2 and Ri1

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If they are positive

242
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
For example, this is about 0.5

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
For example, this is about 0.5

244
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This means that this region

245
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and this region are connected

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and this region and this region are connected

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't look at this

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't look at this

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It means that you and yourself are connected

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It means that you and yourself are connected

251
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But this is not a normal situation

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is because we are calculating

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
After we get this evidence

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
After we get this evidence

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We will force the line to 0

256
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We will force the line to 0

257
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is the way we use

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This is the way we use

259
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of course, you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Of course, you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Many people use different methods

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
For example, Partial Correlation, Mutual Information

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Many people use different methods

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There is no specific method

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It depends on what you want to see

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It depends on what you want to see

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It depends on what you want to see

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
After that

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
After that

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
After we get this evidence

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We will be curious

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What are we going to do next

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
After we get this evidence

274
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We will be curious

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There are too many signals

276
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There are too many signals

277
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So, I am going to report on this data

278
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So, I am going to report on this data

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So we got the evidence

280
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So we got the evidence

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So we got the evidence

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We have two main topics

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Now we have two main topics

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

285
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

286
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let me answer a question

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let me answer a question

288
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let me tell you

289
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you have any questions

290
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can type it into the chat

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can type it into the chat

292
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and I will find time to answer

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Or I will tell you to check with the organization

294
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Or I will tell you to check with the organization

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I will ask you the questions

296
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because I can't see the chat

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because I can't see the chat

298
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So I don't know the questions

299
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you have any questions, you can ask

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If you have any questions, you can ask

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Before we talk about graph theory

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Before we talk about graph theory

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Do you have any questions?

304
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Do you have any questions?

305
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If not, let's continue

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If not, let's continue

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There is a little bit of abstraction

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let me try

309
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Later we can continue to discuss

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Later we can continue to discuss

311
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's intentional

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Describing the relationship between two points

313
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Describing the relationship between two points

314
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Describing the relationship between two points

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It is a very good tool

316
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If you use graph theory

317
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You can get a lot of different values

318
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Each value represents a specific feature of the network

319
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Each value represents a specific feature of the network

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
For example

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We'll talk about some different values later

322
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Some values may represent

323
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
How well the signal is integrated in the entire brain

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How well the signal is integrated in the entire brain

325
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Or how well it is integrated in a single system

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So there will be some different messages

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So there will be some different messages

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
When you do graph theory

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There are two things that are very important

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
These are the two files you must get

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The first one is Node

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The other one is Edge

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Node is our so-called region of interest

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
For example, on the right

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This is the data obtained by the actual receiver

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have 36

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I have 36

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So there are 36 areas of the brain

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So there are 36 areas of the brain

340
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So there are 36 areas of the brain

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So there are 36 areas of the brain

342
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
One point to remember

343
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
One point to remember

344
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Each of those 36 types of dots

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000

00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Time-Varying Method

397
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Time-Varying Method

398
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Time-Varying Method

399
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Time-Varying Method

400
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Time-Varying Method

401
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Time-Varying Method

402
00:28:48,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Time-Varying Method

403
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Time-Varying Method

404
00:29:37,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Time-Varying Method

405
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Time-Varying Method

406
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Time-Varying Method

407
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Time-Varying Method

408
00:30:45,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Substantial Nigra

409
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Substantial Nigra

410
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Substantial Nigra

411
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Rigidity

412
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Postural Problem

413
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Motor Symptoms

414
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Substantial Nigra

415
00:32:43,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Substantial Nigra

416
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Substantial Nigra

417
00:33:34,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Substantial Nigra

418
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The patient will be sent to the center of the machine.

419
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Because the magnetic field in the center is more stable.

420
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Then we start scanning.

421
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
One thing you need to know is that

422
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
MRI has a very loud noise.

423
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So we put earplugs on the patient.

424
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
To protect their hearing.

425
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
In addition, it is a magnetic field.

426
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So there can't be any metal objects on the body.

427
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
For example, keys, wallets, rings, etc.

428
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
All have to be taken down.

429
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Including women's underwear can also be brought in.

430
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So we always ask the cleaner to change clothes.

431
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
This is the image we got.

432
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
In principle, we do this kind of thing.

433
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
We will scan two images.

434
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The most basic.

435
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
One is called T1 Weighted Imaging.

436
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
This is to provide you a structural image.

437
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You can see it clearly.

438
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This image will tell you which one is which.

439
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Gray is gray.

440
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
White is white.

441
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The empty space in the middle is water.

442
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
There is a spinal cord.

443
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Brain.

444
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
These two are eyeballs.

445
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The middle is the air.

446
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
This image provides you with very clear structural information.

447
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
In addition, we will scan the functional imaging.

448
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
We call it Bolt Signal.

449
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It is written here.

450
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
This image is physical observation.

451
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
If you don't deal with it, you can't see anything.

452
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You can only see the middle is the CSF.

453
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You can't clearly define the brain.

454
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Or gray and white.

455
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So when we analyze,

456
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The most important thing is to analyze this image.

457
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
The principle of fMRI is quite complicated.

458
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
This is what I have found so far.

459
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I have seen the simplest and most powerful picture.

460
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I can introduce it to you.

461
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
When the neural source is active,

462
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It needs oxygen, oxygen and blood.

463
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Now the neural source is active.

464
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
The blood vessels near the neural source begin to increase blood flow.

465
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Bring fresh oxygen blood cells to this place.

466
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You will find a lot of fresh blood coming here.

467
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Because oxygen needs to enter the neural source.

468
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Fresh blood will come.

469
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
There are a lot of new oxygen here.

470
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
When the oxygen-blood-red and oxygen-blood-red interact,

471
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We can generate a signal.

472
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Because fMRI is a strong magnetic field.

473
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We used to learn the Faraday's law.

474
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Because of the change in the magnetic field, it will generate an electric signal.

475
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It will be received by the current.

476
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
After a lot of image processing,

477
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You will see this image.

478
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Because of the imbalance of oxygen-blood-red and oxygen-blood-red,

479
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It will generate a signal.

480
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So the picture we just talked about,

481
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The so-called Tom course,

482
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's this thing.

483
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
After we get this thing,

484
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We can start the follow-up analysis.

485
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Of course, the story is not that simple.

486
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Because you can analyze from the signal to the magnetic field.

487
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
There are a lot of things to do in the middle.

488
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
For example, you have to correct the difference in time.

489
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And then correct the space difference.

490
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Sometimes the brain will move like this.

491
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You can't just take the data and analyze it.

492
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You have to correct these things first.

493
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
These things are called preprocessing.

494
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I didn't talk too much today.

495
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The main thing is to let you know that you have to correct the difference in time and space.

496
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
We will focus on the latter part.

497
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
How do you analyze them?

498
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Wait a minute.

499
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Did you have any questions about any image acquisition?

500
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Can I ask a question?

501
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Do you have any questions on the spot?

502
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Did you get this picture on the spot?

503
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You got this picture when you did it.

504
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Then you turn it like this.

505
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Then you turn it into this picture.

506
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
After sending this picture in, it will give you this.

507
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You have to set a few points on the picture.

508
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Then it will find it.

509
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Otherwise, how do you know how many pictures are there?

510
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Okay.

511
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
He asked if we get this picture from here to here.

512
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Basically, how do you get there?

513
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yes.

514
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Because I omitted a lot of things.

515
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So I'm going to talk about it now.

516
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
If we process it in our lab, we will get this T1 and BOL signal.

517
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Then we will throw T1 into a software called FreeSurfer.

518
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The purpose is to do so-called cortical postulation.

519
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
That's why we get those R1, R2, R3, R4.

520
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,000
We take this T1, which means we label each brain area and give it an ID.

521
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Then we do the pre-processing of the image obtained by the fMRI.

522
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
After the pre-processing, we have to put the T1 with the label and the pre-processed fMRI in place.

523
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Because they say that the victim's head won't move too much.

524
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But we still have to put these two images in place to ensure that the area we see on the T1 is the same area on the fMRI.

525
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So this placement is very important.

526
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:34,000
After we put T1 and fMRI in place, we tell the software that we first define how many RIs you want from T1.

527
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
If there are 100, I tell the computer that I want 90.

528
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Then I list all the 90 IDs.

529
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
There is a step called Time Course Extraction.

530
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
After we put these two IDs in place, I tell the software to extract the time course of the 90 RIs.

531
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
For example, the first RI is here.

532
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I extract the time course of this RI.

533
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
The second RI is here.

534
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I extract the time course of this RI.

535
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's like this.

536
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
How big is the RI?

537
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It depends on how you do the protocol postulation.

538
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Basically, the resolution of this RI is 1x1x1 mm.

539
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But some areas are bigger.

540
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
For example, if you have a prefrontal cortex, it's very big.

541
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But if you have a very small one, the anterior cingulate cortex will be smaller.

542
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So it doesn't necessarily depend on the area of your brain.

543
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So what do you usually decide to look at?

544
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
This is a very tricky question.

545
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
If you look at this area, you will find that this area has not changed at all.

546
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It's just floating in another area.

547
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yes.

548
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So now most people tend to use it.

549
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's a bit like looking at how many brain areas you have when you do postulation.

550
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Usually, at least 90 or more.

551
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I know there are more than 100 in FreeSurfer.

552
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
A lot of people take out more than 100 brain areas.

553
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Because they don't know which one they want to look at.

554
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So they just take out all the information about the brain areas.

555
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Some people are very specific.

556
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
They have their assumptions.

557
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
They think which brain area has a special relationship with which brain area they want to look at.

558
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Then they will have a purpose to choose those brain areas first.

559
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Indeed, at the beginning, when you are writing articles,

560
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
the question that often comes back is why you choose these brain areas.

561
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So now, I think it's better to avoid this question.

562
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Plus, you really don't know where the changes are.

563
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So you use all the brain areas.

564
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So is it a problem that you already have?

565
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Or is it a problem that you already have?

566
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Or is it a problem that you already have?

567
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Oh, I found that these PhD students have a lot of questions.

568
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
In fact, it should be said that we already have different software and different templates.

569
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You will get different brain areas.

570
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
In fact, this is a big problem in video editing.

571
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Generally speaking, my answer is that we will have a defined brain area.

572
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
For example, you use FreeSurfer.

573
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Then you will definitely know which brain areas you can find in FreeSurfer.

574
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
This is a long list.

575
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Then we will say that we want these brain areas in that list.

576
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
There is another one called AAL.

577
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
This is another template.

578
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
This is another software.

579
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
If you write an article and say that this is an AAL template.

580
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Then we probably know which brain areas.

581
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
In principle, I don't think they are much different.

582
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But there are a lot of people who specialize in the so-called postulation.

583
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
They will tell you which different templates will have which different shortcomings.

584
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Then last year, I don't know if you have seen that report.

585
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
There was a paper in Nature last year.

586
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
There is a Human Connectome Project in the United States.

587
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
They scanned thousands of people.

588
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Then they used the data of those thousands of people.

589
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Then at the same time, it also contains different modalities.

590
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
For example, there is a functional image of MIT1.

591
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
There is also T2 or Proton Density Modeling.

592
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
There are many different images.

593
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
They put all the modalities together.

594
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Use all these modalities to build another template.

595
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
My impression is that there are more than 100 brain areas than we currently know.

596
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It seems to be more than 200.

597
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So how do you define your brain area?

598
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's a bit tricky.

599
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
At present, we can only say which template you use.

600
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Or if you use which software.

601
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
We probably know what your so-called brain areas are.

602
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Is there any other questions?

603
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
For example, if the area is large or small,

604
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
you can set it to large or small.

605
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
For example, if the signal is very strong when you are small,

606
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but when you are large,

607
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
you have to remove the signal.

608
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yes, there is.

609
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
This is what I don't believe.

610
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
For example, there are some things in the brain area

611
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
where the signal is very, very bad.

612
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Because it just intersects with the air.

613
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
In fact, you can see it in this image.

614
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can see that there is still a brain area here.

615
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
This is the prefrontal cortex.

616
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But it's already close to the sinus, the air area.

617
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
In T1, it looks okay.

618
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
But in FMR, you can see that it's super bad.

619
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Half of the frontal area is gone.

620
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
For example, in the frontal area,

621
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
there are some very small areas, such as the frontal pole.

622
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That area is very small.

623
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And it's close to the air.

624
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So the signal under FMR is super bad.

625
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Usually, I don't look at that area.

626
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
If your signal is already bad,

627
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and you find out that it's mutating,

628
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
what do you say?

629
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Is it really caused by the difference in the vital signs of the nervous system?

630
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Or is it because your own signal is bad?

631
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So my approach is to put those too small areas

632
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
or in those areas where the signal is unclear.

633
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't want those areas.

634
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Which areas are often unclear when you draw like this?

635
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Frontal

636
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The closest to the frontal area

637
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
is the frontal area.

638
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Because it's too close to the air.

639
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
There will be a so-called partial volume effect.

640
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
If you look at this picture,

641
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
the signal is bad in the front area.

642
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And there's an area near here called the orbital frontal cortex.

643
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's close to the nasal cavity.

644
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
There's a lot of air there, so the signal is bad.

645
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And the other area is the temporal pole.

646
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's at the tip of the temporal area.

647
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And there's the inferior temporal cortex.

648
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
It's at the bottom of the temporal area.

649
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Because it's close to the skull base.

650
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So in those areas,

651
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
if I actually see the whole data sharing,

652
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and find that there's an important change in the location,

653
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I'll be a little hesitant.

654
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And then I'll go back and see if my image blurring is good or not.

655
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And then I'll decide whether to believe it or not.

656
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Okay, anything else?

657
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Okay, let's move on.

658
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Okay, this is a little bit...

659
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You have to be patient.

660
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Because this is a little bit complicated.

661
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
This is the background I was talking about earlier.

662
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
The background for this experiment.

663
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Now I'm going to talk about how to use it for this experiment.

664
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And then you'll see...

665
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
First of all, I'm going to talk about dynamic functional connectivity.

666
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I use sliding window.

667
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
This blue is the so-called fMRI timecord.

668
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That's what we've been talking about.

669
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
When you're doing a sliding window,

670
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
the most important thing,

671
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
the first step is to define your so-called window length.

672
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Which is how big your window is.

673
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm using 20 time points here.

674
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That is to say, I only need...

675
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I only have the first 20 time points.

676
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And then I'll do correlation.

677
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I'm using Pearson's correlation here.

678
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And then I'll get a matrix.

679
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And this matrix represents...

680
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I have 54 ROI here.

681
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It represents the relationship between these 54 ROI.

682
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And then I'm going to move my window forward.

683
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Just one time point.

684
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And do the same thing and you'll get the second matrix.

685
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Wait a minute.

686
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
How long is a time point usually?

687
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Oh, it depends on your MRI scan parameters.

688
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
We have two seconds here.

689
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And then you just keep doing the same thing.

690
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Until you've used up all the fMRI timecords.

691
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I have a total of 221 window correlation matrices here.

692
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And then the next very important thing is...

693
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I've got so many matrices.

694
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But not all of them are the same.

695
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So how am I going to report their variability?

696
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So we've calculated seven...

697
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I call them network features.

698
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
According to these matrices,

699
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm going to calculate some numbers.

700
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And each number represents variability.

701
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
For example, the first one.

702
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I call it network variation.

703
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
The first one is very simple.

704
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
In fact, we want to see the overall variability.

705
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So let's just take the first one and the second one.

706
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Take all the numbers in the matrix and subtract them.

707
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And then do the same thing for each of the 221 matrices.

708
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
On average.

709
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So the number we get is a bit like...

710
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
On average, the variability of your entire brain's connectivity.

711
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And then the second one is called network power.

712
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
This is actually very simple.

713
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's mainly about adding up all the connectivity values.

714
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
On average.

715
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And the purpose of this is to get...

716
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's a bit like...

717
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
On average, the strength of your connectivity.

718
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And then these are very similar from C to G and A.

719
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But the difference is...

720
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
A is measuring all the numbers in the whole brain.

721
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
All the elements in this matrix.

722
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But C to G is for a specific connection.

723
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
For example, this is called Inter-Hemisphere Connection.

724
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We only calculate the connection between the opposite brain areas.

725
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And then this is Cross-Hemisphere.

726
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And then this is Within-Hemisphere.

727
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's on the same side.

728
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And then we divide it into the left and the right.

729
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So you can see that the mathematics is actually quite similar.

730
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's just that when we calculate C to G.

731
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The value we get is...

732
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
For example, when we calculate C, we take the right-angled line.

733
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Because the right-angled line represents the connectivity from left to right.

734
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And then...

735
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
This is how the sliding window runs.

736
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What about the other graph theory?

737
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I made it a little fancier here.

738
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I have a little bit of a graph theory.

739
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Combine the two sliding windows together.

740
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So in the front, you'll find that it's exactly the same as the sliding window.

741
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's all the same until this step.

742
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The difference is that after I got this matrix.

743
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I didn't just add or subtract it.

744
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Do some processing to calculate the so-called network feature.

745
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But I first apply a threshold.

746
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Above a certain threshold.

747
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I think these connections are real connections.

748
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
There's no miscommunication under this threshold.

749
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And then I'm going to throw this threshold edge.

750
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
There's something called Brain Connectivity Toolbox.

751
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
This is a free download on the Internet.

752
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's a graph theory.

753
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
After I throw it into the graph theory.

754
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I'll get two global features in each window.

755
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And a local measure.

756
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
In fact, you can get more.

757
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm just using these three for now.

758
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The so-called global measure is.

759
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
One subject will have one number.

760
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
The local measure is.

761
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It depends on how many RRIs it has.

762
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
How many numbers will there be?

763
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And then I'm going to have 221 sets.

764
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Then there are three numbers in each window.

765
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
This is a bit complicated.

766
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
But in a nutshell.

767
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
It's a different way.

768
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I got a lot of different numbers.

769
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Or so-called network features.

770
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Then the point is to look at the patient.

771
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
What's the difference between normal control and normal control?

772
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And then the next one.

773
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Okay.

774
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Actually, this is a little bit.

775
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Is there a problem?

776
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It's okay. I'm going to ask this one.

777
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Now you have it.

778
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You can keep talking.

779
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Don't talk to me.

780
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Okay.

781
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Okay.

782
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's okay.

783
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
After the analysis of the RRIs.

784
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
We got the so-called numbers.

785
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
These are the ones.

786
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
When we use the sliding window.

787
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
We'll get the power of the network variation.

788
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And then the specific connections I just mentioned.

789
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
This is inter-hemisphere.

790
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And then this is cross-hemisphere.

791
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And in the same brain.

792
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
In the same brain.

793
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And then there's the left and the right.

794
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
The so-called flexibility.

795
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It's actually what we're going to do.

796
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
The number of correlations.

797
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
The number of correlations between the two windows.

798
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Two minus.

799
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And then on average.

800
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So these are the numbers in the sliding window.

801
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
If the number is higher.

802
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It means that his connectivity is more dynamic.

803
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
The more mutable, the bigger.

804
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And then dynamic graphical approach.

805
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
That's what we just talked about.

806
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Combined graph theory and sliding window.

807
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It's the same global feature.

808
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I have two.

809
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
One is called global efficiency.

810
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
One is called modularity.

811
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It's a little hard to explain here.

812
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'll try to explain it.

813
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I can't explain it.

814
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
If it's not clear.

815
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Maybe you need to check that.

816
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I'll show you a paper later.

817
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
There may be a complete one in there.

818
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
There's a complete math.

819
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It's easier to understand.

820
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
In short, global efficiency.

821
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The way it's calculated.

822
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
The shortest distance between these two points.

823
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Make them equal.

824
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Do the math first.

825
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And then on average.

826
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
This global efficiency represents.

827
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
The information of the entire neural network.

828
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
In the whole brain.

829
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
How well is it integrated?

830
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So it's also an indicator of integration.

831
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Modularity is just the opposite.

832
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's an indicator of segregation.

833
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Modularity is actually.

834
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Under this network.

835
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Will this network be.

836
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Will it be divided into several different.

837
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Small networks.

838
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's an indicator of segregation.

839
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
This means.

840
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
If the modularity value is higher.

841
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It means.

842
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Its signal.

843
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
In a single system.

844
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's better to be integrated.

845
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
These two points are the opposite.

846
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Integration and segregation.

847
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Another local measure.

848
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Betweenness centrality.

849
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
In short.

850
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You calculate this brain.

851
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Brain area.

852
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
This RRI.

853
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
How important is it in the entire neural network?

854
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That is to say.

855
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
How many.

856
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
The shortest path.

857
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Through this brain.

858
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
This brain area.

859
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
This RRI.

860
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
If this number is higher.

861
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It means.

862
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
This brain area is more important.

863
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It could be.

864
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
The hubs we just talked about.

865
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
With these numbers.

866
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
The first thing we do.

867
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Is to see.

868
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
What's the difference between the patient and the PD patient?

869
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And the other is.

870
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
These values.

871
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Do a forward return with the clinical indicator.

872
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
See what happens.

873
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Then.

874
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Next.

875
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
it is good.

876
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I want to test the bed.

877
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm here.

878
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
This is the result.

879
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I can tell you.

880
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
If it's just a two-sample t-test.

881
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I can't see any difference.

882
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Between patients and normal people.

883
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Those.

884
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
There is no difference at all.

885
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But we do.

886
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Simple.

887
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
When it's Pearson's correlation.

888
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You can find out.

889
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
This is.

890
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Sliding window.

891
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
The result of dynamic connectivity.

892
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
You can find out.

893
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Let's look at the above two.

894
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's the age.

895
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
With the network power.

896
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And.

897
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I put a small picture.

898
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
You can know which one it is.

899
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Connection.

900
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Inter-Hermitian connectivity.

901
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It's related.

902
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But I can tell you first.

903
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I think this is actually more like.

904
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Normal human aging.

905
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Will be produced.

906
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Because I.

907
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I see this on Parkinson's disease patients.

908
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But I also see it on normal people.

909
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So this.

910
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
We won't do so much discussion for the time being.

911
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And then.

912
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
But.

913
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
This is more interesting.

914
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
This is that.

915
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Postural instability.

916
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Get disorder.

917
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's their balance.

918
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Physical coordination.

919
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
That number.

920
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
With.

921
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Enter.

922
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
On the right.

923
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
This.

924
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
This is the right.

925
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Dynamic functional connectivity.

926
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's related to them.

927
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That is to say.

928
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
The more serious the patient.

929
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
His right connectivity.

930
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
More.

931
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Uh.

932
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Stiff.

933
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Can't.

934
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Uh.

935
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Change.

936
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
