00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone, I am Zhang Yanyong, the host today.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We are very happy to invite Xie Dayang, Diane Xie, to talk to us about her field of research and her current research topic.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Diane's main field of research is psychology and education psychology.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
She is currently a second-year PhD student at UC Irvine.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the field of education psychology, Diane is particularly interested in how family, culture, and so on outside of school affect young people's motivation and results in school.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Her topic today is Educational Inequality from a Psychology Perspective, Gender Gap in STEM as a Brief Example.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about gender in the Hollywood industry.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Everyone has different views on gender recognition.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We are very happy to invite Diane to talk to us about this topic.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that if you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone, otherwise you won't be able to hear me.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, you can start.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is very interesting.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you, Diane, for your introduction.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It seems like I am very good at introducing myself, but I am actually not that good.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I am very honored to share my research with everyone today.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't know if I can see six people today.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I will ask questions later.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
From the introduction of everyone, it seems that almost everyone is a science major.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I chose a topic that is more related to science in education psychology.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It is about the inequality of education in STEM, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
As Diane said, this is one of the questions that I can answer in my research direction.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am currently in the second year of UCI Education College.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Although I am in the Education College, the main research methods that I use and the methods that our professors and lab use are mainly from development psychology.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In general, I study social culture, interpersonal relationships, activity experience, and other things that are greater than the individual.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We call them social cultural factors.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How to affect the psychological development of the individual, which is the second link,

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
individual psychological development, and then affect the behavior and cognition of the individual, etc.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So this is a big direction.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It sounds very mysterious and very broad.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is partly because my research has just started and I can't speak very professionally.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Also because my research has just started, so I will be very nervous today.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you find that I speak faster and faster or start to be biased,

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
you are welcome to interrupt me at any time to ask questions or tell me to speak slower or I don't make sense.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I won't be angry.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I really hope everyone will help me.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay, so let's get into today's topic.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
To start today's topic, I actually want to start with a question.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So if you can turn on the microphone, that would be great.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just want to ask a very philosophical question.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why are you here?

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Specifically, why did you join Tyra?

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why did you choose a Saturday afternoon 3 o'clock and listen to some academic sharing here?

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why did you choose to get a Ph.D.?

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why did you choose to enter the academic circle with so many potential opportunities?

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Does anyone want to share why?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Does anyone want to speak first?

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Count to 10.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If no one wants to speak first, I will demonstrate.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, 1, 2, 3, 10.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I will demonstrate first.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why did I join Tyra?

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think this question is more like why I decided to join Tyra.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think this has to do with why I chose to get a Ph.D. and why I chose to stay in the academic circle.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think there's a very important reason.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's because I think...

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I thought about the reasons behind it.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why is it like this?

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I thought about it and found new things.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then I threw it back to solve the problem I was facing.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If I succeeded, I felt very accomplished.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I hope I can continue to use this to do what I want to do in my life.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So I will stay in the academic circle.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Of course, the condition of staying in the academic circle is to get a Ph.D.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Also, Tyra, to a certain extent, started from this motivation.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How should I put it?

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If I can communicate with others and have more ideas,

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
then I can think about the problems I'm facing and solve them.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then I can get this kind of feeling.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Something like that.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Anyone else wants to speak?

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't just let me speak.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't be shy.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Can I speak?

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hello, can you hear me?

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm Chi Chi.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Can you hear me clearly?

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why did I join Tyra?

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Because I'm quite interested in interdisciplinary learning.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In the past, most of the people I met were interdisciplinary learners.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So I thought it was interesting.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But I wasn't very active.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I only participated in a few programs.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Actually, today is the second program.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because I didn't quite understand the topic.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So it was a bit difficult.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But now I'm trying to develop.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think my purpose is simple.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I hope I can be a public intellectual.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So what I write and talk can be heard by people from different fields.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Because my learning background in the past has made me narrow.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because the people I talk to are all from the same field.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So I don't think I have the opportunity to talk to people from different fields.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I participated in this activity.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
On the one hand, I'm curious about things in different fields.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
On the other hand, I hope to communicate with different people.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can think about how to make people from different fields understand what I'm studying.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Thank you very much.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Does anyone else want to share?

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll talk about it.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hello everyone, my name is Qiyun.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I wanted to join Taira because I thought the plan was a bit cool.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can use the Internet and hear that everyone is Taiwanese.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And research in different fields.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Why do I want to get a PhD?

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Mainly because I'm interested in my major.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I do math.

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I want to keep doing research.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So I have to get a PhD.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's about it.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank you very much.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Anyone else wants to share?

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, I'll assume this is a no.

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I started with this question because I've always been interested in this topic.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I just wanted to hear everyone talk about it.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The second is to bring everyone into the topic I'm going to talk about today.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Education.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Education.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
From what I just heard, we give it a lot of value.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Like someone said, I hope what I do today will be more valuable in the future.

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Or I hope what I do today will be more valuable in the future.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So I see it mainly as knowledge and strength.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We can see that we believe that education is a positive thing.

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Just like what I just shared, it's almost all positive.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But if my question is why I want to get a PhD.

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can also say that I lost something in the past few years.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But no one said that.

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This gives a very positive value.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is a very common idea that people don't even question.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Education can give us a better future.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So we want to learn.

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Everyone has already gotten a PhD.

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't need to say that everyone is the best example.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So if we want to look at the value we give to education.

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If we look at the level of education alone and the so-called successful indicators.

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
For example, income.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We can see a very beautiful straight line.

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If we look at education and unemployment rate.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We see a beautiful inverse relationship.

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It seems that education can really bring social mobility.

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The so-called opportunity to climb up.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Just like this picture next to it.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is a very strong idea.

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Just like I just said.

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We give education a very just value.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So it's not hard to see that we put a lot of resources into education.

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For example, this year the United States allocated nearly $700 million to the Department of Education.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If we look at the state level.

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Take California as an example.

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The cost of education is actually greater than human resource health.

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It is also far greater than the cost of judicial administration or natural resource protection.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So this is just a quick introduction to the topic I want to talk about today.

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Everything sounds very reasonable at the moment.

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because education is a channel for everyone to climb up.

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So society should ensure that everyone gets equal education opportunities.

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's why we can see the role of the state government is to invest money in education.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is also a very tempting idea.

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Since education is a chance to turn around.

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We can say that we give education to the disadvantaged.

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They should climb up.

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Education has become a tool to reduce inequality in society.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I will talk about the topic of inequality today.

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Although this idea is very tempting.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But the problem is that if education itself is inequality.

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Then it may amplify inequality in society.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Instead of reducing inequality.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Of course, we don't want to see the reduction of inequality.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So the question for scholars is to ask.

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Is education itself inequality?

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is a big question.

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The short answer is yes.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Education is inequality.

172
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But inequality is very complicated.

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There are many reasons behind it.

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The second reason is that they are related to each other.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let me give you an example.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
In the United States, the most discussed inequality in education is racial inequality.

177
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Specifically, it is the inequality between black and white people.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If we look at this picture.

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The blue line is the performance of white children in mathematics.

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is the performance of the ninth grade.

181
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We can see that the blue line is far higher than the black line.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The orange line is the performance of Latin children.

183
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The green line.

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This is just one example.

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The same achievement gap can be seen at different ages.

186
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It can be seen in different subjects.

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I put a link below.

188
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is just one of the research units tracking these data.

189
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
To see how much racial inequality is now.

190
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
To see if there is any improvement.

191
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
From this picture, we can see that the X axis is the time.

192
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
After so many years, there is still no improvement.

193
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The gap is still very large.

194
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Many people will start to think about the reason for this gap.

195
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Of course, some people will wonder if it is because the resources of black children's schools are poor.

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It sounds like the racial discrimination of schools is outdated.

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It should not be abolished after the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s.

198
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why do we still see such a big gap?

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
One of the reasons is that the reason just now is very good.

200
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But if we look at the data, we will find that there is still isolation.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The fact is that most white children still go to schools for white children.

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Most black children still go to schools for black children.

203
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The schools that the latter go to are usually those schools that are less well-off.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
One of the people just said that schools are different now.

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We found that the problem of schools still exists.

206
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why does this problem still exist after so many years?

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
There are many reasons that are related to each other.

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
For example, why is there a difference in schools?

209
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
One of the reasons is that there is a difference in income.

210
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
On average, the income of black families is lower than that of white families.

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So the places they can live in are different.

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The places they live in are different, so the school district they go to is different.

213
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So if we put the income gap and the achievement gap together,

214
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
we will find that this is happening at the same time, and it is probably related to each other.

215
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So now things are getting more and more complicated.

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We just said that it may be because the schools are different.

217
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
OK, now we find that their economic level is also different.

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Then give another example.

219
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
In addition to these two, we can also look at the family.

220
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If we add the family in, we will find that the parents' education level

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
also has a gap between black and white people.

222
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This gap and the achievement gap just now are also affecting each other.

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So now things are getting more and more complicated.

224
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not just the school itself.

225
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
There is also a problem with the inequality of income in the whole society.

226
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Now we say that the parents' education level is also problematic.

227
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sometimes I think it's a bit of a ghost gun.

228
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's a vicious cycle.

229
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
For example, if there is a so-called gap in the family,

230
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
you can imagine that the parents with a lower level of education

231
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
will naturally have fewer books at home.

232
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Or they don't have those connections to participate in better extracurricular activities.

233
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Then it leads to their next generation's poor income.

234
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Then, as I said at the beginning, it's not about income, it's about education.

235
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Then education is related to income.

236
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Then it's like this, it's a vicious cycle.

237
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So I want to stop here.

238
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Because I find that I speak faster and faster.

239
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's probably because I'm getting more and more nervous.

240
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And here...

241
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I actually just have a question.

242
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Please say it.

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
My question is like this.

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
For example, the income gap or the education gap.

245
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I may not have heard what you just said.

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What is its definition?

247
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
At least in this picture, what is the meaning of the gap?

248
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Because I don't quite understand why there are so many dots.

249
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Is there no face?

250
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The dot is a week.

251
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Every dot is a week.

252
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, the dot is a week.

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's too exaggerated to put it on.

254
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So this should answer your question.

255
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
As I said, the education gap is...

256
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Back to what I said at the beginning.

257
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Education is a tool that can help people climb up.

258
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But this gap means that some people climb higher, some people climb lower.

259
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And if we're talking about the racial achievement gap,

260
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
white people climb higher, black people climb lower.

261
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And if it's the income gap,

262
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
some people climb higher, some people climb lower.

263
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So...

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Can I ask a question?

265
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This is the first time I've seen this graph.

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What does it mean?

267
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The dots and the axis.

268
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What does that mean?

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Right.

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That axis, that gap.

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
For example, this graph is actually a combination of many graphs.

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The x-axis is talking about the income gap.

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Each dot is a week.

274
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So if the income of white people in this week is twice as high as that of black people,

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
then the x-axis is a 2.

276
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If it's higher...

277
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It starts from 0.

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So 0 and above mean that white people are higher than black people.

279
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And the achievement gap means that

280
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
the learning performance of white people is higher than that of black people.

281
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So there's a gap like this.

282
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This graph means that

283
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
these two gaps are related to each other.

284
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And it's a positive relationship.

285
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
For example, if your income gap is high in the same week,

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
then your learning performance gap will also be high.

287
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Does that make sense?

288
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Or is it getting more and more confusing?

289
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Can I ask a question?

290
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So the circle means that each week is different.

291
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And the diagonal line is the standard line.

292
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The middle line.

293
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And the x-axis is the income gap.

294
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What is the y-axis?

295
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The y-axis is talking about

296
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the gap between white people and black people.

297
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So you can see that the y-axis is all 0 and above.

298
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It means that every week,

299
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the average income of white people is higher than that of black people.

300
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And how much is higher

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is proportional to the gap between white people and black people.

302
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And the middle line is a standard line.

303
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It seems like someone wants to ask a question.

304
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Go ahead.

305
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No, I just want to...

306
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Because I've seen this graph.

307
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But what I see is that

308
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
all the cities in the U.S.

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and then make a comparison.

310
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's also racial inequity.

311
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And then look at the gap between them.

312
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The gap between cities and schools is the biggest.

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So the bigger the circle,

314
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
it means that the city...

315
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But in your graph, it's a state.

316
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That state means that

317
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
the bigger the gap between the poor and the rich,

318
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
the bigger the circle.

319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And the smaller the circle means that

320
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
there's not much difference.

321
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But that's what I see in the graph.

322
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But you just said that

323
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
there's a lot of integration.

324
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So I don't know if it's because

325
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
American education, at least before K-12,

326
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
was defined by property tax.

327
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So because of this,

328
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
under the foundation of funding,

329
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
there will be the difference you just mentioned.

330
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The better the school district,

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
if my parents can afford it,

332
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the better the school district.

333
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Of course, the more resources I have here,

334
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
the more money I have,

335
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can attract better teachers.

336
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But if I'm poor in this area,

337
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can't...

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because this is a different education system from Taiwan.

339
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's the funding part.

340
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So there will be a gap like this.

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you for the supplement.

342
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And then I just said...

343
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So this graph...

344
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Like you said,

345
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
if you want to look for it,

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
it's related to education

347
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and the achievement gap.

348
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You can find any Y-axis

349
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
or X-axis you want.

350
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But I made this introduction

351
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
mainly to introduce

352
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
the concept of

353
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
inequality in education.

354
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And then I want to say

355
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
that there are many reasons

356
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
behind inequality in education.

357
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And those reasons are

358
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the reasons that affect and interfere with each other.

359
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So to understand inequality in education,

360
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
you have to think about many aspects.

361
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And this is the conclusion I will come back to.

362
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And then...

363
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like the example I just gave,

364
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
if we only say that inequality in education

365
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
is because of the difference in school resources,

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
then we can say that

367
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
we will intervene.

368
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We take black children

369
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and take white children to school.

370
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This thing has indeed been done.

371
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But we will find that this is not enough.

372
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Because you solve the difference in school hardware.

373
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But like we just said,

374
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
there is still an income gap.

375
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So you have to solve

376
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
why the income gap

377
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
in this society is so big.

378
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Of course, this is not enough.

379
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Because we still haven't solved

380
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the problem of parents' education level.

381
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Do we have to give parents

382
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
some employment guidance, etc.?

383
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
This is just...

384
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
to point out that

385
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
education should be a tool

386
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
to reduce inequality in society.

387
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If we can think of it this way,

388
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I think it's a very tempting idea.

389
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But if we don't carefully measure

390
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
the social factors behind it,

391
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
such as race, class, etc.,

392
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
we may accidentally

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
cause more inequality.

394
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So...

395
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I want to bring this into today's topic.

396
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
My topic is

397
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
gender inequality in education.

398
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What kind of inequality

399
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
does gender social factors

400
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
have in education?

401
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So...

402
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I forgot to show this page.

403
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I put it here.

404
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
If you are interested in

405
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
finding out the picture

406
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and reading it,

407
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
you can pause the video

408
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and go to the link above.

409
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But now...

410
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm going to change it to

411
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
talk about the inequality of my topic today,

412
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
which is inequality in gender and education.

413
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
If we look at the 1960s,

414
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
there was a time when

415
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
girls couldn't even go to college.

416
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Of course, we're a long way from that time.

417
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
A lot of things have happened in history,

418
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
such as the rise of feminism, etc.

419
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We can see that the college degrees

420
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and higher education degrees

421
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that girls received

422
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
have been increasing.

423
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's getting higher and higher.

424
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Very good.

425
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
If we look at the picture from 2016,

426
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
we can see that

427
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the degrees that girls received

428
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
are even higher than that of boys

429
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
in colleges and universities.

430
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So if we only look at

431
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
the effect of education,

432
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
we can say that

433
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
gender inequality

434
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
has been reduced to a very small extent

435
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
compared to before.

436
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But today I still want to talk about this topic

437
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
because gender still has

438
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
an inequality in education.

439
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
If we don't look at the education level,

440
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
but look at what boys and girls are learning.

441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So I'm going to summarize this data

442
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and compare different subjects,

443
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and I chose the university level,

444
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the university degrees given by different subjects

445
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
in 2015,

446
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and draw the proportion of girls in those degrees.

447
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So if we look at psychology,

448
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
we can see that

449
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
77% of psychology graduates

450
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
are girls.

451
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So if we look at social science,

452
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
in the middle,

453
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
we can see that

454
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
half of the graduates are boys,

455
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and half of the graduates are girls.

456
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This picture is very interesting.

457
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You can look at any subject you are interested in.

458
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But one of the phenomena

459
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
is that if we look at the extreme level,

460
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
we can see that

461
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
there are very few girls

462
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
in the red area.

463
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You will find that

464
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
they are all related to math,

465
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
including math itself,

466
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
physical science, engineering, and CS.

467
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Especially if you look at engineering and CS,

468
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
there are only less than 20% of girls,

469
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
less than 20%.

470
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Compared to the rest of the subjects,

471
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
it is very different.

472
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The phenomenon I saw today

473
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
is that in math,

474
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
the number of boys is greater than the number of girls.

475
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I call it gender inequality in STEM.

476
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
This phenomenon

477
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
has been studied by a lot of people.

478
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It is also a phenomenon that everyone cares about.

479
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Because there are a lot of people

480
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
who are interested in this phenomenon.

481
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
For example,

482
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
there are a lot of people

483
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
who are interested in STEM.

484
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
First of all,

485
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
STEM has been very popular in the past few years.

486
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Many countries want to push STEM.

487
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So you can imagine

488
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
if you don't let girls in,

489
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
do you lose a lot of your potential?

490
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So now a lot of forces

491
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
want to push girls into STEM.

492
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So this phenomenon

493
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
has been studied by a lot of people.

494
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I will briefly summarize

495
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
some of the phenomena

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
that have been studied in STEM.

497
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
For example,

498
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I divided this argument

499
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
into Nature and Nurture.

500
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Of course,

501
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
most people will choose

502
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
the point they want to stand

503
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
between the two.

504
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But if it is the Nurture side,

505
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
they will argue that

506
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
boys and girls are not equal

507
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
in the field of math.

508
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
This is a socialized phenomenon.

509
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
For example,

510
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
we have a stereotype

511
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
that boys study science

512
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and girls study liberal arts.

513
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
This leads us to treat

514
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
boys and girls differently.

515
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So it is a socialization process.

516
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We socialize based on gender.

517
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This is what we see today.

518
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Other socialization processes,

519
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
for example,

520
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
when a child is just born,

521
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
he is a boy,

522
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
so we buy him a Lego.

523
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
If he is a girl,

524
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
we buy her a Lego.

525
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
We socialize based on gender.

526
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
This is what we see today.

527
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Other socialization processes,

528
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
for example,

529
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
when a child is just born,

530
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
he is a boy,

531
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
so we buy him a Lego.

532
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If he is a girl,

533
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
we buy her a Lego.

534
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This is what we see today.

535
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Other socialization processes,

536
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
for example,

537
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
when a child is just born,

538
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
he is a boy,

539
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
so we buy him a Lego.

540
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
If he is a girl,

541
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
we buy her a Lego.

542
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
This is what we see today.

543
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Other socialization processes,

544
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
for example,

545
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
when a child is just born,

546
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
he is a boy,

547
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
so we buy him a Lego.

548
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
This is what we see today.

549
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Other socialization processes,

550
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
for example,

551
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
when a child is just born,

552
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
he is a boy,

553
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
so we buy him a Lego.

554
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This is what we see today.

555
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Other socialization processes,

556
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
for example,

557
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,000


558
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
he is a boy,

559
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
so we buy him a Lego.

560
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
This is what we see today.

561
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Other socialization processes,

562
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
for example,

563
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
when a child is just born,

564
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
he is a boy.

565
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
This is what we see today.

566
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
If you look at the above topics,

567
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
family studies,

568
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
psychology, education,

569
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
you can study the gender inequality

570
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
in those areas.

571
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
However,

572
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that is another group of people,

573
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
or another topic,

574
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
because you have to study

575
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
what is happening

576
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
in those areas.

577
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
However,

578
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
if there is no gender inequality,

579
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
then all the people

580
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
in the picture are in the 50s.

581
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Obviously not.

582
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
This is what I want to talk about

583
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
today.

584
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The following topics

585
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
are related to math.

586
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So you mean

587
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
gender inequality

588
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and inequality

589
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
of men

590
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
are two different things?

591
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
If you are simply saying

592
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
that the conclusion is

593
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
different in numbers,

594
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
of course it is the same.

595
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
However,

596
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
there are many reasons

597
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
behind the inequality.

598
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
For example,

599
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
in science,

600
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
science is a subject

601
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
that men study.

602
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It is about science,

603
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
not psychology.

604
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So if I use science

605
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
to explain psychology,

606
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
that is not right.

607
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
If I use psychology

608
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
to explain

609
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
gender inequality,

610
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
that is not right.

611
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Does that make sense?

612
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Does that make sense?

613
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Okay.

614
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Okay.

615
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Maybe you are right.

616
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Now I want to talk about

617
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
nature.

618
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
What I just said is

619
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
that the phenomenon

620
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
we see

621
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
is not caused by

622
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
individuals.

623
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It is caused by

624
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
external social factors.

625
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Nature is saying

626
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that the phenomenon

627
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
we see

628
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
is caused by

629
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
gender inequality.

630
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Whether it is

631
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
the degree of math,

632
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
or the attitude towards math,

633
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
it is different.

634
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So we see

635
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
that

636
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
if everything

637
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
is socialized,

638
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
after so many years,

639
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
after so many years,

640
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
why is there still a gap?

641
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It means that there is

642
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
an external force

643
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
to explain

644
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
this phenomenon.

645
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And if

646
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
there is only

647
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
socialization,

648
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
then in a

649
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
gender-equal

650
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
society,

651
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
we should see this reduction,

652
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
but we don't.

653
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
They also

654
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
say that

655
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
there is a difference

656
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
between

657
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
women and men.

658
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Women prefer

659
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
human-to-human interaction.

660
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
They also prefer

661
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
human-to-human interaction.

662
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So maybe it is not

663
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
because of math,

664
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
but because women are

665
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
drawn to other areas,

666
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
such as medicine,

667
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
or architecture.

668
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So if we

669
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
look at the numbers

670
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and say that

671
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
we don't have 50%,

672
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
then it is incorrect.

673
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Because we shouldn't have

674
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
set 50% at the beginning,

675
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
if women didn't want to

676
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
go into math.

677
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It means that

678
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
although

679
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
there is no difference

680
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
in IQ

681
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
between men and women,

682
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
on average,

683
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
people don't say that

684
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
men are smarter than women.

685
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
However,

686
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
if you look at math,

687
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
men are better at

688
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
problem solving and mental rotation

689
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
than women,

690
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and women are better at calculation.

691
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So if you look at

692
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
higher education,

693
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
it is not about

694
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
basic calculation.

695
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It is more about

696
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
problem solving

697
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and mental rotation.

698
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
At that time,

699
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
you will see

700
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
the gender difference.

701
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
At the end,

702
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
both sides

703
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
will argue.

704
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
For example,

705
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
the last point,

706
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
even if there is

707
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a gender difference at the beginning,

708
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
it is not over time.

709
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
For example,

710
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
when we take the exam,

711
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
we focus on the so-called

712
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
math that men are good at.

713
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
For example,

714
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
when you interview people,

715
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
you are looking at a specific

716
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
math talent.

717
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So even if there is

718
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
a gender difference,

719
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
it is not over time.

720
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That's it.

721
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I briefly covered

722
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
some points

723
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
about gender inequality

724
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
in math.

725
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I also posted a video

726
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
about two psychologists

727
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
who were invited

728
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
to give a speech

729
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
for Nature.

730
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Although it was not

731
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
a public speech,

732
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
they gave a very

733
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
detailed and logical

734
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
speech.

735
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You can watch it

736
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
if you are interested.

737
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
This list

738
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
can go on and on.

739
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
There are many

740
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
possible explanations.

741
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
At the beginning,

742
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I said that

743
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
my research direction

744
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
is to see how social factors

745
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
affect personal development

746
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and behavior.

747
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
As I said,

748
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
social factors affect

749
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
individuals,

750
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I am more

751
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
on the side of Nature.

752
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Next,

753
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I will talk about

754
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
two projects I have done.

755
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I will talk about

756
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
how they

757
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
discuss

758
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
how women

759
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
are more likely to

760
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
have more boys.

761
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
As I said,

762
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
social factors affect

763
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
individual psychological development

764
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and behavior.

765
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
In the middle,

766
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
we need to identify

767
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
what we are interested in

768
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
in psychological development.

769
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I chose to study motivation.

770
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
This is a psychological factor.

771
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I am interested in

772
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
how social factors

773
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
affect psychological factors.

774
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
How does it affect

775
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
individual behavior?

776
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The concept of

777
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
learning motivation

778
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
is abstract.

779
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Many different scholars

780
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
have discussed it.

781
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They use different theories

782
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
to define it.

783
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Of course,

784
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I can try different theories

785
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and start from different theories.

786
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The first project

787
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I want to introduce

788
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
is a simple theory.

789
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It is called

790
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Fixed Growth Mindset.

791
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The person who proposed this theory

792
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
wrote a book a few years ago.

793
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It is very popular.

794
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
This theory has been studied a lot.

795
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
His theory

796
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
is very simple.

797
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
He divided learning motivation

798
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
into two categories.

799
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The first one is

800
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Fixed Mindset.

801
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It means

802
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
whether you are good

803
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
in a certain subject.

804
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Some people

805
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
don't have a good math brain.

806
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
This is Fixed Mindset.

807
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Or

808
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I am good at math.

809
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Something like this.

810
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The second category

811
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
is Growth Mindset.

812
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It means

813
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
whether you are good

814
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
in a certain subject.

815
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It depends on the person.

816
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
If I am lazy today,

817
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
no matter how smart I am,

818
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
after a while,

819
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
even if I am smart,

820
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
if I am lazy,

821
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I might

822
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
turn from a math person

823
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
to a non-math person.

824
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Even if I am not good at math,

825
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
if I work hard,

826
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I might become a math person one day.

827
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It is a very simple concept.

828
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He proposed this

829
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
because he thinks

830
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
if we want to talk about

831
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
the outcome of math,

832
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Growth Mindset

833
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
is healthier than Fixed Mindset.

834
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Because

835
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
people always encounter setbacks.

836
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
If you are a Fixed Mindset person,

837
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
you can

838
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
put a label on yourself.

839
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
For example,

840
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
if I have a Fixed Mindset,

841
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I am not a math person.

842
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So,

843
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
it is less likely

844
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
to continue studying math.

845
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
On the other hand,

846
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
if you are a Growth Mindset person,

847
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and you encounter setbacks,

848
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
your

849
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
learning motive will tell you

850
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
that it doesn't matter

851
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
because you still have room for improvement.

852
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
He proposed this

853
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
theory,

854
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and there are many

855
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
researches that show

856
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
that Growth Mindset

857
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
is healthier

858
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
than Fixed Mindset.

859
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It is also

860
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
better for future development.

861
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
If we add in gender,

862
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I can ask

863
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
if the reason why

864
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
we see fewer girls

865
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
entering science classes

866
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
is because

867
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
of the setbacks

868
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
we encountered

869
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
before higher education.

870
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
If there are more

871
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Growth Mindset students,

872
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
they can continue

873
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
entering higher education.

874
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So,

875
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
we can see that

876
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
there are more boys

877
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
than girls.

878
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So,

879
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
if we want to

880
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
improve our learning

881
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
motives,

882
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
we need to

883
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
think about

884
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
how to

885
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
improve our learning

886
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
motives.

887
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So,

888
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
we need to

889
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
think about

890
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
how to

891
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
improve our learning

892
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
motives.

893
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So,

894
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
we need to

895
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
think about

896
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
how to

897
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
improve our learning

898
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
motives.

899
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So,

900
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
we need to

901
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
think about

902
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
how to

903
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
improve our learning

904
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
motives.

905
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So,

906
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
we need to

907
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
think about

908
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
how to

909
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
improve our learning

910
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
motives.

911
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So,

912
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
we need to

913
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
think about

914
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
how to

915
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
improve our

916
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
learning

917
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
motives.

918
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So,

919
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
we need to

920
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
think about

921
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
how to

922
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
improve our

923
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
learning

924
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
motives.

925
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So,

926
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
we need to

927
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
think about

928
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
how to

929
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
improve our

930
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
learning

931
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
motives.

932
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So,

933
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
we need to

934
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000

1757
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So,

we need to

1773
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
