Okay, let's welcome everyone to participate in today's TARA speech.
Today's speaker is Mr. Zhang Yanyong.
He is now a Ph.D. student in astronomy and physics at Caltech.
Before coming to Caltech, he studied at NTU Physics and NTU Mechanics.
During his time at NTU, he specialized in accelerometers,
half astronomy and half accelerometers, high-performance physics experiments.
Now he is at Caltech, he specializes in dark matter experiments,
which are more astronomical.
So today's speech is mainly about...
My understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Zhang Yanyong.
It's mainly about how they detect their detectors in design experiments.
I want to share it with you.
Some of it has nothing to do with today's speech,
but it has a lot to do with the speaker.
Zhang Yanyong is a disciplined, self-trained athlete.
He is a good trainer.
If you are interested in running, cycling, or surfing,
he has a lot of experience.
He also likes to discuss these things with you.
Lastly, as you have heard,
today is Zhang Yanyong's birthday.
Actually, it's not yesterday, it's today.
I don't know why Zhang Yanyong...
Did Zhang Yanyong say that he was drunk yesterday because it was his birthday?
It's not easy to forget your birthday.
So I decided to sing a happy birthday song for Zhang Yanyong.
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.
You can open the microphone and sing together.
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.
Let's welcome Zhang Yanyong to share his research with us.
I'll turn off the microphone.
Can you hear me?
Because I found that the new version of BlueJeans
can't use a lot of screens on Linux.
So the topic I'm going to talk about is
Photon Noise Estimation and Suppression for Explicit Cryogenic Measurement.
Why did I choose this topic?
The reason is...
Of course, this is very specific.
It's an example of what we're doing right now.
But we all know that
any experiment needs to pursue a higher sensitivity.
The current trend in the world is that we're going to do it at a lower temperature.
Because basic statistical physics tells us that
no matter what system it is,
its noise is basically related to temperature.
So the lower the temperature, the lower the noise.
So today I want to talk about something more general.
For most people, whether they're listening now
or watching on the Internet,
those who are doing experiments
and want to take it,
whether you want to put your experiment device into a liquid nitrogen
or a liquid nitrogen solution,
or like we use cryogenic dilution fridge,
are all useful technologies.
In order to further promote its sensitivity in our experiments,
we developed an application of this technology.
Next slide.
I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about
what our traditional concept of noise is.
Why these concepts are very meaningful
if you think through the details.
But it's not something we can apply directly to our experiments.
First of all, what you're seeing now is called
thermal noise,
which we think is traditionally classical noise.
Of course, we have to say it's Johnson-Nyquist noise
because Johnson-Nyquist is the person who invented it.
Its feature is that it's very wide,
that is, it's maybe 10 hertz.
What you see on the screen
may be from 10 hertz to tens of millions of hertz.
It's the whole range
that you can see this kind of noise signal.
And it's flat, so it's called white noise.
It's like white light.
We know that Johnson found that
this noise only has to do with the temperature
of the instrument that produces this noise,
or the equivalent temperature.
It doesn't have to do with anything else.
For example, I have a resistor today,
and it keeps producing noise.
This resistor, whether it's made of cement,
wire, metal, or air,
it doesn't matter.
As long as the temperature of this thing is like that,
its noise is like that.
This is a very special thing.
So at the beginning of the 20th century,
it was a very special physics.
That is, you would have expected
that this thing would keep producing that noisy signal.
Should it be related to its material?
The answer is no.
But later on, the development of quantum mechanics
immediately made people think,
isn't this the same as black radiation?
What is black radiation?
Black radiation is its light or energy.
Its energy is kT,
and it only has to do with temperature.
Because no matter what material it is,
they exchange energy with light.
I've already said that.
So here's a question.
What is it that makes this classical system
reach thermal equilibrium?
The answer is light.
No matter what material it is, it's all light.
Okay.
So this light becomes...
Later on, Planck found that
as long as light reaches thermal equilibrium,
this thing will emit light.
It has nothing to do with material.
It has nothing to do with temperature.
Then it's called black radiation.
But we also know that black radiation
is the most important thing in human history.
It is the first direct evidence,
and it has been explained,
and it has started the so-called quantum era.
Without quantum mechanics,
without the phenomenon of quantum being brought into physics,
there is no way to explain black radiation.
So here's a very strange thing.
We say this is a classical system.
Classical thermal equilibrium has this phenomenon.
But without quantum mechanics,
there is no way to explain it.
So why does this happen?
If you put any material in a temperature,
put it in a temperature environment,
which is more scientific,
which is called photon bath.
Then through these quantum particles,
which is what we call photons,
exchange energy to reach thermal equilibrium,
there will be this classical effect.
Why is this thing?
Because in fact...
Okay.
Why is the classical description
applicable to the quantum phenomenon?
It has a very important reason.
This reason will also tell me today
why it is very relevant to future experiments.
Because in past experiments,
we usually think that
I operate in classical regime,
I think classical,
that is, T equals 4KT.
If I operate in quantum regime,
I think quantum.
But why is this important?
Because I have already said that
in this classical noise,
it actually comes from quantum effect.
But why can we use
classical treatment to think about this thing?
Because if you look at the textbook
or you look at the wiki,
roughly, usually at a normal temperature,
I write Montaigne here.
In fact, I just want to imply that
in fact, we are not doing
the experiment we are doing now in the future.
At a normal size,
for example, as big as your palm,
a normal temperature,
for example, a thing of room temperature,
it emits a ray of black radiation.
That ray of light
is every second,
every square meter,
it will emit 10 to 20 times of radiation.
So much that it's like
when you go to drink water,
you won't feel a drop of water
hitting your tongue.
It's like a continuous state.
So a classical description can be used.
So it can be calculated as 4KT.
But we can't forget that
if you look at its spectrum,
it can't be explained by classical physics.
It must be quantized.
That's why we started the quantum era.
So I can ask a question.
If your tongue is really sensitive,
when you drink water,
can you feel a drop of water?
Think about this question.
I will continue to talk later.
Then everyone will know
why I'm asking this question.
This question is actually quite interesting.
Next time you drink water,
you can think about
if I can feel a drop of water
on my tongue.
This is the first type.
Now let's look at the second type.
The second type is called shock noise
or Poisson noise.
Of course, Poisson comes from
Poisson distribution.
I think most people who study quantum mechanics
have studied it.
This is a mathematical description.
When you have a fixed probability,
you can calculate
the probability of something happening
in the fixed probability.
But sometimes I see it,
and the last chance I see it
is the biggest.
The last chance I see it is the smallest.
If you look at the picture on the right,
for example, let's look at the blue and purple.
On average,
there is a certain probability
that you will see something
four times.
For example, you see it four times
in one minute.
If you see it five times
in one minute,
it will be smaller.
If you see it six times,
it will be smaller.
But you actually have a chance
to see it 50 or 20 times
in one minute.
But the chance is very small.
You see it is very small here.
And zero times is also very small.
This thing is called Poisson distribution.
It is a system
that requires quantization
to be resolvable.
For example,
if the leaves fall down for a minute,
how many pieces can you see?
You can see this quantization.
Why?
What we are implying here is that
as a detector,
the resolution of your timing
is much higher than
the frequency at which the leaves fall down,
rather than the
frequency at which the leaves fall down.
So you can see this quantization.
So it becomes shot noise.
But you will suddenly find that
shot noise is a peak.
It's bulging here,
on the right side of the picture.
It's not like the picture above.
It's a whole screen.
But in theory,
they are just different.
Do you have that kind of resolution
that can see
the leaves fall down
or the frequency
of the water molecules hitting the tongue?
But its nature
is very different.
You see this shot noise.
It's a very narrow band.
It's a peak here.
And it's due to quantization.
It's due to the quantum nature
of carrier or event.
The example I just gave
is the leaves falling down.
But I can give another example.
For example,
if there is a導線 today,
you charge it.
The resistance of the導線 is very small.
So through the current,
the particles of the electron
are very, very, very many.
So it feels like
the thermal noise
I just mentioned.
That's also very typical.
That's how people measure
thermal noise.
But it's exactly the same thing.
If I put a導線 today
and use the pressure to do it,
is the resistance super, super big?
It's so big
that you can't measure it.
Uh,

is this
This is because
It's because
this
kryptonite
it's
very,
very,
very,
very high.
The electronic
力
only got
carried
across
this
dotted
line,
and
then it
became
like a
very,
very,
very high
voltage.
It can
destroy that
restraining force
and let it
pull out
one by one
like this.
Okay,
this is
shot
noise,
but
shot
noise
in
uh
mundane
apparatus
usually
happens
in
you have
to
externally
apply
a
force
to
the
object.
