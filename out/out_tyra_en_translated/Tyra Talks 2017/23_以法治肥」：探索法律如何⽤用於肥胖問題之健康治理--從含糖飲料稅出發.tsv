0	6000	Let's start recording.
6000	8000	Okay.
8000	10000	Okay, I got it. Thank you.
10000	12000	Let's start.
12000	14000	Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Yanping.
14000	16000	I'm your host today.
16000	18000	But I'll probably talk for a while
18000	20000	and then I'll be gone.
20000	22000	Because my wife's waist is twisted
22000	24000	to the point where she can't hold the baby.
24000	26000	So...
26000	28000	I'm going to have an emergency meeting later.
28000	30000	So today,
30000	32000	let's welcome Hanxi to share
32000	34000	with us...
34000	36000	He's the only one who has a webcam
36000	38000	so he's Hanxi.
38000	40000	He's going to share
40000	42000	with us about the
42000	44000	law related to
44000	46000	public safety.
46000	48000	Because
48000	50000	Hanxi...
50000	52000	Is Hanxi right?
52000	54000	Yes, that's right.
54000	56000	Okay.
56000	58000	My Chinese isn't very good.
58000	60000	Hanxi used to
60000	62000	study law.
62000	64000	But then he went to the police station
64000	66000	to study...
66000	68000	He studied for a while
68000	70000	in Yang Ming's police station.
70000	72000	Then he came back to study law.
72000	74000	His major is
74000	76000	the law related to
76000	78000	public safety.
78000	80000	Hanxi will share the details with us later.
80000	82000	No problem.
82000	84000	We're happy to have Hanxi here today
84000	86000	because he's probably our first law student.
86000	88000	Also, he's probably our first...
88000	90000	I guess,
90000	92000	pure humanist.
92000	94000	So we're happy that we can finally
94000	96000	expand to a more complete
96000	98000	academic field.
98000	100000	There are people in all fields.
100000	102000	Without further ado,
102000	104000	let's give a round of applause to welcome Hanxi.
104000	106000	I'm the only one in charge of filming.
106000	108000	Because
108000	110000	today's guest is not alone.
110000	112000	Today's guest is not alone.
112000	114000	Let me briefly introduce myself.
114000	116000	I'm a friend of Yuhui.
116000	118000	Let's get to know each other.
120000	122000	Why is my microphone
122000	124000	turned off all of a sudden?
124000	126000	Okay.
126000	128000	Yeah.
128000	130000	It's like
130000	132000	a small roundtable.
132000	134000	It's like a chat.
134000	136000	It's not a formal report.
136000	138000	Since we have the opportunity,
138000	140000	let's get to know each other.
140000	142000	Okay.
142000	144000	I'm not sure
144000	146000	which school you're from.
146000	148000	So let's...

216000	218000	Let's switch to Caltech.
218000	220000	We have two people here.
220000	222000	I'm Zhuang Ye You.

244000	246000	That's cool.
254000	256000	So there's one more person.
264000	266000	He left a comment
266000	268000	in the chat room.
268000	270000	Oh, okay.
272000	274000	He's studying geography.
274000	276000	He's studying geography.
276000	278000	What field is he studying?
278000	280000	Geography is pretty broad.
280000	282000	It ranges from biology to natural science.
282000	284000	I'm pretty interested in this.
290000	292000	So we're going to
292000	294000	chat with Zhuang.
294000	296000	Physical Geography.
296000	298000	Okay.
298000	300000	Okay.
308000	310000	You've been to Charleston.
310000	312000	Okay.
312000	314000	I'm going to start.

330000	332000	Hello, everyone.
332000	334000	I'm at Georgetown
334000	336000	studying law.
336000	338000	If you have any questions,
338000	340000	feel free to ask.
340000	342000	You can see my screen.
342000	344000	I think you can hear me.
344000	346000	If you have any questions,
346000	348000	feel free to ask.
348000	350000	I'm happy to share
350000	352000	my research topic with you.
352000	354000	I'm at Georgetown Law School.
354000	356000	I'm at Georgetown Law School.
356000	358000	It's a big classroom.
358000	360000	The signal here is very good.
360000	362000	I'm preparing this topic
362000	364000	about obesity
364000	366000	and soda tax.
366000	368000	I'm preparing this topic
368000	370000	about obesity
370000	372000	and soda tax.
372000	374000	I'm preparing this topic
374000	376000	about obesity
382000	384000	for the first time.
384000	386000	For the first time.
386000	388000	I think I'm getting a little bit
388000	390000	I think I'm getting a little bit
390000	392000	a little bit
392000	394000	a little bit
394000	396000	a little bit
396000	398000	a little bit
398000	400000	a little bit
400000	402000	a little bit
402000	404000	a little bit
404000	406000	a little bit
406000	408000	a really little bit

446000	448000	a really little bit
448000	450000	a really little bit
450000	452000	I think the host just mentioned a little bit
452000	454000	but I can still give a brief introduction
454000	456000	to myself
458000	460000	to put it simply, it's actually a little bit
460000	462000	complicated, because I
462000	464000	like you guys who are watching this video
464000	466000	I have studied in a lot of schools
466000	468000	and right now
468000	470000	George Student University is probably the fifth
470000	472000	so there might be some of you here
472000	474000	whether it's Taitung University or Yangming University
474000	476000	or even UW
476000	478000	University of Washington
478000	480000	In my field,
480000	482000	on the one hand, I was born with a background in law
482000	484000	just like everyone is familiar with
484000	486000	well, law
486000	488000	and being a lawyer
488000	490000	I was born with a background in law and training
490000	492000	I also studied law
492000	494000	and now I am studying law
494000	496000	on the other hand, I am a little bit different
496000	498000	from other law students
498000	500000	in that I have my
500000	502000	medical background
502000	504000	and work experience
504000	506000	how should I put it
506000	508000	that is
508000	510000	my first full-time job
510000	512000	as you can see
512000	514000	my first full-time job
514000	516000	was in Seattle
516000	518000	ICHS
518000	520000	International Community Health Service
520000	522000	International Community
522000	524000	Health Service
524000	526000	that was when I was
526000	528000	in UW
528000	530000	in 2007, after graduating from law school
530000	532000	I went there to work
532000	534000	that was my first full-time job
534000	536000	before that, I was a lawyer in Taiwan
536000	538000	but I hadn't worked there
538000	540000	that was my first full-time job
540000	542000	for a lawyer in Taiwan
542000	544000	in my mindset
544000	546000	to work in a hospital
546000	548000	that was a big surprise
548000	550000	so that year
550000	552000	to some extent
552000	554000	I got interested in medical law
554000	556000	and then
556000	558000	I jumped out
558000	560000	when I came back to Taiwan
560000	562000	I kept my medical background
562000	564000	so I kept my medical background
564000	566000	in the health law field
566000	568000	so
568000	570000	can everyone hear me?
570000	572000	because
572000	574000	it's weird
574000	576000	because I can't hear everyone
576000	578000	we can hear you
578000	580000	so welcome
580000	582000	to speak up
582000	584000	it's my first time
584000	586000	feeling like this
586000	588000	you can't see anyone
588000	590000	it's like a speech
590000	592000	can you speak up?
592000	594000	I can't hear you
594000	596000	can you speak up?
596000	598000	will it be better if I speak up?
598000	600000	if you don't mind
600000	602000	I can see your face
602000	604000	it's like a speech
604000	606000	I'm not wearing any clothes
606000	608000	so I don't want to speak
608000	610000	I'm not wearing any clothes
610000	612000	so I don't want to speak
612000	614000	I'm not wearing any clothes
614000	616000	I'm not wearing any clothes
616000	618000	there's an answer on the screen
618000	620000	no problem, thank you
620000	622000	we can
622000	624000	we can turn on the video
624000	626000	yes
626000	628000	you can turn off the sound
628000	630000	at least there's a video
630000	632000	it feels better
632000	634000	talking to a real person
634000	636000	ok, thank you
636000	638000	to put it simply
638000	640000	I'm a lawyer
640000	642000	a lawyer from Taiwan
642000	644000	but I'm interested in public safety law
644000	646000	so I chose this topic
646000	648000	it's 6.20pm
648000	650000	it's 6.20pm
650000	652000	it's quite simple
652000	654000	my presentation will be divided into 3 parts
654000	656000	introduction
656000	658000	background
658000	660000	why we chose sugar
660000	662000	why we chose soda
662000	664000	and public safety intervention
664000	666000	and public safety intervention
666000	668000	second
668000	670000	case study
670000	672000	one of my research point
672000	674000	is the case of soda tax
674000	676000	last
676000	678000	I want to talk about
678000	680000	soda tax
680000	682000	Caltech is in LA
682000	684000	Caltech is in LA
684000	686000	so if there are
686000	688000	students from San Francisco
688000	690000	or Berkeley
690000	692000	they are
692000	694000	in the area of soda tax
694000	696000	because there's soda tax in the city
696000	698000	it might feel better
698000	700000	but it's a trend
700000	702000	cities are moving towards it
702000	704000	so maybe
704000	706000	you will have the same problem
706000	708000	I talked to LA
708000	710000	public safety
710000	712000	officer
712000	714000	it might not happen in a short time
714000	716000	but it's a trend
716000	718000	anyway
718000	720000	you can listen to
720000	722000	their opinions
722000	724000	after listening
724000	726000	there's pros and cons
726000	728000	you can discuss
728000	730000	ok
730000	732000	sorry
732000	734000	I want to ask
734000	736000	what is the concept of soda tax
736000	738000	in California
738000	740000	California
740000	742000	California
742000	744000	California

814000	818000	I don't know if you will talk about it later
818000	820000	I just want to ask
820000	822000	Does the tax cover the range of hand-shaken drinks?
822000	824000	Like bubble tea
824000	826000	like bubble tea
826000	828000	For now
828000	830000	For now
830000	832000	This is a good question
832000	834000	Because most of it
834000	836000	Most of the tax
836000	838000	Is based on that
838000	840000	The finished product of the drink
840000	842000	To tax
842000	844000	But
844000	846000	If it's a freshly made drink
846000	848000	Freshly squeezed juice or freshly brewed
848000	850000	If it includes
850000	852000	It doesn't look like it, but I can
852000	854000	I think it depends on the definition
854000	856000	It doesn't include
856000	858000	But I can check again
858000	860000	This is a good question
860000	862000	Especially in Taiwan
862000	864000	If you want to pass
864000	866000	Does this hand-shaken drink include
866000	868000	I don't think it's in the definition
868000	870000	But I can help you confirm this
870000	872000	Thank you
872000	874000	Okay
874000	876000	Let's cut it into three parts
876000	878000	To discuss
878000	880000	I'll do the introduction part first
880000	882000	Okay
882000	884000	I want to tell you
884000	886000	Why did we choose sugar?
886000	888000	Why did we choose soda?
888000	890000	This is a trend in the world
890000	892000	You may have noticed
892000	894000	You may not have noticed
894000	896000	But if you use Google
896000	898000	Use Google as a keyword
898000	900000	Search
900000	902000	This is what I did
902000	904000	Yesterday
904000	906000	You can see
906000	908000	The anti-sugar fad
908000	910000	Is now a trend
910000	912000	Bloomberg
912000	914000	The anti-sugar fad
914000	916000	Has become a trend
916000	918000	Has become a trend
918000	920000	It's a trend
920000	922000	It's a trend
922000	924000	This is

1056500	1084500	Coca-Cola, Pepsi and others agree to keep sugar in the drink in Singapore
1084500	1086500	I have a question
1086500	1088500	I think there's a catch
1088500	1090500	For example, Pepsi
1090500	1092500	They don't want to reduce their sales
1092500	1094500	Coca-Cola as well
1094500	1096500	So they said reducing sugar
1096500	1098500	Is it really reducing sugar?
1098500	1100500	And then change it into other sugar-containing types
1100500	1102500	Or do they have any strategies to change their ingredients and taste, etc.
1102500	1104500	Or do they just want to keep it as it is?
1104500	1106500	Or do they want to keep it as it is?
1106500	1120500	Or do they just want to keep it as it is?
1120500	1125500	In fact, the regulation of sugar in the sugar drink
1125500	1130500	Has included artificial sugar
1130500	1132500	So some parts have
1132500	1134500	Like Diacok
1134500	1138500	Some tags have included it
1138500	1140500	So it's included
1140500	1142500	Of course, some cities don't have it
1142500	1144500	So this is also a controversial point
1144500	1146500	Whether artificial sugar is included
1146500	1148500	I think the question is good
1148500	1150500	Because if you look at the sales
1150500	1152500	If you look at the sales
1152500	1154500	Now the consumer's preference is
1154500	1156500	Reduce sugar in some drinks
1156500	1158500	I think the manufacturers naturally develop this kind of thing
1158500	1160500	I am following up
1160500	1162500	I think
1162500	1164500	Even our school cafeteria
1164500	1166500	I think
1166500	1168500	At least this half year
1168500	1170500	They sell sparkling water
1170500	1172500	And even the one with favor
1172500	1174500	The proportion of sparkling water is rising
1174500	1176500	And then the proportion of traditional sugar-containing drinks
1176500	1178500	Then I think this
1178500	1180500	According to some reports, this is a trend
1180500	1182500	So for Coca-Cola
1182500	1184500	In fact, Coca-Cola and Pepsi
1184500	1186500	There are actually a lot of drinks
1186500	1188500	It can actually
1188500	1190500	Adjust its proportion
1190500	1192500	Or adjust the amount of each product
1192500	1194500	It can still
1194500	1196500	Find a way to maintain a certain profit
1196500	1198500	As a manufacturer
1198500	1200500	It has a lot of strategies that can be applied
1200500	1202500	I think it should
1202500	1204500	Indeed reduce the amount of Coca-Cola
1204500	1206500	Or it may launch more
1206500	1208500	Like it now has this
1208500	1210500	Different types of Coca-Cola
1210500	1212500	Then do it like this
1212500	1214500	The proper distribution is
1214500	1216500	I don't know if I answered your question
1218500	1220500	Yes, thank you
1220500	1222500	OK, you're welcome
1222500	1224500	Ok
1224500	1226500	We have seen this international trend
1226500	1228500	Basically for sugar
1228500	1230500	For sugar-containing drinks
1230500	1232500	The next question is to ask
1232500	1234500	Why
1234500	1236500	Why do we want to fight this
1236500	1238500	Sugar-containing and sugar-containing drinks
1238500	1240500	What is the reason behind this
1240500	1242500	The main reason behind the reason is
1242500	1244500	Of course the health part
1246500	1248500	In fact, sugar-containing drinks
1248500	1250500	The two main issues
1250500	1252500	One is that traditionally
1252500	1254500	Everyone thinks of it as a tooth
1254500	1256500	This is one of the issues
1256500	1258500	But let's leave the tooth
1258500	1260500	The most important part here is obesity
1260500	1262500	What is the problem with obesity
1262500	1264500	Because of obesity
1264500	1266500	I use this picture
1266500	1268500	In fact
1268500	1270500	There are several factors that cause obesity
1270500	1272500	Probably sitting in front of the computer
1272500	1274500	Like we don't move
1274500	1276500	Inactive
1276500	1278500	This may cause obesity
1278500	1280500	Lack of exercise
1280500	1282500	Another one is diet
1282500	1284500	The ratio of the amount you eat
1284500	1286500	What kind of food
1286500	1288500	Then it will lead to obesity
1288500	1290500	What is the problem with obesity
1290500	1292500	The following is what most people are talking about
1292500	1294500	NCD
1294500	1296500	Non-Communicable Disease
1296500	1298500	In Chinese, it can be translated as chronic disease
1298500	1300500	There are four main types of chronic diseases
1302500	1304500	The first one on the left is cardiovascular disease
1304500	1306500	Heart disease
1306500	1308500	High blood pressure
1308500	1310500	The second one
1310500	1312500	It's about blood flow
1312500	1314500	Diabetes
1314500	1316500	The second one is respiratory disease
1316500	1318500	The last one is cancer
1318500	1320500	Obesity
1320500	1322500	It will lead to cardiovascular disease
1322500	1324500	Diabetes
1324500	1326500	Risk factors for cancer
1326500	1328500	Risk factors for cancer
1328500	1330500	Even
1330500	1332500	Leading to chronic disease
1332500	1334500	Especially diabetes
1334500	1336500	Related to obesity
1336500	1338500	One of the strongest
1338500	1340500	OK
1340500	1342500	What is the problem with obesity
1342500	1344500	OK
1344500	1346500	The main problem with obesity
1346500	1348500	In fact, it is very realistic
1348500	1350500	In addition to causing patients to suffer from this disease
1350500	1352500	The main thing is for family care
1352500	1354500	Because this is a chronic disease
1354500	1356500	In addition to our whole society
1356500	1358500	If it's really related to everyone
1358500	1360500	The main thing is the increase in medical expenses
1360500	1362500	It's realistic, whether it's the United States or Taiwan
1362500	1364500	This chronic disease
1364500	1366500	In fact, because it takes a long time
1366500	1368500	Medical costs
1368500	1370500	The cost of care is very considerable
1370500	1372500	In Taiwan, I can give an example
1372500	1374500	Our annual budget for health insurance
1374500	1376500	The cost is about 600 billion
1376500	1378500	10% of it
1378500	1380500	Is used to
1380500	1382500	Diabetes patients
1382500	1384500	So the annual cost of health insurance
1384500	1386500	At least 60 billion is used for diabetes
1386500	1388500	Diabetes
1388500	1390500	Of course, there are many reasons for diabetes in Taiwan
1390500	1392500	Maybe everyone knows
1392500	1394500	Food with problems
1394500	1396500	Detergent, pollution, etc.
1396500	1398500	But diabetes
1398500	1400500	The cost of diabetes is so high
1400500	1402500	This is a very direct reason
1402500	1404500	So for each country
1404500	1406500	If you can control obesity
1406500	1408500	Can control
1408500	1410500	Can greatly reduce these chronic diseases
1410500	1412500	Relatively reduce medical costs
1412500	1414500	Why are we looking for this
1414500	1416500	Sugar-free drinks
1416500	1418500	Everyone is studying science
1418500	1420500	This is probably a national high school
1420500	1422500	Natural science or chemistry
1422500	1424500	I mentioned the dissolution of sugar
1424500	1426500	200 grams of sugar
1426500	1428500	Can be dissolved in 100ml of water
1428500	1430500	At room temperature
1430500	1432500	About this
1432500	1434500	The picture on the left is also provided by netizens
1434500	1436500	Actually
1436500	1438500	I was very surprised when I first saw it
1438500	1440500	It's like Coca-Cola
1440500	1442500	The smallest 350ml
1442500	1444500	There is a sugar content of about 9 to 10 grams
1444500	1446500	You can see
1446500	1448500	The more
1448500	1450500	This
1450500	1452500	Or this
1452500	1454500	Lemonade or some juice
1454500	1456500	Ice tea, etc.
1456500	1458500	If you drink a big can of cola
1458500	1460500	You eat so much sugar
1460500	1462500	Actually
1462500	1464500	If you don't drink drinks
1464500	1466500	You won't be crazy
1466500	1468500	Eat a bunch of sugar
1468500	1470500	But in the drink
1470500	1472500	It's a liquid
1472500	1474500	It's easy to take too much at once
1474500	1476500	More than
1476500	1478500	Everyone should take an average of
1478500	1480500	More than ten times
1480500	1482500	This is why
1482500	1484500	Why
1484500	1486500	Hello
1486500	1488500	I have a small question
1488500	1490500	About this picture
1490500	1492500	The cola on it
1492500	1494500	And the red cow
1494500	1496500	Mountain Dew
1496500	1498500	It's all man-made
1498500	1500500	So I can understand that sugar is added by people
1500500	1502500	But for example, the juice below
1502500	1504500	The meaning of those sugar cubes
1504500	1506500	Except for him
1506500	1508500	After extracting the juice
1508500	1510500	After extraction
1510500	1512500	Added so many sugar cubes
1512500	1514500	That means
1514500	1516500	There are so many sugar in that drink
1516500	1518500	Including natural and
1518500	1520500	The total amount of sugar
1520500	1522500	You asked a very good question
1522500	1524500	This is also
1524500	1526500	This is also the United States
1526500	1528500	I will talk about the FDA later
1528500	1530500	In the new nutrition fact
1530500	1532500	To make a distinction
1532500	1534500	Is it this added sugar
1534500	1536500	Or the sugar it already has
1536500	1538500	It lists two different things
1538500	1540500	I believe the list here
1540500	1542500	Basically all included
1542500	1544500	Is the original sugar
1544500	1546500	Plus sugar
1546500	1548500	But in fact
1548500	1550500	In addition to the original
1550500	1552500	If you look at the new nutrition fact
1552500	1554500	It's still much more than natural
1554500	1556500	In other words
1556500	1558500	Real fruit sugar
1558500	1560500	Compared to the drink
1560500	1562500	To make you drink
1562500	1564500	It's actually artificially added
1564500	1566500	The ratio is much higher
1566500	1568500	This is also his terrible place
1568500	1570500	If the real lemonade comes out
1570500	1572500	May be too sour
1572500	1574500	So you will attract everyone to drink
1574500	1576500	He added a lot of sugar
1576500	1578500	This is also what I will slowly introduce
1578500	1580500	Please say
1580500	1582500	I think Zhang Yong just asked
1582500	1584500	The question is very interesting
1584500	1586500	And let me think of another question
1586500	1588500	But before you ask me a question
1588500	1590500	Let me talk about this video first
1590500	1592500	I think the two below
1592500	1594500	Although it looks like juice
1594500	1596500	But the two of them should not be natural
1596500	1598500	So this question
1598500	1600500	In these six specific cases
1600500	1602500	Should not be established
1602500	1604500	Because if you go to buy that drink
1604500	1606500	You buy that lemonade
1606500	1608500	It says on it
1608500	1610500	How much is the real juice
1610500	1612500	Very exaggerated
1612500	1614500	So that's actually artificial
1614500	1616500	But suppose we can find one today
1616500	1618500	Find a juice
1618500	1620500	For example, fresh juice
1620500	1622500	In addition to the ingredients
1622500	1624500	The difference in the amount of sugar
1624500	1626500	In addition to the difference in the amount of sugar
1626500	1628500	Will there be some differences in the type of sugar
1628500	1630500	Because I always hear people say
1630500	1632500	Because I don't study chemistry
1632500	1634500	But I always hear people say that refined sugar
1634500	1636500	With natural sugar in fruit
1636500	1638500	Is actually a different thing
1638500	1640500	This thing
1640500	1642500	Is it considered
1642500	1644500	At the time of the law
1646500	1648500	In the data I checked
1648500	1650500	In terms of reality
1650500	1652500	These sugar powder artificial sugar and natural sugar
1652500	1654500	Is there a difference in the risk to the human body
1654500	1656500	Is there a difference in the risk to the human body
1656500	1658500	Is there a difference in the risk to the human body
1658500	1660500	Everyone thinks there may be
1660500	1662500	Even some people make some distinctions
1662500	1664500	Which is safer and which is not dangerous
1664500	1666500	Like some artificial sugar
1666500	1668500	Actually extracted from a plant
1668500	1670500	Some are chemically synthesized
1670500	1672500	The situation is not the same
1672500	1674500	But these data
1674500	1676500	There is no overwhelming evidence
1676500	1678500	Can prove which is dangerous
1678500	1680500	Which is safer
1680500	1682500	But we believe
1682500	1684500	But we believe
1684500	1686500	Indeed these sugar powder is different
1686500	1688500	May have different effects
1688500	1690500	But so far
1690500	1692500	Scientific evidence
1692500	1694500	As far as I know
1694500	1696500	Of course because I'm not a scientist
1696500	1698500	The data I see
1698500	1700500	It's not really clear
1700500	1702500	Which is dangerous
1702500	1704500	Which is safe
1704500	1706500	Because it brings
1706500	1708500	The main part is the heat
1708500	1710500	This fat
1710500	1712500	This fat itself is a risk
1712500	1714500	Risk to the human body
1714500	1716500	What you said
1716500	1718500	The other additional risk
1718500	1720500	I think there may be
1720500	1722500	But so far
1722500	1724500	It's not clear which is the highest risk
1724500	1726500	Even without considering
1726500	1728500	High sugar content
1728500	1730500	This is a problem
1730500	1732500	You said there may even be additional risks
1732500	1734500	In addition to causing
1734500	1736500	In addition to causing
1736500	1738500	Some artificial sugar powder
1738500	1740500	There may be additional risks of cancer
1740500	1742500	I heard people say this
1742500	1744500	But there is no accurate evidence
1744500	1746500	To prove that it is dangerous
1746500	1748500	So when you say sugar
1748500	1750500	The word sugar
1750500	1752500	In your presentation
1752500	1754500	It covers basically all
1754500	1756500	I don't know
1756500	1758500	Maybe it's just
1758500	1760500	Something that can produce sweetness
1760500	1762500	Yes yes
1762500	1764500	Basically like this
1764500	1766500	Even for this
1766500	1768500	We are talking about
1768500	1770500	Soda tax, sugary, sweetened
1770500	1772500	Beverage tax
1772500	1774500	Most of the laws
1774500	1776500	Include these
1776500	1778500	In addition to 100% natural juice
1778500	1780500	Will be excluded
1780500	1782500	As long as you add artificial
1782500	1784500	Whether it's sugar
1784500	1786500	Will be included
1786500	1788500	In the tax law
1788500	1790500	Most of the definitions are included
1790500	1792500	Unless you sell
1792500	1794500	100% natural juice
1794500	1796500	If you don't add anything else
1796500	1798500	Otherwise you will be taxed
1798500	1800500	In many cities
1802500	1804500	This is also what I said in the first video
1804500	1806500	Because
1806500	1808500	Everyone calls it soda tax
1808500	1810500	It's easy to say
1810500	1812500	This is a water tax
1812500	1814500	Or this is a cola tax
1814500	1816500	In fact, the more correct statement
1816500	1818500	With their official words
1818500	1820500	Sugary, sweetened, beverage
1820500	1822500	Sugary, sweetened, beverage
1822500	1824500	Sugary, sweetened, beverage tax
1824500	1826500	So you see
1826500	1828500	This is a simple chart
1828500	1830500	Oh, I forgot to say
1830500	1832500	Disclaimer
1832500	1834500	Many of these charts
1834500	1836500	Are not my original
1836500	1838500	I found it on the Internet
1838500	1840500	Because I don't have time
1840500	1842500	To add the source
1842500	1844500	Some are in my notes
1844500	1846500	So this is a special statement
1846500	1848500	But this is not my theory
1848500	1850500	I will add it
1850500	1852500	When the video is finished
1852500	1854500	Because this is left
1854500	1856500	For our private academic use
1856500	1858500	So it is recommended to use it
1858500	1860500	So you can see
1860500	1862500	Energy drink
1862500	1864500	Red Bull, vitamin water
1864500	1866500	Sports drink
1866500	1868500	Gel powder
1868500	1870500	We often drink sports drinks
1870500	1872500	This is actually a lot of sugar
1872500	1874500	Even juice
1874500	1876500	A lot of juice sold on the market
1876500	1878500	It is not 100% natural juice
1878500	1880500	It may be naturally concentrated
1880500	1882500	Then restore
1882500	1884500	Add a lot of artificial flavors
1884500	1886500	Colors and so on
1886500	1888500	So just like the classmate said
1888500	1890500	It is actually artificial juice
1890500	1892500	Even including
1892500	1894500	Ice tea
1894500	1896500	Ice coffee
1896500	1898500	It actually adds
1898500	1900500	The sugar content is also very high
1900500	1902500	Like we just saw
1902500	1904500	Peach ice tea
1904500	1906500	7 tablespoons
1906500	1908500	Sugar
1908500	1910500	In fact, it is the same as Coca-Cola
1910500	1912500	So these are all within the scope
1912500	1914500	To be taxed
1914500	1916500	Ok
1916500	1918500	Then we have seen
1918500	1920500	It was mentioned in the introduction
1920500	1922500	Sugar and
1922500	1924500	Soda are our target
1924500	1926500	Because it will create fat
1926500	1928500	Fat is what we want to avoid
1928500	1930500	A major danger factor for leprosy
1930500	1932500	Then next
1932500	1934500	How to avoid
1934500	1936500	Intervention
1946500	1948500	This is a picture on the Internet
1948500	1950500	Including
1950500	1952500	U.S. sugar consumption
1952500	1954500	You can see a very obvious trend
1954500	1956500	Almost a linear trend
1958500	1960500	From 1822 to 2005
1960500	1962500	The consumption of sugar
1962500	1964500	Has been rising
1984500	1986500	This is what I want to talk about
1986500	1988500	From the point of view of the law
1988500	1990500	The government's intervention measures
1990500	1992500	Can be divided into four categories
1994500	1996500	The first is the so-called complete ban
1996500	1998500	As you are familiar with
1998500	2000500	I use the picture of this drug
2000500	2002500	For this drug
2002500	2004500	The government's way is to ban
2004500	2006500	Even with criminal law
2006500	2008500	Basically can't hold
2008500	2010500	Can't sell, can't make
2010500	2012500	Can't use such a thing
2012500	2014500	This is the law
2014500	2016500	Even in terms of drugs
2016500	2018500	This kind of ban
2018500	2020500	For example, we just talked about drugs
2020500	2022500	In fact, there are different levels of drugs
2022500	2024500	It may not be the same in all countries
2024500	2026500	I don't know what's going on in your city
2026500	2028500	But at least in Washington D.C.
2028500	2030500	A while ago, it was a hot topic
2030500	2032500	Legalization of drugs
2032500	2034500	Basically you are here
2034500	2036500	It's not a crime
2036500	2038500	But in Taiwan
2038500	2040500	Drugs are the second level of drugs
2040500	2042500	Same thing
2042500	2044500	So the first level
2044500	2046500	Of course the first level is the most serious
2046500	2048500	But the second level
2048500	2050500	In fact, the relevant criminal law is also quite serious
2050500	2052500	When I was a lawyer in Taiwan
2052500	2054500	I just witnessed
2054500	2056500	Especially foreigners
2056500	2058500	The case of using marijuana in Taiwan
2058500	2060500	Of course they all want to advocate
2060500	2062500	In our country, marijuana is legal
2062500	2064500	Some even say that he went to the Netherlands to use
2064500	2066500	Then returned to Taiwan
2066500	2068500	It was detected that there was marijuana
2068500	2070500	Anyway, we can see
2070500	2072500	This is the first way
2072500	2074500	Then use criminal law to regulate
2074500	2076500	The second example
2076500	2078500	I said it was a mode
2078500	2080500	I said it was a restriction
2080500	2082500	This is also easy to understand
2082500	2084500	I use cigarettes and alcohol
2084500	2086500	Everyone is familiar
2086500	2088500	The government can regulate
2088500	2090500	You can only buy cigarettes or alcohol at the age of 18 or 21
2090500	2092500	Even the purchase of cigarettes and alcohol
2092500	2094500	Restrictions
2094500	2096500	I don't know how you are in the city
2096500	2098500	Like where I live
2098500	2100500	It's actually Maryland
2100500	2102500	I don't sell alcohol in the city
2102500	2104500	Basically, you have to buy alcohol
2104500	2106500	Go to the liquor store
2106500	2108500	It's basically using that way
2108500	2110500	Make you feel less convenient
2110500	2112500	You want to go shopping
2112500	2114500	By the way, bring a bottle of beer back
2114500	2116500	It's quite difficult
2116500	2118500	You need to drive to the store to buy
2118500	2120500	Sometimes you think it's troublesome
2120500	2122500	Reduce your drinking capacity
2122500	2124500	Even for the behavior after use
2124500	2126500	For example, you can't drive after drinking
2126500	2128500	Can't drive a plane
2128500	2130500	Can't drive a bus
2130500	2132500	Restricted
2132500	2134500	For example, cigarettes and alcohol
2134500	2136500	The third one is more interesting
2136500	2138500	I call it Nudge
2138500	2140500	Why talk about this
2140500	2142500	I don't know if everyone has heard of Nudge
2142500	2144500	This is actually
2144500	2146500	I use this picture
2146500	2148500	It's actually a book cover
2148500	2150500	It is almost
2150500	2152500	One of the most famous law professors in the United States
2152500	2154500	He is
2154500	2156500	Case Sunstein
2156500	2158500	He has been to Taiwan
2158500	2160500	He advocated
2160500	2162500	Nudge
2162500	2164500	Nudge is actually not a novel
2166500	2168500	It's not worth it
2168500	2170500	He basically said
2170500	2172500	Use information to provide
2172500	2174500	Environmental settings or speech
2174500	2176500	To affect human behavior
2176500	2178500	The most famous example in his book
2178500	2180500	The manager in the cafeteria
2180500	2182500	As long as he changes the position of the vegetables
2182500	2184500	Will affect the amount of vegetables
2184500	2186500	The amount of vegetables for children
2186500	2188500	In other words, if he moves it
2188500	2190500	To the front, the middle, where everyone sees it
2190500	2192500	I saw it at the beginning
2192500	2194500	It's easy for everyone to take more vegetables
2194500	2196500	I hate vegetables
2196500	2198500	Anyway, the first time you see it, you will take it
2198500	2200500	Will affect the amount
2200500	2202500	This is actually not so much
2202500	2204500	Because in fact
2204500	2206500	All department stores, supermarkets
2206500	2208500	Even the bookstore boss knows
2208500	2210500	He wants to sell the most
2210500	2212500	Put it in the best position
2212500	2214500	But this mentioned
2214500	2216500	This is a bit
2216500	2218500	I use information to provide
2218500	2220500	Use position settings to change human behavior
2220500	2222500	Unknowingly change human behavior
2222500	2224500	But basically this is not really forced
2224500	2226500	This is to let the parties
2226500	2228500	Make decisions with their own free will
2228500	2230500	It's just that his so-called free will
2230500	2232500	Unknowingly received some of my default settings
2232500	2234500	Or some of these
2234500	2236500	Position settings
2236500	2238500	Information provided
2238500	2240500	Affects your own decisions
2240500	2242500	This is the third mode
2242500	2244500	I call it light push
2244500	2246500	The fourth is actually
2246500	2248500	Basically the government does not care
2248500	2250500	Just open
2250500	2252500	Fully provided by the market mechanism
2252500	2254500	Like Taiwan
2254500	2256500	If it is Taiwan's
2256500	2258500	Just mentioned this
2258500	2260500	Or these sugar
2260500	2262500	There is no control at the moment
2262500	2264500	You can add as much sugar as you want
2264500	2266500	But it's possible because everyone is afraid of getting fat
2266500	2268500	So the habit is to say less sugar, micro sugar, no sugar, etc.
2268500	2270500	The government basically does not interfere
2270500	2272500	So there may be
2272500	2274500	These four modes
2274500	2276500	These four modes
2276500	2278500	Can actually be used
2278500	2280500	For sugar-free drinks
2280500	2282500	We want to reduce everyone's intake
2282500	2284500	To achieve this
2284500	2286500	Reduce fat
2286500	2288500	That
2288500	2290500	That
2290500	2292500	Sugar is of course not difficult to understand
2292500	2294500	The first one is of course not difficult to understand
2294500	2296500	Or we will ban it
2296500	2298500	Just mentioned
2298500	2300500	Artificially added sugar
2300500	2302500	Even artificial sugar
2302500	2304500	We can ban it
2304500	2306500	Like anti-fat
2306500	2308500	The fourth is also not difficult to understand
2308500	2310500	Just open
2310500	2312500	Basically the current situation
2312500	2314500	Taiwan's situation is that sugar is not in charge
2314500	2316500	In fact
2316500	2318500	The more interesting thing is actually the second
2318500	2320500	The so-called restrictions and the third light push
2320500	2322500	The second restriction is actually like the example of Singapore
2322500	2324500	They set 12% sugar content
2324500	2326500	In fact, there are restrictions in the United States
2326500	2328500	That is to say
2328500	2330500	Many school vending machines
2330500	2332500	Are not allowed to sell some sugar-free drinks
2332500	2334500	He uses this place restriction
2334500	2336500	Especially for elementary school students, middle school students, etc.
2336500	2338500	Restrict their access to sugar-free drinks
2338500	2340500	This possibility, etc.
2340500	2342500	This is also a restriction
2342500	2344500	About restrictions
2344500	2346500	I want to introduce a case
2346500	2348500	We don't have any students studying in New York
2348500	2350500	There used to be a mayor in New York
2350500	2352500	His name is Michael Bloomberg
2352500	2354500	He is the boss of Bloomberg
2356500	2358500	He used to be the mayor of New York City
2358500	2360500	From 2002 to 2013
2362500	2364500	This person is a billionaire
2364500	2366500	Very rich
2366500	2368500	I remember he didn't know the news
2368500	2370500	Often take money out to do things
2370500	2372500	He is also famous for public health
2372500	2374500	Very enthusiastic
2374500	2376500	This may be related to his undergraduate degree
2376500	2378500	But anyway
2378500	2380500	He invested a lot in public health
2380500	2382500	Bloomberg Foundation
2382500	2384500	Sponsored a lot of public health research
2388500	2390500	He is also very concerned about obesity in New York
2392500	2394500	Even for sugar-free drinks
2396500	2398500	He came up with a way
2398500	2400500	One of the ways
2400500	2402500	This is called
2402500	2404500	Potion cap
2404500	2406500	Simply put
2406500	2408500	Restrict these vegetarian restaurants
2408500	2410500	Can't sell large cups of drinks
2410500	2412500	Restrict the amount of drinks
2412500	2414500	The size of the cup
2414500	2416500	Simply put, you can buy a small cup
2416500	2418500	No matter how many cups you want
2418500	2420500	But the restaurant can't put such a large cup
2420500	2422500	Sell ​​a large cup of drinks
2422500	2424500	Restrict the amount of a cup
2428500	2430500	In 2012, he proposed this policy
2432500	2434500	This policy
2434500	2436500	Later died
2436500	2438500	You can imagine
2438500	2440500	When it was first launched
2440500	2442500	Many people are very angry
2442500	2444500	Restaurant owners are very angry
2444500	2446500	Because selling drinks is making money
2448500	2450500	The biggest in the United States
2450500	2452500	American Beverage Association
2452500	2454500	Very powerful
2454500	2456500	They also pay
2456500	2458500	Advertisement etc.
2458500	2460500	One of the most famous
2460500	2462500	I drew a picture
2462500	2464500	He was laughed at
2464500	2466500	Old mother
2466500	2468500	Nanny
2468500	2470500	We don't need a nanny
2470500	2472500	Tell us how much cola to drink
2474500	2476500	This example and this picture
2476500	2478500	Too famous
2478500	2480500	Discuss relevant issues
2480500	2482500	Even in New York
2482500	2484500	People often talk about this
2484500	2486500	Why did this thing die later?
2486500	2488500	The interesting part of the United States
2490500	2492500	The interesting part of the public service law
2492500	2494500	They are using the method of litigation
2494500	2496500	They filed a lawsuit
2496500	2498500	Challenge New York
2498500	2500500	Administration
2500500	2502500	The court basically believes
2502500	2504500	Bloomberg is not
2504500	2506500	Use through their parliament
2506500	2508500	New York City Parliament
2508500	2510500	To restrict this portion through the law
2510500	2512500	It is used in a similar administrative order
2512500	2514500	To stipulate the portion of the restaurant
2514500	2516500	The court believes that this should be
2516500	2518500	The facts stipulated by the law
2518500	2520500	You can't do it directly with administrative regulations
2520500	2522500	New York City's law
2522500	2524500	New York City's law
2524500	2526500	So it was postponed
2526500	2528500	Anyway
2528500	2530500	The case was lost
2530500	2532500	But he had tried this
2532500	2534500	New York City
2534500	2536500	Is it possible to add soda tax?
2536500	2538500	I have a plan in my research
2538500	2540500	I will interview public officials in New York
2540500	2542500	They are proposing
2542500	2544500	It won't happen so soon
2544500	2546500	But they have tried
2546500	2548500	Use this portion
2548500	2550500	Another case
2550500	2552500	This is a British case
2552500	2554500	If you have been to the UK
2554500	2556500	They called
2556500	2558500	Traffic light system
2558500	2560500	You can see
2560500	2562500	He listed several items
2562500	2564500	Fat
2564500	2566500	saturated fat
2566500	2568500	And this
2568500	2570500	Sugar and salt
2570500	2572500	He used this traffic light
2572500	2574500	If the product contains sugar
2574500	2576500	Or salt
2576500	2578500	Far more than one person
2578500	2580500	You have to mark a red light
2580500	2582500	Remind everyone
2582500	2584500	If it is normal, use yellow light
2584500	2586500	If it is safe, use green light
2586500	2588500	So you can buy a product
2588500	2590500	You can see
2590500	2592500	It is marked in the front
2594500	2596500	So this is what we just talked about
2596500	2598500	Nudge
2598500	2600500	Let consumers decide
2600500	2602500	Do I want to buy this product
2602500	2604500	But
2604500	2606500	It is a pity
2606500	2608500	Since 2013
2608500	2610500	This policy is voluntary
2610500	2612500	It is not mandatory
2612500	2614500	In the UK
2614500	2616500	You can provide information to consumers
2616500	2618500	But there is no law
2618500	2620500	Next is the US
2620500	2622500	Nutrition facts
2622500	2624500	This is the law
