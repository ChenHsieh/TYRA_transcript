0	20500	So after I graduated from university, I think I did an RA, if I remember correctly, at Professor Chen's place, right?
20500	26500	I did it for a year or two
27500	34500	After that, I went to Canada's McMaster to study for my PhD
34500	40500	When I was studying for my PhD, one of the tutors was Dr. Trenner
40500	47500	He was doing a course on music perception and intuition
47500	55500	If you're interested, you can ask him why he chose to do music
55500	58500	or intuition and cognition
58500	64500	I don't know much about intuition, but my impression is that
64500	68500	doing visual psychology takes up a large portion of the work
68500	72500	So why did I decide to do intuition? I think it's interesting
76500	80500	I don't know, it's just my guess
80500	84500	Yongyi has a website, you can go check it out, it's really scary
84500	88500	The publications are as long as ghosts
88500	93500	Other than the publications, there's also awards and media coverage
93500	95500	I think that's really cool
95500	98500	I hope one day I can tell my parents that I'm a journalist
98500	104500	Without further ado, let's welcome Yongyi to share his research with us
105500	110500	I'll turn off my mic so you can hear me
110500	113500	Can you hear me now?
113500	115500	I think it's okay
115500	118500	I'm a little shy
118500	120500	I don't even know if I have to give a score
120500	123500	Today is July 8th, I'm guessing my highest score is 87
123500	125500	I can't go any higher
125500	127500	That's about it
127500	129500	I can predict the results
130500	134500	You have to turn on the audio so you can hear the laughter
134500	137500	I don't think there's any feedback
137500	139500	I think we need feedback
139500	141500	Forget it
141500	143500	It's pretty funny
143500	146500	I'm being encouraged, I'm indeed a person who studies truth psychology
146500	148500	It's different
148500	151500	I'm probably just making things up
152500	156500	I'm not really interested in hearing
156500	159500	There's no deep reason
159500	162500	First of all, I'm very interested in music
162500	165500	I only found out later that most people do visual research
165500	167500	Most people talk about intuition
167500	170500	It's directly implied that it's visual research
170500	172500	I only found out later
172500	174500	If you're doing hearing research
174500	176500	You have to say it's particularly famous for auditory
176500	178500	Otherwise people will get it wrong
178500	180500	It's pretty interesting
180500	183500	I think there are some phenomena in hearing
183500	187500	It's different when it comes to other senses
187500	191500	There are some special problems to deal with
191500	193500	I think that's what makes hearing interesting
193500	195500	It's a special place
195500	199500	Okay, let's get into my presentation
199500	202500	I'm going to start studying how to share my screen
205500	207500	Okay, while you're studying
207500	209500	Let me tell you
209500	212500	Just in case there's feedback
212500	214500	Let me turn off the microphone
214500	217500	If you have anything you want to say
217500	220500	You can type it in
220500	223500	You can also speak
223500	224500	Okay
224500	225500	Okay
225500	227500	Let's go
227500	229500	Okay
229500	234500	My PhD research topic is
234500	238500	It's very vague
238500	240500	Dynamic Auditory Communication
240500	242500	It's vague
242500	244500	It's about how to change your hearing
244500	247500	In a dynamic situation
247500	250500	How to change your hearing
250500	253500	In a dynamic situation
253500	255500	This includes
255500	257500	For example, you're listening to me now
257500	259500	All my voices change at any time
259500	261500	For example, every time I make a sound
261500	262500	There's a millisecond
262500	264500	And then it disappears
264500	265500	Or listening to music
265500	267500	It's kind of like that
267500	268500	And then
268500	271500	And what I want to share today is
271500	272500	My experiment
272500	274500	From a traditional laboratory
274500	275500	Psychological laboratory
275500	277500	And then do it
277500	279500	More complicated
279500	281500	We think it's closer to the real
281500	282500	Interaction
282500	284500	Under the environment of human interaction
284500	285500	That is
285500	288500	From a small laboratory to a large laboratory
288500	289500	Between each other
289500	291500	There are some research methods
291500	293500	Needs to be adjusted
293500	296500	And then I just want to explain today
296500	298500	Take our research as an example
298500	301500	How do we do this
301500	302500	So my sub-topic is
302500	304500	How do psychologists do research
304500	306500	And there is a step-by-step explanation
306500	307500	Explain
307500	309500	What are the problems we encounter
309500	310500	And then
310500	311500	We think
311500	312500	In our situation
312500	313500	How do we solve it
313500	314500	And then
314500	315500	By the way
315500	316500	Just
316500	317500	Just
317500	318500	Please help everyone
318500	320500	The place is
320500	321500	September
321500	323500	Taiwan's Science and Music Magazine
323500	324500	There will be a
324500	327500	A special special issue of music psychology
327500	328500	And then
330500	331500	I want to put this
331500	332500	Related research
332500	333500	It's a draft
333500	334500	Go over there
334500	335500	As a
335500	336500	A small topic
336500	337500	Just share it
337500	339500	Just as a science book
339500	341500	Share it to readers in Taiwan
341500	343500	Then I didn't write it myself
343500	345500	The experience of doing a science book article
345500	346500	Then if I hope
346500	347500	That is to say
348500	350500	I hope to make today's speech
350500	351500	Into different fields
351500	352500	People interested in science
352500	353500	Can probably
353500	354500	Psychologists
354500	355500	How do we do research
355500	356500	Especially in
356500	357500	How do we do research
357500	358500	In such a special situation
358500	359500	If you think
359500	360500	On the content
360500	361500	Or how to explain
361500	363500	How can it be adjusted better
363500	364500	That is
364500	366500	I hope you can tell me
366500	367500	Then
367500	368500	I will
368500	370500	I'm going to take the exam in two weeks
370500	371500	So thank you very much
371500	373500	If there is any help
373500	374500	OK
374500	375500	it is good
375500	377500	The nonsense should be over
377500	379500	First of all, I want to say
379500	381500	Hearing has many domains
381500	382500	Like for example
382500	384500	You can know if the pitch is high or low
384500	386500	What I want to focus on today is
386500	387500	Focus on time
387500	388500	For hearing
388500	390500	Is a very important thing
390500	392500	In fact, time is for many senses
392500	394500	And the reaction is very important
394500	395500	For hearing
395500	397500	I think it is especially critical
397500	398500	Why
398500	400500	If you record my voice
400500	401500	Then take it to
401500	402500	In the software of the computer
402500	403500	Open it
403500	404500	Look at its radio
404500	405500	Its radio
405500	406500	It looks like
406500	407500	Almost like this
407500	408500	Then you can of course
408500	409500	Decode
409500	410500	That is to say
410500	412500	What is my voice
412500	413500	Then
413500	414500	Our hearing is
414500	415500	We have to put it together
415500	417500	To become a meaningful sentence
417500	418500	Ah
418500	419500	But it's hard for hearing
419500	420500	That is to say
420500	421500	Every message
421500	424500	The time it appears is so short
424500	425500	And
425500	427500	It won't appear again
427500	428500	Ah
428500	429500	Human beings have lived for so long
429500	430500	History
430500	431500	The history of human communication
431500	432500	Before the recorder was invented
432500	433500	We have no chance
433500	435500	Listen again
435500	436500	What happened before
436500	437500	How is it
437500	438500	So human hearing
438500	439500	A big problem
439500	440500	That is to say
440500	442500	We have to be able to catch it quickly
442500	443500	Ah
443500	444500	This message is displayed at any time
444500	446500	And then accurately
446500	447500	Awareness
447500	448500	Feel it accurately
448500	449500	The content of this
449500	450500	Then
450500	451500	And another
451500	452500	More demanding is
452500	453500	That is
453500	455500	We are not just aware of this
455500	456500	And we have to
456500	457500	Make a quick response
457500	458500	For example
458500	460500	When you have a conversation with others
460500	461500	What are you hearing
461500	462500	You will be able to understand immediately
462500	463500	Then immediately
463500	464500	Be able to react
464500	465500	Then this skill
465500	466500	When quarreling
466500	467500	It's particularly important
467500	468500	Because if you slow down
468500	469500	If you slow down
469500	470500	You lost the quarrel
470500	471500	It's very
471500	472500	It's important to speak
472500	473500	Right
473500	474500	So you see
474500	475500	Human beings are like this
475500	476500	No, I'm kidding
476500	477500	That
477500	478500	Not only in conversation
478500	479500	In another situation
479500	480500	For example, you are listening to music
480500	481500	Ah
481500	483500	And for example, you are with
483500	484500	You sing with others
484500	485500	Ah
485500	486500	Sing together
486500	487500	That
487500	489500	I can't just listen to other people's music
489500	490500	Listen to this
490500	491500	I'm going to
491500	493500	Sing my part
493500	494500	Because you are like this
494500	495500	No matter how fast your processing speed is
495500	497500	There must be a time difference inside
497500	498500	That
498500	499500	Ah
499500	500500	So
500500	502500	In fact, in many cases of hearing
502500	503500	We think it is
503500	504500	He keeps
504500	505500	Keep predicting
505500	507500	What's going to happen next
507500	509500	Then let people
509500	510500	Always
510500	511500	Let your intuition
511500	512500	Let your nervous response
512500	513500	Always in a
513500	514500	In a well-prepared situation
514500	515500	Then you can
515500	517500	Precise intuition to this matter
517500	518500	And then
518500	520500	Quickly prepared
520500	522500	To make the next reaction
522500	524500	So I think hearing is on time
524500	525500	Ah
525500	527500	In fact, compared to other sensory domains
527500	528500	Is
528500	529500	More demanding
529500	530500	This is
530500	531500	My task
531500	533500	So I think time is very important to hearing
533500	534500	Ok
534500	535500	If you have any questions
535500	536500	You can interrupt me in the middle
536500	537500	Then if there is no problem
537500	538500	I will continue
538500	539500	Then
539500	540500	By the way because I
540500	541500	Now
541500	543500	I share the screen
543500	544500	So if everyone
544500	545500	If you leave a message in the chat
545500	547500	I should not be able to see it now
547500	548500	So everyone can
548500	549500	Just turn on the microphone
549500	551500	It has nothing to do with me
551500	552500	Ok
552500	553500	Ah
553500	554500	I have a question
554500	555500	Ok
556500	557500	Please say
557500	558500	The
558500	561500	The M-I-N-G-E-R above the waveform
561500	562500	What is that?
563500	565500	Oh, that's just an example I found on the Internet
566500	568500	I don't know what that is
568500	569500	Sorry
569500	570500	Ok
570500	571500	Ok, thank you
572500	574500	It should be a project title
575500	576500	Yes
576500	577500	It looks like this
577500	578500	But I don't know
578500	580500	I haven't searched either
582500	583500	Alright
583500	584500	Maybe it's doing something
584500	585500	Voice
585500	586500	Voice of the computer
586500	589500	Some of the projects handled by the visual
589500	590500	I don't know
590500	591500	Sorry
591500	593500	Then I will talk about it first
593500	595500	In traditional psychology and neuroscience
595500	598500	How do we do this kind of research in the lab
598500	599500	If we want to know
599500	600500	What is the importance of time for hearing
600500	602500	How do we do research
602500	603500	For example
603500	604500	I
604500	605500	I will
605500	608500	Design a series of hearing with a computer
608500	610500	A series of hearing that opens at any time
610500	611500	Then for example
611500	612500	Then for example
612500	613500	I can
613500	614500	A kind of audio file
614500	615500	I put it
615500	616500	Every note
616500	617500	Bop, bop, bop
617500	618500	All time
618500	620500	Every bop, bop, bop
620500	621500	Between each tone
621500	623500	Its time is fixed
623500	624500	The same length
624500	626500	For example, it's 500 milliseconds
626500	627500	So this way you
627500	629500	It sounds like a decoder
629500	631500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
631500	633500	Then you can keep going
633500	634500	So this
634500	636500	This is a very regular time
636500	637500	Then you can have a
637500	639500	An irregular time
639500	640500	For example, it's
640500	641500	Between your pain and pain
641500	642500	Can be
642500	643500	For example
643500	644500	Random 250 milliseconds
644500	645500	Between 750 milliseconds
645500	646500	So it might sound like this
646500	649500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
649500	650500	Just
650500	651500	You don't know at all
651500	652500	You
652500	654500	When will the next pain appear
654500	655500	And then
655500	657500	In this different
657500	658500	Under the circumstances
658500	659500	We can
659500	661500	Require the audience to do some
661500	663500	Intuitive answer
663500	665500	For example, we can make
665500	667500	Some of them have sounds
667500	668500	Most of these sounds
668500	670500	Most of them are exactly the same
670500	671500	There are some sounds
671500	672500	Maybe we'll just make it
672500	674500	It's a little bit higher or a little bit lower
674500	676500	We're on the frequency domain
676500	677500	To make some adjustments
677500	678500	And then the audience
678500	679500	Just
679500	680500	To participate in the experiment
680500	682500	The college student has to listen to that sound
682500	683500	If he hears a higher pitch
683500	684500	He'll press a button
684500	685500	If you hear a lower pitch
685500	686500	Just press a button
686500	687500	It sounds like
687500	689500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
689500	691500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
691500	692500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
692500	693500	You have to listen to the higher pitch
693500	694500	You have to react
694500	695500	And then the other
695500	696500	Under the circumstances of irregular time
696500	698500	You can also do this kind of manipulation
698500	699500	And then we can go and see
699500	700500	For example
700500	702500	Under the circumstances of regular time
702500	703500	The correct rate of his answer
703500	704500	It's going to be higher
704500	706500	Under the circumstances of irregular time
706500	707500	Then we can
707500	708500	Psychologists usually say
708500	710500	Oh, that's the regular time
710500	712500	It can help you
712500	713500	Have a better sense
713500	715500	Because you're better
716500	718500	Because your accuracy is higher
718500	720500	You can have a more accurate answer
720500	722500	In this case
722500	723500	We can also do some
723500	725500	Neuroscientific measurements
725500	728500	For example, I can measure people's brainwaves
728500	730500	This is a memory map
730500	732500	It's because of the nervous response of the brain
732500	733500	The nervous response of the brain
733500	734500	It's all about the nerve
734500	736500	It's all about the neurotransmitter
736500	737500	To do the reaction
737500	738500	Then we can put those
738500	740500	For example, the ECG map
740500	742500	Or the sensors for measuring muscle position
742500	743500	We'll put it on the scalp
744500	745500	That's because of the nerve response
745500	747500	It's going to be that wave signal
747500	748500	It's going to come out
748500	750500	So we can put it on the surface of the scalp
750500	751500	Record this signal
751500	752500	That's what we call it
752500	755500	The signal of the brainwaves
755500	757500	Then we can do some corresponding analysis
757500	759500	We can see that the brainwaves are
759500	762500	How to capture the regularity of this time
762500	763500	And then for example
763500	765500	Let's do some complicated processing
765500	766500	And then we'll get
766500	767500	Something like this
767500	768500	The answer is
768500	770500	We'll find out, for example
770500	771500	The brainwave
771500	774500	It's going to adjust the speed of its vibration
774500	776500	It's the same as the external stimulus
776500	778500	And then we just have to catch this
778500	779500	In the brain
779500	780500	Imagine the nerve in the brain
780500	781500	It's like a decoder
781500	783500	It's going to be able to accurately capture
783500	785500	How to produce the next second
785500	787500	That's the traditional neuroscience
787500	788500	Or psychologically
788500	790500	We're going to do this
790500	792500	A study of orientation
792500	794500	But this study is actually quite
794500	796500	OK, please go ahead
796500	798500	That's your time
798500	799500	That's the frequency
799500	801500	That cycle
801500	803500	How short can it be
804500	806500	You mean the cycle of my voice
806500	808500	Or the cycle of the brainwaves
808500	810500	The cycle of the voice
810500	812500	And then there's the brainwaves
812500	813500	You're going to adjust it
813500	815500	If it's the same as your external
815500	817500	Does it have a limit
818500	820500	This is a good question
820500	822500	Usually humans can catch the beat
822500	826500	The shortest is the shortest between pain and pain
826500	827500	It's 200 milliseconds
828500	830500	I can't sing so fast
830500	832500	It's about the same speed
832500	834500	More than 200 milliseconds
834500	835500	You probably think
835500	837500	It's almost a continuous sound
837500	838500	That's the slowest
838500	840500	It's the longest between pain and pain
840500	844500	It can be as long as 1,200 milliseconds
844500	845500	1.2 seconds
845500	847500	After that
847500	849500	You'll feel like every sound is independent
849500	852500	You don't think it's a continuous rhythm
852500	853500	You just can't
853500	855500	Know the pattern
855500	857500	What's interesting is that the brainwaves
857500	859500	Can only catch up
859500	861500	Such a speed range
861500	863500	It's slower than this
863500	864500	Or faster than this
864500	866500	There's no way
866500	868500	As for what causes what
868500	869500	I don't know
869500	871500	It's because the brain can't move so fast
871500	872500	Move so slow
872500	873500	To make us instinctively
873500	874500	Can't catch up so fast
874500	875500	Such a slow speed
875500	876500	I don't know
876500	877500	I can only say
877500	880500	This is what we have now
881500	882500	Thank you
882500	884500	Hello
884500	886500	So I'd like to ask
886500	888500	When you do this experiment
888500	889500	Do you have to eliminate
889500	892500	Other noise interference?
892500	893500	That's right
893500	895500	We do this kind of experiment
895500	896500	Because we want to be clean
896500	898500	So we do it in the soundproof room
898500	900500	And then we'll use headphones
900500	902500	That is, we'll use those
902500	903500	More special headphones
903500	905500	Just send the sound
905500	906500	Into the ear
906500	908500	And it's very close
908500	909500	The more inside, the better
909500	911500	And then the sound is transmitted
911500	912500	It's all very clean
912500	913500	I just want to reduce
913500	915500	External interference
915500	916500	That's right
916500	917500	So when you say
917500	918500	The so-called hearing
918500	920500	It means
920500	921500	Human beings
921500	922500	We can really
922500	923500	The sound we hear
923500	925500	Or include that
925500	926500	Include that
926500	927500	The frequency we can't hear
927500	929500	It's also in the hearing
929500	931500	For example, ultrasonic waves or
931500	933500	Very low frequency
933500	934500	That kind
934500	936500	That kind of hearing
936500	937500	That kind
937500	938500	That's what you're asking
938500	939500	That is to say
939500	940500	Physical stimulation
940500	942500	Does it stimulate psychological feelings?
942500	944500	That's what we say
944500	946500	Will ask questions like this
946500	947500	Of course
947500	948500	Of course there are people
948500	949500	Study such a question
949500	950500	That is to say
950500	951500	Where is the limit of human hearing?
951500	952500	Then you can see
952500	954500	Where is the limit of frequency?
954500	955500	But this is not me
955500	956500	Today
956500	959500	Is the main part of the discussion
959500	961500	Maybe we'll wait
961500	964500	Discuss again later
964500	965500	Like this
965500	966500	I don't know if it's like this
966500	967500	Or just
967500	968500	You can discuss it casually
968500	969500	No no no
969500	970500	Because of me
970500	971500	I'm more curious
971500	972500	When you say you want to eradicate
972500	973500	That interference
973500	975500	When noise interference
975500	977500	That's how you eradicate that kind
977500	978500	We don't know at all
978500	980500	The kind of interference we hear
980500	982500	For example, like ultrasonic waves
982500	984500	You are in that
984500	985500	What is that called
985500	986500	There is no noise at all
986500	987500	That kind of interference
987500	988500	In that kind of experimental environment
988500	990500	You can't guarantee
990500	993500	He won't be affected by the outside world
993500	994500	OK OK OK
994500	995500	Then I know
996500	998500	Of course we
998500	1000500	What we do is
1000500	1001500	We already know
1001500	1003500	Human hearing frequency range
1003500	1005500	It's about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz
1005500	1007500	In the frequency range of this Hz
1007500	1009500	We
1009500	1011500	In fact, in the experimental environment
1011500	1012500	Can still measure
1012500	1013500	In the case of measurement
1013500	1015500	We will make a comparison
1015500	1017500	As for ultrasonic waves
1017500	1019500	We generally think it's human
1019500	1021500	Physically, you can't hear it
1021500	1023500	So
1023500	1025500	So we don't care about his control
1025500	1027500	So for example
1027500	1028500	There is an ultrasonic wave in the lab
1028500	1031500	The sound of the ultrasonic wave
1031500	1033500	Or that kind of very, very, very high frequency
1033500	1035500	We don't care
1035500	1037500	So it's based on an assumption
1037500	1039500	Those things won't cause
1039500	1041500	It won't cause too much interference to humans
1041500	1043500	Yes, it really won't
1043500	1044500	And the other thing is
1044500	1046500	In the case of our experiments
1046500	1047500	We don't say
1047500	1049500	One condition is to make a trial
1049500	1051500	Of course we will do hundreds of trials
1051500	1052500	Thousands of trials
1052500	1053500	Even if there is an effect
1053500	1055500	As long as it is with your experiment
1055500	1057500	The program set by the computer
1057500	1059500	If it's not related to each other
1059500	1061500	Then the effect we observe
1061500	1064500	These external effects
1064500	1066500	It should be reduced a lot
1066500	1068500	OK, thank you
1068500	1070500	Then
1070500	1071500	Hey, copy it
1071500	1072500	That is to say
1072500	1074500	What about this POP process
1074500	1076500	Of course you can decide for yourself
1076500	1078500	See if you want to say
1078500	1080500	To accept the middle question
1080500	1081500	Or ask at the end
1081500	1082500	Or open the discussion directly
1082500	1083500	You can decide
1083500	1084500	Then but
1084500	1085500	That is
1085500	1086500	We
1086500	1088500	The prediction is that you can
1088500	1090500	You can talk for about an hour
1090500	1091500	And then
1091500	1094500	There will probably be a 20-minute discussion
1094500	1095500	Ah
1095500	1096500	That's it
1096500	1097500	As for you
1097500	1098500	Cut it in half
1098500	1099500	Or mixed together
1099500	1100500	How do you decide
1100500	1101500	Just decide for yourself
1101500	1102500	OK OK OK
1102500	1103500	OK
1103500	1104500	Let me tell you first
1104500	1106500	I actually didn't prepare a lot of POP
1106500	1108500	I only prepared about 18 pages
1108500	1109500	So
1109500	1112500	So the topic part will be finished in a moment
1112500	1115500	If there are some related topics
1115500	1118500	Sorry, I just didn't know what your question was
1118500	1121500	If it's related to listening or other music
1121500	1123500	We can wait until then to discuss
1123500	1125500	That if it has to do with the topic I'm talking about
1125500	1127500	Of course we will raise it and discuss it live
1127500	1130500	Sorry, I just didn't know what your question was
1130500	1131500	With this
1131500	1133500	Where is the thing I'm talking about now
1135500	1136500	OK
1136500	1137500	Well
1137500	1139500	But
1139500	1141500	OK, I will continue
1141500	1144500	I think the biggest problem in doing research in the lab
1144500	1145500	Is that
1145500	1146500	If what we want to know is
1146500	1148500	How people interact with each other normally
1148500	1150500	For example, interacting with each other by listening
1150500	1152500	But in fact, the two kinds of information
1152500	1153500	Time-regulated and time-unregulated
1153500	1154500	This kind of experiment
1154500	1156500	The information I made in my computer
1156500	1158500	It doesn't exist in the natural world
1158500	1159500	In the natural world
1159500	1160500	You won't hear a
1160500	1162500	Such accurate information like a decoder
1162500	1163500	You won't hear a
1163500	1165500	A completely random message
1165500	1166500	You usually hear
1166500	1167500	A little regular
1167500	1169500	But it's not that regular
1169500	1171500	So if I do research like this
1171500	1173500	What does it do to understand my human
1173500	1175500	What is the real ability to help
1175500	1178500	In fact, sometimes it is a bit biased
1178500	1180500	So
1180500	1182500	In fact, there is a very interesting paper
1182500	1183500	It was just published recently
1183500	1185500	It's called Neuroscience Needs Behavior
1185500	1187500	If you are interested in
1187500	1189500	Related philosophy, scientific philosophy
1189500	1190500	If you are interested
1190500	1192500	I highly recommend this paper
1192500	1194500	Then I will use the few pictures in it
1194500	1195500	To talk about
1195500	1196500	This research
1196500	1197500	The limitations of laboratory research
1197500	1199500	Generally, we want to know
1199500	1200500	It can be said
1200500	1203500	For example, the neural pattern of the human brain
1203500	1206500	What is the relationship between natural behavior
1206500	1208500	Then you can take the neural pattern
1208500	1209500	As a
1209500	1211500	For example, the psychological process
1211500	1213500	The psychological inner process can also be
1213500	1215500	This is what we want to know
1215500	1217500	Then a better designed ideal experiment
1217500	1218500	That is to say
1218500	1219500	We can control
1219500	1222500	We know which part of the psychological process
1222500	1223500	Or neural response
1223500	1226500	Corresponding to some of our natural behaviors
1226500	1227500	We can have one-to-one
1227500	1229500	Is the correspondence of one-to-one
1229500	1231500	Or a simpler correspondence
1231500	1233500	But like the experiment we just did
1233500	1234500	In fact, the experiment just now
1234500	1236500	Is the experiment I did
1236500	1237500	I did it myself
1237500	1238500	Um, we
1238500	1240500	I actually designed an experiment
1240500	1241500	The situation is
1241500	1243500	Humans are generally
1243500	1245500	It's not going to happen
1245500	1248500	Then we are studying his neural response
1248500	1249500	Although we can know
1249500	1250500	The relationship between these
1251500	1253500	But we can't answer directly
1253500	1255500	What is human nature
1255500	1256500	We can't answer
1256500	1259500	Human natural reaction
1259500	1260500	So what we know is
1260500	1261500	Some humans
1261500	1262500	Supernormal ability
1262500	1264500	It's beyond his usual ability
1264500	1265500	but
1265500	1267500	Our main research topics
1267500	1268500	In fact, there is no direct understanding
1268500	1269500	This is what I think
1269500	1270500	Laboratory research
1270500	1271500	Some big limitations
1271500	1274500	Especially in other areas
1274500	1275500	There is such a situation
1275500	1276500	For example
1276500	1278500	If you want to manipulate social interaction
1278500	1279500	You are in a very small laboratory
1279500	1280500	Basically can't do this
1280500	1281500	Because our lab
1281500	1283500	Basically looks like this
1283500	1284500	Just a person
1284500	1286500	Sitting in a small space
1286500	1287500	Because we have to
1287500	1288500	Like I just said
1288500	1290500	Must control all external stimuli
1290500	1291500	So
1291500	1292500	I often sit alone inside
1292500	1293500	In a very quiet situation
1293500	1295500	Interact with the computer
1295500	1297500	Then at the same time because
1297500	1300500	Uh, our measuring tool
1300500	1302500	For example, uh, uh, uh
1302500	1304500	That side brain wave
1304500	1305500	The length of the line
1305500	1306500	He can only sit there
1306500	1307500	He can't do anything
1307500	1309500	He can only use two fingers to react
1309500	1310500	So actually this is also
1310500	1312500	Very unnatural
1312500	1313500	Then this is some
1313500	1315500	Traditional laboratory environment
1315500	1317500	Some restrictions given
1317500	1318500	OK
1318500	1319500	Come here
1319500	1321500	Everyone agrees that there are actually quite a lot of restrictions
1324500	1325500	Then I
1325500	1326500	What I want to say is
1326500	1327500	Then we
1327500	1329500	In our laboratory
1329500	1331500	How do we try to go
1331500	1333500	Uh, extend to solve
1333500	1335500	Such a barrier
1336500	1337500	Uh, what I want to say first is
1337500	1340500	Music can be a good research tool
1340500	1342500	It can be a research tool
1342500	1343500	As a
1343500	1346500	Uh, to help study human mind activities
1346500	1347500	And neural reactions
1347500	1348500	He
1348500	1351500	Uh, there are some very good ways
1351500	1353500	For example, I can keep
1353500	1355500	There is a good experimental situation
1355500	1357500	For example, today I
1357500	1359500	For example, look at this A picture on the far left
1359500	1361500	I can ask the subject
1361500	1362500	Ask someone to come in
1362500	1363500	Then I'll give him a beater
1363500	1365500	I asked him
1365500	1367500	Press the key of the piano
1367500	1369500	Then the speed of pressing is exactly the same as the beater
1369500	1370500	Then this is a
1370500	1372500	A good control experiment
1372500	1373500	Then I can put this
1373500	1375500	The conditions I control are getting more and more relaxed
1375500	1376500	For example
1376500	1377500	I can ask
1377500	1378500	The computer generates a beater
1378500	1380500	But this beater is
1380500	1382500	At the speed of your pressing keys
1382500	1383500	Then he will go
1383500	1384500	Follow your speed
1384500	1386500	To change his own rhythm
1386500	1387500	Or you can say
1387500	1389500	Let two people play together
1389500	1390500	Multiple people play
1390500	1392500	Even in the case of multiple people playing
1392500	1394500	You and the audience are listening at the same time
1394500	1395500	That
1395500	1397500	Moving more and more to the right of the score
1397500	1400500	That's what we call ecological interaction
1400500	1401500	Interaction
1401500	1402500	Ecological validity
1402500	1404500	That is to say, what you are studying
1404500	1405500	Is
1405500	1406500	Can correspond to human
1406500	1408500	In the case of real life
1408500	1409500	The more right-handed
1409500	1410500	That's what we think
1410500	1412500	More like real life
1412500	1413500	Because when you play music
1413500	1414500	You will also have an audience listening
1414500	1415500	This can be understood
1415500	1417500	But on the right side of the score
1417500	1418500	In fact, your experimental control
1418500	1419500	It's getting worse and worse
1419500	1420500	So for example
1420500	1421500	When a group of people play music
1421500	1422500	If they decide together
1422500	1424500	To speed up or slow down
1424500	1425500	What do you want
1425500	1426500	This is not your experiment
1426500	1428500	Things that can be decided in advance
1428500	1430500	The information you get in the end
1430500	1432500	It will be difficult for you to explain
1432500	1435500	That music can be a good tool
1435500	1436500	Just because he can
1436500	1439500	Get some kind of balance in the middle
1439500	1441500	For example, when the two of them interact
1441500	1443500	They may not be random
1443500	1445500	Play the music they want
1445500	1447500	I can give him a score
1447500	1449500	Ask them to play according to the score
1449500	1450500	And if they have
1450500	1452500	If they play the wrong note
1452500	1453500	In fact, we can
1453500	1454500	From the recording afterwards
1454500	1456500	To find out about this
1456500	1457500	So we can know
1457500	1458500	What did he do wrong
1458500	1459500	I can also know
1459500	1460500	What is the correct answer
1460500	1461500	And we can set
1461500	1462500	That is to say
1462500	1463500	What is the rhythm he wants to play
1463500	1465500	So we still have some control
1465500	1467500	But even under these conditions
1467500	1469500	Their activities
1469500	1470500	Still very
1470500	1472500	An activity that is very close to human behavior
1472500	1473500	So we think music
1473500	1475500	Can be a good tool
1475500	1477500	To study human interaction
1478500	1480500	But there is also auditory communication
1480500	1482500	And it can balance
1482500	1484500	Experimental control and ecological efficiency
1484500	1487500	These two big problems
1487500	1490500	And another advantage of music is
1490500	1493500	You said music is a good research tool
1493500	1494500	The reason is
1494500	1496500	It sounds like it's because he can be
1496500	1498500	That is, he can have this
1498500	1500500	From experimental control
1500500	1502500	To ecological interaction
1502500	1503500	The whole spectrum
1503500	1504500	But then you think
1504500	1505500	What research tool
1506500	1507500	Um
1508500	1509500	How to research
1509500	1511500	Is there no such thing as language?
1511500	1513500	Language, can you
1513500	1516500	Yeah, so I think I don't really understand
1516500	1517500	That's why he's a special
1517500	1518500	Good research tool
1518500	1519500	I didn't say he was particularly good
1519500	1521500	I said he could be a good research tool
1521500	1522500	OK, good
1522500	1524500	So I understood this time
1524500	1525500	What you mean is
1525500	1527500	He can span the whole spectrum
1527500	1529500	He can span the whole spectrum
1529500	1531500	Language is of course
1531500	1533500	You can communicate with the computer
1533500	1534500	Language communication
1534500	1535500	Or the language between people
1535500	1536500	Communicate with others
1536500	1538500	Yes, language is also a good research tool
1539500	1540500	My language is on
1540500	1541500	There is a difficulty in neuroscience
1541500	1542500	Because when you want to talk
1542500	1544500	Mouth to move
1544500	1545500	And then actually
1545500	1548500	It's a bit difficult to measure signals
1548500	1549500	Of course, this is an externalization
1549500	1551500	But I think language is also a
1551500	1553500	It's still a good tool
1553500	1554500	I understand
1554500	1555500	I understand
1555500	1556500	I didn't say music is the best
1556500	1557500	He is one of them
1557500	1558500	And then
1558500	1560500	And another advantage of music is
1560500	1562500	He is a special one
1562500	1563500	A special activity
1563500	1565500	But in fact, in each culture
1565500	1567500	There are music activities
1567500	1568500	And humans actually spend
1568500	1570500	Spend a lot of resources
1570500	1571500	In music activities
1571500	1572500	A lot of time and resources
1572500	1573500	In music activities
1573500	1575500	So we think
1575500	1576500	Research on music activities
1576500	1578500	In fact, it can also be
1578500	1579500	He is a reflection of a human being
1579500	1581500	A very basic behavior
1581500	1582500	With a capability
1584500	1585500	OK
1585500	1586500	So
1587500	1589500	So you say music is a good research tool
1589500	1591500	It means
1591500	1593500	For example, you want to measure his brain
1593500	1594500	How does the brain work
1594500	1596500	You just play music for them
1596500	1597500	Is it similar to this
1597500	1599500	Is this a research method
1599500	1600500	Play music for them
1600500	1601500	Or let them
1601500	1603500	Let them play music
1603500	1604500	So that means
1604500	1605500	You can have a
1605500	1606500	A spectrum
1606500	1608500	You can go from the far left
1608500	1609500	Play music for them
1609500	1611500	I have already designed this music in advance
1611500	1613500	All the way to the far right
1613500	1614500	For example, you can
1614500	1615500	Interact with the music
1615500	1617500	For example, singing karaoke
1617500	1618500	Or if there is no music
1618500	1620500	Two people play music with each other
1621500	1622500	OK
1623500	1624500	Everyone has a question
1624500	1625500	OK
1625500	1626500	I have a simple question
1627500	1628500	It's like this
1628500	1629500	Because it's said here
1629500	1630500	We may start from here
1630500	1631500	More and more
1631500	1632500	More and more
1632500	1633500	About music as a
1633500	1634500	Research tool
1634500	1635500	So I want to clarify
1635500	1637500	A simple question
1637500	1638500	What we are discussing now is
1638500	1640500	Sound is a good research tool
1640500	1642500	Or music is a
1642500	1643500	A specific
1643500	1645500	There is a clear subset
1645500	1647500	In the sound
1647500	1648500	Or are we discussing
1648500	1650500	Sound as a research tool
1653500	1655500	I would say it's music
1655500	1657500	Because
1658500	1660500	If I talk about sound
1660500	1661500	It's just a definition
1661500	1662500	Because
1662500	1664500	Because sound
1670500	1672500	Can you repeat your question?
1673500	1675500	Yes, so my question is actually
1676500	1677500	You are talking about music
1677500	1679500	A good research tool
1679500	1680500	What kind of sound
1680500	1681500	Don't you think it's
1681500	1682500	You want to use it as
1682500	1684500	The definition of music
1684500	1685500	Research tool
1685500	1686500	I understand
1687500	1688500	Yes
1689500	1691500	I forgot to say before
1691500	1692500	In fact, in traditional research
1692500	1694500	In terms of listening
1694500	1696500	We will use computer synthesis
1696500	1698500	That's a very
1698500	1699500	It's like you pick up the phone
1699500	1701500	To hear that kind of sound
1701500	1702500	Or more than that
1702500	1704500	A lot of noise
1704500	1705500	These things
1705500	1706500	We all know
1706500	1708500	Basic listening
1708500	1710500	Materials used
1710500	1711500	But in general
1711500	1712500	We don't use
1712500	1713500	That kind of material
1713500	1714500	And then we
1714500	1715500	And
1715500	1716500	In addition
1716500	1718500	When we study listening
1718500	1719500	Often we will present
1719500	1721500	A completely unchanging sound
1721500	1722500	A complete array
1722500	1724500	For example, show it for one second
1724500	1725500	But in the natural world
1725500	1726500	All the sounds
1726500	1727500	It's probably the first time
1727500	1728500	It's gone
1728500	1730500	It won't have the same stimulus
1730500	1731500	Repeat repeat
1732500	1733500	And music
1733500	1735500	It has another component
1735500	1736500	That is, it has
1736500	1738500	More social interaction
1738500	1740500	It's not just about making sounds
1740500	1742500	It's not just about making
1742500	1744500	I'm going to knock on the table today
1744500	1745500	Make a sound
1745500	1746500	Instead, people will
1746500	1747500	According to your voice
1747500	1749500	And then he has a response
1749500	1751500	And then he makes a new action
1756500	1758500	Does that answer the question?
1758500	1759500	Yes yes
1760500	1761500	Yes yes
1761500	1762500	Thank you
1762500	1763500	OK OK
1763500	1764500	OK
1766500	1768500	Everyone's questions are very good
1768500	1769500	That
1769500	1770500	In our study
1770500	1771500	The example is
1771500	1772500	We want to understand
1772500	1774500	Play with music
1774500	1776500	As an example of a model
1776500	1778500	Is a model of social interaction
1778500	1780500	How do we measure cooperation
1780500	1781500	And then we have to understand
1781500	1783500	Is the relationship between the leader and the follower
1783500	1784500	And then we have to
1784500	1786500	What direction to go
1786500	1788500	To do this research
1788500	1789500	Ah this photo
1789500	1790500	Is a photo of our lab
1790500	1791500	Then I just found
1791500	1793500	We have a short film before the lab
1793500	1794500	OK
1794500	1795500	Show it to everyone
1795500	1797500	I hope everyone can hear the sound
1797500	1800500	Uh, there's a two and a half minute introduction
1818500	1819500	String quartet
1819500	1822500	Is just as exciting and challenging
1822500	1824500	Canadian cellist Adrian Fung
1824500	1826500	And his colleagues are fitted with
1826500	1829500	Specially designed caps and sensors
1829500	1831500	You put them in front of your shirt
1831500	1832500	And wired to monitors
1832500	1835500	That measure their brain activity and heart rate
1835500	1836500	Motion capture cameras
1836500	1838500	Record their movements too
1838500	1840500	Researchers are studying
1840500	1842500	How the musicians communicate with each other
1842500	1844500	During a performance
1844500	1846500	Without using a single word
1846500	1847500	How do they use movements
1847500	1849500	What gestures do the musicians make
1849500	1851500	That make it possible for them
1851500	1853500	To communicate with each other
1855500	1858500	And to communicate with members of the audience
1858500	1860500	They're all wired up too
1860500	1862500	To study how they respond
1862500	1864500	Physically and emotionally
1864500	1866500	To the performers on stage
1866500	1867500	What's great about this
1867500	1869500	Is it affords us the ability
1869500	1871500	To see how effective we are as communicators
1871500	1874500	The theatre is state-of-the-art technology
1874500	1876500	Including a sound system
1876500	1878500	With incredible acoustics
1878500	1880500	Here with just a tap on a tablet
1880500	1883500	I'll make it extremely reverberant in here
1883500	1885500	Sort of like a cathedral
1889500	1891500	The room is transformed
1891500	1893500	A cool feature that serves
1893500	1895500	A wider, more scientific purpose
1895500	1897500	One that could help researchers
1897500	1899500	Design a better hearing aid
1899500	1900500	For the hearing impaired
1900500	1902500	So, ratting
1902500	1903500	Ratting
1903500	1905500	Background noise is coming out of all the speakers
1905500	1907500	It's a multi-channel surround mix
1907500	1909500	And then we can test how well
1909500	1911500	Does a person with a hearing aid
1911500	1913500	Comprehend speech
1913500	1914500	That's presented to them
1914500	1916500	In an environment like this
1916500	1918500	Instead of in the quiet room
1920500	1921500	But for now
1921500	1923500	Most of the research is focused on music
1923500	1925500	And its therapeutic powers
1925500	1927500	Researchers hope their findings
1927500	1929500	Will uncover how some rhythms
1930500	1932500	Might help an autistic child
1932500	1934500	Or why a musical beat
1934500	1936500	Can improve the gait of a patient
1936500	1938500	With Parkinson's disease
1938500	1940500	In order to understand
1940500	1942500	What's going on in the brain
1942500	1944500	We need to know how it's done
1944500	1945500	In typical populations
1945500	1947500	Once we understand that
1947500	1949500	And we know that music
1949500	1951500	Can help people with Parkinson's
1951500	1953500	Or we know that music has an effect
1953500	1955500	On children with autism
1955500	1957500	We can start to understand
1957500	1959500	The deep reasons for that
1959500	1961500	We can perfect the therapies
1961500	1963500	That we give these people
1963500	1965500	And add to mounting evidence
1965500	1967500	That music is good medicine
1967500	1969500	For the brain
1969500	1971500	Cass Roossey, CBC News, Toronto
1975500	1977500	Can everyone hear the sound
1977500	1979500	From the video?
1981500	1983500	Yes, we can
1984500	1986500	We are lucky
1986500	1988500	Our lab
1988500	1990500	Has built a music room
1990500	1992500	With the same size
1992500	1994500	With a stage
1994500	1996500	And a seat for the audience
1996500	1998500	And those can be adjusted
1998500	2000500	So in general
2000500	2002500	Just like just now
2002500	2004500	Sorry, I don't know who asked
2004500	2006500	In general
2006500	2008500	We can't control a lot of environmental factors
2008500	2010500	But in this case
2010500	2012500	We can let a large space
2012500	2014500	To be controlled
2014500	2016500	And in this space
2016500	2018500	We can do some precise measurements
2018500	2020500	And experiments
2020500	2022500	So our lab
2022500	2024500	Can solve the trade-off
2024500	2026500	Between experimental control
2026500	2028500	And eco-efficient
2028500	2030500	A little bit
2030500	2032500	So this research
2032500	2034500	Is done in this situation
2034500	2036500	And you can see
2036500	2038500	The situation of this bottle
2038500	2040500	You can see
2040500	2042500	There is a ball
2042500	2044500	It is a motion capture marker
2044500	2046500	We can use the camera
2046500	2048500	To capture the red light
2048500	2050500	And we can build
2050500	2052500	The body movement
2052500	2054500	And the time
2054500	2056500	And the location
2056500	2058500	So when we measure
2058500	2060500	The image will look like this
2062500	2064500	It is a 3D image
2064500	2066500	It is the body movement
2066500	2068500	It is the shoulder
2068500	2070500	It is the right arm
2070500	2072500	And the head
2072500	2074500	So our research is
2074500	2076500	Can we use
2076500	2078500	The easiest index
2078500	2080500	Like the body movement
2080500	2082500	To understand
2082500	2084500	The human interaction
2084500	2086500	And the leader
2086500	2088500	And the follower
2088500	2090500	We want to start
2090500	2092500	From the easiest
2092500	2094500	And the simplest
2094500	2096500	So there are some questions
2096500	2098500	If we want to do anything
2098500	2100500	We do something
2100500	2102500	The body must have a lot of movements
2102500	2104500	Like playing music
2104500	2106500	We can start from the simple
2106500	2108500	For example
2108500	2110500	If I play the piano
2110500	2112500	I can study the simple movements
2112500	2114500	Like the time
2114500	2116500	The difference between the time
2116500	2118500	And the person
2118500	2120500	We can see
2120500	2122500	The difference between the time
2122500	2124500	And the person
2124500	2126500	But there is a big problem
2126500	2128500	When we do this research
2128500	2130500	The time of each player
2130500	2132500	The time of each player
2132500	2134500	The time of each player
2134500	2136500	Is affected by the music
2136500	2138500	And the music
2138500	2140500	And the music
2140500	2142500	So even if we measure
2142500	2144500	The result
2144500	2146500	We can only see
2146500	2148500	The music
2148500	2150500	And the performance
2150500	2152500	And the performance
2152500	2154500	We can't measure the actual
2154500	2156500	Interaction
2156500	2158500	This is a limitation
2158500	2160500	Another interesting signal
2160500	2162500	We can measure
2162500	2164500	The whole body movement
2164500	2166500	For example
2166500	2168500	The body movement
2168500	2170500	Is not only in the music
2170500	2172500	But also in the daily conversation
2172500	2174500	If you measure
2174500	2176500	The body movement
2176500	2178500	The body movement
2178500	2180500	The index
2180500	2182500	Is the addition of the whole body movement
2182500	2184500	For example
2184500	2186500	If I raise my arm
2186500	2188500	My body needs to lean back
2188500	2190500	To balance the center
2190500	2192500	Otherwise you will fall
2192500	2194500	Another interesting thing
2194500	2196500	The music itself
2196500	2198500	Doesn't require you to move your body
2198500	2200500	When you talk
2200500	2202500	But people will naturally do this
2202500	2204500	So it's not limited to the music
2204500	2206500	It's not limited to
2206500	2208500	What you do
2208500	2210500	It's not limited to
2210500	2212500	What you say
2212500	2214500	It's something that happens naturally
2214500	2216500	So it may reflect
2216500	2218500	A psychological process
2218500	2220500	We think it can be a good index
2220500	2222500	So
2222500	2224500	The first problem is
2224500	2226500	We decide to measure
2226500	2228500	The whole signal
2228500	2230500	Don't just measure the finger
2230500	2232500	The other problem is
2232500	2234500	We know what to measure
2234500	2236500	How do we use
2236500	2238500	Traditionally
2238500	2240500	We get this time series signal
2240500	2242500	We can see the relationship
2242500	2244500	Between the two signals
2244500	2246500	We call it cross correlation
2246500	2248500	A big limitation of cross correlation
2248500	2250500	Is that it can only tell you
2250500	2252500	How similar the two signals are
2252500	2254500	But if today
2254500	2256500	In the case of interaction
2256500	2258500	Usually there will be a leader
2258500	2260500	For example, four people move chairs together
2260500	2262500	There must be a person shouting slogans
2262500	2264500	Now 321 everyone moves together
2264500	2266500	So if we want to know
2266500	2268500	Social interaction
2268500	2270500	The direction of social interaction is also important
2270500	2272500	But cross correlation analysis
2272500	2274500	Can't tell you the result
2274500	2276500	The other analysis is
2276500	2278500	Granger causality
2278500	2280500	Granger causality
2280500	2282500	It was originally invented by economists
2282500	2284500	A mathematical method
2284500	2286500	It mainly reflects
2286500	2288500	A time series signal
2288500	2290500	To what extent
2290500	2292500	To predict
2292500	2294500	A time series signal
2294500	2296500	If it can predict
2296500	2298500	We can say
2298500	2300500	The first time series
2300500	2302500	It can affect time series B
2302500	2304500	But it doesn't matter
2304500	2306500	There are many
2306500	2308500	Methodological disputes
2308500	2310500	But we have to say
2310500	2312500	We can measure
2312500	2314500	How much of the first series
2314500	2316500	Can predict the second series
2316500	2318500	We can
2318500	2320500	Reflect the direction of message transmission
2320500	2322500	So we think
2322500	2324500	Granger causality is more than traditional
2324500	2326500	Related measurement
2326500	2328500	Is to provide more human
2328500	2330500	Interaction
2330500	2332500	So now we know what to measure
2332500	2334500	Then we know
2334500	2336500	How to analyze
2336500	2338500	The third question is what they want to do
2338500	2340500	We just play music
2340500	2342500	If so
2342500	2344500	We just observe
2344500	2346500	Scientific research
2346500	2348500	We need to separate
2348500	2350500	What we are interested in
2350500	2352500	And what we naturally observe
2352500	2354500	We need to know
2354500	2356500	Will it affect our observation
2356500	2358500	This is to understand
2358500	2360500	What we are interested in
2360500	2362500	So on the stage
2362500	2364500	They will do
2364500	2366500	This is just a summary
2366500	2368500	It will have front and back movements
2368500	2370500	We have to measure this
2370500	2372500	Then we want it to play
2372500	2374500	Bach's Hymn
2374500	2376500	And while playing
2376500	2378500	We did one thing
2378500	2380500	It's a little different from normal music
2380500	2382500	We will randomly point
2382500	2384500	One of the people as the leader
2384500	2386500	Usually in the case of music
2386500	2388500	For example, rock band
2388500	2390500	The lead singer is usually the leader
2390500	2392500	Everyone has to follow the speed of the lead singer
2392500	2394500	Follow the volume of the lead singer
2394500	2396500	To make adjustments
2396500	2398500	It's the same in the case of music
2398500	2400500	Usually the first violin is the leader
2400500	2402500	But in Bach's Hymn
2402500	2404500	The advantage of this piece is
2404500	2406500	The relationship between the leader and the follower
2406500	2408500	So when we do experiments
2408500	2410500	We tell them in addition
2410500	2412500	For example
2412500	2414500	We only play the violin today
2414500	2416500	For example, the third row
2416500	2418500	You are the leader today
2418500	2420500	You are going to lead the other three people
2420500	2422500	To play this music
2422500	2424500	And while we are playing this music
2424500	2426500	In order to
2426500	2428500	Close to natural interaction
2428500	2430500	So they play this music
2430500	2432500	They have never rehearsed before
2432500	2434500	This is the first time I saw this score
2434500	2436500	Then they played for the first time
2436500	2438500	Then ask them to interact
2438500	2440500	And we
2440500	2442500	When we point out who is the leader
2442500	2444500	We also give him a note
2444500	2446500	Everyone can only see their own role
2446500	2448500	If you are the leader, of course you know you are the leader
2448500	2450500	But if you are a follower
2450500	2452500	Then you can only know that one of them is the leader
2452500	2454500	Then I have to try to find
2454500	2456500	Who is the leader and then I have to follow him
2456500	2458500	It's a bit like a guessing game
2458500	2460500	OK
2460500	2462500	This is the part of our experiment
2462500	2464500	We experiment on the society
2464500	2466500	Who is the leader
2466500	2468500	Who is the follower
2468500	2470500	Then we hope
2470500	2472500	If our measurement is effective
2472500	2474500	It should be able to reflect
2474500	2476500	We follow the leader
2476500	2478500	A relationship of such manipulation
2478500	2480500	It should be able to reflect our experimental manipulation
2480500	2482500	OK
2482500	2484500	So the information we get is like this
2484500	2486500	Their body movements
2486500	2488500	Then for example, the relationship between the first step of the violin and the second step of the violin
2488500	2490500	Then according to the measure
2490500	2492500	That is to say
2492500	2494500	The first violin
2494500	2496500	How much to predict the second violin
2496500	2498500	This body movement
2498500	2500500	Then in the case of the four-axis
2500500	2502500	We have 12
2502500	2504500	The direction of possible message transmission
2504500	2506500	This is the direction of all message transmission
2506500	2508500	Then
2508500	2510500	Through our experimental manipulation
2510500	2512500	For example, we are in a piece of music
2512500	2514500	We call the first violin
2514500	2516500	It says V1 on it
2516500	2518500	Then
2518500	2520500	So the direction of these three messages
2520500	2522500	It will be the relationship between the leader and the follower
2522500	2524500	The opposite direction is
2524500	2526500	The relationship between the follower and the leader
2526500	2528500	Then the rest of the direction
2528500	2530500	Is the relationship between the follower and the follower
2530500	2532500	OK
2532500	2534500	Then I just use English to put it
2534500	2536500	Leader follower follower
2536500	2538500	So that means we
2538500	2540500	Through the manipulation of this experiment
2540500	2542500	Everyone of us
2542500	2544500	Interactive relationship between them
2544500	2546500	Different situations
2546500	2548500	Then if we are in the next situation
2548500	2550500	For example, if the second violin is the leader
2550500	2552500	Then all the colors of these arrows
2552500	2554500	Will exchange
2554500	2556500	Will exchange
2556500	2558500	Is there a problem here?
2558500	2560500	This is the more complicated part of the experimental manipulation
2562500	2564500	I want to ask
2564500	2566500	You just said that
2566500	2568500	What is the tune of the performance
2568500	2570500	I don't know about music, but what is it?
2570500	2572500	That means
2572500	2574500	Does it already exist in this world?
2574500	2576500	That's right
2576500	2578500	We let him find something to do
2578500	2580500	Will it be like this?
2580500	2582500	For example, these four people
2582500	2584500	Someone in particular
2584500	2586500	I've known this song for a long time
2586500	2588500	Then it will affect the results of the study
2588500	2590500	This is a good question
2590500	2592500	So we are special
2592500	2594500	Special is that we have confirmed with the musicians
2594500	2596500	They haven't played these songs
2596500	2598500	It's the first time
2598500	2600500	Then these musicians
2600500	2602500	We are looking for more professional musicians
2602500	2604500	So they got these songs for the first time
2604500	2606500	They can start cooperating right away
2606500	2608500	OK, thank you
2608500	2610500	This is a good question
2610500	2612500	This reviewer also asked
2614500	2616500	Then the next thing is
2616500	2618500	Get the result of our experiment
2618500	2620500	The three points on the X-axis are different situations
2620500	2622500	Then the Y-axis is
2622500	2624500	The strength of Grand Jack Casualty
2624500	2626500	The higher the Y-axis
2626500	2628500	The higher the Y value
2628500	2630500	The stronger the transmission in this direction
2630500	2632500	Then this is the result of the experiment
2632500	2634500	You can see it
2634500	2636500	You can see it from here
2636500	2638500	From the leader to the follower
2638500	2640500	Their information
2640500	2642500	The amount of transmission is the highest
2642500	2644500	It's the highest compared to other situations
2644500	2646500	OK, this is a
2646500	2648500	The statistics show that
2648500	2650500	And then we have another one
2650500	2652500	The manipulation is to say that they are playing
2652500	2654500	Can you see other people
2654500	2656500	We found that
2656500	2658500	This effect is relatively strong
2658500	2660500	But even if you can't see it
2660500	2662500	Even if it's just playing music
2662500	2664500	There is no visual information
2664500	2666500	You don't know what other people are doing
2666500	2668500	You see what other people are doing
2668500	2670500	You still have this effect
2670500	2672500	OK
2672500	2674500	This is our main finding of the experiment
2674500	2676500	Basically it means
2676500	2678500	The overall action can reflect the direction of information transmission
2678500	2680500	Then see the other person
2680500	2682500	Will this
2682500	2684500	This communication is helpful
2684500	2686500	OK
2686500	2688500	This is the first result
2688500	2690500	The second result is
2690500	2692500	Sorry, you say
2694500	2696500	I see your
2696500	2698500	Non-seeing condition
2698500	2700500	I can't speak Chinese
2700500	2702500	Follower
2702500	2704500	This is the difference between FL and FF
2704500	2706500	There is a difference in dark gray
2706500	2708500	Is there any difference in light gray?
2708500	2710500	No
2710500	2712500	Oh
2712500	2714500	This is quite interesting
2714500	2716500	This means
2716500	2718500	Leader actually ignores
2718500	2720500	Not affected by Follower
2720500	2722500	Relative to the relationship between Follower and Follower
2722500	2724500	That's what it means
2724500	2726500	And this is only in non-seeing
2726500	2728500	Follower and Follower
2728500	2730500	Need to coordinate with each other
2730500	2732500	But the leader doesn't need to adapt to Follower
2732500	2734500	It will look like this
2734500	2736500	But this is only
2736500	2738500	In non-seeing
2738500	2740500	An obvious effect
2740500	2742500	The experience of non-seeing
2742500	2744500	Maybe
2744500	2746500	Make some noise
2746500	2748500	Make it more difficult
2748500	2750500	Not to be affected by Follower
2750500	2752500	Of course this needs to be replicated
2752500	2754500	This is a small difference
2754500	2756500	Or did you analyze the interaction?
2756500	2758500	Did you find it
2758500	2760500	Sorry
2760500	2762500	Your
2762500	2764500	There is no difference between the two white bars
2764500	2766500	There is a difference between the two dark gray bars
2766500	2768500	Is there any difference in this difference?
2768500	2770500	No
2770500	2772500	I looked at all the interactions
2772500	2774500	OK
2774500	2776500	Thank you
2776500	2778500	You're welcome
2778500	2780500	We actually replicated this thing
2780500	2782500	But you just said
2782500	2784500	The difference between the two dark gray bars
2784500	2786500	The difference between the two dark gray bars
2786500	2788500	Actually did not appear in the replication
2788500	2790500	So
2790500	2792500	So
2792500	2794500	We didn't explain too much on paper
2794500	2796500	What is the reason
2796500	2798500	Not very clear
2798500	2800500	But basically it can be found
2800500	2802500	The body movement can reflect the direction of information transmission
2802500	2804500	Reflect the direction of information transmission
2804500	2806500	But I don't think this is very interesting
2806500	2808500	Because
2808500	2810500	What does this have to do with playing music?
2810500	2812500	Just a bunch of people moving around in the studio
2812500	2814500	Who moves first
2814500	2816500	Then we
2816500	2818500	In fact, after they play every song
2818500	2820500	We ask musicians to use a scale
2820500	2822500	To evaluate how well you feel
2822500	2824500	Then
2824500	2826500	We asked him to evaluate three items
2826500	2828500	What is the overall quality of the performance?
2828500	2830500	1 to 5 points
2830500	2832500	Then the synchronization of time
2832500	2834500	Is it very synchronized?
2834500	2836500	Then the difficulty of the cooperation
2836500	2838500	Is there a difference?
2838500	2840500	Then we go to them
2840500	2842500	The amount of Granger Casualty
2842500	2844500	To do
2844500	2846500	Then we found
2846500	2848500	This X axis is
2848500	2850500	For example, here is very good
2850500	2852500	The far right is very good
2852500	2854500	Then the Y axis is
2854500	2856500	Basically
2856500	2858500	The overall amount of information exchange
2858500	2860500	Then we found
2860500	2862500	In fact, the quality of this performance
2862500	2864500	With causal density
2864500	2866500	With the amount of information exchange
2866500	2868500	The coupling of body movements
2868500	2870500	Is related
2870500	2872500	Then there is also some correlation with the synchronization of time
2872500	2874500	But in my second time
2874500	2876500	Replication
2876500	2878500	Only the overall quality of the performance is related
2878500	2880500	So that is
2880500	2882500	The amount of information transfer
2882500	2884500	This body movement
2884500	2886500	Not only reflects the direction of information transfer
2886500	2888500	Then the amount of information transfer
2888500	2890500	It seems to be with the quality of cooperation
2890500	2892500	Can reflect their quality of cooperation
2892500	2894500	So that is
2894500	2896500	Summarize what we learned
2896500	2898500	That is to say
2898500	2900500	Learned in a multi-person cooperation environment
2900500	2902500	Can be observed from the body movement
2902500	2904500	Direction of information transfer
2904500	2906500	Then even if this is a
2906500	2908500	Listening and action-based homework
2908500	2910500	But can you visually see the other person
2910500	2912500	It seems to be a very important communication channel
2912500	2914500	Then the overall action
2914500	2916500	Information flow
2916500	2918500	By measuring the body movement
2918500	2920500	The amount of information activity can reflect the quality of cooperation
2920500	2922500	Then
2922500	2924500	In fact, these three points
2924500	2926500	For everyone
2926500	2928500	In fact, if you don't do research, you will probably get this result
2928500	2930500	Then we think the biggest value
2930500	2932500	That is to say, we actually provide
2932500	2934500	A very low-threshold research method
2934500	2936500	As long as you don't have to be in our
2936500	2938500	Such a laboratory for observation
2938500	2940500	You can observe in any natural situation
2940500	2942500	You can use imaging analysis
2942500	2944500	To observe their
2944500	2946500	Physical actions between people
2946500	2948500	You may be able to observe in a natural situation
2948500	2950500	The group behavior between people
2950500	2952500	We are just in a better and more precise
2952500	2954500	Under the control of the laboratory
2954500	2956500	Prove that this effect should exist
2956500	2958500	Should be an effective index
2958500	2960500	Then I think that is
2960500	2962500	Provided may follow-up researchers
2962500	2964500	If you want to study complex social behavior
2964500	2966500	At least
2966500	2968500	He may now have a tool
2968500	2970500	I have a question
2970500	2972500	Sorry
2972500	2974500	You said
2974500	2976500	I don't understand the second point
2976500	2978500	The third point is the second point
2978500	2980500	I thought the result was
2980500	2982500	If they are facing each other
2982500	2984500	So in the absence of
2984500	2986500	This result is still the same
2986500	2988500	Still have
2988500	2990500	But its effect is weaker
2990500	2992500	Then
2992500	2994500	There is a main effect
2994500	2996500	Simple main effect
2996500	2998500	Leader to follower
2998500	3000500	Leader to follower
3000500	3002500	In this direction
3002500	3004500	See each other
3004500	3006500	Much better than not seeing each other
3006500	3008500	But
3008500	3010500	In fact, both sides are still effective
3010500	3012500	So this is my
3012500	3014500	The third question is
3014500	3016500	What is the direction of causal relationship?
3016500	3018500	For example
3018500	3020500	This
3020500	3022500	This communication channel is because of
3022500	3024500	Communication on music
3024500	3026500	Caused your body to move like this
3026500	3028500	Following
3028500	3030500	Or your body moves like this
3030500	3032500	Caused the progress of music
3032500	3034500	Because if
3034500	3036500	If you can't see your body now
3036500	3038500	Body sway or follow each other
3038500	3040500	It means that it is not visual communication at all
3040500	3042500	Is hearing
3042500	3044500	Or the essence of music
3044500	3046500	Caused by
3046500	3048500	Natural body reaction
3048500	3050500	Is a real cause
3050500	3052500	I didn't say it was a cause
3052500	3054500	I just said it was a reaction
3054500	3056500	Indicator
3056500	3058500	I said it was
3058500	3060500	When we play music
3060500	3062500	Actually don't need
3062500	3064500	Body to do this action
3064500	3066500	But we still do
3066500	3068500	Then this information seems to reflect
3068500	3070500	Direction of information transmission
3070500	3072500	And the quality of its cooperation
3072500	3074500	So you don't think
3074500	3076500	It is functional
3076500	3078500	It's just a indicator
3078500	3080500	It's just a indicator that you can measure
3080500	3082500	I'm conservative
3082500	3084500	I'm conservative
3084500	3086500	I don't know
3086500	3088500	I can't prove it yet
3088500	3090500	There are other studies
3090500	3092500	Some people are
3092500	3094500	Block the whole person
3094500	3096500	Then measure their time
3096500	3098500	The time difference between each other's buttons
3098500	3100500	It is true that the time difference between the buttons
3100500	3102500	Will affect
3102500	3104500	But I think
3104500	3106500	The conclusion is
3106500	3108500	My current research
3108500	3110500	My current results can only say
3110500	3112500	It can be reflected
3112500	3114500	Maybe it's just a related indicator
3114500	3116500	But its function
3116500	3118500	Is it part of the communication itself
3118500	3120500	Is it that I want to see other people's body movements
3120500	3122500	Or part of it
3122500	3124500	I don't know about this
3124500	3126500	Because like you said
3126500	3128500	Even if you can't see it, the body movements have this effect
3128500	3130500	Understand
3130500	3132500	I have another question with Zhang Ting
3132500	3134500	I have another question with Zhang Ting
3134500	3136500	But it's not directly
3136500	3138500	About your research itself
3138500	3140500	But we want something very interesting from your research
3140500	3142500	If we
3142500	3144500	This Baja
3144500	3146500	Because you just emphasized
3146500	3148500	Its four characters are actually relative
3148500	3150500	What is that called
3150500	3152500	Responsibility is more average
3152500	3154500	So you can randomly assign who you are
3154500	3156500	But if we change it to jazz four beats
3156500	3158500	That kind of character is very strong
3158500	3160500	You expect
3160500	3162500	The effect size will become very strong
3162500	3164500	Or will they break down
3164500	3166500	Because they don't know who they are
3166500	3168500	Suppose you don't assign
3168500	3170500	I know
3170500	3172500	This is our experiment 2
3172500	3174500	Actually we
3174500	3176500	We also did it
3176500	3178500	I didn't post it today, but this is experiment 2
3178500	3180500	In the case of experiment 2
3180500	3182500	We don't have that kind of jazz four beats
3182500	3184500	We want them to play
3184500	3186500	Mozart's music
3186500	3188500	Mozart's music
3188500	3190500	If you look at the score
3190500	3192500	All the melodies are in the first minor
3192500	3194500	The other parts are just beats
3194500	3196500	But we still do exactly the same
3196500	3198500	Even if we say the cello is just beat
3198500	3200500	You still have to lead the cello
3200500	3202500	To play his music
3202500	3204500	So this is basically the same as you think
3204500	3206500	The result is
3206500	3208500	I go back to the previous slide
3208500	3210500	This is what I just said
3210500	3212500	Replication
3212500	3214500	There are still three lines above
3214500	3216500	The following three lines are gone
3218500	3220500	So we are in a task
3220500	3222500	Is an unbalanced starting point
3222500	3224500	We do manipulation
3224500	3226500	Still see the above effects
3226500	3228500	But he is actually weak overall
3228500	3230500	Then we measure
3230500	3232500	That is to say
3232500	3234500	In the case of bassline
3234500	3236500	Is the strength of the grunge causality between each other
3236500	3238500	How much
3238500	3240500	We found that in the case of playing Mozart's music
3240500	3242500	The bassline is more uneven
3242500	3244500	In the case of playing Bach
3244500	3246500	The bassline is average
3246500	3248500	This is the effect of this bassline
3248500	3250500	This effect
3250500	3252500	It actually shows that this is functional
3252500	3254500	Because you are in the case of non-sync
3254500	3256500	When this music itself
3256500	3258500	When there is no such message
3258500	3260500	When this music itself has an obvious bias
3260500	3262500	It's hard for you to have one
3262500	3264500	For example, in the case of a cello
3264500	3266500	Without seeing your body
3266500	3268500	But
3268500	3270500	When you see
3270500	3272500	It still produces an effect
3272500	3274500	It means he is
3274500	3276500	Link
3276500	3278500	I suddenly feel like I'm talking about
3278500	3280500	Because although
3280500	3282500	But we didn't
3282500	3284500	But the music itself is also
3284500	3286500	Actually explained
3286500	3288500	Then we
3288500	3290500	I think it's a bit difficult
3290500	3292500	difficult
3292500	3294500	I think even if there is such a difference
3294500	3296500	Just say there is this possibility
3296500	3298500	But answer the question directly
3298500	3300500	For example, I tied the musician
3300500	3302500	Tied to the chair
3302500	3304500	I can't move
3304500	3306500	This is a direct manipulation
3308500	3310500	Do you agree with me
3310500	3312500	I don't know, I can't figure it out
3312500	3314500	I have to think about it
3314500	3316500	That is to say, I can't let you move today
3316500	3318500	See if the quality of your performance will be reduced
3320500	3322500	You obviously have a lot of barriers
3322500	3324500	You can't do that
3324500	3326500	I'm still thinking
3326500	3328500	The evidence just now is not enough
3328500	3330500	He seems to be able to prove
3330500	3332500	You still find this body
3332500	3334500	The reaction is related to the cause and effect
3334500	3336500	Follower
3336500	3338500	This is related to the leader
3338500	3340500	But the cause and effect of this relationship does not mean
3340500	3342500	Music performance
3342500	3344500	Cause and effect between body sway
3344500	3346500	So it's not a good evidence
3346500	3348500	Have you always been like this
3348500	3350500	I'm a little confused
3352500	3354500	I'm also confused
3354500	3356500	When we wrote the paper
3356500	3358500	In fact, different authors are thinking
3358500	3360500	Some authors argue directly
3360500	3362500	Body sway is communication
3362500	3364500	But
3364500	3366500	I don't think you have that evidence
3366500	3368500	I think the evidence is not direct
3368500	3370500	Then I'll be safe
3370500	3372500	Then discuss
3372500	3374500	But I don't know
3374500	3376500	I think there are two causal relationships
3376500	3378500	One causal relationship is the body sway of the leader
3378500	3380500	Causing the body sway of the follower
3380500	3382500	This is the analysis you are doing now
3382500	3384500	As long as the bar on your left is higher
3384500	3386500	It means that this causality exists
3386500	3388500	But
3388500	3390500	You finish first
3392500	3394500	But another causal relationship
3394500	3396500	Music communication
3396500	3398500	Causal relationship between body sway
3398500	3400500	Is body sway
3400500	3402500	Is the cause of music communication
3404500	3406500	The first point
3406500	3408500	About grunge causality
3408500	3410500	I guess many listeners may know
3410500	3412500	It is actually argued
3412500	3414500	Causality is a big problem
3414500	3416500	Mathematically
3416500	3418500	It can only say
3418500	3420500	The amount of information transfer
3422500	3424500	Is there really a cause?
3424500	3426500	There must be some other situations
3426500	3428500	For example, I have to sample
3428500	3430500	The whole universe
3430500	3432500	And you have to assume
3432500	3434500	Anyway, there are some situations
3434500	3436500	Anyway, it's conservative
3436500	3438500	Mathematically, I can only say
3438500	3440500	A predict B
3440500	3442500	Can't say A cause B
3442500	3444500	You can say causality
3444500	3446500	Because it is the difference in time
3446500	3448500	This message leads to this message
3448500	3450500	What other factors do you have in body sway
3450500	3452500	Will lead to this change
3452500	3454500	There may be a third reason for music
3454500	3456500	In short, I think
3456500	3458500	Alternative is limited
3458500	3460500	Not any possible hypothesis
3460500	3462500	These alternatives sound
3462500	3464500	Not very
3464500	3466500	Not very convincing
3466500	3468500	So I think even if it's a bit risky
3468500	3470500	You can still argue
3470500	3472500	But on the other hand
3472500	3474500	What you really care about is
3474500	3476500	Body movement response
3476500	3478500	Is this message
3478500	3480500	Is it music communication itself
3480500	3482500	Does it cause better music quality
3482500	3484500	Is it a good communication
3484500	3486500	This sound
3486500	3488500	But this seems to need other evidence
3488500	3490500	That's right
3494500	3496500	I'm conservative
3496500	3498500	I think you are conservative
3500500	3502500	My bubble is gone
3502500	3504500	So everyone is welcome to discuss freely
3504500	3506500	It doesn't matter
3506500	3508500	I would like to ask you this experiment
3508500	3510500	You are talking about this experiment now
3510500	3512500	For example, how many groups do you want to do
3512500	3514500	Is a group
3514500	3516500	Or how many musicians
3516500	3518500	There is a way to get one
3518500	3520500	Is relatively unrecognized
3520500	3522500	For example, the culture of the performer
3522500	3524500	Or the level of training of the performer
3524500	3526500	Is less disturbed by this aspect
3526500	3528500	OK, I think you asked this question very well
3528500	3530500	I think this is the weakness of this study
3530500	3532500	Because first of all
3532500	3534500	We are looking for very high-level musicians
3534500	3536500	That is, you have to pay a lot of money
3536500	3538500	The kind of concert to buy a ticket
3538500	3540500	They will come
3542500	3544500	Because of the financial restrictions
3544500	3546500	We found two groups
3546500	3548500	We found two groups
3548500	3550500	In terms of statistical methods
3550500	3552500	We think it's better to say
3552500	3554500	We are all
3554500	3556500	We call it within subject comparison
3556500	3558500	Compare yourself to yourself
3558500	3560500	That is, in the case of yourself
3560500	3562500	How much stronger is this effect
3562500	3564500	So even if
3564500	3566500	The sample we took
3566500	3568500	Is very limited, that is, two groups of musicians
3568500	3570500	A total of eight people
3570500	3572500	But within each person
3572500	3574500	Their direction of effect is consistent
3574500	3576500	Is it possible
3576500	3578500	I took some very biased samples
3578500	3580500	For example, these musicians do not represent all humans
3580500	3582500	It is possible
3582500	3584500	This is the weakness of this study
3584500	3586500	How high is this representation
3586500	3588500	I do not know
3588500	3590500	I can only say from other current studies
3590500	3592500	Musicians and normal humans
3592500	3594500	The representation is actually
3594500	3596500	It can represent
3596500	3598500	Ordinary human beings
3598500	3600500	Other cultures
3600500	3602500	This is also a matter of representation
3602500	3604500	It is also said that the representation is still OK
3604500	3606500	It is also said that the representation is still OK
3606500	3608500	It's just that I don't have direct evidence
3608500	3610500	Say this effect
3610500	3612500	Can it represent the effect of all humans
3612500	3614500	I don't know
3614500	3616500	Is it conservative
3618500	3620500	It's okay
3622500	3624500	I have a question
3624500	3626500	You ask first, you finish first
3628500	3630500	It's okay, my next question has nothing to do with this
3630500	3632500	So you can continue to ask other questions
3634500	3636500	You mentioned quarreling at the beginning
3636500	3638500	But quarreling
3638500	3640500	It doesn't seem to be sung
3640500	3642500	I want to know
3642500	3644500	It can also be sung
3644500	3646500	So I want to ask
3646500	3648500	The question is
3648500	3650500	The results are already here
3650500	3652500	How big do you think it is
3652500	3654500	How big can it be
3654500	3656500	Let us predict
3656500	3658500	Or provide us
3658500	3660500	Language communication
3660500	3662500	Knowledge
3662500	3664500	What kind of implications
3664500	3666500	What kind of implications
3666500	3668500	If there are some
3668500	3670500	Weaknesses
3670500	3672500	Where it can't be inferred
3672500	3674500	Some research that may need to be supplemented
3674500	3676500	What will it be
3676500	3678500	To the part of speech
3678500	3680500	OK
3680500	3682500	First of all
3682500	3684500	About body movements
3684500	3686500	Most of the research is actually done in the case of speech
3688500	3690500	But what they do is
3690500	3692500	In a small lab
3692500	3694500	Two people
3694500	3696500	Use relevant methods
3696500	3698500	That
3700500	3702500	There are other research around
3702500	3704500	In fact
3704500	3706500	Music performance and speech
3706500	3708500	The psychological process they use
3708500	3710500	Actually very similar
3710500	3712500	Then we are equal to
3712500	3714500	In the case of music, we also observed
3714500	3716500	This body movement
3716500	3718500	Of course it's not exactly the same effect
3718500	3720500	Extend out
3720500	3722500	But the effect is the same
3722500	3724500	Effect
3724500	3726500	Although there is no direct evidence
3726500	3728500	But I think
3728500	3730500	This effect should be in speech
3730500	3732500	It should be exactly the same
3736500	3738500	This is my guess
3738500	3740500	Thank you
3740500	3742500	I have a related question
3742500	3744500	Can you plug in
3744500	3746500	Is there a lottery number
3746500	3748500	Someone said he had a problem
3748500	3750500	I'm afraid I won't keep plugging in
3750500	3752500	I asked too many questions
3752500	3754500	You just said language
3754500	3756500	In fact, I think
3756500	3758500	More broadly
3758500	3760500	Do you think these are all
3760500	3762500	Is it the phenomenon of hearing?
3762500	3764500	Or is it actually a wider perception
3764500	3766500	Or is it a new way of operation
3766500	3768500	Or is it
3768500	3770500	Specific to the phenomenon of hearing
3770500	3772500	For example, the experiment you just started is regularity
3772500	3774500	Decide
3774500	3776500	You can anticipate
3776500	3778500	How to deal with sensory information
3778500	3780500	Obviously this is also the case in vision
3780500	3782500	Then there is your current music
3782500	3784500	The communication of cooperation
3784500	3786500	Is it really due to the performance of music
3786500	3788500	Or all the cooperation
3788500	3790500	All the cooperation
3790500	3792500	For example, the table you just raised
3792500	3794500	There are all the same phenomena
3794500	3796500	Does the sway of the body also affect
3796500	3798500	Or there are some more general mechanisms
3798500	3800500	For example, any synchrony
3800500	3802500	Any synchronicity
3802500	3804500	Will help communicate
3804500	3808500	Can you remind me again
3808500	3810500	What is the first part
3810500	3812500	I thought it was all examples
3812500	3814500	The main question is
3814500	3816500	Do you think this is a domain-specific phenomenon
3816500	3818500	Specific to the phenomenon of hearing
3818500	3820500	Or is it a broader
3820500	3822500	New way of operation
3822500	3824500	I don't need a standard answer
3824500	3826500	I'm just curious
3826500	3828500	Curious about my idea
3828500	3830500	According to other studies
3830500	3832500	Actually found
3832500	3834500	Like this kind of time synchrony
3834500	3836500	For hearing
3836500	3838500	It's still a bit different from vision
3838500	3840500	Like
3842500	3844500	The sense of rhythm of vision
3844500	3846500	In fact, it is relative to hearing
3846500	3848500	Is quite difficult to trigger
3848500	3850500	The accuracy of his track time
3850500	3852500	No
3852500	3854500	It seems that the results are not so high
3854500	3856500	But someone has succeeded
3856500	3858500	Someone has succeeded
3858500	3860500	Vision still has this effect
3860500	3862500	In fact, it may not be the same
3862500	3864500	The domain of hearing
3864500	3866500	Obviously frequency and time
3866500	3868500	But in vision
3868500	3870500	It will be space and location
3870500	3872500	So
3872500	3874500	Translated, it becomes
3874500	3876500	Like statistical learning
3876500	3878500	If there is a fixed pattern
3878500	3880500	Can't speak Chinese
3880500	3882500	If there is a fixed pattern
3882500	3884500	Repeatedly appear
3884500	3886500	Your processing will be faster and better
3886500	3888500	More accurate
3888500	3890500	Is this a similar phenomenon?
3890500	3892500	Or there is a specialized
3892500	3894500	Some
3894500	3896500	Processing in the brain
3896500	3898500	Processing in different areas
3898500	3900500	I think the special process
3900500	3902500	Because time is one dimension
3902500	3904500	Although
3904500	3906500	It is a single direction
3906500	3908500	But you are always
3908500	3910500	To the future
3910500	3912500	That
3912500	3914500	For example
3914500	3916500	Visual
3916500	3918500	This pattern
3918500	3920500	This pattern is not the same
3920500	3922500	But it must be future-oriented
3922500	3924500	Based on your existing knowledge
3924500	3926500	You keep guessing
3926500	3928500	What is the future information
3928500	3930500	And it is online processing
3930500	3932500	So
3932500	3934500	I think these details
3934500	3936500	Let time
3936500	3938500	For hearing
3938500	3940500	The requirements become
3940500	3942500	Different from other senses
3942500	3944500	Because his information is open at any time
3944500	3946500	Let me give you an example
3946500	3948500	Visual phenomenon
3948500	3950500	Also belongs to
3950500	3952500	Temporal anticipation
3952500	3954500	For example
3954500	3956500	You should know this experiment
3956500	3958500	Three
3958500	3960500	Three random sounds
3960500	3962500	Combination
3962500	3964500	This is the first time
3964500	3966500	Language learning
3966500	3968500	For example, there are nine possible
3968500	3970500	Tones
3970500	3972500	These things
3972500	3974500	Three
3974500	3976500	Always stuck together
3976500	3978500	Three
3978500	3980500	Always a pair
3980500	3982500	These sentences
3982500	3984500	Can be combined
3984500	3986500	But in fact
3986500	3988500	If you use visual stimulation
3988500	3990500	Do the same experiment
3990500	3992500	All the results are the same
3992500	3994500	This is also a future
3994500	3996500	Processing from the past and online
3996500	3998500	Anticipation for the future
3998500	4000500	Affect your intuition
4000500	4002500	I know
4002500	4004500	In each special case
4004500	4006500	Some cases are replicated
4006500	4008500	But there are many cases
4008500	4010500	It's hard to do
4010500	4012500	For example, the effect of rhythm
4012500	4014500	Temporal grouping
4014500	4016500	I know you have done it in the lab
4016500	4018500	But their citation
4018500	4020500	In fact, you can see
4020500	4022500	A lot of people failed
4022500	4024500	But it doesn't matter
4024500	4026500	I know I have done that multisensory
4026500	4028500	I know it's hard
4028500	4030500	It's super simple
4030500	4032500	You just need to present four tones
4032500	4034500	People will know
4034500	4036500	So you mean
4036500	4038500	It has a domain-specific part
4038500	4040500	Extract
4040500	4042500	Temporal regularity
4042500	4044500	What do you think
4044500	4046500	About regularity
4046500	4048500	What do you think is different
4048500	4050500	What is the difference between auditory regularity and visual regularity
4050500	4052500	I think
4052500	4054500	I think the effect is the same
4054500	4056500	But maybe in processing
4056500	4058500	In the very early stage of hearing
4058500	4060500	Will start to deal with this matter
4060500	4062500	You will be in
4062500	4064500	Temporal coding
4064500	4066500	But visual
4066500	4068500	You may want to
4068500	4070500	Where domain
4070500	4072500	I'm not sure
4072500	4074500	The later process will deal with
4074500	4076500	This message
4076500	4078500	These mechanisms
4078500	4080500	That's why it's so noisy
4080500	4082500	For example
4082500	4084500	I don't know if it will affect auditory
4084500	4086500	Because of these phenomena
4086500	4088500	So auditory and visual
4088500	4090500	Basically there is a difference
4090500	4092500	Ok
4092500	4094500	I've been standing for too long
4094500	4096500	Can I guess
4096500	4098500	It's over, please say
4098500	4100500	I read a article before
4100500	4102500	He said
4102500	4104500	This is a new one
4104500	4106500	He said if the stimulation material
4106500	4108500	The trigger material is used
4108500	4110500	Language or
4110500	4112500	Sound is the hearing
4112500	4114500	Trigger material
4114500	4116500	That
4116500	4118500	The subject
4118500	4120500	The abstract
4120500	4122500	Will be higher
4122500	4124500	Later he described this material
4124500	4126500	And so on
4126500	4128500	He will use a more abstract and psychological distance
4128500	4130500	To describe
4130500	4132500	Relative to visual stimulation material
4132500	4134500	I don't know this
4134500	4136500	Processing
4136500	4138500	Listening to music
4138500	4140500	Music and language
4140500	4142500	Are close
4142500	4144500	Relative to visual stimulation
4144500	4146500	Because
4146500	4148500	Take the initiative to do
4148500	4150500	Prediction
4150500	4152500	It feels like
4152500	4154500	My feeling is to be abstract
4154500	4156500	When it's higher
4156500	4158500	I will do it
4158500	4160500	Because if it's very concrete
4160500	4162500	Isn't it just
4162500	4164500	Just accept input
4164500	4166500	You don't have to guess
4166500	4168500	Or is it like this
4168500	4170500	I don't know
4170500	4172500	But
4172500	4174500	I really don't know
4174500	4176500	I don't know how to do it
4178500	4180500	I don't know
4180500	4182500	I really don't know
4184500	4186500	Hello
4190500	4192500	I just said I don't know
4192500	4194500	Sorry
4194500	4196500	Okay
4196500	4198500	Do you have any questions?
4198500	4200500	Someone is chatting
4200500	4202500	Okay
4202500	4204500	Can I ask a question?
4204500	4206500	Okay
4206500	4208500	Please
4208500	4210500	I was thinking
4210500	4212500	If you
4212500	4214500	When the musicians come
4214500	4216500	You tell them on purpose
4216500	4218500	Three of you
4218500	4220500	Follow and one is leader
4220500	4222500	Now you are saying
4222500	4224500	When you are doing it
4224500	4226500	You give them two leaders and two followers
4226500	4228500	To see their
4230500	4232500	Will they fight?
4232500	4234500	Yes
4234500	4236500	Actually we did this experiment
4238500	4240500	Our condition
4240500	4242500	Is called
4242500	4244500	Bitch I'm the leader
4246500	4248500	We
4248500	4250500	We originally thought
4250500	4252500	When your leadership assignment
4252500	4254500	Is a conflict
4254500	4256500	How do we
4256500	4258500	Choose a leader
4258500	4260500	Then
4260500	4262500	That person becomes the leader
4262500	4264500	We originally wanted to see this
4264500	4266500	But the result of the experiment
4266500	4268500	We found that only when
4268500	4270500	Everyone can see each other
4270500	4272500	And everyone is assigned as followers
4272500	4274500	To solve this conflict
4274500	4276500	To be able to
4276500	4278500	At first everyone's coordination was bad
4278500	4280500	But after a while
4280500	4282500	Only when everyone is followers
4282500	4284500	And can see each other
4284500	4286500	To solve this
4286500	4288500	In other cases
4288500	4290500	For example, everyone is the leader
4290500	4292500	Or can't see each other
4292500	4294500	They can't solve it
4294500	4296500	So we call it bitch I'm the leader
4296500	4298500	Okay
4298500	4300500	Have you ever tried
4300500	4302500	Without a leader
4302500	4304500	For example
4304500	4306500	If you tell them
4306500	4308500	One person is the follower
4308500	4310500	One person is the leader
4310500	4312500	But no one gets the leader
4312500	4314500	That's right
4314500	4316500	We just said
4316500	4318500	Everyone is the follower
4318500	4320500	And can see each other
4320500	4322500	When no one is the leader
4322500	4324500	And they play
4324500	4326500	Gradually
4326500	4328500	Information flow
4328500	4330500	But only in a quartet
4330500	4332500	Only in Bach
4332500	4334500	In Mozart
4334500	4336500	If it's not balanced
4336500	4338500	It doesn't work
4338500	4340500	So we think
4340500	4342500	If everyone is the follower
4342500	4344500	Everyone follows Poussin
4344500	4346500	Follow Poussin
4346500	4348500	Once they find this conflict
4348500	4350500	Just follow Poussin
4350500	4352500	At the same time
4352500	4354500	After each performance
4354500	4356500	They have to guess who is the leader
4356500	4358500	They were forced to choose the other three
4358500	4360500	Even if they are all followers
4360500	4362500	You have to guess who
4362500	4364500	I think they are too good
4364500	4366500	After the performance
4366500	4368500	They wrote on the answer sheet
4368500	4370500	No leader
4370500	4372500	They were not fooled by us
4374500	4376500	So this part
4376500	4378500	The conclusion is not clear
4380500	4382500	And we avoid
4382500	4384500	In order to have no leader
4384500	4386500	In the case of no leader
4386500	4388500	Or in the case of all leaders
4388500	4390500	They will conflict at the beginning
4390500	4392500	Two seconds before the performance
4392500	4394500	We play the beat
4394500	4396500	Before the performance
4396500	4398500	The beat is removed
4398500	4400500	So they just have to follow the beat
4400500	4402500	So there will be no problem
4406500	4408500	Does anyone have any questions?
4408500	4410500	I have a question
4412500	4414500	If I understand correctly
4414500	4416500	You do this experiment with music
4416500	4418500	Because I hope this experiment can be close to
4418500	4420500	Social interaction
4420500	4422500	But in human interaction
4422500	4424500	For example, there are leaders and followers in group behavior
4424500	4426500	This often depends on
4426500	4428500	Personal characteristics
4428500	4430500	Personality
4430500	4432500	These things
4432500	4434500	In music, they have been closely trained
4434500	4436500	They may be able to express their personality
4436500	4438500	Their desire
4438500	4440500	Then follow the music
4440500	4442500	So they can't react to human society
4442500	4444500	Personal characteristics affect interaction
4444500	4446500	Do you think this will affect
4446500	4448500	Your research results
4448500	4450500	How to cover this part
4452500	4454500	I think these questions are too good
4454500	4456500	I can only say
4456500	4458500	In this case, this is also a weakness of our research
4458500	4460500	Because we are looking for a group
4460500	4462500	We are not
4462500	4464500	Go out and find two violin
4464500	4466500	Put them together
4466500	4468500	In this case, we can
4468500	4470500	For example, we look for
4470500	4472500	For example, a very strong first violin
4472500	4474500	Or a very strong cello
4474500	4476500	Then look at the relationship between their personalities
4476500	4478500	Relationship
4478500	4480500	Then see how they
4480500	4482500	What effect will this experiment have
4482500	4484500	I don't know about this, Zhang Yanping can do an experiment
4484500	4486500	You can come to us
4488500	4490500	I can only say that this is indeed a weakness of our research
4490500	4492500	Our research is currently
4492500	4494500	As a personality effect
4494500	4496500	We didn't study
4496500	4498500	We just don't look at it
4498500	4500500	Answer
4500500	4502500	I think
4502500	4504500	In your experiment
4504500	4506500	You have assigned leadership
4506500	4508500	Can't you argue
4508500	4510500	To a certain extent
4510500	4512500	Do you operate such a personality
4512500	4514500	Because when a person gets
4514500	4516500	When this assignment
4516500	4518500	To a certain extent
4518500	4520500	That person
4520500	4522500	Is a strong personality
4522500	4524500	Of course, people who are not so strong
4524500	4526500	May not be able to get so much
4526500	4528500	But in general
4528500	4530500	That person
4530500	4532500	Should be taken out
4532500	4534500	It seems
4534500	4536500	Right, this must be understood
4536500	4538500	I don't understand this
4538500	4540500	That's right
4540500	4542500	This leader
4542500	4544500	The operation of the follower is our experiment
4544500	4546500	I think it is
4546500	4548500	In a more unnatural situation
4548500	4550500	Just like the previous question
4550500	4552500	In general, everyone is
4552500	4554500	According to the personality
4554500	4556500	Then we experiment to manipulate
4556500	4558500	As for the effect of the operation and its original personality
4558500	4560500	I don't know
4560500	4562500	Just say we manipulate
4562500	4564500	It seems to be
4564500	4566500	In everyone
4566500	4568500	We still see
4568500	4570500	Even if I am the leader
4570500	4572500	I can influence others
4572500	4574500	The level of predicting others
4574500	4576500	Higher
4578500	4580500	Thank you
4580500	4582500	Do you have any questions?
4582500	4584500	We designed 10 experiments
4584500	4586500	To continue, right?
4586500	4588500	Not bad
4588500	4590500	Then we have to hang the author
4590500	4592500	Hang the author
4592500	4594500	Who will help me run the experiment?
4594500	4596500	Canada is a bit cold
4600500	4602500	Caltech is now 100 degrees
4602500	4604500	Almost hot
4608500	4610500	It's already 4.24
4610500	4612500	Then we officially
