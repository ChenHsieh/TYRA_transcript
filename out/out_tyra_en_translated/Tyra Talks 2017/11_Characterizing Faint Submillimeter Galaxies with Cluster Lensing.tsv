0	1680	This is also a similar picture.
1680	4080	This is the radius,
4080	6560	and this is the brightness distribution picture.
6560	9360	So you find that this HSC, H-band
9360	10560	is the mirror infrared light,
10560	11280	so it's very new.
11280	12720	Its distribution is wider,
12720	16320	and its distribution is more concentrated.
16320	22000	Concentrated in a closer radius.
22000	23040	So it tells you that
25360	27360	these dusts are more compact,
27360	28960	concentrated in the center of the galaxy.
28960	32160	And the stars are running around.
32160	33280	What does this tell you?
33280	35920	It tells you that these SMGs
35920	37840	should be major mergers.
37840	38480	As I said before,
38480	40400	it's two stars colliding.
40400	42400	When the two stars collide,
42400	46160	these stars are running around.
46160	48640	Because when the two stars collide,
48640	50320	the stars
50320	52320	can basically be regarded as collision.
52320	54640	They don't...
54640	57200	They only have gravity for each other.
57200	59200	Because the two stars
59200	60400	don't collide.
60400	62800	Because the universe is very wide.
62800	63360	Very wide.
63360	64320	And the stars...
64320	67280	Imagine they're colliding one by one.
67280	69760	But there's a collision
69760	71040	with a collision on the left,
71040	72480	and a collision on the right.
72480	76080	Then you push each other.
76080	77280	But most collisions
77280	78480	just pass each other.
78480	79520	They don't collide with each other.
79520	81440	Because the space of the universe is very large,
81440	83840	and the frequency of the stars is very small.
83840	86240	So the stars
86240	88240	basically don't collide with each other.
88240	90400	So they run around in space.
90400	91600	It's like this.
91600	93680	They only have gravity
93680	96560	for each other.
96560	97760	But DOS doesn't.
97760	99120	DOS actually comes from...
99120	101040	At first, it comes from gas.
101040	102720	Gas...
102720	103920	When the two stars collide,
103920	106080	the gas will collide with each other.
106080	108560	Then they will lose their kinetic energy.
108560	109040	OK.
109040	110240	And after the gas loses kinetic energy,
110240	112080	they will...
112080	114080	fall to the center of the star
114080	116000	because of gravity.
116080	116640	Because of gravity,
116640	120640	they will fall into the gravitational well of the core.
120640	122560	And after the gas reaches the core,
122560	126000	they will form new stars.
126000	127120	New stars.
127120	128800	They will produce star formation.
128800	129840	After star formation,
129840	131840	as I said at the beginning,
131840	132560	after star formation,
132560	133920	they will have supernova,
133920	136000	and then they will produce some gravity,
136000	139200	and then they will produce these dusts.
139200	140160	OK.
140160	143440	So that's why these dusts are gathered in the middle.
143440	145760	So basically, this paper tells you
145760	148320	what SMG is.
148320	150560	But what this paper doesn't have is
150560	153120	that it only has DOS and STAR components.
153120	154880	It doesn't have
154880	156640	gas components.
156640	158000	That is, you have to observe through
158000	160160	the plane of the molecule or the plane of the atom.
160160	161920	Because this part is still being developed.
161920	163920	We're still waiting for ALMA
163920	167440	to build more instruments
167440	169520	so that we can get this part of the observation.
169520	171200	This is also the focus of SMG
171200	172720	for the next few years.
172720	174320	After you have this component,
174320	175920	you can draw it on the map.
175920	177520	Then you can compare
177520	179680	the behavior of STAR, DOS, and gas.
179680	183120	You can learn more about their dynamics.
183120	183920	OK.
183920	185680	That's all I want to say.
185680	188640	I'm going to briefly introduce
188640	189680	what this field is for,
189680	191680	and then talk about my little project.
191680	193920	And then the last few slides
193920	197520	talk about what ALMA can do in the future.
197520	198720	Thank you, everyone.
205280	207280	Thank you, Xu Liyan.
207280	209280	I've been talking for two hours.
211280	213280	Do you have any questions?
215280	216640	Yes, two hours.
216640	218640	Do we have enough time?
218640	220640	You can ask a few more questions.
220640	222640	Do you have any questions?
222640	224640	I'm not in a hurry.
224640	226640	No, I...
226640	230640	No problem. We can record for five hours.
230640	232640	No, no, no.
232960	234960	I have a question.
234960	236960	I'm more interested in engineering technology.
236960	238960	You mentioned that
238960	240960	some measurements are slower.
240960	242960	For example, SMA is slower than ALMA.
242960	244960	Specifically,
244960	246960	in terms of engineering or technology,
246960	248960	which link
248960	250960	makes it slower?
250960	252960	Basically, it's...
252960	254960	Let me talk about my understanding
254960	256960	of astronomical telescope first.
256960	258960	Then you help me see if it's right or wrong.
258960	260960	As far as I know,
261280	263280	the antenna
263280	265280	receives radio signals.
265280	267280	No matter what kind of wavelength it is,
267280	269280	it's basically an electromagnetic wave.
269280	271280	It receives electromagnetic wave signals
271280	273280	and processes them
273280	275280	through the computer.
275280	277280	For example,
277280	279280	it combines signals from different regions
279280	281280	to make some visualizations.
281280	283280	My understanding of astronomical telescope
283280	285280	is like this.
285280	287280	I don't know if it's wrong.
291280	293280	Hello?
293280	295280	Am I disconnected?
303280	305280	Hello?
305280	307280	Hello?
307280	309280	I'm disconnected.
309280	311280	Julian, did you mute yourself?
317280	319280	Hello?
319600	321600	Hello?
323600	325600	Can you hear me?
325600	327600	Yes, I can hear you.
327600	329600	I just disconnected.
329600	331600	Okay, continue.
331600	333600	So where did you hear it just now?
333600	335600	You said the antenna
335600	337600	receives all electromagnetic wave signals.
337600	339600	It receives electromagnetic wave signals
339600	341600	and then
341600	343600	a large part of it
343600	345600	is processed by the computer
345600	347600	after receiving electromagnetic wave signals.
347920	349920	It combines signals from different regions
349920	351920	to make visualizations.
351920	353920	If my understanding is correct,
353920	355920	when you say
355920	357920	an astronomical telescope
357920	359920	is slower than another,
359920	361920	which part is slower?
361920	363920	Basically,
365920	367920	SMA only has 8 dashes.
367920	369920	ELMA has more than 60 dashes.
369920	371920	That's basically it.
371920	373920	So it's like
373920	375920	more dashes
376240	378240	at the same time?
378240	380240	It's called
380240	382240	collecting area.
382240	384240	So...
384240	386240	I'm still online.
386240	388240	I can see you.
388240	390240	It's basically
390240	392240	collecting area.
392240	394240	It has more than 60 dashes.
394240	396240	I can hear you.
396240	398240	SMA only has 8 dashes.
400240	402240	But SMA can't add more dashes.
402560	404560	Yeah.
404560	406560	To put it simply,
406560	408560	it can observe
408560	410560	a larger area.
410560	412560	So you have more dashes in total.
412560	414560	So effectively,
414560	416560	you collect
416560	418560	more electromagnetic waves.
420560	422560	I see.
422560	424560	That's it.
424560	426560	SMA
426560	428560	has been doing some upgrades.
428560	430560	It can't add
430880	432880	more dashes,
432880	434880	but it can collect
434880	436880	more electromagnetic waves.
436880	438880	What does that mean?
438880	440880	It means
440880	442880	how much electromagnetic waves
442880	444880	a telescope can collect.
446880	448880	Now,
448880	450880	a telescope
450880	452880	can collect
452880	454880	32...
454880	456880	32 GHz
456880	458880	of electromagnetic waves.
459200	461200	On the other hand,
461200	463200	ALMA is not that big.
463200	465200	ALMA is only 8 GHz.
465200	467200	Yeah.
467200	469200	But SMA can only
469200	471200	make up for it.
471200	473200	It doesn't add more dashes,
473200	475200	but it can increase
475200	477200	the frequency of each individual dash.
477200	479200	So it can collect
479200	481200	more electromagnetic waves
481200	483200	at the same time.
483200	485200	Yeah.
485200	487200	But it's not enough.
487520	489520	Yeah.
495520	497520	So...
497520	499520	Is there anything else?
499520	501520	He's not here.
501520	503520	His signal
503520	505520	seems to be lagging.
505520	507520	No.
507520	509520	I'm here.
509520	511520	Is there
511520	513520	Jenny?
513520	515520	Is there anything else?
515840	517840	Is Jenny here?
517840	519840	She hasn't asked a question.
521840	523840	If possible,
523840	525840	I'd like to ask another question.
525840	527840	At the beginning,
527840	529840	you mentioned astronomy
529840	531840	and cosmology.
531840	533840	What's the difference?
533840	535840	Astronomy is about the universe.
535840	537840	It's hard to define.
537840	539840	Basically,
539840	541840	I think
541840	543840	astronomy and cosmology
544160	546160	can be seen as
546160	548160	two different areas
548160	550160	with overlapping.
550160	552160	But they are not the same
552160	554160	or completely different.
554160	556160	They overlap.
556160	558160	I can explain it this way.
558160	560160	For example,
562160	564160	if someone studies
564160	566160	the distribution of dark matter
566160	568160	in the universe,
570160	572160	to understand the evolution of the universe
572480	574480	to understand the distribution
574480	576480	of dark matter in the universe
576480	578480	and to influence
578480	580480	dark matter...
580480	582480	Have you heard of dark matter?
582480	584480	The distribution of dark matter
584480	586480	affects the formation of the galaxy.
586480	588480	The formation of the galaxy.
588480	590480	This is basically cosmology.
590480	592480	But it's also astronomy.
592480	594480	Because it's related to the evolution of the galaxy.
596480	598480	As long as it's related to the evolution of the galaxy,
598480	600480	it's related to our observations of the galaxy.
600800	602800	If you use a microscope
602800	604800	or a sub-millimeter or a radio,
604800	606800	you have to use astronomy to observe.
606800	608800	This is astronomy.
608800	610800	Cosmology is also astronomy.
610800	612800	But some things
612800	614800	are purely cosmology.
614800	616800	For example,
616800	618800	pure cosmology
618800	620800	is basically physics.
620800	622800	For example,
622800	624800	the study of the explosion theory.
624800	626800	I just...
630800	632800	For example,
632800	634800	the study of the early universe.
634800	636800	The explosion theory is
636800	638800	the early universe to the Big Bang.
638800	640800	After that,
640800	642800	there was a period of very crazy expansion.
642800	644800	This part
644800	646800	is very theoretical.
646800	648800	It's hard for us
648800	650800	to actually observe.
650800	652800	It's all physical models.
652800	654800	You have to understand very deep theoretical physics.
654800	656800	This kind of thing
656800	658800	I will classify it
659120	661120	as pure physics.
661120	663120	Basically, it's cosmology,
663120	665120	but not astronomy.
665120	667120	You can say that.
667120	669120	The other part is astronomy,
669120	671120	but not cosmology.
671120	673120	It's a good example. For example,
673120	675120	some people study small stars,
675120	677120	study comets,
677120	679120	or study
679120	681120	very basic star formation.
681120	683120	But it's not my kind of star formation.
683120	685120	It's a star formation one by one.
685120	687120	It studies stars,
687440	689440	such as small stars and comets.
689440	691440	It studies these things
691440	693440	at a close distance.
693440	695440	It's not like
695440	697440	when I study galaxies,
697440	699440	I will talk about redshifts.
699440	701440	If you study solar systems,
701440	703440	small stars and comets,
703440	705440	you won't use the concept of redshifts.
705440	707440	Because they are too close to us.
707440	709440	I just said that redshifts are mainly...
709440	711440	Of course, there are many kinds of redshifts.
711440	713440	They will use Doppler redshifts,
713440	715440	because they have Doppler redshifts as soon as they move.
715760	717760	Cosmological redshifts,
717760	719760	because the universe is expanding,
719760	721760	they will observe this effect.
721760	723760	If you study
723760	725760	very close stars,
725760	727760	study comet formation,
727760	729760	they won't use cosmological redshifts.
729760	731760	They will observe that any
731760	733760	blue and redshifts are Doppler effects.
733760	735760	Basically, when you study these things,
735760	737760	you don't need to consider
737760	739760	the evolution of our universe.
739760	741760	You don't need to consider
741760	743760	whether there is dark energy
744080	746080	or dark matter.
746080	748080	So,
748080	750080	these things will be classified as pure astronomy.
750080	752080	They don't have cosmological redshifts.
754080	756080	I feel a little bit
756080	758080	like that.
758080	760080	Basically, this is what I want to say.
760080	762080	Because people in this field
762080	764080	will have a better feeling.
764080	766080	Okay, thank you.
774080	776080	Because
776080	778080	the time is a bit late,
778080	780080	we will end here today.
780080	782080	Okay, thank you.
782080	784080	Can you still hear me?
784080	786080	I know I can hear you.
786080	788080	I'm just a little bit laggy.
788080	790080	Okay, let's thank Xu Liyan again.
792080	794080	Okay, thank you.
794080	796080	Okay, that's it. See you next week.
796080	798080	Okay, bye bye.
798080	800080	Bye bye.
