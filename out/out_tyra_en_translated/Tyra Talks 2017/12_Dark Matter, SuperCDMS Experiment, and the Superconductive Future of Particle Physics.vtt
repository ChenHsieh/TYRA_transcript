WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Okay

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Oh

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
F

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Oh, I forgot

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Share

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Share screen

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Wow

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Okay

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
is

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Dark Matter Super CDMS

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
which is what I'm doing right now

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
and the Super Conductive Future

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
of Particle Physics

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
which is

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
what I'm doing right now

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Okay, next page

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
The topic I'm going to talk about today

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
will be divided into two parts

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
The first part is

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
the physical part

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm going to talk about Dark Matter

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
which is mainly

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
focused on

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
the direct detection

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
part of the experiment

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
What is its physics?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
What is the current

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
state of the field?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
What is everyone's goal? What are the difficulties?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
How to do this experiment? How to measure this thing?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
It should be more reliable

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
and more interesting

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
The second part will be my own work

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
which is quite R&D

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
People who are interested in

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
technology may be more interested

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
But it should be very related

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
My screen is a bit laggy

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
First of all, because we have already

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
introduced it before

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
What is

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
the basic example

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
of a

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
model and a theoretical basis

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So I'm going to talk about it very quickly

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
So basically

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Can you see my mouse?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Can you see my mouse?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Can you see it?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
There are many basic examples

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We think these basic examples

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
are the basic materials

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
we know

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
in the universe

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
But

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
because of some reasons

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
we think there are still things in the universe

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
that we don't know

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
We can't use this model to explain

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
But anyway, this is called Standard Model

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
It is the best description

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
If you are

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
interested in this

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
You can look it up on Wikipedia

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
There are six quarks

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
three leptons

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
neutrinos

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
and X

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Okay

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
The point I want to talk about today

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
will focus on

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
the ones you can see on the screen

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
The red one is a mole

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
The blue one is a neutrino

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Basically, this is

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
the most important example for us

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Because honestly, in life

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
the most important thing is

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
the things you are interested in

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
the things you breathe

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
and the things that make up you

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
These are the only two

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Okay

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Then

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Sorry, there are electrons

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
These are the three

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
There is another important one

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
The white ghost

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
It is called light

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It sounds very mysterious

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
like a laser gun

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
these things

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
exchange light like baseball

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
and they will

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
reach the energy balance

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Basically, the heat balance

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
After reaching the heat balance

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
everything will have a black hole

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Okay

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
This is very important

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Because my family often ask me

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Is dark matter a black hole?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Actually, it is not

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
You will know why

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
It is very vague

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
This is the universe we usually see

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
When we look at it

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
the whole universe is black

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Then you will say

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Why do we think

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
everything is the matter we know

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
and it will exchange light

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
like a baseball

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
This is actually

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
the universe we see

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
with a good instrument

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Like this

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
The whole universe is basically bright

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
The different colors

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
are basically the same as the black hole

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It corresponds to different temperatures

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You see the brightest one in the middle

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It is the galactic plane

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
There are many planets

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
and a lot of energy

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So there will be a lot of energy

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Okay

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
My mouse

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Okay, you see the back

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
This part is very red

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
The energy here is very low

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It only has a foreground

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It only has a background

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
The background is the whole background of the universe

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It is very cold

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
It is only 3 degrees K

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
But basically it has a temperature

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
So we can still see it

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Okay

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
This picture is basically

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
filled with colors

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
How can we say there is any dark matter

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
that we don't know

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Let me see the next page

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Because there was a very wise man

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
He said

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Vader was seduced by

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
The dark side of the force

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
The dark side of the force

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
The force is what gives Jedi his power

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It's an energy field

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
created by all living things

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
It surrounds us

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It permits us

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
It binds the galaxy together

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It sounds very confusing

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I don't know what he is talking about

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
So I will focus on it

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
The dark side of the force

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Behind the galaxy together

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
This sentence is probably

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
from 1976

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
So you can imagine

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
this is the era when we started to

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
be interested in dark matter

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
This statement is correct

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
We started to be interested in dark matter

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Okay

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Okay

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Actually

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
What did Obeah Kenobi mean by this?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
This means

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
There's a picture here

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
The brightest place is

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
the center of our galaxy

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Then the horizontal axis

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
is the distance from the center of the galaxy to the outside

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
The vertical axis is

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
the particle

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
in that position

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
The speed of rotation around the center of the galaxy

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Then you can see

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
the yellow data

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
The yellow data is

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
the stars over there

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Okay, like the sun

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So we can see those stars

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
are moving

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Then we can see

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
the center of the yellow data

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
is the galaxy

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
That is

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
the size of the galaxy

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
300 years ago

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Then we found

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
we can keep looking out

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
according to the

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
dark radiation

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
We can see the infrared

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Then we can see

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
the blue hyperfine structure

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
The blue dot

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
is the light source

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
of the moon

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
You can keep pushing

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
to the outside

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
the position of 50,000 light years

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
It can be connected

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
This is what we know

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
the size of a galaxy

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Okay

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Then we can see

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
the speed of

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
the particles

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
we see

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
We can

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
There is a point

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
According to the theory of relativity

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
It is basically Newton's law

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
According to

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
the traditional law we know

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
We can guess

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
We just see the speed

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
We can guess

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
the speed of rotation

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
around the orbit

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
So we get

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
the following line

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Okay

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
But actually

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
we observe

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
the speed of rotation is the line above

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
So

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
you will find

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
the speed of rotation

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
is the speed of the line above

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
The actual weight of the orbit

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
is much more than

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
what we can see

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Okay

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So we really can't see it

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
In the 1980s

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
That's because

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
our instrumentation is not good enough

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
We can't see anything

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So there were some

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
disputes about dark matter

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Then

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
in the 1980s and 1990s

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
we started to know

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
that everything we can see is almost right

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So we started to think

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
whether the particles we know

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
can meet this nature

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
The answer is yes

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
There are three kinds of particles

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
called neutrons

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
There are three kinds of particles

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
called neutrons

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
They do have this nature

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
But the neutrons we know

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
This is the point

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Some people think we don't know neutrons

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
The neutrons we already know

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
basically

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
have something to do

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
with the particles

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
we already know

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Because particles and neutrons

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
have something to do with the ratio

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
When they change,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
they will use it

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
So according to all the stars we observed

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Those stars are all neutrons

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
We can infer

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
how many neutrons there are

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Can it

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
cover

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
our missing mass budget

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
The answer is that it can't exceed 6%

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It can't exceed 6%

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
So basically we think

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
it might be new physics

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
The answer is that it shouldn't, right?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Because the quality you see

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
is a virtual line

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So if I have more

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
missing mass

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I think it will fit the original data

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
So when you plot the upper line

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
How do you know

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
when you have more missing mass?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Let me write a book

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Is it easier to plot like this?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Let's say the middle part is symmetric

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
We can think of it as the middle part

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It's the

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
transverse speed

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Yes

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Oh no

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It's the speed of rotation

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
So you can see

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
The real speed

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
is a few hundred

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
kilometers per second

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So it's really slow

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
So basically

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
it's a neutron

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It doesn't have to be close to the speed of light

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Okay

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
This number is a bit important

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Actually Darkmatter

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
has a lot of clues

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I won't say it's evidence

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
So there are a lot of clues

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
This clue is actually

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
the most suspicious

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It has a lot of reasons not to think like this

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
But Darkmatter has a lot of other

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
clues

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
If you are interested, you can ask

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
But basically this is the most important to us

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Okay

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Anyway

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
We need to have additional

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
quality to generate additional benefits

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Or somehow

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
your theory needs to generate additional benefits

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
to explain this question

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Do you have any questions for Darkmatter?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Okay

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Then I'll jump straight to

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
This is an interesting article

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I've seen recently

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
And I think

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
you should know better than me

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Okay

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Okay

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You should know who this is

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
This is the latest

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
CERN Courier

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
article

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
It's

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I magnified the point

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
But I still have a citation

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
So I magnified the citation

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It says

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Let's see where to start

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Okay

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Let's see

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
It

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Let's see

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
It should be here

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It says

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
EPR pair

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
referred to

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
EPR pair

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
referred to ER Einstein Rosenbridge

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
and one part that connects the two parts of

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
the black hole geometry

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
This idea is

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
brought by many theorists

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
in particular

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
in the context of ADS-CFT

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
correspondence

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Okay

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Let's look back

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
The point is

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
The problem with this theory is

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I think it's motivated by

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
what I just said

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
So it can work

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
in galaxy scale

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
But the problem is

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
it can't

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
or it's not good enough

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
in phenomenology

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
to work

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
to estimate

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
larger scale

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
For example,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
what I just said is a galaxy

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
and it will have

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
a modified gravity effect

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
But the problem is

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
we have another observation

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
that if there are two galaxies

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
and these two galaxies

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
all have a

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
dark matter

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
and they contrast

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
we can see the interaction

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
of two matter-like things

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
dark matter and non-dark matter

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
This kind of local

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
and dynamic behavior

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
is not a good way to explain

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
What it's doing now is

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
if it's a whole universe

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
in the early universe

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
it will have a modified CMB

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
which is cosmic background radiation

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Can it work?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Okay

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I actually made up another part

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
How would

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
emergent gravity affect

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
the physics?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Someone asked me

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
There are many different explanations

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
such as extra dimension

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
EREPR

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
or modified gravity

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Modified Newtonian Dynamics

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's a standard name

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
But why do we want to do dark matter?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I think the reason is simple

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
because dark matter can be done

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Even if you

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
don't think it's a good

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
theory

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
But it's important

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
to prove it

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
That's why we're doing this

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I would say it's hard to do

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
But someone is thinking

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
For example, microgravity

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
or some light experiments

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Well

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Jingjie

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I think you know better than me

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So I don't know much

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Can there be special

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
kind of

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
That's what he meant

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Right?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So I just imagined

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
If there is an extra dimension

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Contact

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Then your

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
3 plus 1

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
will be equal to

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
the size of

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
the contact white space

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
So if you

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
make it bigger or smaller

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
it's more likely to be

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
stronger than outside

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
But it's related to

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
the size of

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
the compactified dimension

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Right?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
If the size is not

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
a constant

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
or here is this big

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
or here is this big

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Then it means that in different places

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
the size will be different

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I think it's possible

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Jingjie, I don't know

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
how they do it

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But the point is

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
That's what he said

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Then

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I think I'll just jump back

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
from here

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Where did I talk about?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
OK

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Actually, the more interesting thing is

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
that

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
if anyone is interested in

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
other kinds of

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
prediction

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Right?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
There are all kinds of observations

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
we just talked about

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
the missing mass

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
So

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
what you see now

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
is our Milky Way

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
This is what we think is the Milky Way

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
The Milky Way we see

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Then next to it, I help you zoom in

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
That's our solar system

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Then we go around the sun

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
So the Earth is in the third one

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
OK

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Why is this important?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Because we do experiments on the Earth

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
So you know why it's important

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
The picture in the upper left corner

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
is to say that this is not a special phenomenon

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That is to say

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
only our Milky Way Galaxy has

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Because a lot of people thought

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
you would observe this

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Is it because we are in the Milky Way?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
So we are in the Milky Way

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
The Milky Way is not in the center

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
It's on the side

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
And then you have to correct it

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's like you've been going around

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
A constant change

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
OK

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Is there a problem with this experiment?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
But this thing

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
is basically a

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
A whole observation

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
in the 1970s

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
completely broken

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Vera Rubin

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
This person later won the Presidential Prize

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
He observed a lot of galaxies

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
There are such phenomena

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
So what you see in the upper left corner

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
is what I said

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The speed of the rotation

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
It's really flat

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
But if you

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
r² gm² is equal to r²mv²

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
In fact, it should be

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Is it the opposite of once r?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It will keep going down

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Equals once

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
v² will be the opposite of r

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
v² will be the opposite of r

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So we really think

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
What should the universe look like?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
It should look like this

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It's a little bit laggy

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
There is a halo

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Something like a light cloud

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
OK, so this thing is called Dark Matter Halo

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And then we're in that

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
So we've been constantly

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
in Dark Matter Halo

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Movement is being soaked in

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It feels like you're being soaked in

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I have a question

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
That is to say

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
How big is the curve?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
How big is the scale?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
The effect will come out slowly

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Because you're looking at a galaxy scale

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
For example, the scale of the solar system

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Or the scale of the galaxy

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It will have a similar curve

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
When you draw it out

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Is it the same?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I forgot to put that thing

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
This is very interesting

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
You can ask a question

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
How long does it take for us to go around the sun?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
One year, right?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
How long does it take for us to go around the galaxy?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
How long does it take for us to go around the galaxy?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
OK, basically

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
There's no life

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Can feel the difference

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
So you can imagine

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
We are in a

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
In the center of the galaxy

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The origin of the coordinate

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Around the sun

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Local rotation

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Can you?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
So basically in this Dark Matter Halo

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
We are actually in a fixed position

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
In that very local place

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Keep turning

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
So what do you get in the end?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
You will get

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
If you measure the local

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
The speed of the Halo

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I mean

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Dark Matter

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Wait a minute

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You just asked about the speed of the planet

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
OK

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Let me tell you

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
The earth itself

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
The speed of rotation around the sun

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
This measurement

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
OK

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So actually someone found something very interesting

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
It should be proposed

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
A very interesting concept

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Because we are

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Compared to our life

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And the time scale we use

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
We are in the Dark Matter Halo

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
The solar system is basically fixed in the Dark Matter Halo

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
You see that point is not moving

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Your whole life will not change

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
A pixel on the earth

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
But the earth has been around

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
So it means

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Our solar system is sitting in a

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Constant Dark Matter Week

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
A Dark Matter Wind

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Keep moving in the same direction

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Then we have half a year

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It's clockwise

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Half a year is counterclockwise

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Half a year is counterclockwise

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
This is called Dark Matter Annual Modulation

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
It can be a

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Probing Dark Matter

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
As a particle

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
A very important phenomenon

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
About ten years ago

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Someone planned to test it

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
And then there was no way

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
To reproduce the experiment

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Do you know this?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
In addition to

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The scale of the solar system

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It's a little bit bigger

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
But smaller than the galaxy

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
But smaller than the galaxy

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
See

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Because there are a lot of stars in the galaxy

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Is a lot of

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Constellations

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I don't know

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I don't know

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Because usually we

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
We are

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Anyway, everyone is talking about

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
What clues are there in Dark Matter

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Just use a few scales

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Galaxy

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's a bunch of galaxies

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
It's called Megastructure

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And then there's the whole universe

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
There are about four

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Will there be a star group in the middle?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I don't know

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I don't know

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I don't know

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I don't know

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Next one

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
But

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I have the doll above

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
That is

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
So

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Then we think it's weird

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Since we are sitting on the whole earth

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Including ourselves

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Do you feel like you're being blown by the wind?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Have you been hit all the time?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Is there a ghost behind you?

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
No

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
So a very popular theory

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Is

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
We are all surrounded by

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Dark Matter

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
OK

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It's like we're all surrounded by air

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
But they basically don't

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Pass their momentum to us

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
It won't interact with us

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
OK

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
This is smaller than air

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Because air is actually

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't feel the interaction

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Dark Matter's basic theory is that

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
The next two are the substances we already know

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And then they interact with each other

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
In the form of throwing balls

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So they can pass

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Momentum energy

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
That's what we know

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And then it's all dark matter

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
But Dark Matter has no way to catch the ball

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Just stand there and watch

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Of course

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But it has gravity

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Right

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
So we put one over there

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
A gravity pole

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's the only thing that can interact with us

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It's pulling us

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
So we can

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Basically, this is the only thing we can

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
See the reason for the rotational curve

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
OK

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Right, because it has a gravitational interaction with us

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Can this be

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Localized?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Let's say we have a

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Dark Matter density

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Let's say it's 0.5

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Will it enhance

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
The gravitational interaction between the substances?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
How do we interact with each other?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Oh, yeah, that's what I just said

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Microgravity

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
This thing is very interesting

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
You either measure a very large scale

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Why?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Because you can have a very large group of Dark Matter

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
You can measure a lot of pull

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
This approach will become

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
There is a kind of

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
What is it called?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Lensing

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
In fact, we can use

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Baryonic Matter to do

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But a lot of people are doing

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
There is a galaxy far away

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Then

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
He also has a Dark Matter Halo

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And then there's something behind him

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
So we can see what's behind him

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Then we can see

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
The effect of this galaxy's lensing

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Can we go

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
So this lens

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
How heavy is it?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Then we can see how bright this lens is

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
So we can guess

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
How heavy it is

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I don't know why I'm doing astronomy

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I don't know how to talk about Baryonic Matter

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Standard Model of Matter

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
How heavy it is

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
This is a way

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
There are a lot of these measurements

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Measurement and

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Is it in line with the SNOKER?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
In line with

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
But it's a mass

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Because if you measure it like this, it's a mass, right?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Because you're looking at a very far

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
A very far galaxy as a mirror

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
And then there's another group of people

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
What they're doing now is

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
That's what you said

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Can I do it on Earth?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
For example, I'm on the table

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I know how heavy this apple is

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
How heavy that banana is

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
But if there's Dark Matter in the middle

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
How much should he change

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
The problem with this is that you can put

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
All experiments are controlled very accurately

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
But their signal is very small

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Because things are very light

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So it's hard to do

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
If you do this

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Will be a completely different

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
For Theory

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
But this is

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
This is more like what you're talking about

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
We know this

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Oh yeah

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
So

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
The problem here is

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
How big is your sensitivity

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
You have to compare

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Because if we measure big G now

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
It should all be observed from the sky

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Just look at the big

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I don't know

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I don't know

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
What are they doing now

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
But someone is doing it

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
This is actually a very interesting experiment for me

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
But I think it's been five or ten years

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Should be very

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Test performance

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
There will be no

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I have a question

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Oh, this is a

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
A completely different idea

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
There is that you want to talk about

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Just talk about manufacturing

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
That LHC wants to do this

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I'll talk about it later

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Theoretically, right?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's just a

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
If it's a pile of matter and then there's mass

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Yes, it can be theoretically

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
But I don't think it's measured

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Because your weight is very small

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
So it's hard to measure

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
So now the big difference is

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Of course, there's more mass

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
But I'm not sure

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
No one knows what it is

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
But

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
What you can imagine is that you can modify

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
You originally used to do the assumption

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
That is, if Newton's law is right

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
That is, there is less matter

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Or Newton's law

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Or relativism is not so right

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Then you have to modify that

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Anyway, either case

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
You have to think of a theory

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
What we're doing is to treat it as

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Particle

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Yes, it's a particle

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
And then the only thing it does is

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Okay, this is what I'm talking about

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
So he's standing there

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And then he doesn't do anything, does he?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
So our assumption now is that

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Dark matter doesn't interact

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
This sentence is right

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
If you talk to astronomers

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
In all of our roles

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Dark matter will never work with you

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
What are you doing?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
OK

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
But what is our hope?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Our hope is

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Next page

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Next page

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
It's a very, very, very

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Small chance

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
It's actually going to be with us

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
This red

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I don't know if it's straight or neutral

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Anyway, it's with our normal matter

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Interaction

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
But what are its conditions?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Its condition is to be small

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
So rare that it's seen as

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Consistent with non-interacting

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
In all previous experiments

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
That is to say

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
You want this opportunity to be small

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Um

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
In all previous experiments

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
It looks like it doesn't work

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But you'll think

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
It's already so small

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Why do you have to assume it

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
There are other reasons

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Because we are

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Directly start

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Directly

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Um

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
We have a lot of other examples

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
The theory of physics

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
He predicted that there would be new examples

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
OK

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
It's not just what we know now

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Then these new examples

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
With

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Even their bigger and more complete

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
In theory, we know that part

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
The interaction is very weak

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Um

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Weak to all the other

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
It looks like it's

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
No interaction

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
But it's not completely non-interactive

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
This is the point

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
And then it's more important

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
That value

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Is what we should be able to measure

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
As long as we design a

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Dedicated experiment

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Um

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Because

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
In fact, we can't measure it

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
It's not that it doesn't interact

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
But we don't have a very sensitive way to measure it

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
So we always thought it was completely non-interactive

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
But in fact it is not

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Then if we measure it today

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
In what we think it should interact with us

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
This sensitive detector

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
There is still no interaction

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Then we can rule out the old theory

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Which we did many times

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I'll talk about it later

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
What is the current situation

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
The current situation is

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
The earth is over there

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Red is our experiment

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
We cover it on the earth

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Then we are in the dark matter

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
So as the center of the coordinate

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Dark matter has been hitting us

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Then we hope that many

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
One will hit our detector

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
And then hit the detector

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
The situation is actually quite serious

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It's like you hit the ball

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Come in and out

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Then he put a little bit

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
The kinetic energy is passed to the detector

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Then we have to measure this little kinetic energy

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Ok

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
This is what we have to do

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
How do we actually do it

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Ok, let's start slowly

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
That is to say our project

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
This is not our project

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
But I want to talk about it first

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
The two most popular methods on the earth

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Then I want to

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
In our work

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Why do we think this is better

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
This is the first method

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It's called Time Projection Chamber

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
The red line is dark matter

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Dark matter comes in many times

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
There was one time he hit the bucket

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Detector material in the basket

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Then like hitting the ball

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Then go out

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Then he passed the energy to the line like a caterpillar

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
What is that line

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Inside the bucket

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Is our so-called

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Target Matter

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Usually I don't know what matter is

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Anyway, it's Target Matter

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Then he passed a little energy

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
This kind of material

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
The atomic box of this element

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Then the atomic box

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
After recoiling some energy

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Pass this energy to him

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
The electrons on the track

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
The electrons will move

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Then it will drop

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Then it's the yellow line of the caterpillar

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
OK

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Then this flash of light

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Will spread out

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Will be above and below

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
PMT

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
PMT is called Photon Multiplier Tube

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Basically it is very sensitive

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Light sensor

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
You can measure that light

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Then I just said

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
He hit it

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Then pass the absorbed energy to the electrons and drop it

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Then you know that the moon

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
The light coming out is a fixed color

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Is a fixed energy

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
So you look at the energy of this color

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
How strong it means

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
How many electrons are there

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Then you can reverse

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
How much energy did he eat

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
OK

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
This is

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
The first signal

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Then the second signal is what I just said

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
He will have an electron moon

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Then the moon of the electron

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
In addition to this kind of falling

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It will have a certain ratio

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
OK

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
What about these electrons

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
He is in this vertical direction

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Put a very, very strong power plant

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Is that I wrote there

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It's probably thousands of volts per centimeter

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
So one you look at the following picture

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
One person is so big

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
The vertical direction of the barrel is probably tens of thousands of volts

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
He used this very strong power plant

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The electron is pulled all the way to the bottom

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Just drag it all the way

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Drag it all the way to the top

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
There is a virtual caterpillar above

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
OK, that virtual caterpillar hit the detector

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
He has a secondary signal

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
So there is such a method

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Can you

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Then because he was pulled up

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Speed ​​is a fixed speed

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
It's probably a fixed speed

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Is the electron in

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Drifting speed

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
So you count that

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Flash, flash is basically a moment

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Just a flash and you'll see

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
To the speed of the electron

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The time difference in the middle

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Can you reverse the distance

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
OK, you know what I mean

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Then if you have a row of electrons being drifted

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Then the distance to each one is different

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
You reverse the whole thing and you get a track

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Then through this track

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
You can vary

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Roughly

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Different

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Hit your example

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Distinguish whether we already know

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
The particle hit us

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Or his behavior is consistent

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
We should have expectations for us

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
This is called Time Projection Chamber

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
What about his question

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
OK, let's talk about his advantages

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
His advantage is

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
That material is usually

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Liquified

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
What

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
That

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Xenon

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Or

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Where is it

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Argon

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
It's these two kinds of gas

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
So it's actually a very heavy element

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Then we

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
What about the elements that we know are heavy

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It's a bit like

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
If you hit a heavy thing today

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Hit the air molecules with you

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Then the air molecules will get more

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Energy or heavy things

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
It should be heavy

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
So if you hit it today

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Hit a heavier atomic box

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Then you can leave more energy

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Then we know that the energy is equal to the square of M

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
The square of the atomic box

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
So their signal is very big

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And they are actually easy to scale up

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Why scale up is important

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Because basically there is

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
How many Doppler Meters pass through your detector

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
How big is it with your detector

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
How many atomic boxes are there

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
So if you have a two-time detector

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Basically you

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
The rate of the expected signal should be twice

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
They are easy to put a lot of

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Super high voltage

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
It sounds crazy

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
But it's actually easy

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Basically

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
To summarize

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
State-of-the-art optimization

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Of a widely used

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Iron geophysics technology

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Invented in the 70s

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
OK

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
State-of-the-art optimization

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
This very widely used

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
What are the benefits

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
They can scale up very quickly

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
They know what problems they will encounter

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So currently their approach is

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
The most sensitive

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
In terms of event rate

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
OK

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
The second one

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Another one is Solid State Detector

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Why is this thing

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Let me talk about it

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
What you see on the picture now

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
The part I enlarged

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
That little metal box

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Inside the metal box

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It's the carton next to it

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
The blue thing

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Is a solid state detector

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Its principle is actually the same as

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
The etheric detector

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
You go in and hit it

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Then give it energy

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Energy makes it flash

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
OK, and then the flash

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
What about the light

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Can it pop out

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
And then the top and bottom of this picture

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
That label

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
It's called TES

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
TES is

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
We know the most sensitive detector on Earth

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
What is it

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
It's called Transition Edge Sensor

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I'll talk about it later

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
OK

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
It's very sensitive

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And then

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
In addition to this signal

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You can also get another signal

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's a deposit

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
It's basically heat

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It's heat in the crystal

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
If you think about it

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Then the heat will be passed out

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
But he put the whole box

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
It's empty

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Nothing

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
So heat can't be passed out

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Heat stays inside

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
OK

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
The only track that can be passed out

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
It's the top and bottom

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
It has two caterpillar wires

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
It will pass to heat bath

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
So you can eat all these heat

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Then measure the heat

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Then you

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Correlate these two signals

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
You can identify

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
What hit us

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Is it a particle we know

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Or a particle we don't know

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
OK

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
What's the benefit

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
This kind of solid state detector

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Can be operated under cryogenic temperature

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
For exquisite energy resolution

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
With ultra-low noise

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
What does it mean

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
OK

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
It can have a lot of

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Very special phenomena

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Our collaborators

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
In Berkeley

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
In different laboratories

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
That is to say

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
This kind of thing can play a lot of magic

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Recoil threshold depends on material property

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
You can invent

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Very exotic material

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Then let them eat

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
This

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
After hitting the ball

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Then how to give it to you

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Then you measure

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
OK

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I know that Chicago University is now leading

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
They are doing CCD

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
To put it bluntly

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
The CCD chip in your camera

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Take it to Dark Matter

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
After hitting it, it will leave the electrode

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Then walk a small line

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Different particles walk that line

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
The behavior will be different

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
So you can be very, very

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Accurate judgment

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
What kind of material

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
What kind of particle

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Then there is the superconductor

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I will talk a lot about this later

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Because we are doing superconductor

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
It is also a very sensitive material

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
What is graphene

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
What is special about graphene

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Its conductivity

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Is

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Not all the same

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
It's the same in every direction

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Like your

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Your guide is basically like this

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Graphene

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
It is on the same plane

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
The conductivity of six directions is zero

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Then

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
It's not zero in the other six directions

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Or it is

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Six-fold symmetry

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's very interesting

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
When your particle comes in

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
If it runs in the direction of that no electrode

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Run

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It can be as small as possible

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I can pull it

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I should just say

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
But there is a place

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
It's even weirder

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
It's superfluid

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
It's very sensitive

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Then there is

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
It's Fermi arc

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
This is what we did in Caltech

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
This thing

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
It's basically in a certain direction

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
That

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
It's also zero

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
You can imagine these things

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
They are all very super

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
But the problem is

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
You are the subject of research

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Instead of using it to study other people

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
So every moment

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
It's very, very expensive

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
OK

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
But why is this thing interesting

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I'll tell you later

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Its dilemma is

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Harder to scale up without meeting new challenges

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
While maintaining your budget and sensitivity

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
This is very

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
You know the biggest experimental background

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Is sensitivity

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
No, it's your budget

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
OK

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
So I just finished

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Time Projection Chamber

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
And Solid State Detector

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
This is a monoplot

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
It's the whole field

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
The current state

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
The arc

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Is your assumption

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
The quality of dark matter

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Why do I say assumption

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Because no one measured it

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
If you measure it, you know where it can be drawn

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
You assume

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
How heavy is the dark matter that can't be measured

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
OK

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Then you know

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
How heavy is your dark matter particle

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Then you know your dark matter halo

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
We stand in that halo

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
How heavy is the dark matter total

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
So you know

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
How many

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Particle in terms of number

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
The flux has been flowing through you

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Then you can't measure it again

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Then you can know that the chance of interaction with me

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Can't be greater than how much

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
So the arc is the chance of interaction

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Then every line you see

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Is the upper limit of that opportunity

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
That is

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
The interaction between dark matter and detector

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
The chance must be less than that line

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
If it's higher than that line

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
We should measure it

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
This is the logic of the picture

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
So it actually has two directions

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
One direction is you

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
We're going to make the detector bigger and bigger

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Like the Time Projection Chamber

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Then you can expect more events

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
If it's going to be measured

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
So if you can't measure it, you can keep the line down

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
It means that the higher the sensitivity

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
You still can't measure

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Then the other one is you

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
You can measure the smaller and smaller

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Energy

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Then can you know that

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Because very light particles hit you

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
The energy left is very small

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Then can you go to the left of this picture

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
To draw that line

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Because you know

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
You can measure this kind of energy

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
But you didn't measure it

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Then you can put it there

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
That limit

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
This part is the solid state

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
It's right there

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
This is the main direction of this field

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Everyone wants to push down

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
To make the detector bigger

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
But if you want to go to the right

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
If you push left

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
You need a better detector

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
That's right

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
What if you go to the right

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Ok

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
To the right is like this

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Why do we want to do a dedicated experiment

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
To measure dark matter

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Because we actually have a very very

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Strong machine

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
We have been using

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
It's a big magnet

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
When they built it

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
In addition to looking for the exposure

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
They actually want to find

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
The most important thing I think

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I think it's fair to say

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
The example of superposition theory

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
The example of superposition theory

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It used to be the best for dark matter

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
The most anticipated thing to happen

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Their goal

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Basically around TEV

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Or sub-TEV

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
So that's where I put the picture

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Then you will ask

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Do we want to measure them now

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
The answer is that LHC has not been able to measure

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
And it has exceeded

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
The earliest version

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
The original superposition theory

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
That is to say, we have basically

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
The original superposition theory

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
So there are a lot of superposition theories now

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
It's just looking at its original superposition theory

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
According to our continuous measurement

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
They think it's a

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Superposition theory should have

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
What new phenomenon

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Look at this thing

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So basically

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
You keep going down

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
To measure

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Superposition theory

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Is it wrong?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
But he can't measure

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
It's already weird

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
If you are interested

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
You can ask me

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
So now Susie's

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
The expectations are probably all on this map

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
You will be surprised

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Because almost all of them are in the places we have entered

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
So now a lot of new theories

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Come out

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
If it's not a superposition theory

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
It's another one we've never thought of

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
The dark side

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
It's like you know

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
The dark side

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
We can't see it

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
But it's very, very weak

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
It interacts with the world we see

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
But it's a completely stand-alone

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Dark world

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
It can have very light particles

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Then we have to have

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Very new technology

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Go to the left of this picture

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
So this is our goal

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Then you can see above

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
In the SSD frame

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
The four lines on the left

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
That's basically what we experimented with

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Four different operations

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
So we are the most leading in this place

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Then we are going to propose the next technology

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Push us down again

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
No, push it to the left

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Sorry

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
So this should be

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
OK, this is the last page

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
So the first part everyone has

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Any questions?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I know

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Dark Matter

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
It has its own interaction

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
This is

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Ok

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
This is our most popular theory now

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Called

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Let's talk about popular

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
This is a piece of cake

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Anyway, everyone is the most

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
The theory that people are pursuing in the experiment is

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
It's weakly interacting

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Massive particle

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Weakly is not in terms of

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Interact with us

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Interact with anything

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Including themselves

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
So WIMP is very weak

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
But in fact

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
It should be said that Dark Matter does not have to be very weak

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Like that

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
The latest paper published by He Shu-yu is SIMP

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
What is SIMP

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Strongly

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
He can strongly interact with himself

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
What is the problem with strongly interacting with yourself?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
If he can

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Strongly interact with himself

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
It's true

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
They may have something

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
They have their own

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Or whatever

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
They can condense into very small objects

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
This very small object

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
It will

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Run this

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
What is this called

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
This kind of super super

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
This kind of simulation

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
They run this

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Galaxy Evolution

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
If you let Dark Matter and Dark Matter

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Strongly interact

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
They will condense into very small objects

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Very fast

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
It can't form here

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Then

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Become our Dark Matter

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
It will become

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Dark Matter Planet

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Something like that

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I thought it would turn into a planet

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
As long as there is gravitational force

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Because this is related to the time of Evolution

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Because your

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
You know how strong the gravitational force is

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
It can condense

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
There is a process

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
But it can condense very quickly

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I think I missed one thing

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Astronomers now

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Their perception

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Is like this

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
At the beginning of the universe

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Things are very

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Average distribution in the universe

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Some places

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
A little bit more

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Then

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Dark Matter is a little bit more over there

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
They all come together

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Then it's Dark Matter Halo

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Then this Halo

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
To produce a local gravity

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
We already know

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Drag it over

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Become a current structure

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
So if this process

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Time speed

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
If there is a change

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
For example, it condenses very quickly

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
A very small one

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Then it will not be able to form

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
What we already know

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Or the density of the galaxy

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
In the universe

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
So I really want to ask the question is

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Will Dark Matter be used in the future?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Oh, there is such a theory

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and so

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Black hole is not a big concept

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Because the black hole is just based on gravity

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
So

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Black hole is still very strong

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
You will find

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
You can't see

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Matter

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
This is being done

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
but I

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
I have no idea

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
It sounds reasonable

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
But in fact, someone is doing this

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Someone is doing one thing

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
He can let

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Dark Matter is over there

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Then he said

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Dark Matter and Dark Matter

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Even if it doesn't work with us

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
You will be with yourself

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Let's say he will

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
This is the theory

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
After he annihilated

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
He can

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
It becomes a pair production

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
What else

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
But because there are many

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
And very tight

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
So even Dark Matter coupled to Standard Model

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
The chance is small

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
It will still have

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Very high

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Event rate

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
For example, Gamma Gamma

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
So they are looking at that kind of

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
A lot of quality

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
For example, we think our

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Our own

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
The center of the Milky Way is a super-heavy black hole

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
That

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
That's a hot spot

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It's a lot of time looking over there

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
And then look over there

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Gamma Ray

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Whether it's Spectrum or Ray

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Is there any

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Beyond us

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Normal Matter

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Then you can say over there

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Effectively there is a Dark Matter

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Black hole

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But this kind of experiment is also difficult to do

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Because you know that the black hole itself is a very

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Violent environment

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
So it's equal to

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Even if you see a lot of Gamma Ray

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
You can blame it all on your model

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Why didn't you run well

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
So they have a lot of uncertainty

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
But there are always people

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Because they are so old

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
You can say it's a pile of Dark Matter

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Black hole

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
And then there's Parallelization

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Then it becomes Gamma Gamma

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Then

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
But there is one

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
In Dark Matter

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Self-interaction has a

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Upper bound and lower bound

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
There are several upper bound and lower bound

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
If it's too weakly interact

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
It won't form a black hole

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Then you have no way

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Either

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Is to become

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
A galaxy where the black hole forms

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Or

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
If it's too strong

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
It will quickly become Dark Planet

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Dark Planet

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
You can expect

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
If there is a Dark Planet in a certain place

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
There will be a Dark Galaxy

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
This thing is done by someone

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
But it can't be done

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Like an experiment called AMS

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
The earliest

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
The purpose is to find

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Dark World

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Can't find it

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
So it has a bound

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
So they are now

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
You can still tune

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
But

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
There is a boundary

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I think

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Dark Matter strongly interacting

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Principle will cause

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
If there is a black hole

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
The black hole will be colored by various modes

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
If

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Dark Matter strongly interacting

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I think only half of the people

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
There should be Dark Matter

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Then you will find

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
If there is no way to measure

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Anyway

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Can you find

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Yes

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
This can be done

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
You said this black radiation

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I know what you mean

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
So what you are talking about now

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Black radiation is talking about

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Object black radiation

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Instead of the whole universe

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I don't know

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I don't know

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I don't know if it can be done

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
But it sounds like it can be done

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Because I don't know

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
How to observe

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Things in the sky

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Yes

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
That's it

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Any questions

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Next

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Technical

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Then

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
4 minutes

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
OK

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
So what are we doing

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Didn't I just say we do Solid State Detector

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
So what you see now is a crystal

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
OK

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
This is a crystal we know

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Then

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
What about the two folding lines

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Is Incoming Particle

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Then knock and run out

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Then the small one on the track

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
That's the electron

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
We know that Dark Matter will not have

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Electric charge

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Electric charge

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
But not electric charge

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Because if it has electric charge

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
It will work with light

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
So you see that knock

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
The electron on the side

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
That must be the particle we know

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
And it's a charged particle

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
So we look forward to Dark Matter

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
What should happen

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
You can knock the electron in the middle

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Oh, yeah, but you look at the size

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
It's easier to know

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
So this is a two-scale picture

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
You know, one is super-invincible

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Basically there is no electron

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
So we basically assume

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
As long as it knocks the electron

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
It must not be Dark Matter

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
So we put a piece of crystal

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Over there and let it knock

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
And then we're going to measure this

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
This

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
This energy

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
What do we know

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
What kind of crystal do humans grow the most

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Do you know

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Julia

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Julia

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
acid

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Of course not

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
That's what you grow the most

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
It's not what humans grow the most

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
The answer is that the crystal that humans grow the most

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
It's called a fine crystal

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
How can Taiwanese make a mistake?

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
It's weird.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
And the cost is very low

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
How to grow very clean

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
So our approach is to grow

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
We are

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I don't know how to say

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Fine crystal

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
And Germanium

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
It's the next one

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
These two are actually very good at growing, so the cost is very low

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
We can grow very big and very clean

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
And then after knocking it

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Did I just say

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
The first one I just did as an example

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
It will leave

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
This

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Ionization will produce light, right?

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
But the light of ionization

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
How much is the energy of ionization?

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Do you know

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
It's EV

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Right?

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
If you have a concept of electronics

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
For example, hydrogen is 13.6 EV

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
If it's a heavier atom

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Because the electrons are placed further

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
So the pull will be smaller

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
So it's less than 10

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Less than 10 EV

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
If it

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
The energy left is really small

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
If it's less than 10 EV

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Can we measure it?

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
It won't stay

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Because it can't even eat the energy of the most basic unit

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
What will it do

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
It will become one that keeps shaking

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
It won't knock things away

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
It will keep vibrating over there

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
When it vibrates, it becomes a kind of vacuum

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
We know that vacuum

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
It can actually be translated into a very fancy word

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It's called Fona, which is actually hot vacuum

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
We can measure this hot vacuum

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Our goal is to measure this hot vacuum

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
So measuring this hot vacuum

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Immediately put our threshold

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
From EV-ish

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Down to mini-EV

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Because the basic mode of a vacuum

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Is its frequency

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Multiplied by Brownian frequency

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Is its unit, its energy

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It's very small, it's mini-EV

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
So we immediately

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
From our detection threshold

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
From the crystal itself

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
EV becomes

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Our

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Can be used to measure

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
The threshold of this Fona detector

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
This thing has become

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
It's not a limit at all

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Then we will do another thing

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
When it has

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
We give it a very, very strong electric field

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Across this crystal

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
So it has a little bit of

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Electrode-eating energy

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
It will be pulled away violently

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Then pulled all the way to the top

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Just like the TPC you just saw

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
So basically we are doing TPC in the crystal

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
But we are not liquid

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
We are not solid

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
So this electron is being pulled all the way

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
It's not a fluid process

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
It's crazy to hit people all the way

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
So it's crazy to hit people

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
It will produce a bigger signal

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
More Fona

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
So it's a bit like an Amplifier process

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
So we use this method

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Can put

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Very small amount of signal becomes very large

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Now the question is

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
How do we measure it?

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
What is this for?

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
We know that the ultraviolet

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
It has a change in temperature

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Above this temperature, it is normal

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Under this temperature, it is ultraviolet

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
It's basically like a leap

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
The same process

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
OK

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
This is a very simple concept

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
The picture you see now

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Is a very carefully engineered

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Material for ultraviolet

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So you can see the slope

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Otherwise, it looks like a hammer line

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
If you put your ultraviolet

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Just control the temperature

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
The detector is in that place

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It becomes normal as soon as it eats energy

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Then the energy is dissipated by the heat

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Fall off immediately

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Basically it is very sensitive

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
This is what we are using now

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
This technology

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
What is its problem?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Its problem is

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
If you want to put a lot of

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Detectors today

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
On the surface of your big crystal

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
You can't

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
The surface of the detector

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
There will be no temperature gradient

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Right?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
You probably have half

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
It continues to be too hot

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Half of it is normal

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Then the other half is too cold

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
It doesn't have any sensitivity

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Because it falls in this

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
It falls in this

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
This area

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It won't produce this signal

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
For you to measure

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
But this is really a

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I can only say now

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Available technology state of art

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
So we spent a lot of

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
A lot of energy to use it

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Then adjust it to be usable

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
This principle is like this

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
it is good

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Actually

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
What will it look like?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
You see the picture in the upper right corner

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
That big piece is ours

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Our

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Wafer, you can say it is a wafer

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Actually it is a crystal

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It is not a semiconductor

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We operate it at 30 mK

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So it is electricity

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It is a source

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It is not a semiconductor

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Then its thickness

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It's not our super thin

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
But it has to be 20 inches

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
We are 3 inches

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
But it grew a big piece

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
The thickness is 3 cm

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Then we are above

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
In the way of light

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Put this TES

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
That's a lot of little ones

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Then enlarge it

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
This one next to it

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
You can see it

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
It has one, two, three, four

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Then there are eight

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Like a fan

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Then the black at the end of the fan

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It is TES itself

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
But why TES is so small

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Because the problem is

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
TES does not want

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It has a large

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Temperature gradient

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
So you have to

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
TES itself is very small

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Then you have to make another

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
A big piece

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Phonon absorber

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Put the heat in

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Then send it all to a very

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Small TES

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It is very

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So from the side

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Pink

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
The pink part is our crystal

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Our wafer

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
After sucking up

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
TES

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
This process is actually very complicated

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
And the cost is very high

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But this is not the most complicated part

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
The most complicated part is that its signal is still super small

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
It's so small that we can't

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Just measure DC

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Isn't there a bias?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
The answer is no, we can't measure

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So we have to use another one

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
It's also a very high-tech thing

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
High-tech

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
It's expensive, it's called Squid

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Squid here

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Then Squid

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The principle of this thing is that it can be measured to a very, very

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Small magnetic field

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
But the magnetic field is only in

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Oscillating field

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
So you become

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
We want to put our TES

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I circle it up and then connect an AC

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Current

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Then cross a

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Magnetic field

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Then the magnetic field will produce a magnetic field

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
For Squid

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
But we want to say

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Our TES is not heated

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Then it becomes useless

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
We want it to be pulled back to its original temperature

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
There is one next to it

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
This

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
The circuit

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
If today's TES is bigger

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
The current flowing through it

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Will become smaller because the current flowing through the next door

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Will become bigger

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
So its self-current heating will become smaller

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
But you continue to put it in a

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Cooling power

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Inside the refrigerator

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Its temperature will be pulled down

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
So this is very complicated

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Then couple to Squid

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Then go up and use Amplifier to magnify it

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So our TES

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Looks like this

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
What you see

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The one next to it is the size of a person

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
You can understand

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Middle

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
This little one by one

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Each one is the picture on the right

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
The lower half of the picture on the right

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Six boxes

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Is the box you just saw

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Then there are 31

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So there are 31 times 6, 186 pieces

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
This crystal

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Is in such a big experiment

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Then

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
We call it Tower

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
It's full of complicated and expensive

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Circuit

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Then we put it in Canada's

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Snow Lab, 2 kilometers underground

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
If you are interested, you can ask me why

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Underground

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Then Future

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
This is a summary

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Focus on low mass

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Then we

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
We hope it is very low threshold

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
There is no way to make single

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
A small elliptical TES becomes very sensitive

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So we want to put that

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
A lot of puzzles

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Connect it into a big piece

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Then use a single readout

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Let it become a

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Pixel, so a pixel is so big

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Actually, we only have 12 pixels

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It means that the fluctuation is averaged

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
it is good

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
What is his problem? His problem is

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Obviously our Reconstruct

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
The location of the collision

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
The location resolution is very bad

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Right?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So I want to speed up

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Speed up

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Then my projection does not speed up

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Then this is

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Different electronics need to be frozen at different temperatures

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
So we still have a super super expensive refrigerator

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
To control this temperature, then it is very wasteful

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
it is good

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
So what are we going to do?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
What you see now is a prototype detector

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I will talk about it quickly because it is basically

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Can't

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I don't want to talk about it

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
You see every dot

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
It's all a single pixel

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
OK

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
What about this pixel?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
You can see a line here

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
This line goes up like this

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Then down

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Then go up again

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Then come down again

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Read out all the signals of each dot

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
it is good

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Then it is all single pixel

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
It is not connected into a pixel

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It doesn't need cryogenic electronics at all

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Its signal can be measured directly

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
What is the reason?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
The reason is that we use superconductors

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Superconductors have no resistance

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But the superconductor has a resistance

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Why?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Because we know our

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Charge carrier

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
It is masked

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You are in normal electricity

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
What is it?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Inside the conductor

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
It is an effective mask

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Because it is in a

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Electrode inside the lattice

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It is a cooper pair inside the superconductor

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It is the same

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
There is a mask

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Then there will be a circuit

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
So let's measure this circuit

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
What is the best way to measure the circuit?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You say that good

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Then I will scan the whole frequency

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Then let's see the speed of its drop

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I know its slope

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I know how big the circuit is

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
The smartest way

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Is to make an oscillator

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
You help it with a capacitor

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Then it becomes like this

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
OK

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So you have a circuit

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Then you can use the incoming energy

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
The example here is light

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
But we are copper to phonon

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Then break it

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Break its cooper pair

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It changed its circuit

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
After changing its circuit

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The oscillating frequency of this oscillator

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
So its oscillating frequency

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Here will move

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Move away

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
From the side of this move

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
We know how much it has been broken

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Then we know the cooper pair

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So we know

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
How much energy do we need

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So what do you actually see?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
You put it on

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Network analyzer

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
You see a lot of peaks standing here

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Like a comb

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
This is not in the time domain

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Then the frequency domain

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
If a pixel is hit

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
It will move to the side

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Then the real device

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It's broken again

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It looks like this

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
A cable goes in

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
It's a waveguide

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
If you don't hit on

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Those resonant frequency

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
It's basically a one in one out

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
No problem

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
But hit on resonant frequency

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
There will be a very big drop

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So it's a waveguide

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
You can read all the pixels

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
So basically

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
On the CDMX crystal you just saw

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
12 pixels, we can make it 1000

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
No problem

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Summarize

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
This effect

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
This is our current status

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
It sounds easy

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
We just make a number

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Then we have 1000 pixels

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
There is no problem

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
What is the problem?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
What we do now

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Looks like this

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Resonance is very small

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Resonance is about 2dB

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Resonance

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
But our waveguide

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
It's very, very bad

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
20dB drop

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Continuous

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
We can make the waveguide

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Looks like this

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
The waveguide is about minus 5dB

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
But our

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Resonance is only about 1dB

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Anyway, it's all super bad

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Ok

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Then finally talk about what we want to do

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
That is

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
We know different superconductors

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
The binding energy of the cooper pair inside

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Different

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Then we know again

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Uh

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
What is our phonon energy

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
So if we choose

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Cooper pair binding energy

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Greater than

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
That phonon energy

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Phonon hits the cooper pair

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
It won't absorb, it will spit it back

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Because it can't break the smallest unit

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
So

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
If we put our waveguide

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Made of that kind of material

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But our detector is called KIT

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Kinetic Inductance Detector

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Made of material that can be broken

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Our 100% energy will

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Absorbed in the pixel

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So our resolution

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Should be very large

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
High

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
That's it

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
A little over time

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Actually, I said R&D, but I didn't say it

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Someone over there is talking

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm sorry

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
My wife told me to go grocery shopping

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Will this be recorded?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Will be recorded

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
It should be recorded

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
It doesn't matter

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Let's go

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Resolution

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Resolution

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Resolution

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Resolution

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Resolution

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Resolution

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Resolution

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Resolution

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
This question is actually like this

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
The first one is you want to put your

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Resonance Q factor

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Because the larger your Q factor

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
The more dots you have to scan

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Otherwise you won't see it

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Scan your Q factor

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
How big

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
What is the basis? How do you decide that?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Instinctively

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Just make the Q factor super big

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Because if it's super big, it means

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
It doesn't have a problem with its own detection resolution

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
But because you

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Knocked into the crystal

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Phonon

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Phonon will

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
It's just a shockwave, right?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
It has a

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
You know the shockwave divided by the size of the crystal

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It's probably the time it floats to the surface

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
So its wave shape

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
There's probably one

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
There's one

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
There's one in the frequency

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
There's a main band

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Today you want it to be coupled

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
To a certain

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Resonance

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Actually you have to do

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Conversion

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Convert to

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The width of the baseband is

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Equal to your bandwidth

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
So your

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Resolution actually depends on

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
How big your crystal is

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
So we actually

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Don't want it to be big

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It can't be too big

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Otherwise we will miss the phonon

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
That's probably

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
10 to the power of 4

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
10 to the power of 4

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And then we see how many pixels to put

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And then between each pixel

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
In order to keep it out of the way

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
You have to look at its spacing

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
How wide

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Then add this up and you can push

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Your whole

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Dynamic range

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
You have to measure a few points

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And then how fast

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Of course it has something to do with DAQ

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I have a question

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
You said a

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
You said a

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
What does it mean

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Actually

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Waveguide is a very fancy word

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
But it's actually a wire

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The wire is actually waveguide

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
When you appreciate this thing, you feel that the wire is super powerful

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Just good

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I go back to that page

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
This picture

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
You put the one next to it

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
The Tai Chi picture is all gone

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
There's a wire, isn't there

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And then there's a bucket here

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Each bucket is a pixel

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And then that pixel

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It's a

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
LC circuit

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
You can think of it as

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
It's a resonator

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
It's a very, very narrow band

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Bandpass

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And it's super bandpass

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
That is to say, when your frequency

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Just fall in

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
That

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
The frequency

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Your signal will not flow from the beginning

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
To the end

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
You will flow from the beginning to this side

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And then you just turn it all the way down

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
OK, so

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
What about this picture

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
You can think of this picture as

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
The signal you take out

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
The signal you put in

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
So

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
This line is 1.0

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
That is to say, there is no hit

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
When the resonator

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
How much in, how much out

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
What I'm talking about now is an ideal situation

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
But it's not an ideal situation

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
But when it goes in

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
The frequency it goes in

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
It just happens to be from this

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
It will show up all the way down

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
So this will go straight

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
To the bottom

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Theoretically, it should be super 5DD

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
So it will become a number

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Basically, that's it

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Is this number picture a one-shot

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Or does it always have a frequency

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Or is it always

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
You can think of me sending a frequency

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And then send a frequency

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
This is a way to do it

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
But another way is like this

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Is that you send a signal in

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And then the signal that comes out

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Do a Fourier transform

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
So you have to send in all the frequencies at once

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So the AC next to you

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Is to send in all the frequencies

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Yes, but it will be slower

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It should be said that its resolution is lower

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Sorry, it's not slower, it's lower

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
So we usually

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Take the detector

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And then do this once

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
See all the numbers

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Where is that one by one

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And then we send a lot of

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Those tones

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Do you know what I mean

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
So we actually

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Just delete a lot of

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
The bottom of the flat line

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
So our DAQ will be much faster

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
But yes, that's probably it

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
It has its problems

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
That's it

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
At least for people

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
It's a one-shot time for people

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I can hear you

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I'm Zhang Jianping

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
You're Zhang Jianping

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
What else

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Are you sleeping

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
What's the problem

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
That's it

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I think you've been talking about it

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It seems that basically everyone is

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Mostly from the hardware

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
To

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
To change

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Have you ever thought about this

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
In fact, you can

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
The software part of the statistics

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Can do a little help

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Because I feel like you're in the front

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
The chamber

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
It's a more continuous way

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
It's a continuous one

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But it still has to knock things

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
But it's more continuous

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But when you get to the back

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
When it becomes the transition edge

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
It's like

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
We want to measure a person

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
How perverted he is

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Give him a perverted meter

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Assuming continuous

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
But to see if he's going to kill

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
It becomes a one-off

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Do you know what I'm talking about

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Wait a minute

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Do you know that speaking will be recorded

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
It doesn't matter

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I'm not talking about it today

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Anyway

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
So your curve will become

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
This should not be called long linear

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But this is the

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Line of logistic regression

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
So in fact

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
It's a one-off

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
You spend a continuous line

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
One or one straight line

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
In the middle

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Then I see you feed him

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
It's just looking at his results

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
But actually if you put it

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Because your problem now is

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
My feeling is

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Because Dark Matter is a

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
It's more of a sample study

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Because your signal is rare

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
If I'm not mistaken

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
There are some

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Processing sample

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Information

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Can increase sensitivity

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
With the accuracy of the time

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Including if you use some

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Like bootstrapping

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Or use some

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Regularization

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
To

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Regularize his signal

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
It's actually

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Bayesian method

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
You can increase

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Artificially increase its accuracy

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Although it sounds weird

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Because you actually

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It's not really seeing anything

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
No, it's not weird

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
You know what I want to use

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
But it doesn't seem to work

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Do you know

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It can be used

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I'm here

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Because the question is a bit long

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
So

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I repeat it again

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
So the problem with the sample

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
In addition to talking a lot of dirty words in the middle

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Because there are not many

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
His problem is like this

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
That is to say, we are now doing detector

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Then measured

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
If you don't measure it, you don't measure it

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
But can we use

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Software method

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Our

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
General

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Experimental sensitivity

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Is that what you mean?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Correct

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
The answer is yes

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And when you have

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
One or two hundred people doing an experiment

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
This part will have one hundred people

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Do something like this

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Ok

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Why are we

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Now focus on this part

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
There is actually a very interesting reason

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
When you start doing dark matter

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
You will find out

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
The environment you live in

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
The air you breathe

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
The pen you use is super invincible

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Very radioactive

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
OK

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So the problem is

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
We can now

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Measure the signal

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Then use the software you just said

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
To correct it

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Whether it is correct

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
His true location

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
True energy

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
But we eventually

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
There will be a problem

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
We want to be very clear

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Confidence level is very high

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
This is my detector

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Radioactivity

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Or the real dark matter

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Then we

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Now found

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
The most important

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
To distinguish this

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
The difference is

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Even if it is a neutral particle

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
As long as it is

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
The particle we know

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
The depth of his special detector

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
It must be lighter than dark matter

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
why

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Because his interaction must be bigger

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So he was blocked earlier

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
So we are very, very

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
To know exactly

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Where is he really hitting

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Then we just

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Buy a super expensive crystal

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Then he is one-half outside

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
The signal over there

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Don't use

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It's a waste of money

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
So we want to be very, very good

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Location resolution

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Location resolution

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
The most important thing we are now

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
The biggest limit is

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
We have six pixels on one side

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
What do you want

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So our limit is not

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
The reconstruction of our software

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Not good

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Your detection is basically

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
The biggest limitation

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Our software

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Video

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Talk about this

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I don't want to talk about the content

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You can see the picture

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
The star next to it hasn't come out yet

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
The star next to it

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
The blue part

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Is in one of them

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Surface detector

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
The red part is in another

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Surface detector

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I just said

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
There are six pixels on one side

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
So there are twelve

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
The six pixels are actually arranged

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
A triangle like this

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Plus one in the middle

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Then there are two rings on the outside

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
If there are two rings on the outside

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
He has measured any signal

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
We think he is on the surface

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
We just threw it away

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
So you didn't see it here

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
And then in the middle

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But there are a lot of triangles

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
You can see

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
If that size is six

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
If it's three inches

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
The width is actually super wide

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
So the resolution is super bad

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
If you want to do this

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
You either have to dig

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
To the very edge

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Let you go

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
This thing is

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
We know the particle

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Or we have to find the particle

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
The confidence level is very low

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Or you have to dig a lot

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Either way is not the most efficient way

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
So we have to do this on the hardware

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It's the most you're right

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
It's true that it's true on the software

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But it's relative

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Change the hardware directly

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
His effectiveness

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Too much difference

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
But you're right

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Do you have any questions?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I just turned off the microphone

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
So speak slower

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I'll ask you again

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
You just

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
The new design

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Is to use

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Six L and C

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Then it looks like

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
You can do 40 on the hardware

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Then you just said that

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
You can't do too high

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Then you need to consider

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
His loss

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
That is to say, he changed to this

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Super early

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
It's broken

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Ok

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Good question

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
The answer is

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
This is the problem of TES

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Not our problem

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Why?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Because TES

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
He just needs to operate near TC

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So there is a little bit

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Local heat accumulation

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Will have a big impact on the function of the detector

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
But what we want

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Turn on kinetic inductance

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
The more the better

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
So

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
TC is 1K, 2K material

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
We freeze it to 20mK

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
This way

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Our kinetic inductance is very large

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
And

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Thermal fluctuation

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
There is no impact

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So this is one of the advantages of TES

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But yes

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
This is the problem of TES

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Any other questions?

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
If not

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Thank you
