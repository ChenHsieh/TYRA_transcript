00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to this week's Tera Talk. I'm your host, Yu-Wei Lin.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm pleased to welcome our speaker today, Louis.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He is currently a Ph.D. student at St. Louis University of Washington.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
His main research projects include intellectual property rights, law, anti-Thorax law, and economic analysis.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Before he was a Ph.D. student, he was an intern at Winston & Stone, a law firm in Taiwan and abroad.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He also analyzed the legal process of Taiwan clients and non-authorized individuals in the U.S. and East Texas courts.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Louis is also passionate about entrepreneurship.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He is a member of the China Entrepreneurship and International Exchange Association.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He regularly holds conferences and talks in Taiwan to promote entrepreneurship.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Today's topic is based on his background in law and entrepreneurship.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Louis, please turn on your microphone.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you, Yu-Wei, and thank you, Tera, for inviting me.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Last year, I also talked about copyright issues in my talk.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Today's topic is completely different.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This topic has a little to do with my graduate thesis, but it is not all of my graduate thesis.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Instead, I use different angles to analyze the case study of my graduate thesis.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:24,000
As you can see on the screen, my graduate thesis is co-authored by a friend from Shanghai Fudan University's School of Management.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:47,000
My thesis focuses on the use of bundling in the market.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The main details of my thesis will take about 30-40 minutes.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This topic has a background, so I will talk about it in detail.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm just curious about what kind of people are listening to my talk today.

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I will talk about it in detail.

23
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In fact, it is not so difficult to compare things in the Department of Sociology and Law.

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Today, I will use some mathematical things, but I will not show you the whole process.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't think I need to show off.

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I just want to show you what our results are.

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't have much to say.

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Some of the things I study need to be understood by everyone.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If some of you are interested in this industry or already know it very well, please add it if I am wrong.

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What I want to talk about today is actually related to modern chip.

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Modern chip is the so-called communication chip industry.

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In fact, I found this Samsung Galaxy S4 on the Internet.

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The structure of the picture is like this.

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One of them is modern chip.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What are the benefits of modern chip?

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The advantage is that after I installed this modern chip in my mobile phone today,

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
For example, as we all know, the communication standards of 2G, 3G, and 4G will not have the so-called problems that cannot be used in different countries.

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Just imagine that if you buy an iPhone today, whether it is iPhone 4, iPhone 5, or iPhone 6,

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The result may be that your communication standards are different today, or your communication bandwidth is different.

40
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In fact, this is very blind.

41
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How to solve this difference in bandwidth or communication standards?

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Modern chip plays a very important role.

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Another example is that everyone is in the United States.

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I assume that everyone is in the United States.

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
For example, if you run to some remote places with your mobile phone, it is not 4G that covers the range, but 3G or even 2G.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But you can still make calls and you can still go online.

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's just that it's very slow.

48
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How is this function done?

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
In fact, this is the function of modern chip.

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It can still operate under different standards and under different levels.

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
However, its operating function is limited.

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is the function of modern chip.

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It can be seen that a mobile phone has a lot of functionality.

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But the value of a smart phone is to be online.

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Modern chip plays a very important role.

56
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What I want to discuss today is a small communication chip problem.

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's take a look at the situation of this industry.

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is a total of 1.2 years.

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
From 2007 to 2012, there were several leading companies in the modern chip industry.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We can probably see that Qualcomm has been playing a leading role in this field.

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2007 to the 4G in 2012.

62
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Later, I will show the state of the 5G patent layout.

63
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role.

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2012 to the 5G in 2012.

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This is the current state of the industry.

66
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:43,000
From 2012 to now, we can see that the green part of the patent is high-speed communication.

67
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In fact, it occupies a very high position in the patent layout of modern chip, including radio front, modulation, and core networking.

68
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
From these pictures, we can see the current state of the industry.

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For example, InterDigital and BlackBerry have all disappeared.

70
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
These are all in the past.

71
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The former dragon head is no longer in use.

72
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can see that there is a lot of communication in the green part.

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The gray part is Intel, which we will discuss today.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In fact, it is not as good as Qualcomm in terms of patent layout, especially 5G.

75
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So we can simply summarize that Qualcomm is almost in monopoly in the modern chip industry.

76
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because most of the chips are in the patent layout of most of the modern chip sales, and the quality of its products is maintained.

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So the state of its maintenance is very good.

78
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Most of the big manufacturers, including Apple users, mostly use Qualcomm's modern chip for their important suppliers from iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, and iPhone 7.

79
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But the problem is that these so-called communication standards, which I just mentioned, such as 2G, 3G, and 4G standards.

80
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In fact, these standards have a lot of patent layout behind them, and the negotiation process of each party.

81
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You always have to decide which standard to use. It must be of good quality and easy to promote. I think everyone can understand this.

82
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In fact, there are these international standard organizations behind the standard promotion.

83
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So back to the picture just now, let's come here first.

84
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think this picture is very important in the background of my law school.

85
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why is it important? Because it explains the relationship between people of different levels.

86
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because on my left is IEEE, ITU, and ETSI. These three are very important technical standards organizations that designate 4G and even 5G.

87
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
These technical standards organizations play a role in promoting technical standards.

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The core concept is that I want my 4G standard or 5G standard in the future to be able to be used by many people.

89
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's not that I only let a group of people use it. A small group of people using it is not a standard.

90
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So it must be that everyone can recognize this thing. Yes, it's good, it's easy to use, and it's efficient.

91
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The standard of 5G and 4G can be slowly promoted because the industry recognizes it.

92
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But behind it, as I said before, it involves a lot of different patent layouts.

93
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because it is impossible for a company to have all the patents of technical standards.

94
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It must be segmented. It must be cut into many segments. Some companies specialize in that.

95
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:43,000
For example, now everyone sees Radio Front End. Although the patents of Ericsson and Qualcomm are similar, it also means that there are many things that Qualcomm can't do.

96
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So today I want to talk to you about this kind of industry.

97
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Such patents are called SEP.

98
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
SEP stands for Standard Essential Patents.

99
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Those who have SEPs, such as the manufacturers I mentioned earlier, including Ericsson, Qualcomm, and Intel, are considered SEPs.

100
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Everyone will think that if everyone in the world uses this standard, then he can raise the price.

101
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Because people all over the world use it, then I'm not turning over.

102
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In order to prevent this from happening, it should be said that preventing it from turning over is one point.

103
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Another point is that it can take advantage of the position of patents in the market.

104
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Because patents are a kind of legal monopoly, everyone can understand it this way.

105
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Most people may not study law.

106
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If you ask me how to understand patents, the way to understand it is very simple.

107
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
A patent is a legal right for you to have this kind of monopoly.

108
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It allows you to have the right to monopolize within a period of time for your technology and patent.

109
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So it is a limited monopoly.

110
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:34,000
After these people have patents, if these patents or technologies are used as standards, then they can raise their prices indefinitely.

111
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Isn't that against the purpose of these technical standards organizations that I just mentioned?

112
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Because the price is too high, no one can use it.

113
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If I want to pay so much, who will think about my rights?

114
00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So, in this atmosphere, in this concept, all technical standards organizations in the process of setting standards,

115
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:14,000
remember that this structural organization requires all SEPs to provide an LOA.

116
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
LOA is the condition that you have to accept the conditions provided by the technical standards organization.

117
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
For example, you want to become a 3G standard, or a 4G standard, or a 5G standard in the future.

118
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But your patent price must be within a certain range.

119
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But we call this range of conditions FRIEND.

120
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let me stop for a moment.

121
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because I really can't see everyone's conversation.

122
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Does anyone have any questions now?

123
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's take a look.

124
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It seems that no one has asked me a question.

125
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If you have any questions, you can ask me at any time, it doesn't matter.

126
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If there are no questions, I will continue to talk.

127
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because I found that there is no social science background, I have to speak particularly slowly.

128
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The full name of FRIEND is Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory Licensing.

129
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
FRAND is included in the conditions provided by all technical standards organizations.

130
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This condition actually includes a lot.

131
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If you are interested, you can check it.

132
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
One of the most important conditions is that your patent must be used as a standard.

133
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Your technology must become my 5G standard.

134
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You submit your patent application.

135
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But you must accept the restrictions of FRAND.

136
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Because, as I said, you can't raise the price too high.

137
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If the price is too high, no one will use it.

138
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Another point is the following box.

139
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The following box is the implementer.

140
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What I mean by implementer is, for example, our great HTC.

141
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
HTC may have some patents, but it is not a player.

142
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
HTC is not the patent holders we saw in the picture just now.

143
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's just that I'm an authorized person, and I use the technical standards they have, and I use the technology.

144
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We call it implementer.

145
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It is not a person who develops modern chips.

146
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Simply put, HTC is also.

147
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Apple is also.

148
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Of course, if you are concerned about this industry, Apple has already released a message that it wants to step in.

149
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It also wants to make its own chips.

150
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If you are interested in this in the future, you can talk to me.

151
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's a matter of whether you can do it or not.

152
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There are still some entry barriers.

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Back here, you have to accept that you have to become a technical standard.

154
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You have to accept FRAND.

155
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Second, the condition of FRAND will not be limited to the relationship between you and the technical standard organization.

156
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It will have a third-party interest.

157
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We call it a third-party interest contract.

158
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This third-party interest contract means that after I make these terms with the technical standard organization today, the efficiency of these terms will affect the third person.

159
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The meaning of the third person is that it includes HTC, because it is not an owner of SEP.

160
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It is not an owner of SEP, but its efficiency will affect the third person.

161
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So everyone can enjoy the benefits of FRAND.

162
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
In other words, the third party, for example, HTC, I also have to use these technical standard organizations.

163
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
These 3G, 4G, or 5G patents.

164
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You can't because I'm not in this technical standard organization, or I'm not part of this technical standard organization.

165
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So these SEP owners raise my price very high.

166
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Basically, these SEP owners join the technical standard organization and submit their patents to the technical standard organization as a prerequisite for 5G standards.

167
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The problem is that you have to accept these two conditions.

168
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The first is that the price of your patent must be within a reasonable range.

169
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The second is that it will affect the third party.

170
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
As long as everyone wants to use this technical standard, everyone can enjoy the benefits of FRAND.

171
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Instead of saying that because you are in a technical standard organization, I will give you a discount, and no one else will.

172
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But here I make a signal.

173
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That is, my research is in this area.

174
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The source of all the problems is here.

175
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Because there will be so-called market monopoly problems.

176
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Why?

177
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Think about it, who are the members of all the technical standard organizations?

178
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Isn't it the so-called industry leaders?

179
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Because who sets the technical standards?

180
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It must be the industry leaders, right?

181
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Among these industry leaders, if everyone gathers together to have a meeting.

182
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But Taiwanese people may not know much about this law.

183
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It seems that many manufacturers sit in line together to eat and discuss things.

184
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It seems very simple, there is no legal problem.

185
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I tell you, the problem is here.

186
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The problem is that the U.S. Anti-Trust Law and the so-called EU Competition Law strictly prohibit this matter.

187
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Because this prohibition is actually the so-called joint pricing behavior.

188
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Because the U.S. has a lot of different review standards in the so-called Anti-Trust Law.

189
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
In fact, the most taboo thing is like the joint pricing I just said.

190
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A bunch of competitors in the same industry.

191
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
For example, we just said that Ericsson also has a patent.

192
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It is also in the ETSI, ITU, and IEE.

193
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Qualcomm is also a member.

194
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Because everyone submits their patents and then joins their members.

195
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So this group of people are all competitors in the same industry.

196
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
All set standards here.

197
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Of course, as a government role, the government will be very worried about this matter.

198
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Are you guys doing it?

199
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why? Think from another perspective.

200
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Friend is what we just talked about.

201
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The problem with Friend is that I promised you today.

202
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I promised you to set the price of Friend.

203
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But this is a requirement for all SEP holders.

204
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And this technical standard organization is afraid.

205
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
For example, if I ask for 5%, I ask for the price of Friend.

206
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It is called 5% of each product sale.

207
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
5% may be too high.

208
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
1% is called Friend.

209
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Think about it.

210
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
If this is the case.

211
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What is the price of Friend?

212
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What is the price of reasonable and non-discriminatory?

213
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
All people can only charge 1%.

214
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
In fact, from the perspective of the government, you will find it strange.

215
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why did you all create this RATE together?

216
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Is there a joint pricing behavior?

217
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This problem is stuck in the technical standard organization.

218
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I abbreviate SSO to make it easier for me to say.

219
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
SSO will be worried.

220
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If everyone is investigating me.

221
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Everyone is doubting me.

222
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Am I doing joint pricing?

223
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Because I said a sentence.

224
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The price of Friend is called 1%.

225
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Am I being investigated all day?

226
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So the problem is here.

227
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Although it is a very important organization.

228
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It created Friend.

229
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It requires everyone to accept Friend.

230
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But it is not responsible for the so-called pricing behavior.

231
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Because of this, what is Friend?

232
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can report to you.

233
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What is Friend?

234
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In the legal circle.

235
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There are many discussions in the paper of the Chamber of Commerce.

236
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Because no one dares to go to court.

237
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The court itself or the government unit.

238
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It has never dared to respond positively to this matter.

239
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Includes its definition.

240
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It has its own method of calculation.

241
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But every court in the United States.

242
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Are using different methods of calculation.

243
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So this thing is actually complicated.

244
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
In fact, today I will introduce this kind of background to you first.

245
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Because I think this thing needs to be explained to you first.

246
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Then his background state.

247
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then I can get into what we are studying.

248
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because of this, everyone will have the so-called level playing field.

249
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Everyone has a rough idea of ​​this matter.

250
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I know what I am studying.

251
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm getting into my stuff.

252
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This is easier for everyone to understand.

253
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Before we officially start talking.

254
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Before this very interesting case.

255
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let me ask you first.

256
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The simple industry I just introduced.

257
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Or some knowledge background.

258
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is there any problem with the introduction?

259
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
5 seconds.

260
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No problem so far.

261
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
No problem, very good.

262
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But if you have any questions, you are welcome.

263
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I also want to train.

264
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Talk to people in the legal field.

265
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
See what you think.

266
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
After having such background knowledge.

267
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We know that the technical standards have many patents.

268
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It is authorized to be restricted by the FRIEND regulation.

269
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Then it has a third-party regulation.

270
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So everyone can enjoy FRIEND.

271
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Then there is that we all know.

272
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
When selling, there are usually a lot of patents behind.

273
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
The problem has appeared.

274
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We all know that I just mentioned.

275
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Qualcomm is an industrial leader.

276
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Its modern chip quality is very good.

277
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It is also an Apple long-term supplier.

278
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But at the beginning of 2017.

279
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
FTC, the Federal Trade Commission of the United States.

280
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And Apple itself.

281
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Apple is its downstream manufacturer.

282
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It has sued Qualcomm for violating the Antitrust Law.

283
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Specifically, it has many claims.

284
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It has advocated many things.

285
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What I want to focus on today is.

286
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Qualcomm is on the so-called contract.

287
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
With everyone playing a so-called.

288
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It uses its market position.

289
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
To achieve its goal of making profits.

290
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
How does it do this?

291
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
First of all, everyone sees this picture.

292
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
This picture is actually public.

293
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I didn't do it, it's not so beautiful.

294
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This picture is when Apple is suing Qualcomm.

295
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It added its content of this lawsuit.

296
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And its analysis chart.

297
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
How does Qualcomm violate the law?

298
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Basically, Qualcomm.

299
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Its practice is actually divided into two stages.

300
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Today, because of a little more time.

301
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't know how much time I have.

302
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But I'll talk slowly.

303
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It is actually divided into two stages.

304
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Qualcomm's two-stage behavior is the first.

305
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Qualcomm in 2007.

306
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Before officially becoming an Apple supplier.

307
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
In fact, it is with Apple.

308
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Uh, other assembly lines.

309
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Uh, including the so-called.

310
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We refer to this Fuskang.

311
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I take Fuskang as an example.

312
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Fuskang is Apple's.

313
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
This assembly line.

314
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It is actually Qualcomm itself.

315
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Uh, the assembly line of Apple.

316
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
There is already a contract.

317
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Why? Because you want to assemble.

318
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You will also use Qualcomm's patent.

319
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because Qualcomm's patent layout is very wide.

320
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
We just.

321
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
In fact, I just gave a simple example.

322
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
In fact, if you look at it.

323
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Qualcomm's patent layout.

324
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It has exceeded the scope of the modern chip itself.

325
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It contains the entire technical standard.

326
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
OK, this is what he said.

327
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Uh, I also believe that.

328
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Because if you go to check Qualcomm.

329
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This company was established in 1985.

330
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Then continue to be in.

331
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Uh, the communication chip industry continues.

332
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
To do research and development.

333
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Then continue to.

334
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Uh, expand his career.

335
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So he actually.

336
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The impact is not just in the modern chip itself.

337
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It also includes the whole.

338
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It also includes itself.

339
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Uh, it also includes technical standards.

340
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
OK.

341
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So he was originally Qualcomm.

342
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He is cooperating with Apple suppliers.

343
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Ah, because Apple suppliers.

344
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
For example, I just said Fuskang.

345
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Fuskang, he actually does more than Apple products.

346
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
He also does other.

347
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Do HP, right?

348
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You do other products.

349
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
HP's, for example.

350
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Will also use Qualcomm's chip.

351
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Uh, it will also use Qualcomm's patent.

352
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Or technology also needs to be done.

353
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Uh, patent authorization.

354
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So it becomes.

355
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
In fact, Qualcomm already has.

356
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
With other Apple suppliers.

357
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
To do cooperation.

358
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So why did I mention Apple suppliers?

359
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
His complexity is here.

360
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Because Qualcomm, he did one.

361
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The fun thing is that he is.

362
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Before becoming an Apple supplier.

363
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
He told this Apple supplier.

364
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I just said.

365
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I signed a contract with you.

366
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I put this.

367
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You want to assemble this Apple product.

368
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Okay, I'll take this patent with you.

369
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But what about the content of this patent?

370
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The scope is not the content.

371
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Specific details.

372
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
How is it?

373
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Uh, it's NDA.

374
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Non-disclosure agreement is not open.

375
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
OK, what about other things?

376
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
If I think I'm because of this.

377
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The relationship is actually a bit complicated.

378
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
To put it simply.

379
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Qualcomm, I'm with Apple today.

380
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Uh, the assembly plant of Apple.

381
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Ah, and then the patent authorization.

382
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Ah, these assemblies.

383
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
He can actually come back and ask Apple for this.

384
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Want this reimbursement.

385
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That is to say, because the assembly plant.

386
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
He doesn't think he has to.

387
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Take more of this responsibility.

388
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Because this contract is actually negotiable.

389
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But in the real world.

390
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I can tell you.

391
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Report to everyone.

392
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
In fact, most of the money.

393
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Uh, there are a lot of parts.

394
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
A lot of money has become.

395
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Apple to squeeze.

396
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But of course Apple will say.

397
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I didn't squeeze them.

398
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Of course, in this case.

399
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Qualcomm is Qualcomm.

400
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Uh, Qualcomm claims.

401
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Oh, I have been with these assemblies today.

402
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Cooperation.

403
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I asked them to pay these.

404
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Give me the rights to patent authorization.

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
If you don't want to.

406
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You can go back to Apple.

407
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You don't have to pay for this.

408
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Does Apple pay for you?

409
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But the fun thing is here.

410
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Qualcomm, I just said that Qualcomm.

411
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He is SEP.

412
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In fact, his SEP is a.

413
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
There must be a range.

414
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
His range is the so-called.

415
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
This friend.

416
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
He is more than that.

417
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Fair and reasonable.

418
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He must be reasonable.

419
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And not discrimination.

420
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I went to these assemblies.

421
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Signed the NDA.

422
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
If you are Apple.

423
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Then there is a result.

424
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I want to use.

425
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
For example, I want to use Qualcomm chips.

426
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Then the result.

427
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I use Qualcomm chips.

428
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
All those assemblies below me.

429
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Have been asking me for money.

430
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Qualcomm has already collected more money from me.

431
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Then you have to compensate me.

432
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Then how much compensation.

433
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Then how much according to the contract.

434
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Why is this price?

435
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Those assemblies.

436
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Apple asked those assemblies.

437
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Why is this price?

438
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I can't tell you.

439
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Because Qualcomm said this is NDA.

440
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I can't tell you.

441
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So this is wonderful.

442
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
The first stage is to say.

443
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Qualcomm went to Apple's assembly plant.

444
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Wanted a sum of money.

445
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Then the source of this money is.

446
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
NDA is not public.

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That becomes.

448
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Because the account is there.

449
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Qualcomm asked me for so much money.

450
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Then Apple.

451
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Transferred to Apple.

452
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Then Apple.

453
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I can only admit it.

454
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Apple thinks it's strange.

455
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Is this price reasonable?

456
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Ask my assembly plant.

457
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He can't say.

458
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's weird.

459
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Apple actually wants to get rid of this.

460
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
How much did I pay Qualcomm?

461
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't know.

462
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I don't know my source.

463
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't know my calculation method.

464
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I just kept paying for it.

465
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He thinks it's unreasonable.

466
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Feel the price.

467
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
His internal manager.

468
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Or lawyers or lawyers.

469
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Think this price may be unreasonable.

470
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Qualcomm wants too much money.

471
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
He decided to talk to Qualcomm directly.

472
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So this picture is later.

473
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Apple talked to Qualcomm.

474
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
After he talked.

475
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Apple said I can sign a contract with you.

476
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The gray part below.

477
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
BCPA, TA, FTA, SDA, ASDA.

478
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
These are all abbreviations of this contract.

479
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
BCPA, for example.

480
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
His full name is.

481
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement.

482
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
TA is Transition Agreement.

483
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Anyway, he is an abbreviation.

484
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Anyway, he is an abbreviation.

485
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
In these contracts.

486
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Qualcomm and Apple.

487
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
They went to talk.

488
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Apple feels bad.

489
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You go through the middle.

490
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I want to talk to you directly.

491
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I want to talk to you directly.

492
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Qualcomm agreed.

493
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
After he agreed, he signed these contracts.

494
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But he added some conditions in these contracts.

495
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But he added some conditions in these contracts.

496
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
These conditions are fun.

497
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What you see now.

498
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Rebate Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement.

499
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
These two.

500
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It sounds very simple.

501
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
In fact, the specific content looks like this.

502
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
This is the lawsuit.

503
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
This is mentioned in Apple's lawsuit.

504
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Of course, it contains a lot of confidential documents.

505
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't know what confidentiality is.

506
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't know what confidentiality is.

507
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Mainly these two.

508
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
One is that you have to promise me.

509
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You want me to provide.

510
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You want me to provide you with chips.

511
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You want me to provide you with chips.

512
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
He is the US Federal Trade Commission.

513
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
He is the US Federal Trade Commission.

514
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
No license.

515
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
No chip.

516
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
No license.

517
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
No license.

518
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
He said.

519
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You want me to supply my high-quality modern chip.

520
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But you have to accept the price.

521
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But you have to accept the price.

522
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But you have to accept the price.

523
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You have to accept the price of my SEP.

524
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You have to accept the price of my SEP.

525
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Then he found out inside Apple.

526
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It seems to be a bit higher than the market.

527
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But Qualcomm said.

528
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
But Qualcomm said.

529
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
What can you do?

530
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If you don't accept this price.

531
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Then I can't provide you with this modern chip.

532
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
These two are bundled together.

533
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The so-called bundled together.

534
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm going to sell you a modern chip today.

535
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But you have to accept.

536
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Apple's own claim.

537
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
In fact, this case is still running.

538
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
In fact, this case is still running.

539
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The so-called price is not FRIEND.

540
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The so-called price is not FRIEND.

541
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
The so-called price is not FRIEND.

542
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.

543
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.

544
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.

545
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But because Qualcomm has good quality.

546
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And then he is a market leader.

547
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And then there's a lot of patent planning.

548
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So Apple has to accept this.

549
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So Apple has to accept this.

550
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
This is the first point.

551
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The so-called no license, no chip policy.

552
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The so-called no license, no chip policy.

553
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Apple must accept his contract terms.

554
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Apple must accept his contract terms.

555
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
In exchange, you say, okay, you want me to use his.

556
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I use Qualcomm's modern chip.

557
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I use Qualcomm's modern chip.

558
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But I have to accept a higher FRIEND price.

559
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I have to accept a higher FRIEND price.

560
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You want me to supply this, right?

561
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel.

562
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel.

563
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I didn't treat you badly.

564
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He provides a rebate.

565
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
He provides a rebate.

566
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
This rebate is a fixed amount of price.

567
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
This rebate is a fixed amount of price.

568
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Because you've been my client for a long time.

569
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Because you've been my client for a long time.

570
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Use my communication chip.

571
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Then I'll give you a discount.

572
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Then I'll give you a discount.

573
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Then I'll give you a discount.

574
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Because everyone is not learning law or business.

575
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Because everyone is not learning law or business.

576
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
All the discounts in the mall.

577
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
All the discounts in the mall.

578
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'll give you a sum of money.

579
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
In fact, there are conditions.

580
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Qualcomm said yes.

581
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Apple said yes.

582
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You give me a discount.

583
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But Qualcomm said yes.

584
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'll give you a discount.

585
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But you have to accept the following conditions.

586
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The following conditions are two.

587
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The following conditions are two.

588
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
The following conditions are two.

589
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What are the conditions?

590
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You have to use my communication chip.

591
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You have to use my communication chip.

592
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You can't jump the grass.

593
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You can't use Intel.

594
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You can't use Samsung.

595
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You can't use Samsung.

596
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You can't use my competitor's chip.

597
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You can't use my competitor's chip.

598
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It sounds reasonable.

599
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It sounds reasonable.

600
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The second point is that it's fun.

601
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You can't go to any government unit.

602
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You can't go to any government unit for investigation.

603
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You can't make a lawsuit.

604
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Let's start the debate.

605
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
First, I provide a discount

606
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
First, I provide a discount

607
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But you have to use my chip.

608
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But you have to use my chip.

609
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Second, he says,

610
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Second, I provide a discount

611
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Second, I provide a discount

612
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But you can't sue me.

613
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But you can't sue me.

614
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
These are two points.

615
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
One is that you can't investigate me.

616
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Completely lock you up.

617
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The other point is that

618
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You can't jump to another place.

619
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You can't jump to another place.

620
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You can't make a patent lawsuit.

621
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You can't make a patent lawsuit.

622
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This makes Apple very upset.

623
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I can't use other people's chip.

624
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I can't use other people's chip.

625
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I can't use other people's chip.

626
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Qualcomm uses the so-called

627
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Qualcomm uses the so-called

628
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
No license, no chip.

629
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The price is so high.

630
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I don't know what you're doing.

631
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I don't know what you're doing.

632
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You are a market monopoly.

633
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You are a market monopoly.

634
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The whole thing is mixed up.

635
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The whole case is mixed up.

636
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Let Apple jump.

637
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,500
And caused a lot of

638
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
And caused a lot of

639
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
European Union.

640
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
And China-Taiwan.

641
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Taiwan, you probably heard of it.

642
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
He was also investigating this case.

643
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
US and the U.S.

644
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
The United States Trade Commission is investigating the whole thing.

645
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
What is his legitimacy?

646
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
What is his legitimacy?

647
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
We want to investigate.

648
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Qualcomm is doing this.

649
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
What is the reason behind this?

650
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Why does Qualcomm

651
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Why does Qualcomm

652
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Bundle Rebate?

653
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Bundle Rebate?

654
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
You can think about it.

655
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
If Qualcomm's quality is so good.

656
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
If Qualcomm's quality is so good.

657
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Good quality, good market monopoly status.

658
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Why does he provide a return to Apple?

659
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Why does he provide a return to Apple?

660
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Because I'm lying down.

661
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Apple is coming.

662
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
You can think about it.

663
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
If you are a market monopoly status.

664
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
If you are a market monopoly status.

665
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Basically, everyone's products

666
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Almost use my modern chip.

667
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Almost use my modern chip.

668
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
People can't catch up with me.

669
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
People can't catch up with me.

670
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
For example, he mentioned Intel.

671
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
For him, Intel is nothing.

672
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
He can't catch up with me at all.

673
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
He can't catch up with me at all.

674
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
I don't know if you have learned this.

675
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
I don't know if you have learned this.

676
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
The cost of investment is very high.

677
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
So this question has always been a question of ours.

678
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
So this question has always been a question of ours.

679
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
So this question has always been a question of ours.

680
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
The core question is if Qualcomm

681
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
If Qualcomm is in a market monopoly status.

682
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
If Qualcomm is in a market monopoly status.

683
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
In market leadership.

684
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
He is so wide in his specialist.

685
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
OK, and the quality of products is also very good.

686
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Why does he provide this return to Apple?

687
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
What's going on in society?

688
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
What's going on in society?

689
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
And provided with this return.

690
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
And provided with this return.

691
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
This period is not just a year or two,

692
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Perhaps a period of 3 to 5 years.

693
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Perhaps a period of 3 to 5 years.

694
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
So he's actually still providing this rebate.

695
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
So he's actually still providing this rebate.

696
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Then provide such a return to Apple.

697
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Then the two requirements are that

698
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Then the two requirements are that

699
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
And then you can't investigate me.

700
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
And then you have to accept mine.

701
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Then issue

702
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Is the value of Friends justified?

703
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
I'm not in today's report.

704
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
I'm not in today's report.

705
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Because you say everything.

706
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Apple says you are not a friend.

707
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Qualcomm says I am a friend.

708
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Because I have the whole patent I authorize to you.

709
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Because I have the whole patent I authorize to you.

710
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
This know-how

711
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
And this so-called technical standard.

712
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Of course, the price is so high.

713
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Of course, the price is so high.

714
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
This is the problem of the industry.

715
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
This is the problem of the industry.

716
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Today's problem is on this rebate.

717
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
So today I will tell you briefly.

718
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
That is to say, today I focus on the point.

719
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Also this paper.

720
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
The point I studied with that classmate is.

721
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Why Qualcomm

722
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
He will be so persistent.

723
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
To provide rebate this matter.

724
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
OK

725
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
I'm pausing again.

726
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm pausing again.

727
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
See if you have any understanding of this case.

728
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
See if you have any understanding of this case.

729
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Do you understand this story I just said?

730
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Do you understand this story I just said?

731
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Do you understand this story I just said?

732
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Does anyone not understand?

733
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
What is the link that you don't understand?

734
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
If you don't understand.

735
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Can you tell me which link you don't understand?

736
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:43,500
OK, no one responded.

737
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Just pretend to understand.

738
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
On the basis of this knowledge,

739
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,500
we know that the hatred between Apple and Qualcomm has spread like this.

740
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
I was sued like this last year.

741
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:03,500
For me, this paper is a cross-sectional, cross-field cooperation paper.

742
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
I am responsible for the part of legal analysis.

743
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,500
My partner is responsible for the study of the Gantt theory model,

744
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:16,500
and the analysis of this whole thing from a commercial and economic perspective.

745
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,500
First of all, everyone is very curious.

746
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
From my point of view,

747
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
is there a similar case in the past?

748
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,500
Or how did they judge this rebate case?

749
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Or what is the result of their judgment?

750
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Let me report to you.

751
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Simply put, this thing, this problem,

752
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,500
even the court itself is difficult to handle.

753
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,500
The red part you see on the screen

754
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,500
represents that the court is the red part.

755
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,500
The red case is the court's judgment.

756
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:02,500
The defendant, a company like Qualcomm, is illegal.

757
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
The black part is that I didn't mark it.

758
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
The black part of these cases

759
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,500
is considered legal by the court.

760
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
It's like a bond rebate.

761
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
You have to accept this.

762
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
If you want to use it,

763
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
just like the state of communication I just talked about.

764
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,500
If you want to use my stuff,

765
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,500
you want to become my supplier,

766
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,500
or I want to supply you with good stuff,

767
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
but you have to accept my conditions.

768
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
You can buy it,

769
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
but you have to buy a certain amount.

770
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
After you buy a certain amount,

771
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
I'll give you a rebate.

772
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,500
It's a similar concept.

773
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,500
It's a similar trading model.

774
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
I've sorted out these six cases.

775
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Since none of them are legal,

776
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,500
I won't go over them one by one.

777
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
In fact, based on the results,

778
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
the results are divided.

779
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
The reasons are also divided.

780
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
The three red dots

781
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,500
are the different courts

782
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,500
for these cases.

783
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
So you can see

784
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,500
a very special phenomenon.

785
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,500
On the issue of rebate,

786
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
or bond rebate,

787
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
different courts have different reasons

788
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
and different results.

789
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
I'll talk about it later.

790
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
Qualcomm actually used this point.

791
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
It's not a use.

792
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
It should have seen this point.

793
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
We infer that he saw this point

794
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,500
and it may have become his reason

795
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,500
to continue to use his bond rebate to Apple.

796
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,500
This is our inference.

797
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,500
I'll talk about it later.

798
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,500
This is my preliminary investigation.

799
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
I found that

800
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,500
if the defendant

801
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,500
is illegal in the red case,

802
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
and legal in the black case,

803
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
I'll see

804
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
what common features

805
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
the red case has.

806
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,500
First, those illegal cases

807
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
in the red part.

808
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
I just showed you the red part.

809
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
These defendants

810
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,500
actually have some market monopoly.

811
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,500
So if you are a market monopolist,

812
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,500
it is likely to violate the antitrust law.

813
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,500
This is in our legal school.

814
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,500
If you learn this antitrust law,

815
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,500
basically this probability is very high.

816
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
If you have this market monopoly,

817
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,500
it is basically easy to violate the antitrust law.

818
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,500
This is very normal.

819
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
OK.

820
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,500
In the context of this bond rebate,

821
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,500
it is not an exception.

822
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
But we have seen

823
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
the second point is very interesting.

824
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,500
We see legal.

825
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
We compare these legal cases.

826
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,500
In the black cases,

827
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
we found that

828
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,500
the defendant may still be legal.

829
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Why?

830
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
Just imagine.

831
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,500
In the black cases,

832
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
why do some judges

833
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
think they are legal

834
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
in the same situation?

835
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Because they do not have

836
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
the effect of exclusion.

837
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
OK.

838
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,500
In general,

839
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,500
let's put it simply.

840
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
Antitrust law is actually

841
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,500
a law of corporate behavior.

842
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,500
OK.

843
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,500
It is the law of market economy

844
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,500
and corporate behavior.

845
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,500
So the market economy

846
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
should maintain a competitive attitude

847
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
instead of letting a person monopolize

848
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
or show a state of monopoly.

849
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
But imagine

850
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,500
if he was originally today.

851
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Although he is a

852
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,500
through his sales behavior

853
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
and then his innovative business model

854
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
to achieve his market leadership position

855
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
but not monopoly leadership position

856
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
and then he wants to continue

857
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
to increase his market share

858
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,500
he may let other competitors

859
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
have some problems

860
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
or what is the situation.

861
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
The effect of his exclusion

862
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
may make some

863
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
for example,

864
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
competition or something

865
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
he may let other competitors

866
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,500
he can not come in

867
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
or potential competitors

868
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,500
for example,

869
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,500
as I just mentioned

870
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Intel

871
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
Intel in the so-called

872
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
this computer CPU

873
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
everyone should know

874
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
are doing very well

875
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,500
this Pentium

876
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Pentium series are doing very well

877
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
and then with this

878
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Microsoft

879
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
in the late 90s

880
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
is almost

881
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
this is almost

882
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
very few computers

883
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
but he is in

884
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
the communication chip inside

885
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
he just can not stand

886
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,500
he is not

887
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
the so-called position

888
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,500
that he is coming in today

889
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
but in fact

890
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,500
he wants to come in

891
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
as long as he invests enough money

892
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
in fact, Intel

893
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
if you go to check

894
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,500
in fact, he is also doing

895
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,500
just keep doing bad

896
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
OK

897
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,500
but not to say

898
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,500
he can not do

899
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
this is the difference

900
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
that is

901
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
I'll talk about

902
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
this is the difference

903
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
that is the so-called can not do

904
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,500
that is to say

905
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,500
I used some business behavior

906
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,500
for example, I

907
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,500
I join all the people

908
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,500
I do not provide you material

909
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,500
you can not do

910
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,500
this is not

911
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,500
this must be against

912
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,500
this anti-trust law

913
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,500
because this is against

914
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,500
this

915
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
this market competition

916
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,500
that is

917
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,500
the current situation

918
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
is to say

919
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,500
we observed

920
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,500
the first few

921
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,500
black cases

922
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,500
we found that

923
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,500
those cases

924
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,500
Why is it legal

925
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,500
because those potential competitors

926
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,500
he was not excluded

927
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,500
into this market

928
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,500
he can still

929
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,500
enter this market

930
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,500
competition

931
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,500
means that

932
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
his entry barrier

933
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,500
is low

934
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
that entry barrier

935
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
low, then

936
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
the court saw

937
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
low entry barrier

938
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
that is to say

939
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,500
that you

940
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,500
may come in today

941
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
but you choose not to come in

942
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
or you

943
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,500
may have other

944
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
commercial considerations

945
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,500
but not come in

946
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,500
so

947
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,500
before

948
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,500
I go back

949
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,500
before

950
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,500
these black cases

951
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Why would be

952
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,500
legal

953
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,500
these Bundle

954
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Rebate

955
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
because

956
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,500
other competitors

957
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,500
he

958
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
was not excluded

959
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,500
he still came in

960
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,500
he still joined

961
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,500
this industry

962
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,500
continue to compete

963
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,500
with these defendants

964
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
for example,

965
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,500
if the defendant

966
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,500
is Gaotong

967
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,500
he still

968
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,500
come in

969
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,500
this industry

970
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,500
to compete

971
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,500
that is

972
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
like we

973
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,500
discussed today

974
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,500
Gaotong

975
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,500
is not the only

976
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,500
one

977
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,500
to provide

978
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
Samsung

979
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,500
also has

980
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Huawei

981
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,500
also has

982
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,500
OK

983
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
so

984
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,500
you

985
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,500
know

986
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,500
that

987
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,500
although Gaotong

988
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
in this market

989
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
is based on

990
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,500
monopoly status

991
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,500
based on this

992
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,500
leadership position

993
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,500
and then

994
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,500
may have

995
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,500
some monopoly

996
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,500
power on

997
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,500
sales

998
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,500
because

999
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,500
the quality of

1000
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,500
his product

1001
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,500
is good

1002
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,500
but

1003
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,500
other people

1004
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
are still

1005
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
inside

1006
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,500
right

1007
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,500
other players

1008
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,500
are also

1009
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,500
inside

1010
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,500
other

1011
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,500
manufacturers

1012
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,500
are also

1013
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,500
inside

1014
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,500
but

1015
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,500
you get

1016
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,500
this market

1017
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,500
leadership position

1018
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,500
is my

1019
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,500
development ability

1020
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,500
is strong enough

1021
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
my innovation is enough

1022
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
my patent

1023
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
quality is good enough

1024
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,500
so everyone

1025
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,500
likes to use my

1026
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
product

1027
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
and produce

1028
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
this normal

1029
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
market leadership

1030
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,500
position

1031
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,500
you can't

1032
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
punish this

1033
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
behavior

1034
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,500
otherwise

1035
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
if antitrust

1036
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,500
if this

1037
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,500
antitrust law

1038
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,500
is operated

1039
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,500
like this

1040
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,500
who wants to

1041
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
innovate

1042
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,500
this

1043
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,500
antitrust law

1044
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,500
in the United States

1045
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,500
is actually a

1046
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,500
very sensitive

1047
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
law and sensitive

1048
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,500
topic

1049
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
because

1050
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,500
a

1051
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,500
accident

1052
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
may

1053
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,500
have a

1054
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,500
competitive

1055
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,500
market

1056
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,500
attitude

1057
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
and

1058
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,500
the aftermath

1059
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,500
is actually

1060
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,500
very big

1061
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
because

1062
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
you may

1063
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
accidentally

1064
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,500
punish

1065
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,500
the right

1066
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,500
person

1067
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,500
if you

1068
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
punish

1069
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,500
the right

1070
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
person

1071
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,500
so

1072
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,500
I

1073
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,500
personally

1074
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,500
think

1075
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,500
Taiwan

1076
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
can't

1077
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,500
judge

1078
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,500
antitrust

1079
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,500
so soon

1080
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,500
the reason

1081
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,500
is here

1082
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
I

1083
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,500
want to

1084
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,500
share

1085
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,500
with

1086
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,500
you

1087
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
I

1088
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
don't

1089
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,500
know

1090
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
if

1091
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
this

1092
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
is

1093
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
good or

1094
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,500
not

1095
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,500
but

1096
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,500
I

1097
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,500
think

1098
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
it's

1099
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,500
worth

1100
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,500
talking

1101
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,500
about

1102
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
since

1103
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
there are

1104
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,500
so many

1105
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,500
people

1106
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,500
in this

1107
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
industry

1108
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
and

1109
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,500
why

1110
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,500
they are

1111
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,500
punished

1112
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,500
you have

1113
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,500
to give

1114
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,500
a

1115
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
legitimate

1116
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,500
reason

1117
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,500
the

1118
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,500
United

1119
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
States

1120
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,500
is a

1121
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
public

1122
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
country

1123
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
so

1124
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,500
this

1125
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,500
thing

1126
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
has not

1127
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,500
been

1128
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
judged

1129
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
even

1130
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
as I

1131
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,500
said

1132
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,500
the red

1133
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
case is

1134
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
still

1135
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,500
illegal

1136
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,500
so

1137
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,500
it has

1138
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
legal

1139
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,500
risk

1140
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
under

1141
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,500
this

1142
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,500
legal

1143
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,500
risk

1144
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,500
why

1145
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
will

1146
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
it

1147
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
continue

1148
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,500
to

1149
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,500
implement

1150
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,500
this

1151
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,500
bundle

1152
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,500
rebate

1153
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,500
this is

1154
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,500
our

1155
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,500
cooperation

1156
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,500
paper

1157
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,500
to

1158
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,500
use

1159
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,500
so-called

1160
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
competition

1161
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
theory

1162
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,500
model to

1163
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
do

1164
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,500
that

1165
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,500
this is

1166
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
from him

1167
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,500
I

1168
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,500
will briefly

1169
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,500
introduce

1170
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,500
you

1171
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
can leave

1172
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
me a

1173
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,500
message

1174
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,500
to me

1175
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,500
and

1176
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,500
I will

1177
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,500
explain

1178
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,500
not

1179
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,500
explain

1180
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,500
is that

1181
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,500
I will

1182
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,500
ask my

1183
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,500
friends

1184
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,500
and see if

1185
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,500
I can

1186
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,500
answer

1187
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,500
this

1188
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,500
question

1189
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,500
and

1190
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
then

1191
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,500
we will

1192
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,500
see what

1193
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,500
we see

1194
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,500
in the

1195
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,500
model and

1196
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,500
then we

1197
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,500
will

1198
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,500
say

1199
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
maybe

1200
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,500
behind these

1201
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
models

1202
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
what kind

1203
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
of behavior

1204
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
is possible

1205
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
so

1206
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,500
this

1207
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,500
model is

1208
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,500
such a

1209
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
situation

1210
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,500
and

1211
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,500
from the

1212
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,500
business

1213
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,500
point of

1214
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
view

1215
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,500
and

1216
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
MD

1217
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,500
cry

1218
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
ah

1219
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,500
yes

1220
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,500
MD

1221
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,500
cry

1222
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,500
ok

1223
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,500
MD

1224
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,500
does not seem to

1225
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,500
be within

1226
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,500
this

1227
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,500
range of

1228
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,500
modern

1229
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,500
chip

1230
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,500
ok

1231
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
so

1232
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,500
he

1233
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
I do not know

1234
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,500
MD

1235
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,500
is not really

1236
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,500
doing

1237
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,500
modern

1238
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,500
chip

1239
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
may not

1240
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,500
have

1241
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
ok

1242
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,500
not at all

1243
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
in the

1244
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,500
patent

1245
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,500
so

1246
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
I just

1247
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
simply talk about

1248
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
this math

1249
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,500
we use

1250
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,500
some of the

1251
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
math because

1252
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,500
we just

1253
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,500
finished listening to

1254
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
our story

1255
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,500
so

1256
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,500
listen to

1257
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,500
our story

1258
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,500
after

1259
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,500
these

1260
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,500
mathematical

1261
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,500
model

1262
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
assumptions

1263
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,500
I think

1264
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
it should

1265
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
not be

1266
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,500
very complicated

1267
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,500
ok

1268
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
first of all

1269
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
we design

1270
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
this game

1271
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,500
for the

1272
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,500
theory of

1273
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,500
game

1274
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
so

1275
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,500
this game

1276
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,500
is divided into

1277
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,500
the so-called

1278
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
exotic and

1279
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,500
non-exotic

1280
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,500
ok

1281
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,500
ah

1282
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,500
exotic

1283
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,500
I will explain

1284
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,500
to you

1285
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,500
that is

1286
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,500
as I just

1287
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,500
said

1288
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,500
this

1289
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,500
friend

1290
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,500
problem

1291
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,500
is the

1292
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,500
so-called

1293
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,500
price

1294
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,500
problem

1295
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,500
that

1296
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,500
why

1297
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,500
will have

1298
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
friend

1299
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,500
you think

1300
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,500
reasonable

1301
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,500
I think

1302
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,500
unreasonable

1303
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,500
ok

1304
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,500
you provide me

1305

the

1307
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,500

00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,500
included

1312
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,500

ok

1315
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,500
this is a bit

1316
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,500
tricky

1317
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,500
I say

1318
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
again

1319
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
is

1320
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Apple

1321
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,500
will think

1322
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,500
you

1323
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,500

1325
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,500
modern

1326
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,500
chip

1327
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
ok

1328
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,500
you

1329
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
this is a

1330
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,500
price

1331
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
say

1332
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
when

1333
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,500
you

1334
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,500
give me

1335
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,500
a patent

1336
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,500
patent

1337
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,500
law

1338
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,500
there is a

1339
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
basic concept

1340
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,500
that I simply

1341
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,500
emphasize

1342
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,500
this

1343
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,500
you do not have

1344
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,500
a patent

1345
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,500
law

1346
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,500
concept

1347
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,500
is that

1348
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,500
once

1349
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,500
my

1350
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,500

1351
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,500
contains

1352
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,500
my patent

1353
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
together

1354
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,500
sold out

1355
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,500
if

1356
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,500
this

1357
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,500
thing

1358
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,500
again

1359
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,500

1360
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,500
the

patent

1362
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,500
sold to me

1363
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,500
he put

1364
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
this

1365
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,500
patent

1366
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,500
price

1367
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,500
sold to me

1368
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,500
why

1369
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Foxconn

1370
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,500
to be

1371
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,500
pulled

1372
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,500
once more

1373
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,500
wool ah

1374
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
right

1375
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,500
course

1376
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,500
do not

1377
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,500
use

1378
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
the core

1379
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,500
concept

1380
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,500
is

1381
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,500
the

1382
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
concept

1383
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,500
is

1384
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
that

1385
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,500
he will

1386
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,500
have

1387
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,500
this

1388
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,500
controversy

1389
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,500
is because

1390
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,500
that

1391
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,500
high school of course

1392
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
think that

1393
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,500
I do not

1394
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,500
authorize you

1395
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
or say I

1396
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,500
sell you

1397
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,500
a patent

1398
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,500
that I

1399
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,500
contain

1400
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
only a small

1401
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,500
part of my

1402
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
patent

1403
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,500
patent

1404
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,500
combination

1405
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,500
there are many

1406
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
patents

1407
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,500
you did not

1408
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,500
use

1409
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,500
so you have

1410
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
to pay

1411
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,500
extra

1412
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,500
money

1413
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,500
that everyone

1414
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,500
should understand

1415
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,500
it

1416
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,500
is

1417
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
why we

1418
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,500
design

1419
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,500
some of

1420
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,500
this

1421
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,500
game

1422
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,500
because

1423
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,500
I originally

1424
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,500
give you

1425
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,500
this

1426
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,500
modern

1427
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,500
chip

1428
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,500
should be

1429
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,500
all the

1430
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,500
prices

1431
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,500
include

1432
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
patent

1433
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,500
prices

1434
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,500
this is

1435
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,500
Apple's

1436
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,500
idea

1437
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,500
that

1438
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,500
Qualcomm

1439
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,500
do not

1440
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,500
think so

1441
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,500
Qualcomm

1442
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,500
think that

1443
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,500
I only

1444
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
give you a

1445
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,500
part of

1446
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,500
you have

1447
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
a lot of

1448
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,500
money

1449
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,500
why he dare

1450
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,500
talk about this

1451
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,500
condition

1452
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,500
because he dare

1453
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
say you

1454
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
even if I

1455
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,500
supply you

1456
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,500
modern chip

1457
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,500
I have other patents

1458
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,500
you have not

1459
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,500
used so you

1460
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
have to pay more

1461
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
money

1462
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,500
that is not

1463
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,500
gone

1464
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,500
this is the

1465
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,500
so-called

1466
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,500
one-stage

1467
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,500
non-exhaustive

1468
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,500
non-exhaustive

1469
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,500
this will

1470
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,500
mean that

1471
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,500
a game

1472
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,500
exhaustive

1473
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,500

1474
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,500
game

1475
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,500
it is based on

1476
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Apple's

1477
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
two-stage game

1478
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,500
this is interesting

1479
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,500
we will go to

1480
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,500
two stages

1481
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,500
of two stages

1482
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,500
to run

1483
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,500
this model

1484
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,500
this game

1485
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,500
3 model

1486
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,500
that

1487
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,500
inside the game

1488
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,500
exhaustive

1489
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
we just mentioned

1490
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,500
that

1491
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,500
because

1492
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,500
this Apple

1493
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,500
thinks

1494
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,500
you give me

1495
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,500
modern chip

1496
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,500

00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,500
includes all

00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,500

may be

1510
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
because

1511
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,500
this high-speed

1512
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,500
he thought

1513
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,500
that

1514
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,500
the patent

1515
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,500
inside the

1516
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,500
modern chip

1517
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
is only

1518
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,500
part of me

1519
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,500
OK

1520
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,500
so

1521
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
I

1522
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,500
I have

1523
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,500
many other

1524
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,500
patents

1525
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,500
have not

1526
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,500
given you

1527
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
so

1528
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
I

1529
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
also add

1530
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
this money

1531
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,500
there is

1532
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,500
the whole

1533
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,500
technology

1534
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,500
this is

1535
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
I think

1536
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Apple to pay

1537
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,500
what is

1538
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
Apple

1539
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,500
to pay

1540
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,500
the whole

1541
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,500
market value

1542
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
value

1543
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,500
is not just

1544
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,500
cheap

1545
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,500
OK

1546
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,500
so

1547
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,500
this model

1548
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,500
in

1549
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,500
price

1550
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,500
is the

1551
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,500
P

1552
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,500
above

1553
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,500
the basic

1554
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,500
method of

1555
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,500
calculation

1556
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,500
of

1557
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,500
this

1558
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,500
base

1559
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,500
is not

1560
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,500
the same

1561
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,500
OK

1562
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,500
that

1563
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,500
in

1564
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,500
how much

1565
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,500
percentage

1566
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,500
to calculate

1567
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,500
but it

1568
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,500
is not

1569
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,500
supposed to

1570
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,500
use the

1571
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,500
whole

1572
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,500
market

1573
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,500
price

1574
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,500
to calculate

1575
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,500
OK

1576
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,500
this is

1577
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,500
our two

1578
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,500
different

1579
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,500
game

1580
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,500
his

1581
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,500
calculation

1582
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,500
price

1583
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,500
P

1584
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,500
this

1585
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,500
price

1586
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,500
above

1587
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,500
is not

1588
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,500
the same

1589
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,500
that

1590
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,500
came

1591
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,500
two

1592
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,500
stages

1593
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,500
in

1594
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,500
the

1595
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,500
first

1596
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,500
stage

1597
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,500
I

1598
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,500
know

1599
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,500
that

1600
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,500
this

1601
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,500
is a

1602
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,500
very interesting

1603
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,500
point

1604
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,500
in

1605
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Qualcomm's

1606
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,500
complaint

1607
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
is that

1608
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
I do not

1609
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,500
know if

1610
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,500
one

1611
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,500
year

1612
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
or

1613
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,500
one

1614
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,500
year

1615
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,500
one

1616
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,500
year

1617
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,500
one

1618
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,500
year

1619
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,500
I

1620
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,500
forgot

1621
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
which

1622
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,500
device

1623
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,500
I

1624
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,500
started

1625
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,500
complaining

1626
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,500
about

1627
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,500
is because

1628
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Apple

1629
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
but it

1630
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
breaks the

1631
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
rule

1632
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:17,500
went to

1633
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
Apple

1634
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,500
will not accept

1635
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,500
the

1636
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,500
Bundle Rebate

1637
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,500
and

1638
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,500
Core Comp

1639
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,500
most important

1640
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,500
role

1641
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,500
it

1642
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,500
is there a reason

1643
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,500
to provide

1644
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,500
this rebate

1645
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,500
is our basic

1646
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,500
GAP

1647
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,500
and

1648
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,500
that

1649
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,500
math model

1650
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,500
we have a few

1651
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,500
assumptions

1652
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,500
are actually

1653
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,500
based on our

1654
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,500
story

1655
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,500
so actually

1656
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,500
quite intuitive

1657
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,500
first

1658
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,500
we assume

1659
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,500
it is a

1660
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,500
very

1661
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,500
market

1662
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,500
quality

1663
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,500
and

1664
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
higher than

1665
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,500
Intel

1666
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
in the first

1667
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,500
stage

1668
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,500
should be able to

1669
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,500
understand

1670
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
the

1671
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
recent years

1672
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,500
so

1673
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,500
that

1674
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,500
and

1675
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,500
these

1676
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,500
Apple

1677
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,500
Apple

1678
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,500
and

1679
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,500
Qualcomm

1680
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,500
these

1681
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,500
are actually

1682
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,500
a

1683
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,500
standard

1684
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,500
for their

1685
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,500
companies

1686
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,500
is that

1687
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,500
I want to

1688
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,500
get the

1689
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,500
third

1690
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,500
it

1691
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,500
is that

1692
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,500
we play

1693
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,500
the game

1694
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,500
a bit like

1695
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,500
Apple is a

1696
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,500
follower

1697
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,500
because Apple

1698
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,500
it did not produce

1699
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
the so-called

1700
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,500
modern chip

1701
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,500
it did not

1702
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
create a

1703
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,500
modern chip

1704
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,500
so

1705
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,500
it is a

1706
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,500
bit like

1707
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,500
this game

1708
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,500
is the

1709
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,500
first

1710
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,500
Qualcomm

1711
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,500
it provides

1712
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,500
a contract

1713
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,500
