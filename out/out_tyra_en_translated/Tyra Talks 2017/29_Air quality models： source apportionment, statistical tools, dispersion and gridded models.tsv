0	1160	Okay, I'll start now.
4160	5360	I was scared.
5360	9000	So what I'm going to talk about today is
10760	13920	I'm going to describe fluid mechanics,
13920	16800	but I'm going to use quantum mechanics
16800	19760	to describe fluid mechanics.
19760	23520	Before I start, I'm going to talk about
23520	25840	why fluid mechanics,
25840	28360	usually the Navier-Stokes equation or Euler equation,
28360	30360	is very non-linear.
30360	35360	How could it be related to this linear equation?
35360	37360	In fact, this is not a discovery.
37360	39360	As early as 1926,
39360	42360	Magnum had already discovered
42360	45360	that these two equations are closely related.
45360	47360	I usually think like this.
47360	50360	The Euler equation,
50360	52360	the physics behind it is like this.
52360	55360	It has a few postulates.
55360	57360	The first one is that there is inertia.
57360	59360	That is to say, if the particle has no force,
59360	62360	the speed is just following the speed of the particle.
62360	65360	So the speed of the fluid is
65360	67360	the speed of the vector.
69360	71360	But in fact, there is an inner force in the fluid,
71360	73360	which is the pressure.
73360	76360	And Euler's assumption is that
76360	78360	this is a conservative field,
78360	80360	so it is already a gradient of function.
81360	83360	And finally, this gradient of function,
83360	85360	which is the pressure force,
85360	88360	is the only constraint.
88360	91360	In fact, it is an incompressible flow.
91360	94360	And these assumptions are combined
94360	98360	to write the incompressible Euler equation.
98360	101360	And the most difficult part in this equation
101360	104360	is actually the inertia part.
104360	108360	Because it has a non-linear effect in the equation.
108360	110360	That is, U dot gradient U.
111360	114360	When you say P-lemming,
114360	118360	I also want to use these non-linear equations.
118360	120360	Yes, just like dust.
120360	122360	Do you know why?
122360	124360	If I have the first equation on the right,
124360	126360	will it be very simple?
132360	134360	It can be said to be simple or not simple.
134360	136360	It is not so direct.
136360	138360	It is also a non-linear method.
138360	140360	It is a Berger's equation.
144360	146360	If you want to simulate,
146360	148360	you can just throw a lot of particles
148360	150360	and let it fly.
150360	152360	But in the end, you have to predict
152360	154360	what the final density is.
154360	156360	In fact, it can be clearly written down.
156360	158360	Especially when it is Euler,
158360	160360	it can be clearly written down.
160360	162360	In fact, there are some interesting phenomena.
162360	164360	It is not very direct.
164360	166360	And those are all non-linear phenomena.
166360	168360	It looks like a very simple physics.
168360	170360	But in fact, because it is non-linear,
170360	172360	it just runs out of phenomena.
172360	174360	Many non-linear phenomena,
174360	176360	such as shock wave and reflection wave,
176360	178360	will appear.
178360	180360	Yes, it's a simple version,
180360	182360	but it's not so direct.
186360	188360	This non-linear phenomenon
188360	190360	can be written in different ways.
190360	192360	Like Lagrange and Helmholtz.
192360	194360	A lot of people
194360	196360	write Euler's equation in the same way.
196360	198360	But the non-linear phenomenon
198360	200360	is always there.
200360	202360	It's all because of the law of inertia.
202360	204360	But in fact, there is a linear equation.
204360	206360	Schrodinger's equation
206360	208360	is built into the law of inertia.
212360	214360	Schrodinger's equation
214360	216360	for complex value wave function
216360	218360	is written like this.
220360	222360	I will throw away the potential term.
222360	224360	This looks like a heat equation.
224360	226360	Yes, the mathematical convention
226360	228360	is that delta is the Laplacian.
228360	230360	It's usually a gradient equation.
230360	232360	It looks like a heat equation,
232360	234360	but there is an i.
236360	238360	h bar is a function
238360	240360	in my entire talk.
242360	244360	But this Schrodinger's equation
244360	246360	shouldn't be regarded as a heat equation.
246360	248360	It's actually a wave equation.
248360	250360	And it's a dispersive wave equation.
250360	252360	It has a dispersion phenomenon.
252360	254360	That is, different waves
254360	256360	travel at different speeds.
258360	260360	If I look at the group velocity
260360	262360	of this wave,
262360	264360	you can see the dispersion relation.
264360	266360	The group velocity is actually
266360	268360	equal to the wave number.
268360	270360	The wave number
270360	272360	is usually measured by
272360	274360	the IC time of the E2 wave.
274360	276360	It will show
276360	278360	the wave number
278360	280360	and
280360	282360	the point is that
282360	284360	the wave number and the
284360	286360	wave number of the wave
286360	288360	are actually all
288360	290360	measured by the group velocity.
290360	292360	The wave number itself is
292360	294360	the group velocity.
294360	296360	So you will get a
296360	298360	velocity-advected-by-velocity phenomenon.
298360	300360	That is, it only has
300360	302360	an internal
302360	304360	flying phenomenon.
304360	306360	Because the speed is written as
306360	308360	So based on this variable
308360	310360	change, you can see that
310360	312360	the original non-linear things
312360	314360	may become linear, or the linear
314360	316360	may become non-linear.
316360	318360	After the Schrodinger equation
318360	320360	is logged, what you get
320360	322360	will be this
322360	324360	functional phenomenon.
324360	326360	This was actually done by
326360	328360	Madelung in 1926.
328360	330360	In 1925, Schrodinger
330360	332360	just wrote the Schrodinger equation.
332360	334360	The next year, Madelung said
334360	336360	amplitude squared
336360	338360	is the density of the fluid.
338360	340360	That can be regarded as the probability
340360	342360	density of the particle.
342360	344360	Then you
344360	346360	treat the whole system as a fluid.
346360	348360	The speed of the fluid is
348360	350360	gradient of theta, which is
350360	352360	the group velocity.
352360	354360	If you do this,
354360	356360	you bring these things in
356360	358360	and separate the actual area.
358360	360360	Then it will be a
360360	362360	If you have seen fluid,
362360	364360	you will find that
364360	366360	this is the compressible Euler equation.
366360	368360	The first method is
368360	370360	conservation of mass.
370360	372360	The second is conservation of momentum.
372360	374360	The only difference between
374360	376360	compressible and classical fluid
376360	378360	is the bone potential.
378360	380360	In the end, this is also the key
380360	382360	to evolving into bone mechanics.
384360	386360	But this
386360	388360	won't appear later.
388360	390360	Because you can know
390360	392360	I will add a
392360	394360	compressible Euler equation
394360	396360	to make it incompressible.
396360	398360	In that case,
398360	400360	the density will become constant
400360	402360	and the bone potential will disappear.
402360	404360	So we don't have to worry about it later.
406360	408360	What I just said
408360	410360	is that these two
410360	412360	actually have a point of view.
412360	414360	The first one is
414360	416360	The first one is
418360	420360	The first one is
420360	422360	the continuity equation.
422360	424360	q is the density.
426360	428360	So this is
428360	430360	the quality conservation.
430360	432360	So when you say h bar equals 0,
432360	434360	it's completely true.
434360	436360	h bar equals 0.
438360	440360	If your h bar equals 0,
440360	442360	it looks very similar.
442360	444360	But the
444360	446360	fluid velocity
446360	448360	h bar equals 0,
448360	450360	the flow velocity disappears.
450360	452360	Unless your theta
452360	454360	is infinitely large.
458360	460360	Look at the third line.
460360	462360	The fluid velocity is u times h bar times the gradient.
464360	466360	If your h bar equals 0,
466360	468360	your theta will...
468360	470360	You can make h bar very small.
470360	472360	It will become
472360	474360	semi-classic continuity.
474360	476360	It will become very close to the fluid velocity.
476360	478360	But you can't measure it directly.
478360	480360	Just treat it as a variable.
480360	482360	I only have u and theta left.
484360	486360	Under this new variable,
486360	488360	I already have
488360	490360	q bar, q bar,
490360	492360	h bar equals 0.
492360	494360	But this implies that your theta
494360	496360	must be an infinite positive function.
496360	498360	So...
498360	500360	Just treat it as...
500360	502360	Let's say...
502360	504360	Okay, that's it.
510360	512360	So my
512360	514360	overview is...
514360	516360	At the beginning,
516360	518360	I just simulated
518360	520360	to show you the simulation result.
520360	522360	And then...
522360	524360	Next, I want to talk about
524360	526360	a theory that is
526360	528360	more advanced than the variable variation.
528360	530360	It's called Geometric Clutch Variables.
530360	532360	I don't know how much I can talk about it.
532360	534360	For the dynamics part,
534360	536360	I will talk about the result.
536360	538360	But
538360	540360	there may be some parts in the middle.
540360	542360	I will try to talk about it.
542360	544360	If you have any questions,
544360	546360	please feel free to ask.
548360	550360	I will use some
550360	552360	more complicated math.
552360	554360	And then...
554360	556360	We published a paper
556360	558360	called Schrodinger's Smoke.
558360	560360	It's about cat when smoke.
560360	562360	It's about
562360	564360	doing some
564360	566360	utility simulation.
566360	568360	So if you google
568360	570360	Schrodinger's Smoke, you will see our paper.
570360	572360	We use
572360	574360	Madelung's idea.
574360	576360	We want to
576360	578360	treat fluid density...
578360	580360	Instead of using
580360	582360	density and velocity.
582360	584360	We use the complex value
584360	586360	wave function.
586360	588360	And then use Madelung's variable variation.
588360	590360	And this fluid velocity
590360	592360	actually has this...
592360	594360	You can write gradient theta
594360	596360	as the square on the right.
596360	598360	If you
598360	600360	write it like this,
600360	602360	you will find that
602360	604360	minus i gradient is
604360	606360	the momentum operator.
606360	608360	So it just evaluates the momentum operator.
608360	610360	But
610360	612360	the point is
612360	614360	even though it looks great,
614360	616360	but velocity is just
616360	618360	a function of function.
618360	620360	It means that you don't have any vorticity.
620360	622360	When you take
622360	624360	velocity and curl,
624360	626360	look at the angular momentum,
626360	628360	you will find that it's zero.
628360	630360	Your velocity
630360	632360	can only be this kind of potential flow.
632360	634360	Or this kind of
634360	636360	no vortex fluid.
636360	638360	It's not interesting.
638360	640360	To solve this problem,
640360	642360	we consider
642360	644360	two components Schrodinger equation.
644360	646360	You can think of this
646360	648360	as spin half particle.
648360	650360	Or you can think of it as
650360	652360	two components.
652360	654360	Its Schrodinger equation is still the same.
654360	656360	It's component wise.
656360	658360	It's still the same
658360	660360	one component Schrodinger equation.
660360	662360	The variable variation
662360	664360	is the density of the fluid.
664360	666360	It's still the same.
666360	668360	Amplitude squared.
668360	670360	But in this case,
670360	672360	it's the sum of
672360	674360	the density of two channels.
674360	676360	And
676360	678360	for velocity,
678360	680360	it's the same as the momentum operator.
680360	682360	If you write this down,
682360	684360	it will become
684360	686360	the velocity of two components.
686360	688360	But
688360	690360	it's a linear combination.
690360	692360	It depends on their density.
692360	694360	In this case,
694360	696360	you don't have to worry about curl.
696360	698360	It can
698360	700360	describe
700360	702360	more interesting
702360	704360	fluid states.
704360	706360	So we use one component
706360	708360	and two components
708360	710360	to describe the fluid.
710360	712360	Now,
714360	716360	to describe the fluid,
716360	718360	we need to describe incompressible fluid.
718360	720360	We already have the inertial motion.
720360	722360	To describe
722360	724360	incompressible fluid,
724360	726360	we add a potential term
726360	728360	to make it correspond to the velocity.
728360	730360	It's the divergence tree.
730360	732360	It's like the Euler equation.
732360	734360	When you add the pressure,
734360	736360	the fluid becomes incompressible fluid.
738360	740360	Then we
740360	742360	use the constraint Schrodinger equation
742360	744360	to describe the incompressible Schrodinger equation.
744360	746360	The solution is
746360	748360	the incompressible Schrodinger flow.
750360	752360	Then
752360	754360	it's the same as
754360	756360	other incompressible flow.
756360	758360	As long as you have
758360	760360	continuity equation,
760360	762360	that is, the quality is constant,
762360	764360	and
764360	766360	it's incompressible fluid.
766360	768360	The volume will not change over time.
768360	770360	The density
770360	772360	will not change
772360	774360	over time.
774360	776360	Initially, if density is constant,
776360	778360	it will always be constant.
778360	780360	My question is
780360	782360	you
784360	786360	turn it into
786360	788360	a two-component
788360	790360	vector.
790360	792360	Are you a two-component?
792360	794360	If
794360	796360	the screen is zero,
796360	798360	there will be no velocity.
798360	800360	If you have two components,
800360	802360	you need at least two components.
802360	804360	What is the implication?
804360	806360	How do you turn it into a one-component?
806360	808360	Actually,
808360	810360	at the beginning,
810360	812360	nComponent
812360	814360	and twoComponent.
814360	816360	After that,
816360	818360	twoComponent
818360	820360	is enough.
820360	822360	The meaning of enough
822360	824360	is
824360	826360	in
826360	828360	the middle,
828360	830360	at the end,
830360	832360	there is a question.
832360	834360	Can you find
834360	836360	a two-component wave function
836360	838360	that matches
838360	840360	the velocity?
840360	842360	Then I found that two-component
842360	844360	did a good job.
844360	846360	It means that it can be done
846360	848360	suddenly.
848360	850360	Is it a two-component?
850360	852360	Three-component.
852360	854360	Do you mean domain?
854360	856360	Is it a fluid domain?
858360	860360	Is it a fluid space?
860360	862360	Yes.
862360	864360	Two-component or three-component?
876360	878360	Sorry.
882360	884360	There are four variables
884360	886360	on your right hand side.
886360	888360	Each size is different.
888360	890360	On the left hand side,
890360	892360	there are two
892360	894360	or three variables.
896360	898360	If there are two variables,
898360	900360	there is a redundancy on the right hand side.
900360	902360	Do you know
902360	904360	what is redundancy?
904360	906360	You mean
906360	908360	four components
908360	910360	are like four-component,
910360	912360	but there are only three-component
912360	914360	to be described.
916360	918360	Yes, there is redundancy.
918360	920360	Then...
920360	922360	Let me think about it.
922360	924360	Is it a symmetry?
924360	926360	What?
926360	928360	Yes, it is.
928360	930360	It is a bit complicated.
930360	932360	There is a symmetry.
932360	934360	It means
934360	936360	when you write the velocity field
936360	938360	like this,
938360	940360	in the end,
940360	942360	we will do an unshrinkable flow.
942360	944360	The unshrinkable flow is just
944360	946360	that the velocity field drops a little bit.
946360	948360	All the velocity fields
948360	950360	can be projected.
950360	952360	All the radians of pressure
952360	954360	can be shrinked.
954360	956360	After this,
956360	958360	this space
958360	960360	will only be dominated by
960360	962360	one particle.
962360	964360	Given curl of u,
964360	966360	we can only decide how much u is.
966360	968360	The curl of u
968360	970360	will be mapped to
970360	972360	the two-component
972360	974360	wave function
974360	976360	corresponding to the spin vector
976360	978360	or block vector.
978360	980360	There is a gauge symmetry
980360	982360	which is the variable
982360	984360	of the unshrinkable area.
984360	986360	It will be
986360	988360	corresponding to the same velocity field.
988360	990360	In the end,
990360	992360	you will see a big
992360	994360	redundant degree of freedom.
994360	996360	So on the right,
996360	998360	the overall phase
998360	1000360	of quantum mechanics
1000360	1002360	is not important.
1002360	1004360	Is it physical or...
1004360	1006360	It's the same.
1006360	1008360	It just matches
1008360	1010360	the velocity field.
1010360	1012360	In the velocity field,
1012360	1014360	we need to do pressure projection.
1014360	1016360	The redundancy.
1016360	1018360	In the end, it will match.
1018360	1020360	Yes.
1020360	1022360	In the velocity field,
1022360	1024360	we need to remove
1024360	1026360	some redundancy
1026360	1028360	to describe the
1028360	1030360	unshrinkable flow.
1030360	1032360	It's the phase shift
1032360	1034360	in Schrodinger's equation.
1034360	1036360	Why can you use
1036360	1038360	both domain and three-dimensional?
1038360	1040360	This is...
1042360	1044360	Actually,
1044360	1046360	domain can be done
1046360	1048360	in higher dimensions.
1048360	1050360	This is because...
1050360	1052360	I don't know how to explain.
1052360	1054360	It's...
1054360	1056360	Simply put,
1056360	1058360	vorticity is a two-form.
1058360	1060360	Only that thing
1060360	1062360	is used
1062360	1064360	to describe the flow.
1064360	1066360	It's...
1066360	1068360	It's...
1068360	1070360	If I say
1070360	1072360	the speed of unshrinkable flow
1072360	1074360	is equal to
1074360	1076360	the vorticity.
1076360	1078360	It's a two-form.
1078360	1080360	In the end,
1080360	1082360	you only need
1082360	1084360	a map.
1084360	1086360	At most, you only need
1086360	1088360	a map.
1088360	1090360	So, vorticity is a two-form.
1090360	1092360	Yes.
1092360	1094360	If it's in the other direction,
1094360	1096360	it won't shrink.
1096360	1098360	It's not important.
1098360	1100360	It can shrink.
1102360	1104360	Yes.
1104360	1106360	You can see
1106360	1108360	in the end.
1108360	1110360	Now, let's say it's just a metronome.
1110360	1112360	Will you talk about turbulence?
1112360	1114360	I won't talk about turbulence.
1114360	1116360	But I will talk about
1116360	1118360	the dynamics of a normal vortex.
1122360	1124360	This is incompressible Schrödinger's flow.
1124360	1126360	Then we...
1126360	1128360	The mathematical simulation
1128360	1130360	is very simple.
1130360	1132360	You just need to
1132360	1134360	make a circle and
1134360	1136360	solve the linear Schrödinger's equation.
1136360	1138360	It corresponds to
1138360	1140360	your field.
1140360	1142360	It's like a simulation
1142360	1144360	of inertia motion.
1144360	1146360	Then you apply potential force
1146360	1148360	to make the field
1148360	1150360	become divergence-free.
1152360	1154360	Then we started to do some simulations.
1154360	1156360	In the end, we found
1156360	1158360	that it was
1158360	1160360	very successful
1160360	1162360	in simulating
1162360	1164360	vortex dynamics.
1164360	1166360	What is vortex?
1166360	1168360	I just said curl of velocity.
1168360	1170360	That thing is called vorticity.
1170360	1172360	In the real fluid,
1172360	1174360	it only appears
1174360	1176360	from the boundary.
1176360	1178360	It appears from the boundary.
1178360	1180360	When it forms,
1180360	1182360	it's already low-dimensional.
1182360	1184360	It's two-dimensional geometry.
1184360	1186360	That's vortex sheet.
1186360	1188360	Vortex sheet is not stable.
1188360	1190360	It will quickly curl into
1190360	1192360	vortex filaments.
1192360	1194360	It will become a vortex structure.
1194360	1196360	That structure will become very stable.
1196360	1198360	We see a lot of vortex in our daily lives.
1198360	1200360	That's what we call
1200360	1202360	vortex filaments.
1202360	1204360	Are those two real photos?
1204360	1206360	Yes, they are.
1206360	1208360	They are not photoshopped.
1210360	1212360	They look like real photos.
1212360	1214360	The color is very bright.
1214360	1216360	You need to add a filter.
1216360	1218360	Yes, I need to add a filter.
1222360	1224360	This is a real video.
1224360	1226360	But vortex filaments
1226360	1228360	are hard to simulate
1228360	1230360	with a normal
1230360	1232360	fluid software.
1232360	1234360	Because
1234360	1236360	these vortex motions
1236360	1238360	are very sensitive
1238360	1240360	to the
1240360	1242360	vortex thickness.
1244360	1246360	If the vortex becomes thicker,
1246360	1248360	it will become slower.
1248360	1250360	If it becomes thinner, it will become faster.
1250360	1252360	So if you really want to...
1252360	1254360	And the whole fluid is
1254360	1256360	the whole fluid motion
1256360	1258360	is dominated by
1258360	1260360	these
1260360	1262360	one-dimensional filaments.
1262360	1264360	So if you want to calculate the whole fluid
1264360	1266360	qualitatively correct,
1266360	1268360	you need to use a very high
1268360	1270360	resolution fluid to solve
1270360	1272360	those vortex.
1272360	1274360	Otherwise, the thickness will be misinterpreted.
1274360	1276360	The whole
1276360	1278360	vortex dynamics
1278360	1280360	will be qualitatively wrong.
1280360	1282360	So you either need
1282360	1284360	a very expensive grid,
1284360	1286360	or you need to use some very complicated methods
1286360	1288360	to describe those vortex dynamics
1288360	1290360	using some real curves.
1290360	1292360	Then you can do those simple reconnections.
1294360	1296360	But if you use Schrodinger's
1296360	1298360	equation...
1298360	1300360	Let me talk about
1300360	1302360	the difficulties first.
1302360	1304360	You can see from some benchmark tests.
1304360	1306360	There is a phenomenon called leapfrogging vortex rings.
1306360	1308360	If you put two vortex rings
1308360	1310360	in front and back,
1310360	1312360	the vortex rings will be sucked
1312360	1314360	to the front.
1314360	1316360	This is a real video.
1316360	1318360	They will be exchanged.
1318360	1320360	Then you will see...
1320360	1322360	Will the people on the line see
1322360	1324360	the same thing?
1326360	1328360	Anyway,
1328360	1330360	two vortex rings will leapfrog.
1330360	1332360	But if you use
1332360	1334360	a general
1334360	1336360	mathematical method
1336360	1338360	to solve Euler's equation or Navier-Stokes equation,
1338360	1340360	even if you use a very advanced method,
1340360	1342360	but if you are in a very rough grid,
1342360	1344360	the two vortex rings will merge together very quickly.
1344360	1346360	Then you won't see that leapfrogging phenomenon.
1346360	1348360	Now we are solving...
1348360	1350360	We just
1350360	1352360	introduced incompressible Schrodinger flow.
1352360	1354360	It has the same resolution size.
1354360	1356360	You can see that
1356360	1358360	it can do this.
1358360	1360360	It can reproduce
1360360	1362360	this observed phenomenon.
1362360	1364360	Then...
1364360	1366360	Let me ask a question.
1366360	1368360	You just said
1368360	1370360	that it can reproduce this phenomenon.
1370360	1372360	It means that
1372360	1374360	you can see it like this.
1374360	1376360	But if you change it to a parameter,
1376360	1378360	it can really
1378360	1380360	change to
1380360	1382360	the gas you just saw.
1382360	1384360	Yes.
1384360	1386360	Because there are some parameters in it.
1386360	1388360	So if you want to do
1388360	1390360	further parameter
1390360	1392360	tuning,
1392360	1394360	of course you can match it.
1394360	1396360	It's actually very simple.
1396360	1398360	Just two rings.
1398360	1400360	It has a certain vortex.
1400360	1402360	When the ring is small enough,
1402360	1404360	its final dynamics is dominated by
1404360	1406360	the dynamics of the vortex filaments.
1406360	1408360	That thing is
1408360	1410360	mathematically...
1410360	1412360	Even Schrodinger, you can push it out.
1412360	1414360	Under that progressive behavior,
1414360	1416360	it's the same.
1416360	1418360	It's...
1418360	1420360	It's...
1420360	1422360	You can push it out.
1422360	1424360	Then the two rings will jump like this.
1426360	1428360	Yes.
1428360	1430360	This system is very robust.
1430360	1432360	If you put the two rings together,
1432360	1434360	it will jump.
1434360	1436360	It will jump according to
1436360	1438360	the evolution distance.
1438360	1440360	So we just put it anywhere and it will jump.
1442360	1444360	Another phenomenon is also a very simple setup.
1444360	1446360	It means that you put two vortex rings
1446360	1448360	on each other.
1448360	1450360	But there is an angle.
1450360	1452360	Then they will recombine.
1452360	1454360	Then it will separate from the other two directions.
1454360	1456360	This is a real experiment.
1458360	1460360	You can see the two rings.
1460360	1462360	It's like this.
1462360	1464360	Then it separates.
1464360	1466360	If you use a normal
1466360	1468360	LTI
1472360	1474360	software,
1474360	1476360	it's hard to simulate this thing.
1476360	1478360	It really needs very high accuracy.
1478360	1480360	This is the same as
1480360	1482360	our method.
1482360	1484360	You can find this phenomenon
1484360	1486360	on a very thick network.
1486360	1488360	Then
1488360	1490360	I just said that
1492360	1494360	when simulating LTI,
1494360	1496360	its grid resolution
1496360	1498360	dominates a large part.
1498360	1500360	So you can see that
1500360	1502360	using some traditional methods
1504360	1506360	to look at
1506360	1508360	the node.
1508360	1510360	Then you will find that at different resolutions,
1510360	1512360	the result is the same.
1512360	1514360	So using our method
1514360	1516360	on a very thick network, it's close to the end.
1516360	1518360	It can simulate
1518360	1520360	some other interesting phenomena.
1522360	1524360	It can be used
1524360	1526360	in computer graphics.
1526360	1528360	For example, you can simulate a jet.
1528360	1530360	You can simulate an obstacle.
1530360	1532360	The vortex behind.
1532360	1534360	The vortex behind.
1534360	1536360	Then you can simulate
1536360	1538360	a moving obstacle.
1540360	1542360	This video looks good when it looks smooth.
1542360	1544360	Then there's
1544360	1546360	another
1546360	1548360	moving obstacle.
1548360	1550360	Because
1550360	1552360	in this kind of vortex dynamics,
1552360	1554360	if it can be calculated accurately,
1554360	1556360	you can see
1556360	1558360	a more realistic vortex
1558360	1560360	phenomenon.
1560360	1562360	This is really important
1562360	1564360	in computer graphics.
1566360	1568360	These are two
1568360	1570360	water-absorbing boxes.
1570360	1572360	It's called secondary small ring shoot-off.
1572360	1574360	What I'm doing here is
1574360	1576360	putting two
1576360	1578360	pieces of ink
1578360	1580360	on top of each other.
1580360	1582360	It will also
1582360	1584360	have a problem.
1584360	1586360	What is network complexity?
1588360	1590360	Network complexity is
1590360	1592360	that
1592360	1594360	my computation grid
1594360	1596360	how many
1596360	1598360	pieces each side has to cut.
1598360	1600360	So usually
1600360	1602360	usually
1602360	1604360	you have to
1604360	1606360	cut 256
1606360	1608360	times 256 times 256.
1610360	1612360	Or 512 times 512.
1612360	1614360	You often need
1614360	1616360	a very large memory
1616360	1618360	to eat.
1618360	1620360	Or you need to use cluster to compute.
1620360	1622360	This is 64 times
1622360	1624360	64 times 64.
1624360	1626360	Then you introduce it in these grids.
1628360	1630360	Yes.
1630360	1632360	What is relative?
1634360	1636360	You can't say it's relative.
1636360	1638360	How big is the thing in the middle?
1638360	1640360	Oh.
1640360	1642360	It's relative.
1642360	1644360	Just look at this picture.
1644360	1646360	It's
1646360	1648360	64 times 64 times 64.
1648360	1650360	If you put it on the computer
1650360	1652360	you can see
1652360	1654360	that
1654360	1656360	the gray part at the bottom is the network.
1656360	1658360	You can see the grid.
1658360	1660360	That's the real
1660360	1662360	network on the
1662360	1664360	computation of Lisan.
1664360	1666360	So the length of the command
1666360	1668360	is actually normalized.
1668360	1670360	Yes.
1672360	1674360	It has a physical size
1674360	1676360	which is 1m x 1m x 1m.
1676360	1678360	And
1678360	1680360	it has a resolution which is dimensionless.
1680360	1682360	It's 1 out of 64.
1682360	1684360	Then you put it on that position.
1684360	1686360	It becomes the smallest length in the world.
1686360	1688360	At this length
1688360	1690360	we simulate the Lisan version
1690360	1692360	of this grid.
1692360	1694360	Theoretically
1694360	1696360	at this length
1696360	1698360	when it's dimensionless
1698360	1700360	it will be
1700360	1702360	limited to the real
1702360	1704360	continuous world.
1704360	1706360	And this picture
1706360	1708360	is when I'm at 64 times 64 times 64
1708360	1710360	it's very close.
1710360	1712360	But in the traditional method
1712360	1714360	you need a higher resolution.
1720360	1722360	Why did you choose this picture?
1722360	1724360	This is the community.
1724360	1726360	It's a little perverted.
1730360	1732360	You can actually add gravity.
1732360	1734360	It's a little bit
1734360	1736360	when the density is different.
1736360	1738360	That's because
1738360	1740360	there are two components.
1740360	1742360	You can play a trick.
1742360	1744360	For example, when the potential of two components
1744360	1746360	is a little different
1746360	1748360	you can make some effects.
1754360	1756360	Because of the gravity
1756360	1758360	the gravity of the air
1758360	1760360	is pushed up.
1760360	1762360	And this is bar.
1762360	1764360	H bar
1764360	1766360	has a unit
1766360	1768360	which is meter square
1768360	1770360	meter square divided by second.
1770360	1772360	And
1772360	1774360	so
1774360	1776360	I usually
1776360	1778360	make it dimensionless.
1778360	1780360	So according to my real
1780360	1782360	density
1782360	1784360	it's 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 meter.
1784360	1786360	There is a
1786360	1788360	characteristic length
1788360	1790360	which is 1 meter.
1790360	1792360	And then you start to get rid of these variables.
1794360	1796360	Based on experience.
1796360	1798360	Planck constant
1798360	1800360	has nothing to do with the real Planck constant.
1804360	1806360	My final analysis will say
1806360	1808360	you don't have to get close to 0.
1808360	1810360	That is to say
1810360	1812360	H bar can be very large.
1812360	1814360	The phenomenon you just saw
1814360	1816360	is the result when H bar is very large.
1816360	1818360	Finally, we did a mathematical analysis
1818360	1820360	and found that
1820360	1822360	when H bar is very large
1822360	1824360	the result of Perturb
1824360	1826360	is the difference between it and the Euler equation
1826360	1828360	the effect
1828360	1830360	is only in the
1830360	1832360	vortex
1832360	1834360	and other places it will be very fast
1834360	1836360	to the Euler equation.
1836360	1838360	There is this kind of
1838360	1840360	argument.
1840360	1842360	In this case, you will find that
1842360	1844360	when H bar is very large,
1844360	1846360	it will get the vortex
1846360	1848360	dominated Euler equation.
1848360	1850360	Then you will find
1850360	1852360	that
1852360	1854360	I will talk about this later.
1854360	1856360	I don't know what I'm talking about.
1856360	1858360	But
1858360	1860360	H bar
1860360	1862360	when it is very small
1862360	1864360	it will become exactly the Euler equation.
1864360	1866360	You just saw
1866360	1868360	when H bar is very large
1868360	1870360	I can simulate some phenomena
1870360	1872360	and it is matched.
1872360	1874360	I can see the phenomenon in the vortex.
1874360	1876360	It is the same as the vortex.
1876360	1878360	If H bar is very small
1878360	1880360	it will be the same.
1880360	1882360	It will be the same.
1882360	1884360	It can detect the Euler equation
1884360	1886360	on a very large network.
1886360	1888360	Yes, if H bar is too small
1888360	1890360	I think H bar is a bit
1890360	1892360	too large.
1894360	1896360	Yes.
1896360	1898360	In fact, it is H bar
1898360	1900360	that you have to choose.
1904360	1906360	H bar will correspond to
1906360	1908360	your
1908360	1910360	If you know the super fluid
1910360	1912360	there is an H bar inside.
1912360	1914360	That thing will cause the vortex
1914360	1916360	quantization.
1916360	1918360	That is, every vortex unit
1918360	1920360	can be quantized into H bar units.
1920360	1922360	In that case
1922360	1924360	you will see that
1924360	1926360	H bar is very small
1926360	1928360	you have to have the same strength
1928360	1930360	of vortex to detect
1930360	1932360	a lot of small vortices.
1934360	1936360	You can take the real fluid as
1936360	1938360	vortex becomes
1938360	1940360	a continuum.
1940360	1942360	That is, vortex can be any
1942360	1944360	number or size.
1944360	1946360	It can be taken as H bar is infinitely small
1946360	1948360	and there are a lot of vortices.
1948360	1950360	But when H bar is large
1950360	1952360	it still has some thicker vortices.
1952360	1954360	Those vortex dynamics
1954360	1956360	are similar to the vortex dynamics
1956360	1958360	in the fluid.
1962360	1964360	What is the advantage of simulation?
1964360	1966360	Is it because
1966360	1968360	we don't know what linear is?
1968360	1970360	Or does it have some special properties?
1970360	1972360	There are two
1972360	1974360	advantages.
1974360	1976360	One is
1976360	1978360	that the method
1978360	1980360	becomes simpler.
1980360	1982360	You don't have to worry about
1982360	1984360	how to idealize.
1984360	1986360	Because that thing is quite difficult.
1986360	1988360	You just need to idealize the linear system.
1988360	1990360	In Numerical Method
1990360	1992360	it becomes
1992360	1994360	an extreme simplification.
1994360	1996360	The other is
1996360	1998360	that even if I simulate
1998360	2000360	in a very advanced way
2000360	2002360	those non-linear OEVs
2002360	2004360	still can't simulate those phenomena.
2004360	2006360	In our method
2006360	2008360	I can simulate those phenomena
2008360	2010360	in a very early stage.
2010360	2012360	Especially on those
2012360	2014360	thin vortex dynamics.
2014360	2016360	These are the two advantages.
2018360	2020360	Someone asked
2020360	2022360	what is the physics of H bar?
2024360	2026360	Isn't it a high-level question?
2026360	2028360	The physics of H bar
2028360	2030360	in this fluid world
2030360	2032360	can be regarded as a parameter.
2032360	2034360	It will be connected to
2038360	2040360	for example
2042360	2044360	in this animation
2044360	2046360	you can see
2046360	2048360	a small amount of
2048360	2050360	in the end
2050360	2052360	the vortex will
2052360	2054360	cascade to a very low level
2054360	2056360	and look like turbulence.
2056360	2058360	But because of H bar
2058360	2060360	it will
2060360	2062360	go to a certain level and won't continue to fall.
2062360	2064360	That is the vortex concentration.
2064360	2066360	Now that you mentioned it
2066360	2068360	you don't assume
2068360	2070360	that it will cascade.
2070360	2072360	Will it?
2072360	2074360	No.
2076360	2078360	It will still cascade.
2082360	2084360	In the original fluid
2084360	2086360	the vortex will cascade.
2086360	2088360	H bar means
2088360	2090360	that at a certain level
2090360	2092360	H bar will dominate
2092360	2094360	and the fluid will disappear
2094360	2096360	at that level.
2096360	2098360	The vortex will not continue to cascade.
2098360	2100360	It will become diffusion and disappear.
2100360	2102360	It will eat up the energy.
2104360	2106360	So when we look at
2106360	2108360	turbulence
2108360	2110360	if H bar
2110360	2112360	is getting smaller and smaller
2112360	2114360	it will cause
2114360	2116360	turbulence.
2116360	2118360	It will look like turbulence.
2118360	2120360	Without H bar
2120360	2122360	in theory
2122360	2124360	it will develop into
2124360	2126360	this is still an open problem
2126360	2128360	how is turbulence born.
2128360	2130360	A typical situation is that
2130360	2132360	it will continue to cascade from H bar
2132360	2134360	and then dominate into a spectrum
2134360	2136360	of different
2136360	2138360	things.
2138360	2140360	So you mean
2140360	2142360	if H bar is too large
2142360	2144360	if H bar is too large
2144360	2146360	you won't be able to see turbulence.
2146360	2148360	Because
2148360	2150360	it hasn't produced a new vortex yet
2150360	2152360	so it will dissipate.
2154360	2156360	I remember
2156360	2158360	in Sandwich
2158360	2160360	the cascading and reverse cascading
2160360	2162360	were very good.
2164360	2166360	We haven't done
2166360	2168360	that side yet.
2168360	2170360	We want to
2170360	2172360	use
2172360	2174360	a very large network
2174360	2176360	with high resolution
2176360	2178360	and then put
2178360	2180360	some random
2180360	2182360	velocity
2182360	2184360	and random wave function
2184360	2186360	and then use our method
2186360	2188360	to look at its energy spectrum
2188360	2190360	and then compare
2190360	2192360	the turbulence.
2192360	2194360	But we haven't done that yet.
2194360	2196360	But usually
2196360	2198360	if you want to see
2198360	2200360	if this thing can model
2200360	2202360	turbulence
2202360	2204360	you have to look at
2204360	2206360	the energy spectrum first.
2206360	2208360	I think
2208360	2210360	cascading versus reverse cascading
2210360	2212360	is the most important thing.
2212360	2214360	Is there a way?
2214360	2216360	Yes.
2216360	2218360	One.
2218360	2220360	But there are still other ways.
2220360	2222360	So you mean
2222360	2224360	we don't need
2224360	2226360	theory.
2228360	2230360	I think reverse cascading
2230360	2232360	is better.
2232360	2234360	Yes.
2246360	2248360	We also
2248360	2250360	have
2252360	2254360	simulation on the left
2254360	2256360	and real video on the right.
2258360	2260360	This is what we often show to others
2260360	2262360	that
2262360	2264360	we can use our very simple algorithm
2264360	2266360	to do some
2266360	2268360	simulation of turbulence.
2268360	2270360	This is the first part of the remark.
2272360	2274360	It means
2274360	2276360	it breaks through our traditional
2276360	2278360	imaginary fluid calculus
2278360	2280360	what the usual framework looks like.
2280360	2282360	Usually we will
2282360	2284360	figure out how to simulate turbulence.
2284360	2286360	But this framework
2286360	2288360	doesn't have this problem.
2290360	2292360	Especially in Vortex Dynamics
2292360	2294360	we can
2294360	2296360	simulate those phenomena.
2296360	2298360	Usually we think
2298360	2300360	we need to solve Euler's equation
2300360	2302360	or Navier-Stokes equation.
2302360	2304360	We need to be very advanced
2304360	2306360	and have a very fine network
2306360	2308360	to simulate those phenomena.
2308360	2310360	There is also
2310360	2312360	an interesting
2312360	2314360	insight on math.
2316360	2318360	This is
2318360	2320360	incompressible Schrodinger flow equation.
2320360	2322360	It looks like this.
2322360	2324360	Schrodinger equation
2324360	2326360	restricted on
2326360	2328360	a divergence-free constraint.
2330360	2332360	This divergence-free constraint
2332360	2334360	can be translated into
2334360	2336360	wave function and
2336360	2338360	Laplacian.
2338360	2340360	The spatial derivative of the whole equation
2340360	2342360	is Laplacian.
2342360	2344360	This is a very special
2344360	2346360	part of Schrodinger.
2346360	2348360	You often need to talk about
2348360	2350360	U dot grad U.
2350360	2352360	You use a lot of mathematical structures.
2352360	2354360	You often talk about 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional.
2354360	2356360	Or
2356360	2358360	you have to be on a manifold.
2358360	2360360	Laplacian can be set
2360360	2362360	on a very low space.
2362360	2364360	You can have a graph
2364360	2366360	or a point cloud.
2366360	2368360	You don't even need to use a dimensional concept.
2368360	2370360	In that world,
2370360	2372360	you can still discuss similar flow phenomena.
2376360	2378360	This is a surface,
2378360	2380360	so it's still a manifold.
2380360	2382360	Then we have this rabbit
2382360	2384360	and its graph.
2384360	2386360	A triangular graph.
2386360	2388360	You can get the graph.
2388360	2390360	That information is the only thing you need to know.
2390360	2392360	You can solve the
2392360	2394360	Schrodinger equation.
2394360	2396360	You can easily
2396360	2398360	use the same complexity
2398360	2400360	to model the graph
2400360	2402360	in this general space.
2404360	2406360	That was
2406360	2408360	my first part.
2408360	2410360	Next, I'm going to talk about
2410360	2412360	the
2414360	2416360	wave function
2418360	2420360	and
2422360	2424360	the
2424360	2426360	encoded information.
2426360	2428360	This is called
2428360	2430360	Clutch Variables.
2434360	2436360	We developed
2436360	2438360	this theory
2438360	2440360	to connect the Schrodinger equation
2440360	2442360	to the classical field.
2442360	2444360	We have a side project
2444360	2446360	to use this to do
2446360	2448360	some
2448360	2450360	vortex visualization.
2452360	2454360	Okay.
2454360	2456360	Notation means
2456360	2458360	that we often
2458360	2460360	use vector field
2460360	2462360	to represent the speed.
2462360	2464360	On the right,
2464360	2466360	there are many arrows in a fish tank.
2466360	2468360	Alternatively,
2468360	2470360	you can consider its
2470360	2472360	covector,
2472360	2474360	or throw the index down.
2474360	2476360	Or it will
2476360	2478360	become...
2478360	2480360	You can imagine
2480360	2482360	that the arrow
2482360	2484360	is replaced by
2484360	2486360	some hyperplane.
2488360	2490360	This is called
2490360	2492360	Differential Form.
2492360	2494360	Differential Form
2494360	2496360	means that
2496360	2498360	it can be evaluated
2498360	2500360	along some curves.
2500360	2502360	If it is a one-form,
2502360	2504360	it means that
2504360	2506360	it can be evaluated
2506360	2508360	along the curve.
2508360	2510360	This is called
2510360	2512360	Circulation.
2512360	2514360	It is usually visualized
2514360	2516360	as a hyperplane.
2516360	2518360	When you see
2518360	2520360	many hyperplanes,
2520360	2522360	the curve is
2522360	2524360	proportional to
2524360	2526360	the density
2526360	2528360	of these hyperplanes.
2528360	2530360	The density
2530360	2532360	of the banana
2532360	2534360	is the value of the curve.
2534360	2536360	So we often use
2536360	2538360	this one-form.
2540360	2542360	There is also
2542360	2544360	a abstract concept called
2544360	2546360	Pullback.
2546360	2548360	If you have two spaces
2548360	2550360	and you have a map
2550360	2552360	from the space on the left to the space on the right,
2552360	2554360	if there is a Differential Form
2554360	2556360	on the right,
2556360	2558360	you can pull it back
2558360	2560360	into the Differential Form
2560360	2562360	of the space on the left.
2562360	2564360	The definition is that
2564360	2566360	if there is a Differential Form
2566360	2568360	on the right,
2568360	2570360	you map it to the right
2570360	2572360	and evaluate it to the right.
2572360	2574360	The symbol is defined as
2574360	2576360	f star alpha.
2576360	2578360	If you don't use this symbol,
2578360	2580360	you often write
2580360	2582360	the rightmost space.
2582360	2584360	We often write
2584360	2586360	Pullback.
2586360	2588360	Pullback
2588360	2590360	has some beautiful
2590360	2592360	definitions.
2592360	2594360	But that's only
2594360	2596360	a very detailed introduction.
2596360	2598360	So I won't talk about it here.
2606360	2608360	Pullback
2608360	2610360	has something called
2610360	2612360	Exterior Derivative Commute.
2612360	2614360	If you write it in a normal language,
2614360	2616360	it will be very difficult to see.
2616360	2618360	So we like to use
2618360	2620360	this
2620360	2622360	coordinate-free
2622360	2624360	notation.
2626360	2628360	There is a special pullback
2628360	2630360	in the stream.
2630360	2632360	Consider that the map
2632360	2634360	is a flow map.
2634360	2636360	When the stream is flowing,
2636360	2638360	the map is from
2638360	2640360	the space of time 0
2640360	2642360	to the space of time t.
2642360	2644360	In this way,
2644360	2646360	you can naturally
2646360	2648360	generate the map
2648360	2650360	and
2650360	2652360	the physical quantity
2652360	2654360	in the world of time t
2654360	2656360	can be pulled back to the space of time 0.
2656360	2658360	That thing is called
2658360	2660360	Lagrangian Coordinate.
2660360	2662360	The physical quantity
2662360	2664360	in the Lagrangian Coordinate.
2664360	2666360	We often like to discuss
2666360	2668360	the division of time
2668360	2670360	in the Lagrangian Coordinate.
2670360	2672360	That division is called
2672360	2674360	Lead Derivative.
2674360	2676360	If the physical quantity
2676360	2678360	changes with time,
2678360	2680360	it will become
2680360	2682360	the generalized
2682360	2684360	material derivative.
2692360	2694360	I often say that
2694360	2696360	this physical quantity is just
2696360	2698360	carried away by the stream.
2698360	2700360	It means that
2700360	2702360	after it is pulled back
2702360	2704360	to the Lagrangian Coordinate,
2704360	2706360	the world will not change.
2708360	2710360	Do you understand?
2710360	2712360	It doesn't matter.
2712360	2714360	The Euler equation
2714360	2716360	is written as
2716360	2718360	in terms of velocity one form.
2718360	2720360	That is to say,
2720360	2722360	the one form of velocity
2722360	2724360	is the hyperplane
2724360	2726360	covector
2726360	2728360	that I just visualized.
2728360	2730360	It is purely a vector.
2730360	2732360	There is a
2732360	2734360	derivative of some function
2734360	2736360	on the right.
2736360	2738360	We often call that
2738360	2740360	an exact form.
2740360	2742360	The exact form
2742360	2744360	means that
2744360	2746360	the velocity form
2746360	2748360	is divergence-free.
2752360	2754360	The vorticity equation
2754360	2756360	is purely a vector.
2756360	2758360	The vorticity
2758360	2760360	is a two-form.
2760360	2762360	Vorticity is a two-form.
2762360	2764360	Vorticity
2764360	2766360	is a quantity.
2766360	2768360	It is not a vector.
2768360	2770360	It is a quantity
2770360	2772360	that is to be measured
2772360	2774360	on a two-dimensional curve.
2774360	2776360	We often say vorticity flux.
2776360	2778360	In fact,
2778360	2780360	what we can measure
2780360	2782360	is the concept of flux
2782360	2784360	that is to be measured
2784360	2786360	on a two-dimensional curve.
2786360	2788360	Then,
2788360	2790360	if you see a curve
2790360	2792360	that flows
2792360	2794360	at any given time,
2794360	2796360	you can pull it back
2796360	2798360	to its zero-time state
2798360	2800360	and put the evaluated
2800360	2802360	vorticity flux
2802360	2804360	back to the original space.
2804360	2806360	You will find that it changes at any time.
2806360	2808360	That is, vorticity is purely a vector.
2808360	2810360	You want to ask...
2810360	2812360	The meaning of vector
2812360	2814360	is not that
2814360	2816360	it has a
2816360	2818360	zero-time state.
2818360	2820360	You can ask again.
2820360	2822360	The meaning of vector
2822360	2824360	is not that
2824360	2826360	it has a zero-time state.
2826360	2828360	There is still a
2828360	2830360	velocity field in the fluid.
2830360	2832360	It is u.
2832360	2834360	The relationship between u and eta
2834360	2836360	and the velocity one-form
2836360	2838360	is that
2838360	2840360	eta is the velocity
2840360	2842360	flat.
2842360	2844360	It is the co-vector.
2844360	2846360	It is the dual vector.
2846360	2848360	Then,
2850360	2852360	the physical quantity
2852360	2854360	is directly
2854360	2856360	purely a vector
2856360	2858360	in this velocity field.
2858360	2860360	It changes at any time.
2860360	2862360	You see that
2862360	2864360	L sub u
2864360	2866360	depends on
2866360	2868360	the velocity.
2868360	2870360	Then, eta
2870360	2872360	u depends on eta.
2872360	2874360	So, it is a nonlinear function.
2876360	2878360	The vorticity
2878360	2880360	equation is the same.
2880360	2882360	In fact, vorticity
2882360	2884360	must be equal to d of eta
2884360	2886360	or d of u
2886360	2888360	flat. So, omega
2888360	2890360	is coupled with velocity.
2890360	2892360	In this case,
2892360	2894360	vorticity is
2894360	2896360	purely a vector
2896360	2898360	in this equation.
2898360	2900360	When they are coupled together,
2900360	2902360	it increases.
2902360	2904360	What are the benefits?
2904360	2906360	I am just talking about
2906360	2908360	the benefits.
2908360	2910360	There is no benefit or
2910360	2912360	disadvantage.
2912360	2914360	It is just a different formulation.
2914360	2916360	Since the time of Euler,
2916360	2918360	we have been talking about
2918360	2920360	purely a vector.
2920360	2922360	This term is not invented by me.
2924360	2926360	So, there is no disadvantage.
2926360	2928360	I am just saying
2928360	2930360	that
2930360	2932360	I am just saying that
2932360	2934360	the definition of purely a vector is
2934360	2936360	the force derivative.
2936360	2938360	It is just a general material derivative.
2938360	2940360	It is just a quantity of u dot grad.
2940360	2942360	I can imagine
2942360	2944360	writing a general
2944360	2946360	derivative.
2946360	2948360	What is the general derivative?
2948360	2950360	u dot grad.
2950360	2952360	The u dot grad
2952360	2954360	you mentioned
2954360	2956360	is used for zero-form.
2956360	2958360	Few people talk about
2958360	2960360	how to generalize
2960360	2962360	one-form, two-form, or other tensors.
2962360	2964360	In this case,
2964360	2966360	people can only write
2966360	2968360	a basis for those tensors.
2968360	2970360	For those
2970360	2972360	previous functions,
2972360	2974360	they become a zero-form function.
2974360	2976360	You can do
2976360	2978360	a partial division of time
2978360	2980360	plus u dot grad.
2980360	2982360	But often the right-hand side won't do that.
2982360	2984360	It should be taken care of.
2984360	2986360	It should not be a function.
2986360	2988360	It should be a tensor.
2990360	2992360	It contains those things.
2992360	2994360	So,
2994360	2996360	sometimes people are surprised
2996360	2998360	that the vorticity should not be written as
2998360	3000360	zero on the right-hand side.
3000360	3002360	So, I added an equation here.
3002360	3004360	We often see vorticity as a vector.
3004360	3006360	Or three components
3006360	3008360	with some
3008360	3010360	basis.
3010360	3012360	Then we find that the right-hand side is not zero.
3012360	3014360	Then it is regarded as a vortex stretching term.
3014360	3016360	People often say that
3016360	3018360	the difference between two-form and three-form is
3018360	3020360	that sometimes there is
3020360	3022360	a vortex stretching term.
3022360	3024360	It's just because
3024360	3026360	it's a co-dimension.
3026360	3028360	When it's different,
3028360	3030360	it should be a tensor,
3030360	3032360	but it's a vector.
3032360	3034360	When it's a purely vector,
3034360	3036360	there is a difference.
3036360	3038360	Then,
3038360	3040360	I want to emphasize that
3040360	3042360	I only use the above notation.
3042360	3044360	I only use the simple notation
3044360	3046360	to represent
3046360	3048360	what I need to use.
3050360	3052360	The first one is notation.
3052360	3054360	Now I can talk about
3054360	3056360	clebsch representation.
3056360	3058360	Clebsch is
3058360	3060360	from 1850s.
3062360	3064360	You may have heard of
3064360	3066360	Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.
3066360	3068360	But most people may not know
3068360	3070360	quantum mechanics.
3070360	3072360	Who is the boss?
3072360	3074360	Clebsch.
3074360	3076360	They seem to be from the same era.
3076360	3078360	But they
3078360	3080360	are not used
3080360	3082360	to describe quantum mechanics.
3082360	3084360	They want to describe
3084360	3086360	SU.
3086360	3088360	That was in
3088360	3090360	the mid-19th century.
3090360	3092360	So people think
3092360	3094360	Clebsch is a modernist.
3094360	3096360	No, he is from
3096360	3098360	the mid-19th century.
3098360	3100360	But some of his work
3100360	3102360	is in quantum mechanics.
3104360	3106360	Before Clebsch,
3106360	3108360	people only discussed
3108360	3110360	potential flow.
3110360	3112360	At first, people didn't know
3112360	3114360	what to do with quantum mechanics.
3114360	3116360	People didn't know curl operator.
3116360	3118360	And there were no planes at that time.
3118360	3120360	People were most concerned about
3120360	3122360	the problem of quantum mechanics.
3122360	3124360	So
3124360	3126360	it was all about
3126360	3128360	potential flow.
3128360	3130360	In that case,
3130360	3132360	velocity one form is
3132360	3134360	d of some function.
3134360	3136360	Velocity vector field is
3136360	3138360	the gradient of some function.
3138360	3140360	This is potential.
3140360	3142360	But there was no vorticity.
3142360	3144360	So Clebsch wrote a paper
3144360	3146360	in Camp-Holt's
3146360	3148360	first invention of
3148360	3150360	vorticity.
3150360	3152360	He immediately thought
3152360	3154360	potential flow should be generalized.
3154360	3156360	Otherwise,
3156360	3158360	the vorticity will be destroyed.
3158360	3160360	So he considered
3160360	3162360	two other potentials.
3162360	3164360	One is lambda and the other is mu.
3164360	3166360	He wrote velocity one form
3166360	3168360	as lambda d mu plus d phi.
3168360	3170360	And
3170360	3172360	lambda d mu
3172360	3174360	is generalized.
3174360	3176360	It will have vorticity.
3176360	3178360	This was very popular
3178360	3180360	at that time.
3180360	3182360	You can see it in thermodynamics.
3182360	3184360	It's not
3184360	3186360	closed.
3186360	3188360	It's
3188360	3190360	TDS.
3194360	3196360	At that time,
3196360	3198360	it's easy to see
3198360	3200360	lambda d mu as a consideration.
3200360	3202360	It's natural.
3202360	3204360	At that time,
3204360	3206360	d phi can be used as
3206360	3208360	potential flow.
3208360	3210360	Lambda d mu is not necessarily
3210360	3212360	divergence-free.
3212360	3214360	As long as phi is good enough.
3214360	3216360	If so,
3216360	3218360	I will look at
3218360	3220360	the vorticity two form.
3220360	3222360	It's just lambda wedge d mu.
3222360	3224360	Phi is not important.
3230360	3232360	But
3232360	3234360	it's like this.
3234360	3236360	Any lambda mu
3236360	3238360	can be solved
3238360	3240360	by
3240360	3242360	the fact that
3242360	3244360	eta needs to be divergence-free.
3244360	3246360	This is
3246360	3248360	Helmholtz's
3248360	3250360	decomposition theorem.
3252360	3254360	Any
3256360	3258360	three-dimensional field
3258360	3260360	can be divided into
3260360	3262360	divergence-free part and curl-free part.
3262360	3264360	This is Helmholtz's decomposition theorem.
3268360	3270360	Is this the only part?
3270360	3272360	No.
3274360	3276360	It's not well-defined.
3276360	3278360	Potential flow is not well-defined.
3278360	3280360	Phi can be any parameter.
3282360	3284360	D phi is well-defined.
3284360	3286360	The left part is well-defined.
3286360	3288360	It's not well-defined or not well-defined.
3288360	3290360	It can be represented by
3290360	3292360	this equation.
3292360	3294360	Phi is not defined as
3294360	3296360	d inverse of eta.
3296360	3298360	It's not well-defined.
3300360	3302360	I only consider
3302360	3304360	the velocity field.
3304360	3306360	It's the form of d of some function.
3306360	3308360	Then we discuss how to
3308360	3310360	describe the function.
3312360	3314360	I want to have more potential.
3314360	3316360	Three potentials.
3316360	3318360	I deliberately put this form
3318360	3320360	as curl-free.
3322360	3324360	It's not
3324360	3326360	orthogonal splitting.
3328360	3330360	I don't claim this is
3330360	3332360	a splitting.
3332360	3334360	It's not unique splitting.
3334360	3336360	It's not like this.
3338360	3340360	You can also discuss
3340360	3342360	what the gauge symmetry is.
3342360	3344360	It can be short form lambda mu phi.
3344360	3346360	It corresponds to the left side.
3346360	3348360	There are a lot.
3348360	3350360	It should be easy to see.
3356360	3358360	Omega looks like this.
3358360	3360360	It means
3360360	3362360	you will see later
3362360	3364360	it's the area form of
3364360	3366360	lambda mu plane.
3366360	3368360	It's like gradient mu.
3368360	3370360	Gradient lambda cross gradient mu.
3370360	3372360	It's a small area.
3376360	3378360	If you want to use
3378360	3380360	vector potential,
3380360	3382360	can you use it?
3382360	3384360	Yes.
3388360	3390360	If you want to use
3390360	3392360	vector potential,
3392360	3394360	omega corresponds to
3394360	3396360	magnetic field or curvature.
3396360	3398360	I will use it later.
3398360	3400360	Then
3402360	3404360	So
3404360	3406360	capstructure
3406360	3408360	is described as
3408360	3410360	three potentials.
3410360	3412360	You can ask
3412360	3414360	what the three potentials
3414360	3416360	satisfy.
3416360	3418360	Then you will find
3418360	3420360	those functions are purely reflected.
3420360	3422360	Then phi
3422360	3424360	lambda mu is purely reflected.
3424360	3426360	Then phi
3426360	3428360	is the time point.
3428360	3430360	It is chosen to say
3430360	3432360	eta is divergence free and
3432360	3434360	for all time.
3434360	3436360	This is capstructure.
3436360	3438360	But it's
3438360	3440360	not that famous.
3440360	3442360	Then
3442360	3444360	there are still
3444360	3446360	some works on it.
3446360	3448360	For example, Marston
3448360	3450360	found that
3450360	3452360	capstructure representation can make
3452360	3454360	fluid
3454360	3456360	described as Hamiltonian system.
3456360	3458360	Hamiltonian system is
3458360	3460360	a generalized coordinate
3460360	3462360	and the momentum corresponding to it.
3462360	3464360	There will be a position and momentum
3464360	3466360	relationship.
3466360	3468360	This is the infinite version.
3468360	3470360	Because fluid has infinite freedom.
3470360	3472360	Then
3472360	3474360	lambda and mu
3474360	3476360	correspond to
3476360	3478360	position and momentum.
3478360	3480360	Then
3480360	3482360	there are some beautiful mathematical structures.
3482360	3484360	However,
3484360	3486360	people think it's too artificial.
3486360	3488360	It's not practical.
3488360	3490360	The main reason is
3490360	3492360	there are a lot of fluid
3492360	3494360	and a lot of momentum.
3494360	3496360	It can't be written as lambda and mu plus phi.
3496360	3498360	Then
3498360	3500360	it doesn't mean
3500360	3502360	it can't be...
3502360	3504360	It doesn't mean
3504360	3506360	some capstructure can be designed in a strange way.
3506360	3508360	It is topologically
3508360	3510360	separated.
3510360	3512360	For example, if your eta is written as
3512360	3514360	lambda and mu plus phi.
3514360	3516360	Then there is a quantity called helicity.
3516360	3518360	It is the
3518360	3520360	velocity
3520360	3522360	and velocity
3522360	3524360	are integrated.
3524360	3526360	Then
3526360	3528360	its total points
3528360	3530360	will be equal to
3530360	3532360	the average
3532360	3534360	of the vortex line in the fluid.
3534360	3536360	It's like
3536360	3538360	that
3538360	3540360	if you have two vortex filaments
3540360	3542360	and there is a linking,
3542360	3544360	then the helicity is not linked.
3544360	3546360	Then
3546360	3548360	it can use points to describe.
3548360	3550360	But if
3550360	3552360	eta is written as lambda and mu plus phi,
3552360	3554360	you can easily prove that
3554360	3556360	its total helicity is linked.
3556360	3558360	Then it will cause
3558360	3560360	a lot of velocity
3560360	3562360	that helicity won't be linked.
3562360	3564360	It is topologically
3564360	3566360	unable to be described
3566360	3568360	as a capstructure.
3570360	3572360	And if it is possible,
3572360	3574360	it is difficult to find
3574360	3576360	lambda and mu.
3576360	3578360	And even if you find it, it is not unique.
3578360	3580360	Just like what you just found.
3580360	3582360	Does it have the same thing as trace-734?
3582360	3584360	Yes.
3584360	3586360	Trace-734.
3586360	3588360	If it is a higher-dimensional fluid,
3588360	3590360	for example, a 5D fluid,
3590360	3592360	it has a slightly higher helicity.
3592360	3594360	Yes.
3594360	3596360	This question is a bit confusing.
3596360	3598360	Will there be this effect?
3598360	3600360	Yes. For example, a 2D fluid,
3600360	3602360	no one will discuss its helicity.
3602360	3604360	Then 3D, 5D, 7D,
3604360	3606360	no, 4D fluid,
3606360	3608360	you can still discuss
3608360	3610360	three-dimensional helicity.
3610360	3612360	It follows the fluid,
3612360	3614360	it is purely a dimension.
3614360	3616360	It can be grouped into 3D.
3616360	3618360	It is a 3D form.
3618360	3620360	It is purely a dimension.
3620360	3622360	Then if it is
3622360	3624360	a three-dimensional fluid,
3624360	3626360	it is a closed space.
3626360	3628360	It should be like this.
3628360	3630360	Then a five-dimensional fluid,
3630360	3632360	it corresponds to trace-734.
3632360	3634360	It means that
3634360	3636360	depending on how high your helicity is,
3636360	3638360	you can write a lot of
3638360	3640360	new concert content.
3640360	3642360	With trace-734.
3646360	3648360	Then because of these difficulties,
3648360	3650360	some people want to write
3650360	3652360	Clutch Representation.
3652360	3654360	So they invented a thing called
3654360	3656360	Multi-Component Clutch Variable.
3656360	3658360	Lambda and mu
3658360	3660360	make a lot of noise,
3660360	3662360	and then add them together.
3662360	3664360	Then diffuse.
3664360	3666360	Diffuse is the same as
3666360	3668360	pressure projection.
3668360	3670360	But this is very
3670360	3672360	new insight.
3672360	3674360	Because it is trivial.
3674360	3676360	You can write it
3676360	3678360	in three-dimensional form.
3678360	3680360	Velocity 1 force
3680360	3682360	is also very trivial.
3682360	3684360	This is exactly Clutch Representation.
3684360	3686360	Multi-Component Clutch Representation.
3686360	3688360	So you don't have
3688360	3690360	as much new insight as Lagrangian.
3690360	3692360	But there is
3692360	3694360	a very interesting paper
3694360	3696360	in the 1980s.
3696360	3698360	At that time,
3698360	3700360	it used another
3700360	3702360	new
3702360	3704360	generalized Clutch Variable method.
3704360	3706360	You put the lambda and mu,
3706360	3708360	which is
3708360	3710360	the key term.
3710360	3712360	You put lambda and mu together
3712360	3714360	as a map.
3714360	3716360	It is sent from the fluid domain to R2.
3716360	3718360	Then omega equals
3718360	3720360	lambda times mu.
3720360	3722360	It is the area
3722360	3724360	of the two-dimensional space
3724360	3726360	pulled back by the map.
3726360	3728360	That is,
3728360	3730360	it does the variable conversion.
3730360	3732360	You can think of it as
3732360	3734360	you put the S,
3734360	3736360	which is lambda and mu together.
3738360	3740360	R2 vector value
3740360	3742360	function.
3742360	3744360	From three-dimensional to two-dimensional.
3744360	3746360	On the left,
3746360	3748360	you can draw any two-dimensional curve.
3748360	3750360	You can discuss
3750360	3752360	the vorticity flux on it.
3752360	3754360	Its value is equal to the area
3754360	3756360	on the right.
3756360	3758360	How much time did I spend?
3760360	3762360	8 minutes.
3762360	3764360	Oh.
3764360	3766360	OK.
3766360	3768360	This is a natural generalization.
3768360	3770360	You can imagine that you put the lambda and mu
3770360	3772360	together. I don't take it as R2.
3772360	3774360	I can take it as any two-dimensional manifold.
3774360	3776360	So you can
3776360	3778360	consider it as a sphere.
3778360	3780360	Then,
3780360	3782360	the
3782360	3784360	vorticity can still be taken as
3784360	3786360	the area on the sphere
3786360	3788360	from the pullback.
3788360	3790360	You can't actually
3790360	3792360	put the lambda and mu together.
3792360	3794360	You can only write it as a variable conversion.
3796360	3798360	If so,
3798360	3800360	you will find that the helicity is not necessarily the same.
3800360	3802360	So you can
3802360	3804360	find that at least most of the three-dimensional
3804360	3806360	flux can be approximated.
3810360	3812360	Yes.
3812360	3814360	Yes.
3816360	3818360	The dimension is not the same.
3818360	3820360	This is a continuous map.
3820360	3822360	SC continuous map.
3822360	3824360	Then you can discuss its pullback.
3824360	3826360	There is a tool form on the right.
3826360	3828360	You can turn the pullback
3828360	3830360	into a tool form.
3830360	3832360	And that tool form,
3832360	3834360	if you just put the area on the right
3834360	3836360	from the pullback into
3836360	3838360	vorticity,
3838360	3840360	it is a
3840360	3842360	it is a
3842360	3844360	capture representation.
3844360	3846360	Because the core of the capture representation
3846360	3848360	is that omega equals
3848360	3850360	lambda which equals
3850360	3852360	the area from the pullback
3852360	3854360	into vorticity.
3858360	3860360	Yes.
3860360	3862360	I will say syntactic manifold.
3862360	3864360	There is a
3864360	3866360	non-degenerate tool form.
3868360	3870360	Yes.
3870360	3872360	Yes.
3872360	3874360	This is the syntactic manifold value
3874360	3876360	function.
3876360	3878360	The non-degenerate version of
3878360	3880360	syntactic structure
3880360	3882360	is what Marston and others
3882360	3884360	saw.
3890360	3892360	So we think
3892360	3894360	this method is
3894360	3896360	quite interesting.
3896360	3898360	It turns the space on the right
3898360	3900360	into a general manifold.
3900360	3902360	So we look for this route.
3902360	3904360	But this
3904360	3906360	is just a two-page paper.
3906360	3908360	I didn't talk much about it.
3908360	3910360	So we continue to develop this thing.
3910360	3912360	But it only discusses vorticity.
3912360	3914360	Velocity can also be generalized like this.
3914360	3916360	To generalize velocity,
3916360	3918360	we remember that
3918360	3920360	velocity is written as this lambda
3920360	3922360	dmu plus dv.
3922360	3924360	You can also think of it as a
3924360	3926360	map size. It is sent to a three-dimensional space.
3926360	3928360	Then it projects it.
3928360	3930360	Then it
3930360	3932360	pulls back a one-form.
3932360	3934360	Just like the
3934360	3936360	vorticity is a two-form.
3940360	3942360	Its form is xdy plus dz.
3942360	3944360	You can imagine
3944360	3946360	what this means.
3946360	3948360	This is what Clebsch did.
3948360	3950360	Before Clebsch, people
3950360	3952360	only looked at the potential flow,
3952360	3954360	which is eta equals to dv.
3954360	3956360	You can think of it as
3956360	3958360	pulling back the dz one-form.
3958360	3960360	You can think of dz
3960360	3962360	as these hyperplane fields.
3966360	3968360	They all point in the same direction.
3968360	3970360	A very trivial one-form.
3970360	3972360	Then you pull it back like this.
3972360	3974360	What Clebsch did
3974360	3976360	was to replace the template field
3976360	3978360	with a more
3978360	3980360	rich xdy plus dz form.
3980360	3982360	Then you see
3982360	3984360	that hyperplane field
3984360	3986360	is nowhere integrable.
3986360	3988360	It's not just
3988360	3990360	some tangent spaces
3990360	3992360	in the family of surfaces.
3992360	3994360	It's all separated like this.
3996360	3998360	This is called contact geometry.
4002360	4004360	Clebsch representation
4004360	4006360	means that
4006360	4008360	I have a size of a map, which is sent to this space.
4008360	4010360	Then I pull back these hyperplane fields
4010360	4012360	to become the velocity
4012360	4014360	of this hyperplane field, one-form.
4014360	4016360	To describe the flow,
4016360	4018360	instead of saying
4018360	4020360	how some one-forms change at any time,
4020360	4022360	he just said how this psi changes at any time.
4022360	4024360	Then this becomes a zero-form.
4024360	4026360	So it becomes a little bit
4026360	4028360	simpler.
4030360	4032360	Then in the case of Clebsch,
4032360	4034360	remember lambda, mu, and phi.
4034360	4036360	Actually, only lambda and mu determine the vorticity.
4036360	4038360	So
4038360	4040360	there is a natural projection,
4040360	4042360	which is just a projection.
4042360	4044360	Then
4044360	4046360	you can say that
4046360	4048360	the vorticity is just the two parts in front
4048360	4050360	of the pullback area.
4050360	4052360	Then
4052360	4054360	we call the psi velocity-Clebsch map.
4054360	4056360	Then S is called
4056360	4058360	vorticity-Clebsch map.
4058360	4060360	So the identity after the pullback
4060360	4062360	is the velocity of the vorticity.
4064360	4066360	Then you will find that
4066360	4068360	actually
4068360	4070360	the x, dy, and z on the right
4070360	4072360	and the sigma below
4072360	4074360	are x, dy, and h, dy.
4074360	4076360	One is the area form,
4076360	4078360	and the other is the form of Clebsch.
4078360	4080360	The relationship between the two
4080360	4082360	is actually quite important.
4082360	4084360	It's very obvious.
4084360	4086360	The result is that
4086360	4088360	the relationship of the
4088360	4090360	theta on top
4090360	4092360	is quite important.
4092360	4094360	It's
4094360	4096360	d theta equals pi star sigma.
4096360	4098360	That is, the curved
4098360	4100360	curves on top
4100360	4102360	are like a velocity field.
4102360	4104360	A fixed velocity field.
4104360	4106360	Then the curl
4106360	4108360	corresponds to the vorticity
4108360	4110360	in the template velocity field.
4110360	4112360	The two forms are
4112360	4114360	the area forms
4114360	4116360	in the two-dimensional space below.
4116360	4118360	Then
4118360	4120360	this
4120360	4122360	means that
4122360	4124360	the frame on the right
4124360	4126360	and the square on the left
4126360	4128360	are
4128360	4130360	in another field.
4130360	4132360	This is called pre-quantum bundle.
4136360	4138360	I don't have much time,
4138360	4140360	so I'll
4140360	4142360	try to
4142360	4144360	explain
4144360	4146360	what each sentence
4146360	4148360	means.
4148360	4150360	I don't think it's bad.
4150360	4152360	It's not bad?
4152360	4154360	It's not bad, right?
4156360	4158360	What I just said
4158360	4160360	is that it can be any syntax manifold.
4160360	4162360	The two-dimensional space below me
4162360	4164360	can also be a sphere,
4164360	4166360	or a Riemann surface,
4166360	4168360	or in general, any syntax manifold,
4168360	4170360	any two-dimensional space.
4170360	4172360	Then
4172360	4174360	there is actually
4174360	4176360	a fiber bundle above it.
4176360	4178360	If I add one more,
4178360	4180360	each point below me will grow
4180360	4182360	a little bit of freedom.
4182360	4184360	Then it becomes
4184360	4186360	a three-dimensional space
4186360	4188360	in the two-dimensional space below.
4190360	4192360	There is an operator
4192360	4194360	called projection.
4194360	4196360	Then there is
4196360	4198360	a
4198360	4200360	one-form
4200360	4202360	in the three-dimensional space,
4202360	4204360	just like x, y, and z.
4204360	4206360	But in general, I can use any one-form
4206360	4208360	as long as it meets the following conditions.
4208360	4210360	As I just said,
4210360	4212360	def equals pi star sigma.
4212360	4214360	Then
4214360	4216360	there is a normalization.
4216360	4218360	Then it will be
4218360	4220360	a pre-quantum bundle.
4220360	4222360	This word comes from geometric quantization.
4222360	4224360	That is to say,
4224360	4226360	there is a form that
4226360	4228360	quantum mechanics
4228360	4230360	is generally
4230360	4232360	quantized from the classical system.
4232360	4234360	We usually say
4234360	4236360	that the momentum
4236360	4238360	is a function of space.
4238360	4240360	There are some standard programs.
4240360	4242360	But in general,
4242360	4244360	there is not only
4244360	4246360	x and p in general space.
4246360	4248360	There is only position and momentum.
4248360	4250360	It is a general simplex manifold.
4250360	4252360	How do you discuss it?
4252360	4254360	Then how does the classical mechanics
4254360	4256360	on it become a quantum system?
4256360	4258360	It actually lifts this thing
4258360	4260360	into this
4260360	4262360	phase factor.
4262360	4264360	Then the function on this is called wave function.
4264360	4266360	Then there is a point
4266360	4268360	that needs to be defined.
4268360	4270360	It is pi star sigma.
4270360	4272360	It is a connection.
4272360	4274360	Then you will need
4274360	4276360	to say that the
4276360	4278360	coverage of the connection
4278360	4280360	is the same as the symplectic form
4280360	4282360	of the manifold.
4282360	4284360	That is
4284360	4286360	key for the Poisson equation.
4286360	4288360	Poisson bracket
4288360	4290360	will become
4290360	4292360	b bracket.
4292360	4294360	Then the Hamiltonian equation
4294360	4296360	will become
4296360	4298360	the Heisenberg equation.
4298360	4300360	That has nothing to do
4300360	4302360	with this.
4302360	4304360	They will need
4304360	4306360	a definition called pre-confirm bundle.
4306360	4308360	I just need the same definition here.
4308360	4310360	So I call it pre-confirm bundle.
4312360	4314360	What is theta?
4314360	4316360	Theta is a one form.
4316360	4318360	You can say that it is the bundle
4318360	4320360	connection.
4320360	4322360	Connection means
4322360	4324360	that it defines
4324360	4326360	if I go from one point to another
4326360	4328360	in the manifold,
4328360	4330360	we need to discuss
4330360	4332360	what is called parallel transport.
4332360	4334360	Then you will see this hyperplane field.
4334360	4336360	It means that
4336360	4338360	if it is cut off from this hyperplane,
4338360	4340360	it means parallel.
4340360	4342360	If it is all misaligned,
4342360	4344360	it means that if I go around
4344360	4346360	and do parallel transport,
4346360	4348360	it may go to different heights.
4348360	4350360	That is the definition of Parallel transport.
4352360	4354360	There is a gap.
4354360	4356360	The size of the gap
4356360	4358360	is the
4358360	4360360	distance between
4360360	4362360	the two paths.
4362360	4364360	What is the library?
4364360	4366360	It means
4366360	4368360	the phase.
4368360	4370360	It is
4370360	4372360	usually
4372360	4374360	U1.
4374360	4376360	Wave function is a definition
4376360	4378360	for every x and p
4378360	4380360	in the space below.
4380360	4382360	I define
4382360	4384360	its
4384360	4386360	amplitude.
4386360	4388360	How much probability it has in that place.
4388360	4390360	It also adds a phase factor.
4390360	4392360	I can have the density of the wave
4392360	4394360	but I can only have the Ith.
4394360	4396360	It can be evaluated on this factor.
4396360	4398360	What is the difference between
4398360	4400360	U1 and U2?
4404360	4406360	Another variable
4406360	4408360	is the
4408360	4410360	density.
4410360	4412360	Because it
4412360	4414360	actually has
4414360	4416360	another value.
4416360	4418360	But the bundle
4418360	4420360	is a trivial bundle.
4420360	4422360	It is just cross r.
4422360	4424360	But this phase is
4424360	4426360	more complicated.
4426360	4428360	Because it is cross s1.
4428360	4430360	But in general, it might be cross s1.
4430360	4432360	So it must be written in bundle language.
4432360	4434360	So it is often
4434360	4436360	that
4436360	4438360	in
4438360	4440360	that
4440360	4442360	density is just
4442360	4444360	a function
4444360	4446360	of the manifold below.
4446360	4448360	But if we talk about phase,
4448360	4450360	it can't be well defined.
4450360	4452360	You have to choose a gauge
4452360	4454360	because this fiber
4454360	4456360	is a compact.
4456360	4458360	In quantum mechanics, it is usually compact.
4458360	4460360	How does it decide
4460360	4462360	the fiber structure
4462360	4464360	or the
4464360	4466360	input module?
4466360	4468360	How do I
4468360	4470360	choose sigma
4470360	4472360	or q?
4472360	4474360	How do you
4474360	4476360	make a connection
4476360	4478360	with the fiber
4478360	4480360	of the module?
4480360	4482360	I read
4482360	4484360	Wikipedia.
4486360	4488360	It only talks about
4488360	4490360	U1 principle bundle
4490360	4492360	over a syntactic manifold.
4492360	4494360	I just generalize a little bit here.
4494360	4496360	I just say that it is a single fiber.
4496360	4498360	So it can be
4498360	4500360	not necessarily
4500360	4502360	a U1 structure.
4502360	4504360	I don't know why.
4504360	4506360	What I mean is, even if you choose
4506360	4508360	a manifold bundle, I think your
4508360	4510360	manifold structure is free.
4510360	4512360	Yes.
4512360	4514360	I don't know how physicists
4514360	4516360	usually choose this.
4516360	4518360	When doing geometric composition,
4518360	4520360	how to choose?
4520360	4522360	How to choose?
4522360	4524360	Sometimes
4524360	4526360	there is a problem with the existence.
4526360	4528360	But if there are many different structures,
4528360	4530360	I don't know.
4538360	4540360	As long as you have this pre-quantum structure,
4540360	4542360	you can immediately discuss
4542360	4544360	what it corresponds to.
4544360	4546360	Velocity-catch map and
4546360	4548360	vorticity-catch map.
4548360	4550360	That is, the domain of the fluid
4550360	4552360	is the bundle above.
4552360	4554360	It is called velocity-catch map.
4554360	4556360	It can be used to pull back
4556360	4558360	the hyperplane field above.
4558360	4560360	Then the area form
4560360	4562360	or syntactic form
4562360	4564360	is pulled back to the vorticity field.
4566360	4568360	There is a very important
4568360	4570360	combination.
4570360	4572360	In fact,
4572360	4574360	if my right
4574360	4576360	syntactic manifold
4576360	4578360	is only 2-dimensional,
4578360	4580360	and my fluid domain is only 3-dimensional,
4580360	4582360	there is an interesting phenomenon.
4582360	4584360	If I draw an area on the right,
4584360	4586360	its pre-image
4586360	4588360	must be a vortex tube.
4588360	4590360	The definition of a vortex tube is
4590360	4592360	that it is a 3-dimensional area,
4592360	4594360	but the vorticity flux through
4594360	4596360	its boundary is 0.
4596360	4598360	In other words,
4598360	4600360	the vortex line is like a parallel tube.
4604360	4606360	If you reduce these regions to a point,
4606360	4608360	you will find that it is
4608360	4610360	pre-image of point through S.
4610360	4612360	It will be a vortex line.
4614360	4616360	There is a well-known
4616360	4618360	level set method in
4618360	4620360	application mathematics.
4620360	4622360	You can use a level set function
4622360	4624360	to describe any
4624360	4626360	combination shape.
4626360	4628360	You can use an implicit function
4628360	4630360	to describe.
4630360	4632360	S is like this implicit function.
4632360	4634360	It is not mapped to R2,
4634360	4636360	but it is mapped to the
4636360	4638360	general syntactic manifold.
4638360	4640360	The geometry it describes
4640360	4642360	is the vortex line.
4642360	4644360	The vortex line
4644360	4646360	looks complicated,
4646360	4648360	but if you have
4648360	4650360	this geometric variable,
4650360	4652360	it is a level set function.
4652360	4654360	If you have
4654360	4656360	this level set function,
4656360	4658360	it is very easy to visualize
4658360	4660360	these vortex structures.
4660360	4662360	This motivates
4662360	4664360	us to have a side project.
4668360	4670360	Remember that
4670360	4672360	if you want to
4672360	4674360	set up a level set
4674360	4676360	interpretation, you need to
4676360	4678360	have a side project.
4678360	4680360	But if we choose R2,
4680360	4682360	we know that there is no helicity,
4682360	4684360	so it is too boring.
4684360	4686360	We already know that S2
4686360	4688360	has a two-page paper
4688360	4690360	that says there is a general helicity.
4692360	4694360	If the domain below is S2,
4694360	4696360	you have to ask
4696360	4698360	how to choose
4698360	4700360	the helicity.
4700360	4702360	We already know that there is a pre-content bundle
4702360	4704360	called half-vibration.
4704360	4706360	The Q above is S3.
4706360	4708360	S3 is the three-dimensional sphere
4708360	4710360	in the four-dimensional space.
4710360	4712360	The three-dimensional
4712360	4714360	surface is also
4714360	4716360	the three-dimensional surface.
4718360	4720360	The easiest way to understand
4720360	4722360	the structure is to use
4722360	4724360	the four-element.
4724360	4726360	The four-element is
4726360	4728360	a plus bi
4728360	4730360	a plus bi is
4730360	4732360	the negative number.
4732360	4734360	You can add
4734360	4736360	cj plus dk
4736360	4738360	i, j, k are all negative numbers.
4738360	4740360	There are three negative numbers in the space.
4740360	4742360	Then
4742360	4744360	satisfy some multiplication
4744360	4746360	i squared minus 1
4746360	4748360	j squared minus 1
4748360	4750360	k squared minus 1
4750360	4752360	aj minus k
4752360	4754360	polymatrix
4754360	4756360	There are
4756360	4758360	four elements
4758360	4760360	and four helicity.
4760360	4762360	The three-dimensional sphere is
4762360	4764360	normalize.
4766360	4768360	This is
4768360	4770360	often used
4770360	4772360	to describe three-dimensional rotation.
4772360	4774360	When do I need to finish?
4774360	4776360	I want to finish
4776360	4778360	the second part.
4778360	4780360	If you want to hear more,
4780360	4782360	I will continue.
4784360	4786360	The three-dimensional
4786360	4788360	rotation is like this.
4788360	4790360	Any
4792360	4794360	Q is a
4794360	4796360	unit four element.
4796360	4798360	The three-dimensional rotation is
4798360	4800360	like su2.
4800360	4802360	Because it is
4802360	4804360	su2 space.
4804360	4806360	The rotation of the implement
4806360	4808360	is that any three-dimensional
4808360	4810360	rotation
4810360	4812360	is written as
4812360	4814360	span.
4814360	4816360	It is any point on the earth.
4816360	4818360	It is written as
4818360	4820360	a four-dimensional element.
4820360	4822360	If you put the left side
4822360	4824360	as Q and the right side as Q
4824360	4826360	as a unit four element,
4826360	4828360	the result is still a three-dimensional
4828360	4830360	three-dimensional element.
4830360	4832360	So there is a rotation of r3.
4832360	4834360	That is
4834360	4836360	a three-dimensional rotation.
4836360	4838360	If you
4838360	4840360	make Q a
4840360	4842360	shift,
4842360	4844360	it is a
4844360	4846360	ten-digit number.
4846360	4848360	You just multiply
4848360	4850360	cosine something
4850360	4852360	with i sine something.
4852360	4854360	You will find that your rotation
4854360	4856360	is just a rotation
4856360	4858360	along the North Pole.
4858360	4860360	The North Pole
4860360	4862360	is the invariant
4862360	4864360	vector under this variation.
4864360	4866360	I call
4866360	4868360	Q bar iQ
4868360	4870360	or Pi of Q.
4870360	4872360	Pi is projection.
4872360	4874360	The Q map of S3
4874360	4876360	becomes the new location
4876360	4878360	of the North Pole.
4878360	4880360	This is the map of S3 to S2.
4880360	4882360	This map is called half map.
4882360	4884360	It goes from
4884360	4886360	r3 to r2.
4886360	4888360	The fiber direction
4888360	4890360	is the projection.
4890360	4892360	All are projected at the same point.
4892360	4894360	It is a fiber.
4894360	4896360	The fiber
4896360	4898360	is the iQ of E2.
4898360	4900360	It is the iQ of E2.
4900360	4902360	In fact,
4902360	4904360	the three-dimensional sphere
4904360	4906360	looks abstract,
4906360	4908360	but you can visualize it.
4908360	4910360	You can use stereographic projections
4910360	4912360	to project it to r3.
4912360	4914360	You can project the two-dimensional sphere
4914360	4916360	to r2.
4916360	4918360	You can project it to r2.
4918360	4920360	You can project it to r3.
4920360	4922360	You can project it to r3.
4922360	4924360	You can visualize
4924360	4926360	the two-dimensional sphere to r3.
4926360	4928360	It is a polyhedral transformation.
4928360	4930360	You can see the angle.
4930360	4932360	This map is
4932360	4934360	the
4934360	4936360	the
4936360	4938360	This map is
4938360	4940360	all
4940360	4942360	I put 1000 fibers.
4942360	4944360	The half fiber I mentioned earlier
4944360	4946360	looks like this.
4946360	4948360	It is very crossed.
4948360	4950360	This is a fiber bundle.
4950360	4952360	Each circle
4952360	4954360	Each fiber is a
4954360	4956360	circle of S1.
4956360	4958360	It is all mapped to a point on S2.
4958360	4960360	The index set
4960360	4962360	of these fibers
4962360	4964360	is S2.
4966360	4968360	It is the location of the base point.
4968360	4970360	The remaining freedom
4970360	4972360	is that you can rotate
4972360	4974360	the base point.
4974360	4976360	S3 is this structure.
4978360	4980360	Each fiber
4980360	4982360	is generated by e2's
4982360	4984360	it.
4986360	4988360	Vertical direction
4988360	4990360	is
4990360	4992360	i times i.
4992360	4994360	If e2's it
4994360	4996360	can go
4996360	4998360	in this direction,
4998360	5000360	infinitesimally times i
5000360	5002360	is in this direction.
5002360	5004360	The vertical space
5004360	5006360	is a one form.
5006360	5008360	I call it Theta.
5010360	5012360	This is
5012360	5014360	You can think of it as
5014360	5016360	because it is a vertical space
5016360	5018360	so
5018360	5020360	the one form of Theta
5020360	5022360	is any infinitesimally motion
5022360	5024360	projected to fiber direction.
5024360	5026360	That is, the internal
5026360	5028360	i times q.
5028360	5030360	This structure
5030360	5032360	is in every point.
5032360	5034360	Remember that the fibers are intersecting each other.
5034360	5036360	So you will see that
5036360	5038360	Theta is nowhere integral.
5040360	5042360	You can go through it.
5042360	5044360	This is
5044360	5046360	I have printed out the 3D printer.
5046360	5048360	If you go to see it,
5048360	5050360	you will see that it is nowhere integral.
5050360	5052360	This is the real
5052360	5054360	I am in S3
5054360	5056360	I drew this quaternion
5056360	5058360	stereographic projecting
5058360	5060360	to R3 and then 3D
5060360	5062360	3D printer
5062360	5064360	3D printer
5064360	5066360	Yes.
5066360	5068360	So it becomes S3 printer.
5068360	5070360	4D printer.
5074360	5076360	Actually it satisfies
5076360	5078360	this choice.
5078360	5080360	It just satisfies
5080360	5082360	the pre-quantum bundle.
5082360	5084360	This is the pre-quantum structure.
5086360	5088360	This thing
5088360	5090360	you can visualize it like this.
5090360	5092360	S3
5094360	5096360	There is fiber direction in S3.
5096360	5098360	Just like the Z direction in R3.
5098360	5100360	Now it becomes
5100360	5102360	fiber direction in S3.
5102360	5104360	So you can take that direction as
5104360	5106360	the Z axis of the general world.
5106360	5108360	It is the direction of gravity.
5108360	5110360	The vertical space is the platform.
5110360	5112360	When you walk on the platform, you are stable.
5112360	5114360	Nowhere integral
5114360	5116360	means
5116360	5118360	if you want to
5118360	5120360	walk a circle
5120360	5122360	if you want to walk a circle back
5122360	5124360	you will find that you have to keep climbing the stairs
5124360	5126360	to get back to the platform.
5126360	5128360	This is the
5128360	5130360	Zeta and Pi-star sequence.
5130360	5132360	Zeta
5132360	5134360	is projected
5134360	5136360	to the fiber direction.
5136360	5138360	In other words,
5138360	5140360	if you draw a circle
5140360	5142360	or a curve in S3
5142360	5144360	and you take the Zeta
5144360	5146360	you will find that
5146360	5148360	you are walking in that direction
5148360	5150360	but you are in the fiber direction.
5150360	5152360	So the physical force you produce
5152360	5154360	is your total work.
5154360	5156360	It is the work of climbing up
5156360	5158360	with gravity.
5158360	5160360	Zeta means that
5160360	5162360	if you walk a circle back, it is not equal to zero.
5162360	5164360	It means that
5164360	5166360	if you walk to the platform, you will find that
5166360	5168360	your progress is not equal to zero.
5168360	5170360	This is also
5170360	5172360	produced by our S3D.
5172360	5174360	So you will see
5174360	5176360	this is the famous
5176360	5178360	impossible stairs.
5178360	5180360	Most people
5180360	5182360	know that
5182360	5184360	this is a visual illusion.
5184360	5186360	But that is in R3.
5186360	5188360	You have to use a visual illusion to understand.
5188360	5190360	But in S3, this is everywhere.
5190360	5192360	Because
5192360	5194360	the platforms in S3 are all low-end.
5194360	5196360	So it must look like this.
5196360	5198360	So you can
5198360	5200360	put it in S3D.
5204360	5206360	Just now
5206360	5208360	there are a lot of abstract things.
5208360	5210360	We found that
5210360	5212360	one of the good examples is
5212360	5214360	half-vibration.
5214360	5216360	So if we change
5216360	5218360	the catch variable to S3
5218360	5220360	to S2
5220360	5222360	the catch side
5222360	5224360	corresponds to S.
5224360	5226360	It will become
5226360	5228360	the wave function
5228360	5230360	in our Schrodinger equation.
5230360	5232360	Then
5232360	5234360	when the velocity is pulled back
5234360	5236360	it is the Madelung transform.
5236360	5238360	In Madelung transform, we use
5238360	5240360	C2 value wave function.
5240360	5242360	You have a, b, c, d, i.
5242360	5244360	You can expand it into 4 elements.
5244360	5246360	Remember
5246360	5248360	we normalized it
5248360	5250360	because it is an incompressible case.
5250360	5252360	So actually
5252360	5254360	psi is a
5254360	5256360	S3 value function.
5256360	5258360	It is normalized, quaternion or C2 vectors.
5258360	5260360	Then
5260360	5262360	when we do
5262360	5264360	phase shift
5264360	5266360	what is that?
5266360	5268360	No, this is just a value.
5268360	5270360	I want to expand
5270360	5272360	a, b, i, c, d, i
5272360	5274360	into a, b, i, c, j, d, k
5274360	5276360	There are many different ways.
5276360	5278360	But I deliberately choose this way
5278360	5280360	it will cause my left side is a complex scalar
5280360	5282360	dependent on i, c.
5282360	5284360	The right side will be a quaternion
5284360	5286360	dependent on i, c.
5286360	5288360	Remember
5288360	5290360	in Madelung transform
5290360	5292360	the momentum operator
5292360	5294360	is evaluated.
5294360	5296360	Then you will find
5296360	5298360	quaternion is a deep sine
5298360	5300360	projected to i-th direction.
5300360	5302360	We can see
5302360	5304360	i-gradient
5304360	5306360	after gradients
5306360	5308360	is projected to i-th side.
5308360	5310360	That is exactly
5310360	5312360	the action of C2.
5312360	5314360	It is projected to fiber direction or gravity direction.
5314360	5316360	It is exactly
5316360	5318360	the pullback of 1-form.
5318360	5320360	So the pullback of 1-form
5320360	5322360	is exactly the Clebsch representation.
5322360	5324360	So in S3
5324360	5326360	under the
5326360	5328360	pre-quantum structure
5328360	5330360	the Clebsch variable
5330360	5332360	is exactly the Madelung transform.
5334360	5336360	Then we know
5336360	5338360	the given velocity
5338360	5340360	form has a
5340360	5342360	vorticity Clebsch variable.
5342360	5344360	The vorticity Clebsch variable
5344360	5346360	is the sidebar i-th side.
5346360	5348360	That is
5348360	5350360	the block vector
5350360	5352360	we learned in quantum mechanics.
5352360	5354360	The block vector
5354360	5356360	is the vorticity Clebsch map.
5356360	5358360	Remember
5358360	5360360	vorticity Clebsch map has an amazing function.
5360360	5362360	It is the level size function of
5362360	5364360	vortex line.
5364360	5366360	If you have wave function
5366360	5368360	you can find the block vector.
5368360	5370360	The block vector
5370360	5372360	is the area drawn on the sphere.
5372360	5374360	The pre-image is the vortex.
5376360	5378360	Vortex2
5380360	5382360	Another interesting application is
5382360	5384360	given velocity field.
5384360	5386360	You can find the wave function.
5386360	5388360	Then you can visualize the vortex2
5388360	5390360	as an implicit function.
5392360	5394360	Here I show some results.
5394360	5396360	This turns into
5396360	5398360	a vortex detection
5398360	5400360	application.
5400360	5402360	Vortex detection is
5402360	5404360	how to find
5404360	5406360	where the vortex is
5406360	5408360	in a velocity field.
5410360	5412360	This is a
5412360	5414360	flow data.
5414360	5416360	It is a delta wing.
5418360	5420360	You can see
5420360	5422360	some vortex settings.
5424360	5426360	Under the velocity field
5426360	5428360	you can
5428360	5430360	calculate the vorticity
5430360	5432360	and take the threshold.
5432360	5434360	Then you can see the vorticity is bigger.
5434360	5436360	Some more complicated methods
5436360	5438360	are lambda2 method
5438360	5440360	or cube criterion method.
5440360	5442360	There are some heuristics.
5442360	5444360	You can look at the local Jacobian
5444360	5446360	and calculate the eigenvalue.
5446360	5448360	Then you can determine
5448360	5450360	where the vortex is.
5450360	5452360	These methods are heuristic.
5452360	5454360	You can see these tubes are not vortex tubes.
5454360	5456360	We developed
5456360	5458360	a method to convert
5458360	5460360	given velocity field
5460360	5462360	into wave function.
5462360	5464360	You can find the spin vector
5464360	5466360	and
5466360	5468360	the
5468360	5470360	level set function
5470360	5472360	for vortex tubes
5472360	5474360	and vortex stripes.
5474360	5476360	You can easily
5476360	5478360	visualize
5478360	5480360	the vortex structure.
5480360	5482360	It can reveal
5482360	5484360	much more information.
5484360	5486360	These are the real vortex tubes
5486360	5488360	and not heuristic.
5488360	5490360	You can calculate the operator
5490360	5492360	and look at the eigenvalue
5492360	5494360	to see if it is rotating or not.
5498360	5500360	We found that
5500360	5502360	most velocities can be approximated.
5502360	5504360	For example,
5504360	5506360	the vortex has a linking number
5506360	5508360	which is 0.
5508360	5510360	To solve this problem,
5510360	5512360	we solved
5512360	5514360	an image processing problem.
5514360	5516360	We found that
5516360	5518360	it is a Ginzburg-Landau model.
5518360	5520360	When we solve
5520360	5522360	an image processing problem,
5522360	5524360	we want to match
5524360	5526360	some parameters.
5526360	5528360	For example,
5528360	5530360	I want to find a Psi
5530360	5532360	which
5532360	5534360	is close
5534360	5536360	to
5536360	5538360	the given velocity field.
5538360	5540360	This is called fidelity term.
5540360	5542360	There is a problem.
5544360	5546360	As I mentioned,
5546360	5548360	there is a redundant
5548360	5550360	gauge symmetry.
5550360	5552360	If my S
5552360	5554360	is below the block vector,
5554360	5556360	I will post-compose
5556360	5558360	an area-preserving differential coefficient.
5560360	5562360	It is exactly the same
5562360	5564360	as the vortex.
5564360	5566360	Vortex is a pull-back area.
5566360	5568360	The right side is a mix.
5570360	5572360	The pull-back area is the same.
5574360	5576360	With such a big
5576360	5578360	redundant gauge symmetry,
5578360	5580360	we still want to find
5580360	5582360	a better one.
5582360	5584360	So we add
5584360	5586360	a symmetry-breaking term.
5588360	5590360	I want to find
5590360	5592360	the most smooth
5592360	5594360	solution.
5594360	5596360	With this solution,
5596360	5598360	we get a better
5598360	5600360	optimization problem.
5600360	5602360	This is fidelity and regularization.
5602360	5604360	Image processing
5604360	5606360	has two terms.
5606360	5608360	Fidelity and regularization.
5608360	5610360	These two terms
5610360	5612360	are the
5612360	5614360	two directions
5614360	5616360	of the
5616360	5618360	re-quantum structure.
5618360	5620360	If you have a deep Psi,
5620360	5622360	the rest of the direction
5622360	5624360	is how fast
5624360	5626360	you move
5626360	5628360	in different fibers.
5628360	5630360	The projection
5630360	5632360	is how fast
5632360	5634360	you move
5634360	5636360	in the two-dimensional
5636360	5638360	sphere.
5640360	5642360	You will find that
5642360	5644360	ds is the horizontal direction
5644360	5646360	and the re-quantum direction
5646360	5648360	is the speed direction.
5648360	5650360	This is the fidelity term.
5650360	5652360	You just need to change the gauge.
5652360	5654360	I change d to
5654360	5656360	d-iEta.
5656360	5658360	As I mentioned earlier,
5658360	5660360	the re-quantum connection
5660360	5662360	is at the same speed.
5662360	5664360	You can adjust it like this.
5664360	5666360	After adjusting it,
5666360	5668360	this is my new covariant derivative.
5668360	5670360	After adjusting it,
5670360	5672360	this nabla Psi
5672360	5674360	is projected
5674360	5676360	on the fiber direction.
5676360	5678360	The horizontal direction
5678360	5680360	is still
5680360	5682360	the original ds.
5684360	5686360	What?
5688360	5690360	It's non-zero.
5690360	5692360	It's because of the redundant gauge symmetry.
5692360	5694360	That is to say,
5698360	5700360	if I choose 0,
5700360	5702360	the problem should be solved like this.
5702360	5704360	When I find a Psi,
5704360	5706360	it should be 0.
5708360	5710360	Oh, right.
5710360	5712360	How do I choose Psi?
5712360	5714360	The way of optimization is
5714360	5716360	that I choose Psi at the beginning.
5716360	5718360	Because the larger the Psi,
5718360	5720360	the easier it is to solve.
5720360	5722360	The ds on the right is good.
5722360	5724360	When I solve
5724360	5726360	to the approximate value,
5726360	5728360	I reduce Epsilon.
5728360	5730360	At the end,
5730360	5732360	when Epsilon is almost 0,
5732360	5734360	I trace my
5734360	5736360	suboptimal solution.
5736360	5738360	When Epsilon is equal to 0,
5738360	5740360	it will stick to the
5740360	5742360	minimized
5742360	5744360	Psi star Theta.
5744360	5746360	The fidelity term
5746360	5748360	will be minimized.
5750360	5752360	Yes.
5756360	5758360	You can say that.
5758360	5760360	You can see that
5760360	5762360	there are different weights.
5762360	5764360	Yes.
5764360	5766360	It's called a Bergers sphere.
5766360	5768360	The metric of fiber
5768360	5770360	and not fiber direction
5770360	5772360	is anisotropic.
5772360	5774360	The concept is
5774360	5776360	used to do
5776360	5778360	collapse S3 into S2
5778360	5780360	in Weibull.
5780360	5782360	It's used in
5782360	5784360	different things.
5784360	5786360	According to
5786360	5788360	the theorem of Pythagoras,
5788360	5790360	the square box
5790360	5792360	is just
5792360	5794360	its
5796360	5798360	size.
5798360	5800360	It's just anisotropic.
5800360	5802360	As you mentioned.
5804360	5806360	Visualize.
5806360	5808360	Anisotropic norm
5808360	5810360	looks like this.
5810360	5812360	Cool.
5816360	5818360	It's called King-Splendor
5818360	5820360	because
5820360	5822360	it's normalized
5822360	5824360	Psi.
5824360	5826360	It's normalized
5826360	5828360	deep Psi
5828360	5830360	norm square.
5830360	5832360	The D is covaried.
5832360	5834360	It's magnetic field.
5834360	5836360	At the bottom,
5836360	5838360	there will be some
5838360	5840360	particles.
5840360	5842360	You can see
5842360	5844360	the vortices.
5844360	5846360	I'm visualizing the vortices.
5846360	5848360	And
5848360	5850360	some particles.
5850360	5852360	And
5852360	5854360	this is the choice of
5854360	5856360	the query.
5860360	5862360	Can you see it?
5862360	5864360	We also
5864360	5866360	do some
5866360	5868360	biological
5868360	5870360	flow calculation.
5870360	5872360	We ask for some data
5872360	5874360	and do some
5874360	5876360	visualization.
5876360	5878360	Find
5878360	5880360	the velocity field
5880360	5882360	near the bird.
5882360	5884360	Convert into wave function.
5884360	5886360	Block vector.
5886360	5888360	Preimage of area.
5888360	5890360	Visualization is
5890360	5892360	more information
5892360	5894360	than
5894360	5896360	simulation.
5896360	5898360	This is the second part.
5898360	5900360	I think
5900360	5902360	we can stop here.
5902360	5904360	I just want to prove
5904360	5906360	some mathematical
5906360	5908360	flow.
5908360	5910360	That's it.
5910360	5912360	I just want to say
5912360	5914360	what?
5914360	5916360	I said it all
5916360	5918360	in defense class.
5918360	5920360	There are some
5920360	5922360	interesting things.
5922360	5924360	Coriolis force and quantum
5924360	5926360	hole effect.
5926360	5928360	Quantum hole effect is
5928360	5930360	quantum mechanics
5930360	5932360	with magnetic field.
5932360	5934360	There will be
5934360	5936360	some
5936360	5938360	Lorentz force
5938360	5940360	quantum version.
5940360	5942360	Then
5942360	5944360	we put quantum mechanics
5944360	5946360	power system.
5946360	5948360	It's similar to fluid.
5948360	5950360	Lorentz force
5950360	5952360	is Coriolis force.
5952360	5954360	I can simulate
5954360	5956360	the fluid
5956360	5958360	with Coriolis force.
5958360	5960360	But my method
5960360	5962360	is not to add
5962360	5964360	Coriolis force.
5964360	5966360	I just add
5966360	5968360	quantum mechanics.
5968360	5970360	The result is like this.
5970360	5972360	You can see
5972360	5974360	it's all anti-clockwise.
5976360	5978360	I didn't
5978360	5980360	solve any equation.
5980360	5982360	I just solve the equation
5982360	5984360	with magnetic field.
5996360	5998360	There are many open problems.
5998360	6000360	This is just the beginning
6000360	6002360	of a new framework.
6002360	6004360	For example,
6004360	6006360	I didn't say
6006360	6008360	if we can get
6008360	6010360	new insights
6010360	6012360	from the Euler equation.
6012360	6014360	We can't make
6014360	6016360	a big claim yet.
6020360	6022360	I don't want to
6022360	6024360	discuss Euler equation.
6024360	6026360	I want to discuss general flow
6026360	6028360	or conservation law.
6028360	6030360	For example, traffic flow.
6030360	6032360	Those are
6032360	6034360	general flow.
6034360	6036360	It's not only about
6036360	6038360	inertia system
6038360	6040360	and conservation law.
6042360	6044360	There are some
6044360	6046360	capture representation.
6046360	6048360	Most of them are
6048360	6050360	capture representation in MHD.
6050360	6052360	We can discuss
6052360	6054360	the framework.
6054360	6056360	That's all.
6056360	6058360	Thank you.
6086360	6088360	I think there will be.
6088360	6090360	But I need to know
6090360	6092360	more about it.
6092360	6094360	Then
6094360	6096360	do some benchmark.
6098360	6100360	Maybe climate simulation is better.
6100360	6102360	Weather prediction.
6102360	6104360	I think data-driven is better.
6116360	6118360	I've seen
6118360	6120360	the chart of
6120360	6122360	state-of-the-art.
6132360	6134360	Wait.
6140360	6142360	I've seen
6142360	6144360	very good
6144360	6146360	I've heard
6146360	6148360	that
6148360	6150360	I've seen some
6150360	6152360	crappy simulation.
6152360	6154360	I've heard some talk
6154360	6156360	that you can do it
6156360	6158360	very accurately.
6158360	6160360	For example,
6160360	6162360	it's not real
6162360	6164360	but it's conservation law.
6164360	6166360	It's the simulation of tsunami.
6166360	6168360	It can match
6168360	6170360	almost exactly.
6170360	6172360	It has been developed
6172360	6174360	since 90s.
6174360	6176360	But it's not
6176360	6178360	tsunami every day.
6178360	6180360	You need to verify.
6180360	6182360	It matches
6182360	6184360	with the Japanese tsunami.
6184360	6186360	Is the simulation
6186360	6188360	non-linear?
6188360	6190360	Non-linear.
6190360	6192360	The tsunami's
6192360	6194360	shadow water wave is non-linear system.
6198360	6200360	It's from
6200360	6202360	physical model
6202360	6204360	to mathematical
6204360	6206360	shadow water equation.
6206360	6208360	There might be
6208360	6210360	error.
6210360	6212360	And the geography
6212360	6214360	is input.
6214360	6216360	And the real
6216360	6218360	wave arrive time
6218360	6220360	and height are all non-linear.
6224360	6226360	If you really want to
6226360	6228360	do the prediction,
6228360	6230360	you can do it very well.
6232360	6234360	I have a similar question.
6234360	6236360	I've been thinking about application.
6236360	6238360	I've been thinking about
6238360	6240360	TimeTree.
6240360	6242360	You mean Gensperr?
6242360	6244360	I've been thinking about it
6244360	6246360	since the beginning.
6246360	6248360	I don't know
6248360	6250360	like Xiaoliu
6250360	6252360	or DMT.
6252360	6254360	They want to use
6254360	6256360	first principle to create new
6256360	6258360	real.
6258360	6260360	I don't know.
6264360	6266360	I want to
6266360	6268360	compare
6268360	6270360	the terms in DFT.
6270360	6272360	And I know
6272360	6274360	for example
6274360	6276360	the simplest
6276360	6278360	Gensperr Landau model
6278360	6280360	doesn't need complicated
6280360	6282360	DFT.
6282360	6284360	Gensperr Landau model
6284360	6286360	usually
6288360	6290360	means
6298360	6300360	I said this is Gensperr Landau
6300360	6302360	means
6304360	6306360	usually Gensperr Landau
6306360	6308360	will say Psi is not sent to S3 map
6308360	6310360	but to D2 or R4 map.
6310360	6312360	And then
6312360	6314360	it's not normalized.
6314360	6316360	So there's a non-linear image.
6316360	6318360	Non-linear image means
6318360	6320360	it's
6320360	6322360	penalized.
6322360	6324360	If Psi is not equal,
6324360	6326360	it will want to go in the opposite direction.
6326360	6328360	It's a non-term.
6328360	6330360	Of course, it's related to Psi norm.
6330360	6332360	So it's a non-linear image.
6332360	6334360	And that image
6334360	6336360	will appear in
6336360	6338360	GP equation.
6338360	6340360	It's a very popular GP equation.
6340360	6342360	It's a non-linear
6342360	6344360	equation.
6344360	6346360	It's a bit long in practical.
6346360	6348360	It's a bit long in practical.
6348360	6350360	But you often
6350360	6352360	think that
6352360	6354360	if I model it,
6354360	6356360	it's a very natural
6356360	6358360	symmetry.
6358360	6360360	You can see the mathematical meaning
6360360	6362360	of penalization term.
6362360	6364360	So you often see
6364360	6366360	many models
6366360	6368360	add up like this.
6368360	6370360	But this is a bit different.
6370360	6372360	It's a projection
6372360	6374360	or a constraint
6374360	6376360	system.
6376360	6378360	So for example, GP equation
6378360	6380360	is a bit superfluous.
6380360	6382360	It's an incompressible
6382360	6384360	flow.
6384360	6386360	So
6386360	6388360	it's a bit different in math.
6388360	6390360	So if it's going in that direction,
6390360	6392360	I don't know if there are
6392360	6394360	new ideas.
6396360	6398360	Okay.
6410360	6412360	Okay.
6412360	6414360	If there are no other questions,
6414360	6416360	thank you again.
