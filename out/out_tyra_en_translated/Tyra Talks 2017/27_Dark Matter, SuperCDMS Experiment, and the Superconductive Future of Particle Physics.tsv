0	2000	Okay
2000	4000	Oh
4000	6000	F
6000	8000	Oh, I forgot
8000	10000	Share
10000	12000	Share screen
12000	14000	Wow
22000	24000	Okay
26000	28000	Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today
28000	30000	is
30000	32000	Dark Matter Super CDMS
32000	34000	which is what I'm doing right now
34000	36000	and the Super Conductive Future
36000	38000	of Particle Physics
38000	40000	which is
40000	42000	what I'm doing right now
42000	44000	Okay, next page
44000	46000	The topic I'm going to talk about today
46000	48000	will be divided into two parts
48000	50000	The first part is
50000	52000	the physical part
52000	54000	I'm going to talk about Dark Matter
54000	56000	which is mainly
56000	58000	focused on
58000	60000	the direct detection
60000	62000	part of the experiment
62000	64000	What is its physics?
64000	66000	What is the current
66000	68000	state of the field?
68000	70000	What is everyone's goal? What are the difficulties?
70000	72000	How to do this experiment? How to measure this thing?
72000	74000	It should be more reliable
74000	76000	and more interesting
76000	78000	The second part will be my own work
78000	80000	which is quite R&D
80000	82000	People who are interested in
82000	84000	technology may be more interested
84000	86000	But it should be very related
86000	88000	Okay
88000	90000	My screen is a bit laggy
90000	92000	First of all, because we have already
92000	94000	introduced it before
94000	96000	What is
96000	98000	the basic example
98000	100000	of a
100000	102000	model and a theoretical basis
102000	104000	So I'm going to talk about it very quickly
104000	106000	So basically
106000	108000	Can you see my mouse?
108000	110000	Can you see my mouse?
110000	112000	Can you see it?
112000	114000	There are many basic examples
114000	116000	We think these basic examples
116000	118000	are the basic materials
118000	120000	we know
120000	122000	in the universe
122000	124000	But
124000	126000	because of some reasons
126000	128000	we think there are still things in the universe
128000	130000	that we don't know
130000	132000	We can't use this model to explain
132000	134000	But anyway, this is called Standard Model
134000	136000	It is the best description
136000	138000	If you are
138000	140000	interested in this
140000	142000	You can look it up on Wikipedia
142000	144000	There are six quarks
144000	146000	three leptons
146000	148000	neutrinos
148000	150000	and X
150000	152000	Okay
152000	154000	The point I want to talk about today
154000	156000	will focus on
156000	158000	the ones you can see on the screen
158000	160000	The red one is a mole
160000	162000	The blue one is a neutrino
162000	164000	Basically, this is
164000	166000	the most important example for us
166000	168000	Because honestly, in life
168000	170000	the most important thing is
170000	172000	the things you are interested in
172000	174000	the things you breathe
174000	176000	and the things that make up you
176000	178000	These are the only two
178000	180000	Okay
180000	182000	Then
182000	184000	Sorry, there are electrons
184000	186000	These are the three
186000	188000	There is another important one
188000	190000	The white ghost
190000	192000	It is called light
192000	194000	It sounds very mysterious
194000	196000	like a laser gun
196000	198000	So
198000	200000	these things
200000	202000	exchange light like baseball
202000	204000	and they will
204000	206000	reach the energy balance
206000	208000	Basically, the heat balance
208000	210000	After reaching the heat balance
210000	212000	everything will have a black hole
212000	214000	Okay
214000	216000	This is very important
216000	218000	Because my family often ask me
218000	220000	Is dark matter a black hole?
220000	222000	Actually, it is not
222000	224000	You will know why
224000	226000	It is very vague
226000	228000	This is the universe we usually see
228000	230000	When we look at it
230000	232000	the whole universe is black
232000	234000	Then you will say
234000	236000	Why do we think
236000	238000	everything is the matter we know
238000	240000	and it will exchange light
240000	242000	like a baseball
242000	244000	This is actually
244000	246000	the universe we see
246000	248000	with a good instrument
248000	250000	Like this
250000	252000	The whole universe is basically bright
252000	254000	The different colors
254000	256000	are basically the same as the black hole
256000	258000	It corresponds to different temperatures
258000	260000	Okay
260000	262000	You see the brightest one in the middle
262000	264000	It is the galactic plane
264000	266000	There are many planets
266000	268000	and a lot of energy
268000	270000	So there will be a lot of energy
270000	272000	Okay
272000	274000	My mouse
274000	276000	Okay, you see the back
276000	278000	This part is very red
278000	280000	The energy here is very low
280000	282000	It only has a foreground
282000	284000	It only has a background
284000	286000	The background is the whole background of the universe
286000	288000	It is very cold
288000	290000	It is only 3 degrees K
290000	292000	But basically it has a temperature
292000	294000	So we can still see it
294000	296000	Okay
296000	298000	This picture is basically
298000	300000	filled with colors
300000	302000	How can we say there is any dark matter
302000	304000	that we don't know
304000	306000	Let me see the next page
306000	308000	Because there was a very wise man
308000	310000	He said
310000	312000	Vader was seduced by
312000	314000	The dark side of the force
314000	316000	The dark side of the force
316000	318000	The force is what gives Jedi his power
318000	320000	It's an energy field
320000	322000	created by all living things
322000	324000	It surrounds us
324000	326000	It permits us
326000	328000	It binds the galaxy together
328000	330000	It sounds very confusing
330000	332000	I don't know what he is talking about
332000	334000	So I will focus on it
334000	336000	The dark side of the force
336000	338000	It is the dark side that binds us together
338000	340000	This phrase is from 1976
340000	342000	So you can imagine
342000	344000	This is probably the time
344000	346000	when we started to be interested in
346000	348000	dark matter
348000	350000	I think this statement is correct
350000	352000	We started to have dark matter
352000	354000	Okay
354000	356000	So
356000	358000	Actually
358000	360000	What does this mean
360000	362000	There is a picture here
362000	364000	The center is the brightest part
364000	366000	The brightest part is the center of our galaxy
366000	368000	Then the horizontal axis
368000	370000	is the distance from the center of the galaxy
370000	372000	to the outside
372000	374000	The vertical axis is
374000	376000	the particle
376000	378000	in that position
378000	380000	The speed of rotation around the center of the galaxy
380000	382000	Then you can see
382000	384000	the yellow data
384000	386000	The yellow data is
386000	388000	the stars over there
388000	390000	Okay, like the sun
390000	392000	So we can see those stars
392000	394000	are moving
394000	396000	We know how fast they are moving
396000	398000	Then the yellow data
398000	400000	is the part of the galaxy
400000	402000	That is
402000	404000	the size of the galaxy
404000	406000	300 years ago
406000	408000	But then we found
408000	410000	We can keep looking out
410000	412000	According to the dark radiation we just used
412000	414000	Our instrument is getting better
414000	416000	We can see the infrared
416000	418000	Then we see
418000	420000	the blue hyperfine structure
420000	422000	The blue dot
422000	424000	That's basically
424000	426000	the light source
426000	428000	You can keep pushing
428000	430000	to the outside
430000	432000	The position of 50,000 light years
432000	434000	It can be connected
434000	436000	This is what we know now
436000	438000	The size of a galaxy
438000	440000	Okay
440000	442000	Then we go through
442000	444000	to see
444000	446000	What we see
446000	448000	The speed of these particles
448000	450000	We can go
450000	452000	Okay, there's a point
452000	454000	According to the relativity
454000	456000	It's basically Newton's law
456000	458000	According to
458000	460000	the traditional law we know
460000	462000	We can guess
462000	464000	We just see the speed
464000	466000	We can guess how much mass there is
466000	468000	It goes around this kind of thing
468000	470000	It goes around the inner side of the orbit
470000	472000	So we get
472000	474000	We get the following line
474000	476000	Okay
476000	478000	But actually
478000	480000	What we observe
480000	482000	The speed of rotation is the line above
482000	484000	Okay
484000	486000	So in the middle
486000	488000	You will find that
488000	490000	The speed of rotation
490000	492000	is the speed of the line above
492000	494000	The actual weight of the orbit
494000	496000	is much more than
496000	498000	what we can see
498000	500000	Okay
500000	502000	So we really can't see it
502000	504000	In the 1980s
504000	506000	That's because our instrumentation
506000	508000	is not good enough
508000	510000	There's nothing you can't see
510000	512000	Okay
512000	514000	So for a while
514000	516000	Dark matter still had some
516000	518000	controversy
518000	520000	Then in the 1980s to the 1990s
520000	522000	We started to know
522000	524000	that everything we can see is almost right
524000	526000	So we started to think
526000	528000	Is it that the particles we know
528000	530000	can meet this nature
530000	532000	The answer is yes
532000	534000	There are three kinds of particles
534000	536000	There are three kinds
536000	538000	Anyway, there is one
538000	540000	There are three kinds of particles
540000	542000	It does have this nature
542000	544000	But what we know
544000	546000	Here is a point
546000	548000	We think we don't know
548000	550000	Some people
550000	552000	What we already know
552000	554000	It basically has something to do
554000	556000	with the particles we already know
556000	558000	Because the particles and the particles
558000	560000	are composite
560000	562000	They have a proportional relationship
562000	564000	Because they will
564000	566000	use it when they change
566000	568000	So according to all the stars we observe
568000	570000	Those stars are the particles and the particles
570000	572000	We can reverse the most
572000	574000	How many particles are there
574000	576000	Can it
576000	578000	cover our
578000	580000	missing mass budget
580000	582000	The answer is that it can't exceed 6%
582000	584000	Can't exceed 6% at most
584000	586000	Okay
586000	588000	So basically we think
588000	590000	It may be new physics
592000	594000	The more things
598000	600000	The answer is that it shouldn't be like this
602000	604000	Because the quality you see
604000	606000	You estimate it as a line
606000	608000	So you mean
608000	610000	If I have more images I can't see
610000	612000	Will fit the original data
614000	616000	That is to say, when the upper line is
616000	618000	When the upper line is more
618000	620000	So why is it bigger when the upper line is more
622000	624000	Let's write a book
634000	636000	Is it easier to turn like this
636000	638000	Then assume that the middle is symmetrical
638000	640000	You can think of it as all in the middle
640000	642000	Ok
644000	646000	Just that
646000	648000	Transverse speed
648000	650000	Yes yes yes
650000	652000	Oh no
652000	654000	It's the speed of turning
654000	656000	So actually you can see
656000	658000	Its speed
658000	660000	What is the real speed
660000	662000	Hundreds of kilometers per hour
662000	664000	That every second
664000	666000	So it's really slow
666000	668000	Basically it is
668000	670000	It doesn't have to be close to the speed of light
670000	672000	Ok
672000	674000	This number will be a bit important
674000	676000	So actually darkmatter
676000	678000	There are a lot of clues
678000	680000	I won't say it's evidence
680000	682000	I haven't measured it yet
682000	684000	So there are a lot of clues
684000	686000	This clue is actually the most suspicious
686000	688000	There are a lot of reasons for him
688000	690000	Don't think like this
690000	692000	But darkmatter has a lot of other clues
692000	694000	I put it in the background
694000	696000	If you are interested, you can ask
696000	698000	Ok
698000	700000	So anyway
700000	702000	We have to have extra quality
702000	704000	To produce extra power
704000	706000	Or somehow you want your theory
706000	708000	To produce extra power
708000	710000	To explain this question
710000	712000	Is there any use of darkmatter?
712000	714000	Ok
714000	716000	Then I will jump directly to
716000	718000	This is what I saw recently
718000	720000	I think it's very interesting
720000	722000	That article
722000	724000	And I think you should know better than me
724000	726000	Ok
750000	752000	Ok
752000	754000	You should know who this is
754000	756000	Yes
756000	758000	This is my
758000	760000	This is the latest issue of CERN Courier
760000	762000	An article
762000	764000	It's
764000	766000	I magnified the focus
766000	768000	But I still have citations
768000	770000	So I magnified the citation
770000	772000	It says
772000	774000	Let's see where to start
774000	776000	Ok
776000	778000	Let's see
778000	780000	Let's see
780000	782000	Let's see
782000	784000	Here
784000	786000	It says
786000	788000	Basically they say
788000	790000	EPR pair
790000	792000	EPR pair
792000	794000	Refer to ER Einstein Rosenbridge
794000	796000	And one part that connects the two
796000	798000	Part of the black hole geometry
798000	800000	And then
800000	802000	This idea spring
802000	804000	By many theorists
804000	806000	In particular in the context
806000	808000	Of ADS-CFT correspondence
808000	810000	Ok
810000	812000	Let's look back
812000	814000	The point is
814000	816000	The problem with this theory is
816000	818000	I think it's motivated by
818000	820000	What I just said
820000	822000	So it can work
822000	824000	In galaxy scale
824000	826000	But the problem is
826000	828000	It can't
828000	830000	Or it's not good enough
830000	832000	In phenomenology
832000	834000	To work
834000	836000	To estimate
836000	838000	Something bigger
838000	840000	Something bigger
840000	842000	For example, I just said
842000	844000	A galaxy
844000	846000	Then it will have a
846000	848000	Modified gravity effect
848000	850000	But the problem is
850000	852000	We have another observation
852000	854000	If there are two galaxies
854000	856000	Then these two galaxies
856000	858000	Have a dark matter
858000	860000	Then they contrast
860000	862000	We can see two
862000	864000	Things like matter
864000	866000	Dark matter and non-active matter
866000	868000	This kind of local
868000	870000	Dynamic behavior
870000	872000	It doesn't have a good way to explain
872000	874000	Its work now
874000	876000	Is to say
876000	878000	If it is a whole universe
878000	880000	It will have
880000	882000	Modified CMB
882000	884000	Is it effective?
884000	886000	Ok
886000	888000	I actually framed another part
888000	890000	How would
890000	892000	Emergent gravity affect
892000	894000	The physics
894000	896000	Someone asked me
896000	898000	There are many different explanations
898000	900000	For example, extra dimension
900000	902000	EREPR
902000	904000	Modified gravity
904000	906000	Modified Newtonian dynamics
906000	908000	It's a standard name
908000	910000	But why do we want to do dark matter
910000	912000	I think the reason is simple
912000	914000	Because dark matter can be done
914000	916000	Even if you
916000	918000	Don't think it's a good
918000	920000	Maybe it's the right theory
920000	922000	But rule out and prove it
922000	924000	Should be equally important
924000	926000	So we are doing this now
926000	928000	But I would say this mod is difficult to do
928000	930000	But someone is thinking
930000	932000	For example, microgravity
932000	934000	Some light experiment
934000	936000	That
936000	938000	The details
938000	940000	I think you should know better than me
940000	942000	So I don't really understand
942000	944000	There can be special
944000	946000	That
946000	948000	It means
948000	950000	Right
952000	954000	So what I just imagined
954000	956000	Assuming there is an extra dimension
956000	958000	Contact
958000	960000	Then your thinking
960000	962000	3 plus 1
962000	964000	Will be proportional to
964000	966000	This contact
966000	968000	Its size
968000	970000	So if you are here
970000	972000	Bigger or smaller
972000	974000	It's more likely to be proportional
974000	976000	To the outside
976000	978000	But this
978000	980000	Compactify
980000	982000	Dimension
982000	984000	Right
984000	986000	Assuming the size
986000	988000	Is not constant
988000	990000	Here is so big
990000	992000	Then it means in different places
992000	994000	Four or more
994000	996000	Its size will be different
996000	998000	Should be possible
998000	1000000	I don't know how they do it
1000000	1002000	But
1002000	1004000	The point is that someone thinks so
1004000	1006000	Then
1006000	1008000	I think
1008000	1010000	I'll jump back
1010000	1012000	Faster
1014000	1016000	Where did I say
1018000	1020000	Ok
1020000	1022000	Actually
1022000	1024000	It's more interesting
1024000	1026000	That
1026000	1028000	If someone is interested in other
1028000	1030000	Various
1030000	1032000	Prediction
1032000	1034000	Prediction
1036000	1038000	Various observations
1038000	1040000	So
1040000	1042000	We have a missing mass
1042000	1044000	A
1044000	1046000	So
1046000	1048000	What you see now
1048000	1050000	Is our Milky Way
1050000	1052000	This is what we think of Milky Way
1052000	1054000	The Milky Way we see
1054000	1056000	Then next to it, I help you zoom in
1056000	1058000	That's our solar system
1058000	1060000	Then we go around the sun
1060000	1062000	The third one over there
1062000	1064000	Why is this important
1064000	1066000	Because we do experiments on the earth
1066000	1068000	Everyone knows how important it is
1068000	1070000	What about the picture in the upper left corner
1070000	1072000	Is to say
1072000	1074000	This is not a special phenomenon
1074000	1076000	That is to say, only our Milky Way Galaxy
1076000	1078000	Because before
1078000	1080000	A lot of people think
1080000	1082000	Will you observe like this
1082000	1084000	Is it because we are in the Milky Way
1084000	1086000	So we are in the Milky Way
1086000	1088000	That is not the center of gravity
1088000	1090000	Then observe there
1090000	1092000	Then you have to correct it
1092000	1094000	Such a
1094000	1096000	A constant change
1096000	1098000	That
1098000	1100000	Will there be a problem with this experiment
1100000	1102000	But this thing
1102000	1104000	It's basically a
1104000	1106000	A
1106000	1108000	A whole observation of the 70s
1108000	1110000	Completely broken
1110000	1112000	This person later got that
1112000	1114000	President's Freedom Award
1114000	1116000	He observed a lot of galaxies
1116000	1118000	Then there is such a phenomenon
1118000	1120000	So what you see in the upper left corner is
1120000	1122000	I said that
1122000	1124000	The speed of rotation
1124000	1126000	It's really flat, isn't it?
1126000	1128000	But if you
1128000	1130000	Gmm is equal to R squared
1130000	1132000	In fact, it should be
1132000	1134000	In contrast to once
1134000	1136000	That is, it will keep going down
1136000	1138000	Uh, once
1138000	1140000	V squared will be in contrast to R
1140000	1142000	V squared will be in contrast to R
1142000	1144000	OK, so we really think
1144000	1146000	What should it look like
1146000	1148000	It should look like this
1148000	1150000	It's a little bit of lag
1150000	1152000	There is a halo
1152000	1154000	Something like a light cloud
1154000	1156000	OK, so this thing is called Dark Matter Halo
1156000	1158000	Then we are in that
1158000	1160000	Inside, so we have been constantly
1160000	1162000	In Dark Matter Halo
1162000	1164000	Uh, moving is being soaked inside
1164000	1166000	A feeling of being soaked inside
1166000	1168000	I have a question, then you
1168000	1170000	Uh, that is to say
1170000	1172000	How big is it
1172000	1174000	Its scale
1174000	1176000	Its effect will come out slowly
1176000	1178000	Because you want to look at the Galaxy scale
1178000	1180000	Then I said, for example, the solar system scale or the galaxy group scale
1180000	1182000	It will also have a laser curve
1182000	1184000	Then when you draw it out
1184000	1186000	Is it the same as that
1186000	1188000	Oh, I forgot to put that thing
1188000	1190000	That is
1190000	1192000	This is very interesting, you can ask a question
1192000	1194000	That is
1194000	1196000	How long does it take for us to turn the sun
1196000	1198000	One year, right?
1198000	1200000	Then we solar system
1200000	1202000	How long does it take to turn the galaxy
1202000	1204000	OK
1204000	1206000	Basically, there is no life
1206000	1208000	Can feel the difference
1208000	1210000	So you can imagine
1210000	1212000	We are in a
1212000	1214000	With
1214000	1216000	The center of the galaxy as the origin
1216000	1218000	Coordinate inside
1218000	1220000	Surrounding the sun to do local rotation
1220000	1222000	Can you
1222000	1224000	So basically in this Dark Matter Halo
1224000	1226000	Inside
1226000	1228000	We are actually in a fixed position
1228000	1230000	Local place will keep turning
1230000	1232000	So what will you get in the end
1232000	1234000	You will
1234000	1236000	If you measure the local
1236000	1238000	The speed of that halo
1238000	1240000	I said
1240000	1242000	Dark Matter
1242000	1244000	Wait a minute, you just asked
1244000	1246000	The speed of the planet
1248000	1250000	Ok, let me tell you
1250000	1252000	The speed of the earth itself around the sun
1252000	1254000	Will dominate this
1254000	1256000	This measurement
1256000	1258000	OK
1258000	1260000	So actually someone found something very interesting
1260000	1262000	It should be said that Propose is a very interesting concept
1262000	1264000	Because we are
1264000	1266000	Relative to our life
1266000	1268000	And the time scale we use
1268000	1270000	We are in Dark Matter Halo
1270000	1272000	Solar system in Dark Matter Halo
1272000	1274000	Basically fixed
1274000	1276000	That point is not moving
1276000	1278000	Your whole life will not change
1278000	1280000	A pixel on the earth
1280000	1282000	But the earth has been around
1282000	1284000	So the earth is equal to
1284000	1286000	The solar system is sitting in a
1286000	1288000	Constant Dark Matter Week
1288000	1290000	A Dark Matter
1290000	1292000	Wind inside
1292000	1294000	Keep moving in the same direction
1294000	1296000	Then we have half a year
1296000	1298000	Half a year is against it
1298000	1300000	Half a year is against it
1300000	1302000	This is called Dark Matter Annual Modulation
1302000	1304000	It can be a
1304000	1306000	Probing
1306000	1308000	Dark Matter as a particle
1308000	1310000	A very important phenomenon
1310000	1312000	About ten years ago
1312000	1314000	They measured
1314000	1316000	And then all the other people couldn't
1316000	1318000	Reproduce that experiment
1318000	1320000	Do you know this
1320000	1322000	In addition to the
1322000	1324000	The scale of the solar system
1324000	1326000	It's a little bit bigger
1326000	1328000	But smaller than the galaxy
1328000	1330000	But smaller than the galaxy
1330000	1332000	See
1332000	1334000	There are a lot of stars in the galaxy
1334000	1336000	Is a lot of
1336000	1338000	Oh, I don't know
1338000	1340000	I don't know
1340000	1342000	I don't know
1342000	1344000	Because usually we
1344000	1346000	We are
1346000	1348000	Anyway, everyone is talking about
1348000	1350000	What clues are there in Dark Matter
1350000	1352000	Just use a few scales
1352000	1354000	Galaxy
1354000	1356000	It's a bunch of galaxies
1356000	1358000	It's called Megastructure
1358000	1360000	And then there's the whole universe
1360000	1362000	There are about four
1362000	1364000	Will there be a star group in the middle
1364000	1366000	I don't know
1366000	1368000	Maybe someone is doing it
1368000	1370000	I don't know
1370000	1372000	I don't know
1372000	1374000	The next one
1374000	1376000	But
1376000	1378000	Oh, yeah, I have that doll up there
1378000	1380000	That's it
1380000	1382000	So
1382000	1384000	Then we think it's weird
1384000	1386000	Since we're sitting on the whole earth
1386000	1388000	Including ourselves
1388000	1390000	Do you feel like you're being blown by the wind
1390000	1392000	Or has the ghost been pushing you
1392000	1394000	The answer is no
1394000	1396000	So
1396000	1398000	A very popular theory
1398000	1400000	That is
1400000	1402000	We're all surrounded by
1402000	1404000	Dark Matter
1404000	1406000	OK, just like we're all surrounded by air
1406000	1408000	But they basically
1408000	1410000	Won't put their
1410000	1412000	Momentum to us
1412000	1414000	It won't interact with us
1414000	1416000	OK
1416000	1418000	This is smaller than air
1418000	1420000	Because we're actually air
1420000	1422000	I don't feel the interaction
1422000	1424000	But Dark Matter basically has a theory
1424000	1426000	The first two are the substances we already know
1426000	1428000	And then they interact with each other
1428000	1430000	In the form of throwing the ball
1430000	1432000	So they can pass on
1432000	1434000	That's what we know
1434000	1436000	And then
1436000	1438000	It's all Dark Matter next to it
1438000	1440000	But Dark Matter has no way to catch the ball
1440000	1442000	Just stand there and watch
1442000	1444000	Of course
1444000	1446000	But he has gravity
1446000	1448000	Yeah, so
1448000	1450000	So we put one over there
1450000	1452000	Gravity pole
1452000	1454000	It's the only thing that can interact with us
1454000	1456000	It's pulling us
1456000	1458000	So we can
1458000	1460000	Basically this is the only
1460000	1462000	We can see that
1462000	1464000	The reason for the Rotational Curve
1464000	1466000	OK
1466000	1468000	Because it has a gravitational interaction with us
1468000	1470000	Can this be localized?
1470000	1472000	Let's say we have a
1472000	1474000	Dark Matter here
1474000	1476000	Let's say it's a ball
1476000	1478000	Would it enhance
1478000	1480000	The gravitational pull between the substances?
1480000	1482000	How does it interact with you?
1482000	1484000	Oh, yeah, that's what I just said
1484000	1486000	Microgravity
1486000	1488000	This thing is very interesting
1488000	1490000	You either measure a very large scale
1490000	1492000	why
1492000	1494000	Because you can have a very large group of Dark Matter
1494000	1496000	You can measure the great pull
1496000	1498000	Then this approach will become
1498000	1500000	There is a
1500000	1502000	What is it called?
1502000	1504000	Lensing is Gravitational Lensing
1504000	1506000	In fact, we can use what we know
1506000	1508000	Baryonic Matter
1508000	1510000	But a lot of people are doing
1510000	1512000	There is a galaxy far away
1512000	1514000	Then it also has a
1514000	1516000	Dark Matter Halo
1516000	1518000	And then there's something behind it
1518000	1520000	So we can see what's behind it
1520000	1522000	Then we can see
1522000	1524000	The effect of this galaxy
1524000	1526000	Can we go to
1526000	1528000	So this lens
1528000	1530000	How heavy is it?
1530000	1532000	Then we can see how bright this lens is
1532000	1534000	So we can guess how heavy its Baryonic Matter is
1534000	1536000	I don't know
1536000	1538000	I don't know why I have to talk about Baryonic Matter when I do astronomy
1538000	1540000	Standard Model of Matter
1540000	1542000	How heavy is it?
1542000	1544000	Then this is a way
1544000	1546000	There are a lot of measurements
1546000	1548000	Measurement and
1550000	1552000	Does it match?
1552000	1554000	But it's a total
1554000	1556000	Because if you measure it like this, it's a total
1556000	1558000	Because you're looking at a very far
1558000	1560000	A very far galaxy
1560000	1562000	As a mirror
1562000	1564000	A lens is not a mirror
1564000	1566000	So a lot of people are doing
1566000	1568000	Is what you said
1568000	1570000	Can I do it on Earth?
1570000	1572000	For example, I'm on the table
1572000	1574000	I know how heavy this apple is
1574000	1576000	How heavy that banana is
1576000	1578000	How big is the gravitational pull between them
1578000	1580000	But if there's Dark Matter in the middle
1580000	1582000	How much should it change
1582000	1584000	The problem with this is that you can control all the experiments
1584000	1586000	But their signals are small
1586000	1588000	Because things are light
1588000	1590000	So it's hard to do
1590000	1592000	But if there's a breakthrough in this part
1592000	1594000	It will be a completely different
1594000	1596000	For Theory
1596000	1598000	But this is
1598000	1600000	This is more like what you're talking about
1600000	1602000	We're measuring the magnitude of the current current
1602000	1604000	This we know
1604000	1606000	Because if Dark Matter
1606000	1608000	If it's small, it's not
1608000	1610000	But it's like this
1610000	1612000	So
1614000	1616000	The problem here is
1616000	1618000	How big is your sensitivity?
1618000	1620000	How big is your experiment sensitivity?
1620000	1622000	Because we're measuring the magnitude
1622000	1624000	It should all be from astronomy
1624000	1626000	Just look at the big
1626000	1628000	Gravitational Source
1628000	1630000	I don't know
1630000	1632000	I don't know what they're doing right now
1632000	1634000	But someone is doing it
1634000	1636000	This is actually a very interesting experiment for me
1636000	1638000	But I think it's been five or ten years
1638000	1640000	Should all be very
1640000	1642000	Test performance
1642000	1644000	There will be no breakthrough
1644000	1646000	I have a question
1646000	1648000	Dark Matter seems to be man-made
1648000	1650000	Oh
1650000	1652000	This is a completely
1652000	1654000	Different idea
1654000	1656000	You have to talk about
1656000	1658000	Just talk about man-made
1658000	1660000	That's what LHC wants to do
1660000	1662000	I'll talk about it later
1662000	1664000	Yeah, because if it's man-made
1664000	1666000	Maybe you can measure the difference
1666000	1668000	Oh, I know what you mean
1668000	1670000	Theoretically, right?
1670000	1672000	It's Gravity
1672000	1674000	If it's a pile of matter
1674000	1676000	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
1676000	1678000	But I don't think I can measure it
1678000	1680000	The reason is the same as just now
1680000	1682000	Because your weight is small, it's hard to measure
1682000	1684000	So now the problem is
1684000	1686000	Of course we know there is
1686000	1688000	Golden mass
1688000	1690000	But I'm not sure if it's dark matter
1690000	1692000	No one knows what it is
1692000	1694000	But what you can imagine is
1694000	1696000	You can modify what you originally used to do
1696000	1698000	Assuming something
1698000	1700000	Assuming Newton's law is right
1700000	1702000	That is, there is less matter
1702000	1704000	Or Newton's law
1704000	1706000	Then you have to modify that
1706000	1708000	Anyway, either case
1708000	1710000	You have to come up with a theory
1710000	1712000	What we are doing is to treat it as a particle
1712000	1714000	Yes, it's a particle
1714000	1716000	To do
1716000	1718000	Its only interaction is gravity
1718000	1720000	OK
1720000	1722000	This is what I want to talk about
1722000	1724000	So it just stands there and doesn't do anything, right?
1724000	1726000	So our current assumption is
1726000	1728000	Dark matter doesn't interact
1728000	1730000	This sentence is correct
1730000	1732000	If you talk to astronomers
1732000	1734000	In all of our roles
1734000	1736000	Dark matter will never work with you
1736000	1738000	What are you doing
1738000	1740000	OK
1740000	1742000	But what is our hope
1742000	1744000	Our hope is
1744000	1746000	Next page
1746000	1748000	Next page
1748000	1750000	It's a very, very, very
1750000	1752000	Small chance
1752000	1754000	It's actually going to be with us
1754000	1756000	This red
1756000	1758000	Red is straight or neutral, I forgot
1758000	1760000	Anyway, it interacts with our normal matter
1760000	1762000	But what are its conditions
1762000	1764000	Its condition is to be small
1772000	1774000	That is to say
1774000	1776000	You want this opportunity to be small
1778000	1780000	In all previous experiments
1780000	1782000	It looks like it has no interaction
1782000	1784000	But you will feel that
1784000	1786000	It's already so small, so why do you have to assume it
1786000	1788000	There is actually another reason
1788000	1790000	Because
1790000	1792000	We are directly
1792000	1794000	Attack Dark Matter
1794000	1796000	Before we measure directly
1798000	1800000	We have a lot of other theoretical examples
1800000	1802000	It predicts
1802000	1804000	New example
1804000	1806000	OK
1806000	1808000	It's not just what we know now
1808000	1810000	Then these new examples
1810000	1812000	With
1812000	1814000	The whole complete
1814000	1816000	The larger and more complete theory
1816000	1818000	Its interaction is very weak
1820000	1822000	Weak to all other
1822000	1824000	The experiments we have done before
1824000	1826000	It looks like it has no interaction
1826000	1828000	But it is not completely
1828000	1830000	This is the point
1830000	1832000	Then it is more important
1832000	1834000	That value
1834000	1836000	Is what we should be able to measure
1836000	1838000	As long as we design a
1838000	1840000	Dedicated experiment
1840000	1842000	So some people think
1842000	1844000	This is very important
1844000	1846000	In fact, we can't measure
1846000	1848000	It's not that it doesn't interact
1848000	1850000	But we don't have a very sensitive way to measure it
1850000	1852000	So we always thought it was completely
1852000	1854000	But in fact
1854000	1856000	If we measure it today
1856000	1858000	We think it should interact with us
1858000	1860000	This sensitive detector
1860000	1862000	There is still no interaction
1862000	1864000	Then we can rule out the old theory
1864000	1866000	Which we did many times
1866000	1868000	I will talk about it later
1868000	1870000	So what is the current situation
1870000	1872000	The current situation is
1872000	1874000	The earth is over there
1874000	1876000	Red is our experiment
1876000	1878000	We put it on the earth
1878000	1880000	Then we are in the dark matter
1880000	1882000	So as the center of the coordinate
1882000	1884000	Dark matter has been hitting us crazy
1884000	1886000	Then we hope that many
1886000	1888000	One will hit our detector
1888000	1890000	Then hit the detector
1890000	1892000	The situation is actually quite serious
1892000	1894000	Like you hit the ball
1894000	1896000	I wrote it there
1896000	1898000	Come in and out
1898000	1900000	It passes a little bit of kinetic energy to the detector
1900000	1902000	Then what we want to measure is this little bit of kinetic energy
1904000	1906000	it is good
1906000	1908000	This is what we want to do
1908000	1910000	How do we actually do it?
1912000	1914000	Okay, let's start to move on
1914000	1916000	That is to say our project
1916000	1918000	This is not our project
1918000	1920000	But I want to talk about it first
1920000	1922000	The two most popular methods on the earth
1922000	1924000	Then I want to
1924000	1926000	Then we have to say in our work
1926000	1928000	Why do we think this is better
1928000	1930000	This is the first method
1930000	1932000	Called Time Projection Chamber
1934000	1936000	That red line is dark matter
1936000	1938000	Dark matter comes in
1938000	1940000	After a lot of times
1940000	1942000	It hit the bucket
1942000	1944000	Detected matter in the basket
1944000	1946000	Then like hitting the ball
1946000	1948000	Then go out
1948000	1950000	Then it passes the energy to the line like a caterpillar
1950000	1952000	What is that line?
1952000	1954000	Inside the bucket
1954000	1956000	Is our so-called
1956000	1958000	Target Matter
1958000	1960000	What do I usually talk about?
1960000	1962000	Anyway, it's Target Matter
1962000	1964000	Then it passes a little energy to this
1964000	1966000	Material
1966000	1968000	The atomic box of this element
1968000	1970000	Then the atomic box
1970000	1972000	After some energy
1972000	1974000	Pass this energy to it
1974000	1976000	Electrons on the track
1976000	1978000	The electrons will move forward and then fall
1978000	1980000	Then the light will come out
1980000	1982000	The light is the yellow line of the caterpillar
1982000	1984000	OK
1984000	1986000	Then this flash of light
1986000	1988000	It will spread out
1988000	1990000	The PMT above and below
1990000	1992000	PMT is called Photon Multiplier Tube
1992000	1994000	Photon Multiplier Tube
1994000	1996000	Photon Multiplier Tube
1996000	1998000	Basically it is a very sensitive light sensor
1998000	2000000	You can measure that light
2000000	2002000	Then I just talked about it
2002000	2004000	Then it will absorb the energy
2004000	2006000	Pass it to the electrons and then fall
2006000	2008000	Then you know that the moonlight
2008000	2010000	The light released is a fixed color
2010000	2012000	Is a fixed energy
2012000	2014000	So you look at the energy of this color
2014000	2016000	How strong it means
2016000	2018000	How many electrons are released
2018000	2020000	Then you can push it back
2020000	2022000	How much energy did it eat
2022000	2024000	OK
2024000	2026000	This is the first signal
2026000	2028000	Then the second signal
2028000	2030000	Did I just say
2034000	2036000	It will have an electron moonlight
2036000	2038000	Then the electron moonlight
2038000	2040000	In addition to this kind of falling
2040000	2042000	This ratio is separated
2042000	2044000	OK
2044000	2046000	What about these electrons
2046000	2048000	It is in this up and down vertical direction
2048000	2050000	Put a very, very strong power plant
2050000	2052000	I wrote it there
2052000	2054000	It's probably thousands of volts per centimeter
2054000	2056000	For one
2056000	2058000	You look at the picture below
2058000	2060000	The vertical direction of the barrel is probably tens of thousands of volts
2060000	2062000	It will use this very strong power plant
2062000	2064000	Put
2064000	2066000	The electron is pulled all the way
2066000	2068000	Just drag it all the way
2068000	2070000	It's a virtual caterpillar on top
2070000	2072000	OK, that virtual caterpillar hit the detector
2072000	2074000	It has a secondary signal
2074000	2076000	So there is such a method
2076000	2078000	Can you
2078000	2080000	Then because it is pulled up
2080000	2082000	Speed ​​is a fixed speed
2082000	2084000	It's probably a fixed speed
2084000	2086000	Is the electron in the material
2086000	2088000	Drifting speed
2088000	2090000	So you count that
2090000	2092000	Flash, flash is basically a moment
2092000	2094000	Just flash and see
2094000	2096000	The speed at which you receive the electron
2096000	2098000	The time difference in the middle
2098000	2100000	Can you reverse the distance
2100000	2102000	OK, do you know what I mean
2102000	2104000	If you have a row of electrons being drifted
2104000	2106000	Then every one reaches a different distance
2106000	2108000	You reverse the whole thing and you get a track
2108000	2110000	Then through this track
2110000	2112000	You can vary
2112000	2114000	Roughly
2114000	2116000	Different
2116000	2118000	Hit your example
2118000	2120000	So you can tell
2120000	2122000	Is it that we already know the particle hit us
2122000	2124000	Or its behavior is consistent
2124000	2126000	This is what we should expect
2126000	2128000	This is called Time Projection Chamber
2128000	2130000	What about its problem
2130000	2132000	OK, let's talk about its advantages
2132000	2134000	Its advantage is
2134000	2136000	The material is usually
2136000	2138000	Liquified
2138000	2140000	What
2140000	2142000	That
2142000	2144000	Xenon
2144000	2146000	Or
2146000	2148000	Argon
2148000	2150000	Argon, Xenon
2150000	2152000	These are the two types of deflection
2152000	2154000	So it's actually a very heavy element
2154000	2156000	Then we
2156000	2158000	We know the heavy element
2158000	2160000	It's a bit like
2160000	2162000	If you hit a heavy thing today
2162000	2164000	Hit the air molecules with you
2164000	2166000	The air molecules will get more
2166000	2168000	Energy or something heavy
2168000	2170000	It should be heavy
2170000	2172000	So if today Dark Matter hits
2172000	2174000	Hit a heavier atomic box
2174000	2176000	It can leave more energy
2176000	2178000	Then we know that this energy is equal to the square of M
2178000	2180000	The square of the atomic box
2180000	2182000	So the signal is very big
2182000	2184000	And it's actually easy to scale up
2184000	2186000	Why scale up is important
2186000	2188000	Because basically there are
2188000	2190000	How many Dark Matters pass through your detector
2190000	2192000	How big is it with your detector
2192000	2194000	How many atomic boxes are there
2194000	2196000	So if you have a two-fold detector
2196000	2198000	Basically
2198000	2200000	The rate of the expected signal should be twice
2200000	2202000	They are easy to put a lot of
2202000	2204000	They are basically a big bucket
2204000	2206000	A super high voltage
2206000	2208000	It sounds crazy, but it's actually easy
2208000	2210000	Basically
2210000	2212000	To summarize
2212000	2214000	This is state-of-the-art optimization
2214000	2216000	Of a widely used
2216000	2218000	High-energy physics technology
2218000	2220000	Invented in the 70s
2220000	2222000	OK
2222000	2224000	They want to state-of-the-art
2224000	2226000	Optimize this very widely used
2226000	2228000	What are the benefits
2228000	2230000	They can scale up very quickly
2230000	2232000	And they know what problems they will encounter
2232000	2234000	So currently this approach
2234000	2236000	Is the most sensitive
2236000	2238000	In terms of event rate
2238000	2240000	OK
2240000	2242000	The second one
2246000	2248000	Another one is Solid State Detector
2248000	2250000	Why is this thing
2250000	2252000	Let me talk about it
2252000	2254000	What you see on the picture now
2254000	2256000	The part that I enlarged
2256000	2258000	That little metal box
2258000	2260000	Inside that metal box is next to this
2260000	2262000	Carton
2262000	2264000	That blue thing
2264000	2266000	Is a solid state
2266000	2268000	Its principle is actually the same as the one
2268000	2270000	The state of the art
2270000	2272000	You run in and hit it
2272000	2274000	Then give it energy
2274000	2276000	Energy makes it flash
2276000	2278000	OK, and then the flash
2278000	2280000	Light
2280000	2282000	Can be blown out
2282000	2284000	And then the top and bottom of this picture
2284000	2286000	That label
2286000	2288000	Called TES
2288000	2290000	TES is
2290000	2292000	We know the most sensitive on Earth
2292000	2294000	What is it
2294000	2296000	It's called Transition Edge Sensor
2296000	2298000	I'll talk about it later
2298000	2300000	OK
2300000	2302000	It's very, very sensitive
2302000	2304000	And then
2304000	2306000	In addition to this signal
2306000	2308000	You can also get another signal
2308000	2310000	It's a deposit
2310000	2312000	Basically it's heat
2312000	2314000	It's heat in the crystal
2314000	2316000	Because energy is heat
2316000	2318000	If you think about it
2318000	2320000	Then the heat will flow out
2320000	2322000	The whole box is hollow
2322000	2324000	Nothing
2324000	2326000	So heat can't get out
2326000	2328000	Heat stays inside
2328000	2330000	OK
2330000	2332000	The only track that can be sent out
2332000	2334000	It's the top and bottom
2334000	2336000	It has two caterpillar wires
2336000	2338000	It will send heat bath
2338000	2340000	So you can eat all these heat
2340000	2342000	Then measure the heat
2342000	2344000	Then you
2344000	2346000	What is it called
2346000	2348000	You can identify
2348000	2350000	What hit us
2350000	2352000	Is it a particle we know
2352000	2354000	Or a particle we don't know
2354000	2356000	OK
2356000	2358000	What is the advantage
2358000	2360000	This kind of Solid State Detector
2360000	2362000	Can be operated under cryogenic temperature
2362000	2364000	For exquisite energy resolution
2364000	2366000	With ultra-low noise
2366000	2368000	But
2368000	2370000	What does it mean
2370000	2372000	It's super expensive
2372000	2374000	OK
2374000	2376000	It can have a lot of special phenomena
2376000	2378000	Our collaborators
2378000	2380000	In Berkeley
2380000	2382000	In different laboratories
2382000	2384000	This kind of thing
2384000	2386000	It can play a lot of magic
2386000	2388000	Recoil threshold depends on material property
2388000	2390000	You can invent
2390000	2392000	Very exotic material
2392000	2394000	Then let them eat
2394000	2396000	This
2396000	2398000	After hitting the ball
2398000	2400000	How to send it to you
2400000	2402000	Then you measure
2402000	2404000	OK
2404000	2406000	I know that Chicago University is now leading
2406000	2408000	They are doing CCD
2408000	2410000	To put it bluntly
2410000	2412000	The CCD chip in your camera
2412000	2414000	Take it to Dark Matter
2414000	2416000	After hitting
2416000	2418000	Then walk a small line
2418000	2420000	Different particles walk that line
2420000	2422000	The behavior will be different
2422000	2424000	So you can be very, very
2424000	2426000	Accurate judgment
2426000	2428000	How much energy is flowing now
2428000	2430000	What kind of particle is it
2430000	2432000	Then come again
2432000	2434000	Because we do superconductor
2434000	2436000	It is also a very sensitive material
2436000	2438000	And graphene
2438000	2440000	What is graphene?
2440000	2442000	What is special about graphene?
2442000	2444000	Its conductivity
2444000	2446000	is
2446000	2448000	Not all the same
2448000	2450000	It's the same in every direction
2450000	2452000	Like your guide
2452000	2454000	It's basically like this
2454000	2456000	It's like this
2456000	2458000	It's on the same plane
2458000	2460000	There are six directions
2460000	2462000	It's not zero
2462000	2464000	Then in the other six directions
2464000	2466000	It's not zero
2466000	2468000	Or it's the six-fold symmetry
2468000	2470000	It's very interesting
2470000	2472000	When your particles come in
2472000	2474000	If it runs in the direction of the conductor
2474000	2476000	It can
2476000	2478000	No matter how small the energy
2478000	2480000	It can pull
2480000	2482000	I should just talk about bandgap
2482000	2484000	Leave a place for bandgap
2484000	2486000	It's even weirder
2486000	2488000	It's superfluid
2488000	2490000	It's superfluid
2490000	2492000	It's also very sensitive
2492000	2494000	And it's even weirder
2494000	2496000	Fermi arc
2496000	2498000	This is what we did in Caltech
2498000	2500000	It's basically in a certain direction
2500000	2502000	Its bandgap is also zero
2502000	2504000	You can imagine
2504000	2506000	These things
2506000	2508000	They are all superfluid
2508000	2510000	But what's the problem
2510000	2512000	The problem is that they look like
2512000	2514000	It's the subject of research
2514000	2516000	Instead of using it to study other people
2516000	2518000	It's very, very expensive
2518000	2520000	But why is this interesting
2520000	2522000	I'll tell you later
2522000	2524000	Its dilemma
2524000	2526000	It's harder to scale up
2526000	2528000	Without meeting new challenges
2528000	2530000	While maintaining your budget and sensitivity
2530000	2532000	You know
2532000	2534000	The biggest experimental background is sensitivity
2534000	2536000	No, it's your budget
2536000	2538000	Can you understand
2538000	2540000	OK
2540000	2542000	So after talking about
2542000	2544000	Time projection chamber
2544000	2546000	And solid state detector
2546000	2548000	This is a monoplot
2548000	2550000	It's the whole field
2550000	2552000	The current state
2552000	2554000	Horizontal
2554000	2556000	It's your assumption
2556000	2558000	The quality of dark matter
2558000	2560000	Why do I say assumption
2560000	2562000	Because no one measured
2562000	2564000	If you measure it, you know where it can be drawn
2564000	2566000	You assume
2566000	2568000	How heavy is the dark matter you can't measure
2568000	2570000	OK
2570000	2572000	Then you have to know
2572000	2574000	How heavy is the dark matter particle
2574000	2576000	Then you know
2576000	2578000	The dark matter halo
2578000	2580000	How heavy is the total dark matter
2580000	2582000	So you know
2582000	2584000	How many
2584000	2586000	Particle in terms of number
2586000	2588000	The flux has been flowing through you
2588000	2590000	Then you can't measure
2590000	2592000	Then you can know
2592000	2594000	The chance of interaction with me
2594000	2596000	Can't be greater than how much
2596000	2598000	Otherwise I should measure
2598000	2600000	So the axis is the chance of interaction
2600000	2602000	Is the upper limit of that opportunity
2602000	2604000	This is
2604000	2606000	The interaction between dark matter and detector
2606000	2608000	The chance must be less than that line
2608000	2610000	If it's higher than that line
2610000	2612000	We should measure
2612000	2614000	This is the logic of the picture
2614000	2616000	So it actually has two directions
2616000	2618000	One way is that you
2618000	2620000	The bigger the detector
2620000	2622000	Like that time projection chamber
2622000	2624000	In theory, you can expect more events
2624000	2626000	If it can be measured
2626000	2628000	So if you can't measure it, you can keep the line down
2628000	2630000	It means that the higher the sensitivity
2630000	2632000	You still can't measure
2632000	2634000	Then the other one is that you can measure
2634000	2636000	The smaller the energy
2638000	2640000	Then can you know that
2640000	2642000	Because very light particles hit you
2642000	2644000	The energy left is very small
2644000	2646000	Then can you go to the left of this picture
2646000	2648000	To draw that line
2650000	2652000	Because you know you can measure this kind of energy
2652000	2654000	But you didn't measure
2654000	2656000	Then you can put it there
2656000	2658000	This part
2658000	2660000	Is the solid state
2662000	2664000	This is the main direction of this field
2664000	2666000	Everyone wants to push down
2666000	2668000	To make the detector bigger
2668000	2670000	But if you want to push to the left
2670000	2672000	You need a better detector
2674000	2676000	Then you will ask
2676000	2678000	What if to the right
2680000	2682000	To the right is like this
2682000	2684000	Why do we want to do a dedicated experiment
2684000	2686000	To measure dark matter
2686000	2688000	Because we have a very very
2688000	2690000	Very powerful machine
2690000	2692000	We have been using it
2694000	2696000	When they built it
2696000	2698000	Their reason besides looking for
2698000	2700000	The exposure
2700000	2702000	They actually want to find
2702000	2704000	I think it's fair to say
2704000	2706000	The super symmetry theory
2706000	2708000	Then the example of the super symmetry theory
2708000	2710000	It used to be the best for dark matter
2710000	2712000	The most anticipated thing
2712000	2714000	Their goal
2714000	2716000	Basically around TEV
2716000	2718000	Or sub-TEV
2718000	2720000	So that's where I put the soil
2722000	2724000	Then you will ask
2724000	2726000	Do we want to measure them now
2726000	2728000	The answer is that LHC has not been able to measure
2728000	2730000	And it has exceeded
2730000	2732000	The earliest version
2732000	2734000	Super symmetry theory
2734000	2736000	In other words, we have basically ruled out
2736000	2738000	The original super symmetry theory
2738000	2740000	So now there are a lot of super symmetry theories
2740000	2742000	They are looking at the original super symmetry theory
2742000	2744000	According to our continuous measurement
2744000	2746000	They think it is a
2746000	2748000	Super symmetry theory should have
2748000	2750000	What new phenomenon
2750000	2752000	Looking at this thing
2752000	2754000	So basically you keep going
2754000	2756000	Is more sensitive
2756000	2758000	To measure the super symmetry theory
2760000	2762000	Is there anything wrong?
2762000	2764000	But it can't be measured
2764000	2766000	It's already weird
2766000	2768000	If you are interested
2768000	2770000	You can ask me
2770000	2772000	So now Susie's
2772000	2774000	The expectations are probably all on the map
2774000	2776000	Everyone is surprised
2776000	2778000	Because almost all of them are in the places we have ruled out
2778000	2780000	So now a lot of new theories
2780000	2782000	Come out
2782000	2784000	If it's not a super symmetry theory
2784000	2786000	It's another one we've never thought of
2786000	2788000	The dark side
2788000	2790000	Just like you know
2790000	2792000	It's the dark world
2792000	2794000	We can't see it
2794000	2796000	It's very weak
2796000	2798000	Interact with the world we see
2798000	2800000	But it's a completely
2800000	2802000	Standalone dark world
2802000	2804000	It can have very light particles
2804000	2806000	Then we have to have
2806000	2808000	Very new technology
2808000	2810000	Go to the left of this picture
2810000	2812000	So this is our goal
2812000	2814000	Then you can see the top
2814000	2816000	Inside the SSD frame
2816000	2818000	The four lines on the far left
2818000	2820000	That's basically what we experimented
2820000	2822000	Four different operations
2822000	2824000	This is the most leading
2824000	2826000	Then we are going to propose the next technology
2826000	2828000	Push us down again
2828000	2830000	Push it to the left
2830000	2832000	Sorry
2832000	2834000	So this should be
2834000	2836000	OK, this is the last page
2836000	2838000	So the first part
2838000	2840000	Do you have any questions?
2840000	2842000	Oh, this is
2842000	2844000	Ok, this is
2844000	2846000	Our most popular theory now
2846000	2848000	It's called
2848000	2850000	Let's talk about popular
2850000	2852000	Anyway, it's everyone
2852000	2854000	The theory that most people are experimenting
