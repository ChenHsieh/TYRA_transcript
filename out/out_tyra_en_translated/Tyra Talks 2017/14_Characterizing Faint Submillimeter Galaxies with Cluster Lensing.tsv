0	13000	Hello everyone, I'm the host for today, Zhang Yanyong, and we're going to have our 21st Terra Talk.
14000	16000	Today's speaker is Xu Liyan.
16000	21000	Xu Liyan and I have known each other for almost two years.
21000	30000	It's really interesting because we're at Caltech, and Xu Liyan is studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.
30000	36000	In 2016, we had a year-long visit to Caltech and IPAC.
36000	38000	At that time, we met Xu Liyan.
38000	43000	Xu Liyan happens to be a senior in the Department of Physics at Caltech, but he was studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.
43000	45000	Did I say that correctly?
45000	48000	I'm from the Department of Physics.
48000	50000	Oh, you're from the Department of Physics.
50000	53000	But you're studying astronomy at Manoa University.
53000	57000	My advisor is from Manoa University.
57000	58000	I see.
58000	62000	It's interesting because he's from Hawaii, and they were surfing.
62000	65000	I was surfing, so we became good friends.
65000	70000	Of course, his main job is still doing astronomy observation research in Hawaii.
70000	79000	After returning from Caltech, in 2017, he recently obtained a Ph.D. degree, so he is a new doctor.
79000	82000	Liyan's research is mainly galaxy observation.
82000	87000	In his doctoral career, he is going to talk to us about this big topic today.
87000	94000	He published 34 papers, but today he will focus on the latest one.
94000	104000	If you are interested in learning more about the previous papers, you can contact him directly.
104000	108000	Without further ado, let's welcome Liyan to give us his speech.
108000	110000	I'll mute myself.
110000	115000	I'd like to remind everyone to mute your microphone when you speak.
115000	116000	Thank you.
116000	117000	You can start.
117000	119000	Okay, I'll start.
120000	125000	If you have any questions, please mute your microphone.
125000	128000	I'm afraid people won't understand.
130000	131000	Oh, sorry.
131000	133000	We forgot something.
133000	134000	We need to clap.
134000	137000	We need to mute our microphone when we clap.
140000	142000	Okay, you can start.
142000	143000	Okay, thank you.
144000	153000	As you can see, my title is Characterizing Faint Sub-millimeter Galaxies with Posture Lensing.
153000	161000	If you don't read astronomy, you can only understand Characterizing, Faint, and Width.
161000	164000	I'll explain what they mean.
165000	172000	In short, I'm studying a galaxy called Sub-millimeter Galaxy.
172000	182000	The wavelength detected by this galaxy is called Sub-millimeter.
182000	187000	Sub-millimeter is shorter than millimeter.
187000	189000	Millimeter is in kilometers.
190000	202000	Traditionally, people use 850 micrometers to study Sub-millimeter Galaxy.
202000	208000	Now I'll explain why I'm studying this galaxy and what I'm studying.
209000	211000	Okay.
211000	216000	Why do we study this galaxy?
216000	219000	It's related to the evolution of the universe.
219000	227000	You can google the history of the universe.
227000	229000	You'll see a similar picture.
229000	234000	The age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.
234000	235000	Maybe you've heard of it.
236000	239000	It started from the Big Bang.
239000	243000	The history of the universe is shown here.
243000	244000	It started from the Big Bang.
244000	249000	Then there was a period of time called Inflation.
249000	253000	At that time, the temperature of the universe was still very high.
253000	255000	It was all gaseous gas.
256000	259000	Until the temperature dropped to the ground.
259000	266000	The gaseous electrons in the universe were recombined with the gaseous atoms.
266000	269000	They became neutral gas atoms.
269000	274000	From then on, light can start to run freely in the universe.
274000	280000	Before that, any light would be scattered by those gaseous electrons.
281000	285000	From then on, light can run freely in the universe.
285000	290000	At that time, the universe was scattered by those gaseous electrons.
290000	291000	Okay.
291000	295000	But the temperature of the universe was still very high.
295000	299000	So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.
299000	302000	After the temperature dropped to the ground.
302000	304000	The temperature of the gaseous atoms dropped to the ground.
304000	307000	The temperature of the universe was still very high.
307000	311000	So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.
311000	313000	Before that, there was a period called Dark Age.
313000	314000	Okay.
314000	319000	Basically, in the Big Bang, Inflation, and Cosmic Microwave Background.
319000	324000	During this period, I basically think that this part of history belongs to physicists.
324000	327000	Like the theory of explosion, it's a physicist.
327000	329000	This is very physical.
329000	330000	And Big Bang.
331000	334000	From the beginning of the formation of gravity.
334000	336000	After the first gravity.
336000	339000	This part can be done by astronomers.
339000	341000	Astronomers can do this part.
341000	343000	I said that the temperature of the universe.
343000	345000	Because the universe is constantly expanding.
345000	347000	The temperature slowly drops.
347000	350000	And these gaseous atoms.
350000	354000	It can be further combined into gaseous atoms.
354000	356000	Gaseous atoms.
356000	358000	If it's cold enough.
358000	360000	After gravity collapses.
360000	362000	It will form a star.
362000	364000	Then the star will.
364000	366000	You should have heard of the star.
366000	367000	Just like our sun.
367000	369000	It produces a fusion reaction.
369000	370000	So it will glow.
370000	371000	Then it will produce gas.
371000	372000	Okay.
372000	375000	Then the star will not be one by one.
375000	377000	They are produced in groups.
377000	379000	That is to form the so-called galaxy.
379000	380000	Right.
380000	381000	The galaxy is.
381000	383000	A galaxy is basically.
383000	385000	More than a billion of stars.
385000	386000	Okay.
386000	388000	It is a system of galaxies.
388000	389000	So.
389000	391000	From this time on.
391000	393000	After the galaxy.
393000	394000	It is.
394000	396000	Many galaxies.
396000	397000	In this universe.
397000	399000	More and more galaxies.
399000	400000	Okay.
400000	401000	Then.
401000	402000	We study.
402000	403000	I mean.
403000	404000	This part.
404000	405000	I study the so-called.
405000	407000	Galaxy formation and evolution.
407000	409000	The formation of galaxies.
409000	410000	And evolution.
410000	411000	Then.
411000	413000	An important point is.
413000	414000	My research.
414000	415000	This research.
415000	416000	Is to study.
416000	417000	This universe.
417000	419000	The star formation.
419000	421000	The history of star formation.
421000	422000	This is the so-called.
422000	424000	Cosmic star formation.
424000	425000	Then.
425000	427000	We want to use.
427000	428000	That is to say.
428000	429000	From this.
429000	431000	From the first star to now.
431000	433000	The evolution of this universe.
433000	434000	One of them.
434000	436000	You have to understand the evolution of this universe.
436000	437000	One of them.
437000	438000	You have to understand.
438000	439000	It must be very important.
439000	441000	How to say.
441000	443000	One of the very important factors.
443000	445000	Is star formation.
445000	447000	Because.
447000	448000	If you.
448000	450000	From the perspective of astronomy.
450000	452000	No matter what you are studying.
452000	453000	No matter you are studying.
453000	455000	The evolution of galaxies.
455000	456000	Galaxy formation and evolution.
456000	457000	Or.
457000	458000	You want to study.
458000	459000	What.
459000	460000	Stars.
460000	461000	For example.
461000	462000	Like our solar system.
462000	463000	Or study.
463000	464000	What.
464000	465000	Mars.
465000	466000	Small stars.
466000	467000	In the universe.
467000	469000	No matter what kind of weather you study.
469000	470000	It must be.
470000	471000	Related to the stars.
471000	472000	Related to the stars.
472000	473000	Because.
473000	474000	You have the star.
474000	475000	You have the star formation.
475000	476000	After.
476000	477000	After the star formation.
477000	478000	These stars.
478000	479000	Merge together.
479000	480000	Becomes.
480000	481000	Galaxy.
481000	482000	So it's related to the galaxy.
482000	483000	Then.
483000	484000	You.
484000	485000	Star.
485000	486000	Star system.
486000	487000	Like our solar system.
487000	488000	Is.
488000	489000	After the star formation.
489000	490000	Then.
490000	492000	Some dust around this star.
492000	493000	Slowly.
493000	494000	Is formed.
494000	495000	Star.
495000	496000	Then the star.
496000	497000	Just go around the star.
497000	498000	Like the comet.
498000	499000	Small star.
499000	500000	This is also.
500000	501000	This is also.
501000	502000	So.
502000	503000	You can say.
503000	504000	Astronomy.
504000	505000	No matter what you study.
505000	506000	Ah.
506000	507000	I said astronomy.
507000	508000	If it's.
508000	509000	The kind of physics in cosmology.
509000	510000	It doesn't count.
510000	511000	Astronomy.
511000	512000	Basically.
512000	513000	Whatever you do.
513000	514000	No matter what you do.
514000	515000	It's related to.
515000	516000	Star formation.
516000	517000	So star formation.
517000	518000	History.
518000	519000	Star formation.
519000	520000	History.
520000	521000	So it's a very important.
521000	522000	Ah.
522000	523000	You want to understand.
523000	524000	This universe.
524000	525000	This is a very important thing.
525000	526000	OK.
526000	527000	Then.
527000	528000	So.
528000	529000	I believe I have.
529000	530000	Convinced everyone.
530000	531000	Star formation.
531000	532000	History.
532000	533000	It's a very important thing.
533000	534000	But.
534000	535000	Ah.
535000	536000	Star formation.
536000	537000	History.
537000	538000	Ah.
538000	539000	We.
539000	540000	When we do research.
540000	541000	Found.
541000	542000	This picture on the left.
542000	543000	It's the so-called.
543000	544000	I put star formation.
544000	545000	History.
545000	546000	This thing.
546000	547000	Brighten it.
547000	548000	Then.
548000	549000	This place.
549000	550000	Left.
550000	551000	This axis.
551000	552000	Called.
552000	553000	Star formation.
553000	554000	Great.
554000	555000	Density.
555000	556000	Star formation.
556000	557000	Great.
557000	558000	Is.
558000	559000	Left.
559000	560000	There is a green layer.
560000	561000	Is.
561000	562000	Every year.
562000	563000	His unit is.
563000	564000	Ah.
564000	565000	Ah.
565000	566000	The quality of the stars.
566000	567000	Out of.
567000	568000	Time.
568000	569000	Then.
569000	570000	His unit basically.
570000	571000	Every year.
571000	572000	You see.
572000	573000	Every year.
573000	574000	Can produce.
574000	575000	How many solar qualities.
575000	576000	This.
576000	577000	This unit is the solar mass.
577000	578000	Is the solar mass.
578000	579000	So in this part.
579000	580000	Calls.
580000	581000	Star formation.
581000	582000	Great.
582000	583000	So if you are in the volume.
583000	584000	Is.
584000	585000	Star formation.
585000	586000	Great.
586000	587000	Then in the unit volume.
587000	588000	Then.
588000	589000	Don't.
589000	590000	You don't care how he came.
590000	591000	Then he is a huge unit.
591000	592000	Then.
592000	593000	Three times.
593000	594000	So he is this part.
594000	595000	Ah.
595000	596000	Gravitational law.
596000	597000	In the unit volume.
597000	598000	So called.
598000	599000	Star formation.
599000	600000	Great.
600000	601000	Density.
601000	602000	Very early.
602000	603000	Here is the lookback time.
603000	604000	So the more to the right.
604000	605000	Is.
605000	606000	Longer ago.
606000	607000	OK.
607000	608000	Then this lookback time.
608000	609000	Can correspond to the so-called.
609000	610000	Redshift.
610000	611000	Called.
611000	612000	Redshift.
612000	613000	Then this.
613000	614000	Redshift.
614000	615000	What is it?
615000	616000	I'll explain it later.
616000	617000	But you can.
617000	618000	I can tell you now.
618000	619000	Is.
619000	620000	The more to the right.
620000	621000	Is.
621000	622000	The earlier.
622000	623000	The.
623000	624000	Universe.
624000	625000	That.
625000	626000	Zero.
626000	627000	This place is now.
627000	628000	OK.
628000	629000	So the time travel.
629000	630000	Is from the right to the left.
630000	631000	Or from the left to the right.
631000	632000	OK.
632000	633000	Then this picture.
633000	634000	Basically.
634000	635000	Is a star formation.
635000	636000	History.
636000	637000	Then you want to.
637000	638000	Measure this picture.
638000	639000	Ah.
639000	640000	You.
640000	641000	We.
641000	642000	Ah.
642000	643000	Will find.
643000	644000	There are two.
644000	645000	Ah.
645000	646000	Basically.
646000	647000	Can be.
647000	648000	Two kinds of observations.
648000	649000	Is very important.
649000	650000	Is.
650000	651000	Ah.
651000	652000	When we used to.
652000	653000	Probably in the 90s.
653000	654000	When.
654000	655000	The end of the 90s.
655000	656000	We have some.
656000	657000	Ah.
657000	658000	Ah.
658000	659000	Ah.
659000	660000	Ah.
660000	661000	Satellite.
661000	662000	Ah.
662000	663000	It's the space telescope.
663000	664000	We go to measure.
664000	665000	The whole universe.
665000	666000	Background radiation.
666000	667000	That.
667000	668000	There are different.
668000	669000	Wavelength background radiation.
669000	670000	That.
670000	671000	I just mentioned.
671000	672000	The background radiation of the universe microwave.
672000	673000	Is called.
673000	674000	Cosmic Microwave Background.
674000	675000	Is here.
675000	676000	Ah.
676000	677000	Then this.
677000	678000	Is.
678000	679000	Is the intensity of light.
679000	680000	Then.
680000	681000	Horizontal.
681000	682000	Is wavelength.
682000	683000	So this is basically.
683000	684000	Light wave.
684000	685000	That.
685000	686000	CMB is probably a place.
686000	687000	Then we will find.
687000	688000	In this universe.
688000	689000	There are two components.
689000	690000	CMB does not count.
690000	691000	There are two.
691000	692000	Very important components.
692000	693000	One is called.
693000	694000	Cosmic.
694000	695000	Optical Background.
695000	696000	It is visible.
696000	697000	Light.
697000	698000	Background.
698000	699000	Then the other part.
699000	700000	Is called.
700000	701000	Cosmic Infrared Background.
701000	702000	Is infrared background.
702000	703000	Then we found.
703000	704000	Then we found.
704000	705000	These two.
705000	706000	Background.
706000	707000	Their amount.
707000	708000	Is almost.
708000	709000	Almost.
709000	710000	So what does this tell us?
710000	711000	Because in this universe.
711000	712000	Horizontal.
712000	713000	They will send out.
713000	714000	Ah.
714000	715000	Point light.
715000	716000	Visible light.
716000	717000	Or.
717000	718000	Infrared light.
718000	719000	That.
719000	720000	Horizontal.
720000	721000	Direct light.
721000	722000	Basically.
722000	723000	Is this component.
723000	724000	Optical Background.
724000	725000	OK.
725000	726000	But.
726000	727000	In this universe.
727000	728000	Star formation.
728000	729000	OK.
729000	730000	About half.
730000	731000	The other half.
731000	732000	About half.
732000	733000	Is not.
733000	735000	We can directly observe.
735000	736000	It is called.
736000	737000	Dusty Star Formation.
737000	738000	What does it mean?
738000	739000	That is.
739000	740000	When you have.
740000	741000	A lot of stars.
741000	742000	In a region.
742000	743000	Then.
743000	744000	A lot of.
744000	745000	New.
745000	746000	Huge stars.
746000	747000	They.
747000	748000	Very soon.
748000	749000	They will age.
749000	750000	And become so-called.
750000	751000	Supernova.
751000	752000	Supernova.
752000	753000	Then.
753000	754000	These.
754000	755000	These huge stars.
755000	756000	They are produced.
756000	757000	They are produced.
757000	758000	A lot of.
758000	759000	Heavy objects.
759000	760000	Then.
760000	761000	They become supernova.
761000	762000	They will explode.
762000	763000	Then.
763000	764000	Those heavy objects.
764000	765000	That is.
765000	766000	That is.
766000	767000	Is talked about.
767000	768000	In the space of the universe.
768000	769000	And.
769000	770000	Heavy objects.
770000	771000	Heavy objects.
771000	772000	For example, carbon.
772000	773000	Metal.
773000	774000	These things.
774000	775000	They will form.
775000	776000	The dust of the star system.
776000	777000	That is.
777000	778000	So-called.
778000	779000	Dust.
779000	780000	That particles.
780000	781000	Is.
781000	782000	Like dust.
782000	783000	Floating.
783000	784000	In space.
784000	785000	That.
785000	786000	Dust.
786000	787000	Will block.
787000	788000	These stars.
788000	789000	Directly.
789000	790000	The light emitted by the star system.
790000	791000	As I said.
791000	792000	It is.
792000	793000	Extraterrestrial light.
793000	794000	Radiation light.
794000	795000	And.
795000	796000	Near-infrared.
796000	797000	That is.
797000	798000	Near-infrared light.
798000	799000	Those dust.
799000	800000	Will absorb.
800000	801000	This part of the light.
801000	802000	Then.
802000	803000	From the perspective of.
803000	804000	The observer on our planet.
804000	805000	That is.
805000	806000	Blocking it.
806000	807000	Blocking that part of the light.
807000	808000	But.
808000	809000	After it is blocked.
809000	810000	The energy is stored.
810000	811000	After it is absorbed.
811000	812000	It will radiate.
812000	813000	These energy.
813000	814000	The energy it absorbs.
814000	815000	Radiate out.
815000	816000	But when it radiates out.
816000	817000	Is.
847000	848000	Absorbed.
848000	849000	So we call.
849000	850000	Dusty star formation.
850000	851000	Or.
851000	852000	Dust.
852000	853000	Hidden star formation.
853000	854000	Or.
854000	855000	Dust obscured star formation.
855000	856000	Anyway.
856000	857000	The meaning is.
857000	858000	These star formation.
858000	859000	Will be.
859000	860000	Dust.

7169040	7171580	As an example, this study paper
7172140	7176180	The green and blue
7176180	7180940	are basically visible light or near-infrared light
7180940	7183740	So what they represent is the horizontal part
7183740	7187060	And the red part is the result of OMAR observation
7187060	7189060	So the result of OMAR observation is basically dust
7189060	7194580	Then they found that the horizontal part is a messy piece
7194580	7195580	That is, they have a wider distribution
7195580	7198860	And their dust is very compact in the middle
7198860	7199860	So what they found is that the horizontal part is a messy piece
