00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hi, everyone. We're going to have the fourth Q&A session this year.

00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
We're honored to have Zhang Yanping here to talk about positive emotions and human relations.

00:22.000 --> 00:33.000
Zhang Yanping is a Ph.D. candidate at UNC-Chapel Hill.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
He has been studying at UNC-Chapel Hill since 2013.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Prior to that, he obtained a Ph.D. and a master's degree in psychology at NTU.

00:45.000 --> 01:04.000
His research focuses on positive psychology, positive emotion, gratitude, self-transcendent emotion, well-being, cultural psychology, and moral psychology.

01:04.000 --> 01:18.000
His research includes emotional communication, interpersonal dynamics, Taiwanese indigenous psychology, prosocial behavior, political participation, and moral judgment.

01:19.000 --> 01:32.000
As you can see, Zhang Yanping's research focuses on social psychology and social participation.

01:32.000 --> 01:48.000
Today, he's going to talk about emotional and interpersonal dynamics.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Let's welcome him.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
First, I'd like to say I'm sorry.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I thought I'd be here next week.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
So the content I'm going to talk about today is a little different from what I wrote for Zhang Yanping.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Wait a minute. I'll close the door.

02:08.000 --> 02:20.000
I was going to prepare a more general content next week.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm going to talk about a lot of projects that I've done before.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I'm going to put them all together and talk about a big direction and what to do next.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
But I got the time wrong.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
So I didn't prepare that.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
So what I'm going to talk about today is one of the projects I was going to cover.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
But I'm going to talk about this project.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
The bad thing is that I'm going to talk about it in more detail.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
So if you have any technical questions, you can just ask.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
The good thing is that I'm not going to talk about the studies I shared last spring.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
So if you've heard of it, you won't repeat it.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
This is the first one. I'm sorry. I got the time wrong.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
The second one.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
The second one is when I was talking about my research interests.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
It sounds like a lot of answers.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It sounds like independent things.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But in fact, it's like this.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Imagine.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm actually interested in how people communicate and understand each other.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
What the other person wants to do.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Who is the other person?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
What is the other person thinking?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Wait a minute.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
In this process of interpersonal communication,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
In the past, people have been pointing out a lot.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
That is to say, our speech and communication.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
In fact, non-verbal communication is a big part of it.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And it's not just a big part.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
In fact, it's a relatively large part.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Compared to verbal communication.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
For example, if I say hello to everyone today.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Thank you very much for coming to my speech.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
But from start to finish.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Then you must find it strange.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
But in fact, that's a constant behavior.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
I didn't even move.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You can just say that my hands are stiff.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
But in fact, it's not.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Just that little action.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
The whole process of communication has changed.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
What I'm interested in is non-verbal communication.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Non-verbal communication is largely related to emotions.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
If I'm angry, I'll just crack my teeth.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Even if I haven't hit you yet.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I also crack my teeth.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
I don't know if you've seen that.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
There is a very famous photo of an Olympic gold medalist.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
He once won a silver medal.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I don't remember his name.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Very famous recently.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Then his mouth is on one side of his mouth.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Because he's very ungrateful.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
That's actually a content performance.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Will it affect

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
If you're talking to your partner.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
It's like this.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
A very ungrateful look.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
There's going to be a problem with communication.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So what I'm interested in is

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Emotions in non-verbal communication.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
How does this have anything to do with moral psychology?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Because it's simple.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Because if I'm talking to my partner today.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Then show a very ungrateful look.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
There will be a fight later.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
There will be a fight.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
It's about morality.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
It's about who's right and who's wrong.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Why do you think I shouldn't do this?

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Why should I listen to you?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
But I give you this ungrateful look.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
You think this is morally wrong.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Where do you see this signal from?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Then next.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
For example, I walked on the street.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Then there was a street friend.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
He showed me some emotional non-verbal communication signals.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
But then it will affect my judgment of his situation.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
For example, this guy deserves it.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
He didn't work hard to get there.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Or do I think he must have been bullied.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So this society is not fair.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
So I have to help him.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
So moral behavior or moral judgment

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
And the next moral behavior

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
It's all in this kind of interpersonal communication.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
It's all in this kind of interaction.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
So it's actually a line that keeps pulling down.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And then finally.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm very interested in culture.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Because that's what we're going to talk about today.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Culture greatly affects how we understand others.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Like this.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
We'll talk about culture later.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
I won't talk about it now.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Anyway, you can imagine it.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Then I started.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Because I have two screens.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
So if you leave a message, I can see it.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
It won't affect my PowerPoint.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
So if you have any questions, you can leave a message.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
You can also speak directly through the microphone.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
It doesn't matter.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So I should be able to see it.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Okay, let's get started.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
First of all, thank you all for coming to listen to me today.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And it's under such late notice.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
So.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I was interrupted just now.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Thank you all.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
In order to express my gratitude to everyone.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
This is what I used in my dissertation proposal defense.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
So it's funny.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Maybe it's weird here.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
That's what I said at the time.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
In order to express my gratitude to everyone.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
Please let me kiss your feet.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
This behavior.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Especially in Taiwan.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
It's very bizarre.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Why would you do this?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
But in India.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I don't know if you know.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
In India.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Kissing someone's feet is the highest expression.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Respect.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
And gratitude.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Grateful for the help of these people.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
And cultivation.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
And incense.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So this behavior is usually for.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
This.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
It's usually for the elders.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Or this monk.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
This monk.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
It's what the monks do.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Of course, it's not limited to these people.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
But it's usually like this.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
This behavior looks very bizarre.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
But in fact, in this part of the world.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
This is what everyone does.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
And don't forget.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
This is not a small island in the Pacific Ocean.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Then there are only a few hundred people.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
This is India.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
There are hundreds of millions of people in India.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Very, very many.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
So it's not a.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
So it's actually not a.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Very rare event.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
But we don't know about these events.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I don't know.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
So for us.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Grateful is to express gratitude.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Just say thank you.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Hug.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
But.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
This thing.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
In the example just now.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
It shows that.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
This is often not the case.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Before we start.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Before analyzing culture.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Let's talk about why.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
So why do we need to study gratitude?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Because.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We know that gratitude is a positive emotion.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I'm going to talk about gratitude today.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Gratitude is a positive emotion.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
When we feel grateful.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
We feel very happy.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Warm.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
So he.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Psychologically.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Comfortable.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
And the study also shows.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Feel positive emotion.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Will make us.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
There are many benefits of mental health.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Come again.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
In addition to mental health.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Physical health.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
The study also shows that.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
When feeling positive emotion.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
All kinds of positive emotions.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Physical health will be better.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Not to mention gratitude.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Because gratitude is usually between people.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I thank a person.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Then a person is good to me.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
He gives me social support.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
So I feel grateful.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Then I might return it later.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
So give him social support.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
The study found that.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Social support.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
For this.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Mortality rate.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Will it hang anyway?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Will people die?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
This prediction.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Very high.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
How high is it?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Higher than smoking.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Then.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Let me see if I can.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Find this information for everyone.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
Take a quick look.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
This is a big one in the past.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
This review paper.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
Then he found that.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Everyone can see me now.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
This powerpoint is affiliation.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Or the one just now.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I can see it.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Affiliation, right?

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
Very good.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
This is.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
In the past, this study is.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
He did it like this.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Everyone can see this.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
There are a lot of bars here.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
This bar.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Is these items on the left.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
For mortality risk.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Prediction.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
This effect size.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
If you don't know what effect size is.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Don't care about it.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
The longer the prediction, the stronger the prediction.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
The less noise.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
The top.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
This pile.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Is a variety of different ways to measure social support.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Then social support.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Or good quality.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
High quality social relationship.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
For the mortality rate.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
The prediction is very high.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
If you have good quality.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
These.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Quality relationship.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Then.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
The mortality rate is relatively low.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Prediction is stronger than smoking.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
And this smoking is not what.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Pick two a day.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
What is it?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Less than 15.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Everyone can see here.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Less than 15.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
So this is a crazy pile.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
You.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
A crazy pile.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
You are not necessarily.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Not necessarily dead.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
It will be faster than those who do not have social support.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Social support is so important.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Then there are below.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
But.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Aren't they consistent?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
You have an error bar.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
What is it called?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
They are not consistent.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Your social relationship.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
After adding the error bar.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Within one sigma.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Consistent with smoking.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I can accept.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
You said alcohol consumption.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
But I don't think smoking is good.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Smoking is right.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
This is not wrong.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
This is true.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
And this.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
You can see this.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
The size of the error bar.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
In fact, it has a lot to do with the method of measurement.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Because if you are today.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Especially when you.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
If you ask about this smoking.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Then you pick a few.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
This can be counted one by one.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
But how to measure the relationship quality.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Is a very tricky question.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
So it will have three different categories.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Then there are several categories.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
The error bar is super big.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Because it is obvious.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
The way of measuring is not very good.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
It's not accurate.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
But generally the idea is.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Social support.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
At least.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
At least it is with.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Smoking.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Can't be distinguished.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Just like this.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Like you don't have friends.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
It's like you smoke every day.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah, that's fine.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
It's not bigger.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
But at least it can't.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Not lower.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
And then alcohol.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
In this place.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Alcohol is a little lower.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
But it.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
It is still lower than social support.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Then there is the flu vaccine.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
The flu vaccine is even lower.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Physical activity is here.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
It's lower.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Then.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Okay, that's it.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
These are the more important ones.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
So.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
What is the point?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
The point is that social support.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
It is for.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Mortality risk.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
The prediction is so strong.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So we.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I want to have a good relationship.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
In the end.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Wait a minute.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I see someone.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Oh.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Is the edge wrong?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Okay.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
The edge is not wrong.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
The edge needs help.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Need help.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
But we just want to talk about this.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
That is to say.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
There is no social support.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
In fact, it is a very.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
A serious problem.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
So it's not just about teenagers.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Teenage smoking is not good.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It's just that teenagers are excluded.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
He might die faster.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Anyway, think about it.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
This is actually quite reasonable.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
This smoking.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
You still have smoking.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
But.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
People who are excluded.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
It's easy to commit suicide in the end.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
So this is really a serious problem.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Okay, finally.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
This past research has been considered.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
It's not research.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
This is a philosopher.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Many philosophers.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Maybe not many.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
But there are a few important philosophers.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
They believe that.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Gratitude is a very important emotion.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Because it brings people together.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
He.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
It is the foundation of our modern society.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Just social exchange.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Or this.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Rational exchange is not enough.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
So it's a bit like a lubricant.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
That's why we need to study gratitude.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
But the problem is.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Just like the example we just saw.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
We're not really sure.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
How to express gratitude.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Or what to do with gratitude.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Because the cultural difference is so big.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
So in this project.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm going to do this.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
The question is.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Cultural variation in good expressions.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Different cultures.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
How to express.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Express gratitude.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
And then.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Especially I will focus on.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
The difference between the United States and Taiwan.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I will explain later.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Why the United States and Taiwan.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Except.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Of course there are some theoretical reasons.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I will explain later.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Another one is because.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm in the United States.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
So it's easy for me to get American samples.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Then I have connections in Taiwan.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
So I get connections in Taiwan.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
This is a.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
This is a practical reason.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I'll talk about this first.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
The theoretical reason.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I'll talk about it later.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
OK.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Then it officially started.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
We've already spent half an hour.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
It's really funny.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Anyway.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
OK.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
So what is gratitude?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Gratitude.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
This emotion.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
We just.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Define it a little bit.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
It's a kind of.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
When we receive help from others.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Or goodwill.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
When goodwill.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Will feel a kind of.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Positive.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Happy.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Joyful.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Warm.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
This feeling.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
This emotion.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
We.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
We call this feeling gratitude.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Or say.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
We call this feeling gratitude.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
It's usually not wrong.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
As for whether.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Only this feeling is called gratitude.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
We don't care about it now.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Don't care about it now.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
In this place.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Gratitude has several characteristics.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Compared with other positive emotions.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
The first one is.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
It's usually.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
In interpersonal relationships.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Produced.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Someone helped me.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Give me a gift.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Or.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Say something nice to me.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Or.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Give me.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Just.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Do something for me.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Teach me something I don't know.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
I feel very grateful.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
This is different from.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Other positive emotions.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
But I'm happy today.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I don't need anyone else.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I feel great.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
This is positive emotion.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
This is joy.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
But this is not grateful.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
You won't because.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm happy.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Feel grateful.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Usually not.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
We can discuss later.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
If you are happy.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Feel grateful.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Why is that?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I think this question is very interesting.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
But basically.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Gratefulness.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Its characteristics are.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Produced directly from interpersonal relationships.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Usually.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
In addition.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
It will have.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Results in interpersonal relationships.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Or effect.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
We receive a person.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Gratefulness.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
We usually.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Repay.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Or at least say thank you.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
This thank you.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Not in the air.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Say it to another person.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
So.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Gratefulness is a very interpersonal.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Emotion.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Relative to.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Other positive emotions.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
So.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
This is.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Later.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
There is a.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Because of these phenomena.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
There is a theory.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Called.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Find.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Find.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Remind.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
And.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Find.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Theory.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
This theory says so.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
He said.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Gratefulness.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
The reason why people.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Have this emotion.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.120
So.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.120
So.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.120
So.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.120
So.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.120
So.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.120
So.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.120
So.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.120
So.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.120
So.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.120
So.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.120
So.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.120
So.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.120
So.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.120
So.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.120
So.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.120
So.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
So.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.120
So.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.120
So.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.120
So.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.120
So.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.120
So.

26:09.120 --> 26:09.920
This is.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.120
he is very famous in recent research.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.120
If you're interested in it, we can talk about it later.

26:15.120 --> 26:18.120
But this is a concept.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.120
This is collective culture.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.120
Everybody image of this dimensions are different.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.120
So what's the result.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.120
The result is.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.120
If in to personalistic culture change.

26:30.120 --> 26:34.120
We all think about change the role of society already and social norm.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.120
It's easy.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.120
It's allowed.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.120
Let them do it.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.120
It's allowed.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.120
But in extremism.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.120
Especially in extreme extremism.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.120
It's very difficult.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.120
Let me give you an example.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.120
You're in Japan.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.120
If you want to quit the black society, you have to cut your finger, right?

26:50.120 --> 26:51.120
You have to.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.120
This is very serious.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.120
There will be very serious consequences.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.120
And usually the result is that you won't quit.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.120
Otherwise you will die.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.120
So you actually didn't quit.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.120
Or you really cut a finger.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.120
Then your whole life changed.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.120
Ok.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.120
Then we put the culture into the emotion.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.120
What's the result?

27:13.120 --> 27:14.120
The result is.

27:15.120 --> 27:19.120
In the left side of the personalistic culture.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.120
It's easy to see.

27:22.120 --> 27:27.120
Everybody's emotional expression is a lot of big body movements.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.120
Then easy to see.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.120
And I say it is easy to see.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.120
It's literally easy to see.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.120
You push that person far away.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.120
Then you see that person is far away.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.120
He is saying hello to you and waving his hand.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.120
It's literally easy to see.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.120
But.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.120
If it is.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.120
This collective culture.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.120
Everyone's expression is relatively small.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.120
That is, he may smile at you.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.120
Even the teeth did not show.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.120
So if you are two meters away.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.120
You just.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.120
This face is.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.120
It looks like a flat one.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.120
Won't move.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.120
So why is that?

27:57.120 --> 27:58.120
Because.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.120
Back to that American.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.120
Back to that American.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.120
The example of panic.

28:04.120 --> 28:06.120
Everyone is really two meters away.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
You can't see.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.120
Then you express.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.120
Express.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.120
Sour.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.120
But if it is.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.120
If you.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.120
On the right.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.120
In Taiwan or Japan.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.120
You have a very special.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.120
Fixed social position.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.120
You don't even need to express.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.120
You know what you want to do.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.120
Others know what you want to do.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.120
You also know what others know what you want to do.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.120
So why do you have to use emotions to communicate?

28:24.120 --> 28:25.120
No need.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.120
The most is to do a little adjustment.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.120
Then you just smile.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.120
A smile is probably enough.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.120
So the result is.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.120
In addition to people.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.120
There are different ways of expression.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
We will also.

28:38.120 --> 28:41.120
There are different ways of understanding other people's expressions.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.120
In fact, this is.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.120
This.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.120
The other side of the board.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.120
I don't need to explain.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
It's easy to understand.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.120
As a result, we call this thing.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.120
Emotional culture.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.120
Every culture.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.120
Or every group of people.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.120
Because of their.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.120
The structure of interpersonal relationships.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.120
The structure of their natural relationships.

29:00.120 --> 29:02.120
Form a set.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.120
A unique way of expression and understanding emotions.

29:04.120 --> 29:06.120
It's called emotional culture.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.120
Emotional culture.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.120
Good.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.120
So.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.120
So we.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.120
In this.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.120
In my research.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.120
In fact, what we are going to study is.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.120
The difference in emotional culture.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.120
Then I will.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.120
I will.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.120
Select the United States and Taiwan.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
The reason is.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.120
I just told you.

29:34.120 --> 29:38.120
The United States is a country with a very high percentage of individualism.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.120
So he is.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.120
One of the dimensions.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.120
Taiwan.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.120
Although not the highest.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
But also.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.120
Among the three highest.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.120
One of them.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.120
South Korea.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.120
South Korea, Japan, Taiwan.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.120
One of them.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.120
Then.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.120
So.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.120
So.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.120
Select these two countries.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.120
He is.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.120
This kind of.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.120
This is called.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.120
Select these two countries.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.120
Can increase us.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.120
In fact, after the increase.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.120
This finding.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.120
This.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.120
Generalizability.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.120
Interpretability.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
It can also be used at a lower cost.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.120
Because we put.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.120
This is equal to.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.120
This contrast.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.120
Pull to the maximum.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.120
We use the lowest cost.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.120
See this effect.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
Good.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.120
The next question is.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.120
If you go to identify.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.120
These two countries.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.120
Then these two countries.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.120
When expressing gratitude.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.120
What kind of behavior will be used?

30:32.120 --> 30:33.120
That has just been said.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.120
Individualism.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.120
This kind of panic country.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.120
They will form.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.120
Is big.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.120
In theory.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.120
They have to form big.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.120
Because big will be effective.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.120
Emotional expression.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.120
And.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.120
Generally.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
More.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.120
Expressive.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.120
Or more.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.120
Observable.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.120
This.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.120
Emotional expression.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.120
In the past.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.120
For gratitude.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.120
In the United States.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.120
At the same time.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.120
Oh.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.120
When people feel grateful.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.120
In addition to saying thank you.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.120
This seems.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.120
There is no cultural difference.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.120
In addition.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.120
Americans will.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.120
Very inclined to.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.120
Body contact.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.120
Including.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.120
Hug.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.120
Including.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.120
Handshake.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.120
Including kiss.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.120
Including high five.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.120
Or slap.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.120
And so on.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.120
In the past.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.120
I found that.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.120
If you are grateful.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.120
Ask him what he wants to do.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.120
He will.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.120
Come out.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.120
That's because it's.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.120
Body.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
Body interaction.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.120
He has bodily contact.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.120
So he will.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.120
In relation to.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.120
Just say thank you.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.120
Or.

31:32.120 --> 31:33.120
Say thank you.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.120
This.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.120
Is the sound.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.120
This.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.120
Sound.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.120
This.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.120
Communicate.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.120
Communicate.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.120
Channel.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.120
But if you add bodily contact.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.120
There will be one more.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.120
The channel.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.120
So.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.120
It's not easy.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.120
Oh.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.120
Is.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.120
This is.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.120
This.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
This is why.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.120
A lot of emotional.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.120
Reason.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.120
So.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.120
Assuming that it will become here.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.120
The United States is relative to Taiwan.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.120
Because of its cultural factors.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.120
So.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.120
When they express their gratitude.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.120
There should be more.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.120
Body.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.120
Behavior.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.120
Conversely.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.120
In fact, it is more special.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.120
Not the other way around.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.120
But on the other hand.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.120
I think this is more special.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.120
Is.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.120
So what is Taiwan going to do?

32:15.120 --> 32:16.120
To express.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.120
In this study.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.120
We put forward a.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.120
Called.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.120
The other.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.120
Question together.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.120
I am now reading.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.120
There is a question.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.120
You read it out.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.120
Because we record.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
Or do you let me read it out.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
You read it out.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.120
OK, I read it out.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.120
page change.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.120
I understand now.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.120
Because of them.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.120
This question is like this.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.120
Is it because they are a panic-type country?

32:51.120 --> 32:53.120
So raise extreme individualism.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.120
Or because of the original

32:54.120 --> 32:55.120
People who want to panic.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.120
It was originally an individualistic feature.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.120
So I want to panic.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.120
OK, this one.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.120
I think it's a very good question.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.120
I'll answer it later.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.120
Because this is not actually.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.120
This is actually not this project.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.120
The question to be discussed.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.120
Right.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.120
In this project.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.120
They are a

33:16.120 --> 33:17.120
Individualistic culture.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.120
In fact, it is a given.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.120
Then this given.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.120
There is also a lot of data knowledge.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.120
So I don't want to discuss it now.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.120
Why did it become like this?

33:25.120 --> 33:26.120
So I don't want to answer the question now.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.120
But we'll talk about it later.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.120
Discussion time.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.120
Let's talk about this question.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.120
What happened to the culture?

33:30.120 --> 33:31.120
I think this question is very interesting.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.120
Can I do this?

33:36.120 --> 33:37.120
OK, back to Taiwan.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.120
How do you express your gratitude to Taiwan?

33:39.120 --> 33:40.120
We found one.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.120
We went to

33:41.120 --> 33:42.120
Translate some books.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.120
Then I found an act.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.120
Called self-improvement.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
English translated into self-improvement.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.120
But this is very strange.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.120
But his Chinese is actually called self-improvement.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.120
Or self-cultivation.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.120
In fact, it is self-cultivation.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.120
Or

33:56.120 --> 33:57.120
Self-cultivation.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.120
Such a thing.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
The definition is like this.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.120
Basically, if you are

34:08.120 --> 34:09.120
A good student.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
Study hard.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.120
If it's a good kid.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.120
You have to respect your parents.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.120
Because these are your social responsibility.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.120
And social role.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.120
Why is this behavior

34:19.120 --> 34:21.120
A possible way to express gratitude?

34:23.120 --> 34:24.120
Because

34:26.120 --> 34:27.120
Big brother.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.120
Why is it

34:31.120 --> 34:32.120
A possible way to express gratitude?

34:32.120 --> 34:33.120
Because we said before.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.120
Gratitude.

34:34.120 --> 34:36.120
The existence of this emotion.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.120
Because it can help

34:39.120 --> 34:41.120
Promote interpersonal relations.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
Then in a

34:44.120 --> 34:45.120
Interpersonal relations.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.120
The structure is already stable.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.120
And it's almost a spoken place.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.120
How do you promote interpersonal relations?

34:52.120 --> 34:53.120
You can't.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.120
You are not expected to build a new relationship.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.120
Or destroy a new relationship.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.120
Or destroy an old relationship.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.120
So what you can do is maintenance.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.120
This is to let the relationship.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.120
In three.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.120
What can be done is to do maintenance.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.120
Or do buy.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.120
No more buy.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.120
No more

35:11.120 --> 35:12.120
Initiate or what.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.120
So this

35:14.120 --> 35:15.120
Buy.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.120
Can do is to put your

35:16.120 --> 35:17.120
Position well.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.120
Because past research has found that.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.120
In this.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.120
I actually.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.120
In our society.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.120
If you put

35:24.120 --> 35:25.120
Own.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.120
This role.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.120
Do it well.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.120
Or when your responsibility is done.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.120
Others will see it.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.120
The result that others can see is that he will come.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.120
Willing to invest in your relationship with you.

35:38.120 --> 35:39.120
And then.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.120
Put your original

35:41.120 --> 35:42.120
This bonding.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.120
Or bond.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.120
Think it's important.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.120
So self-cultivation can actually help.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.120
Relationship.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.120
Stability.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.120
And maintenance.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.120
In our culture.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.120
Give you an example.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.120
This is a big brother.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.120
What am I going to say?

36:01.120 --> 36:02.120
The window on his head.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.120
Why tie a window in that place?

36:09.120 --> 36:10.120
Because this is his job.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.120
This is his job.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.120
His job.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.120
He's playing.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.120
Most people can say.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.120
I must win.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.120
That's because I'm a player.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.120
I just want to win.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.120
I'm cool.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.120
This is not good.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.120
But everyone has.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.120
If there is.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.120
For.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.120
I think everyone is from Taiwan.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.120
So what does it mean to win?

36:26.120 --> 36:27.120
Is.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.120
There should be a little feeling.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.120
That is to say.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.120
Usually we are talking about winning.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.120
I am determined to win.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.120
When you do this thing well.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.120
Usually this thing is our responsibility.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.120
Then we.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.120
For the society.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.120
Or for us.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.120
The surrounding social face.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.120
Including parents.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.120
Or the teacher.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.120
The mayor.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.120
There is a sense of responsibility.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.120
So I'm going to do this thing.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.120
Give him a hard time.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.120
Not just.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.120
It's cool to win.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.120
This is also.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.120
At the same time.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.120
This is what the big brother said.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.120
He said.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.120
I remember in a place.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.120
He said.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.120
He will work hard to play.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.120
Because of fans.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.120
Because of the coach.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.120
Because of teammates.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.120
Not just.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.120
Because it's cool to win.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.120
So he is not.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.120
So he is a grateful expression.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.120
But his result.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.120
On the other hand.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.120
He wants to do his job well.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.120
And then.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.120
This is our data.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.120
I can talk a little bit first.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.120
That is to say.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.120
Indeed.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.120
There are victims.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.120
When he feels grateful.

37:24.120 --> 37:25.120
He will.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.120
I will show up to work.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.120
Hard every day.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.120
During practice.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.120
I don't know.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.120
Is this person an athlete?

37:31.120 --> 37:32.120
Or what?

37:32.120 --> 37:33.120
Because he wrote.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.120
Not very sure.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.120
But you can see.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.120
When you feel grateful.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.120
People really want to.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.120
Do your job well.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.120
So the assumption is.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.120
The assumption is.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
When grateful.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.120
In the United States.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.120
For Americans.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.120
They would like to.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.120
Use physical contact.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.120
To express gratitude.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.120
In Taiwan.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.120
There will be more.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.120
Want this.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.120
Self-improvement impulse.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.120
Is there a problem here?

37:57.120 --> 37:58.120
Is there a problem here?

38:03.120 --> 38:05.120
Because I'm going to talk about the experiment later.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.120
Very fast.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.120
Very short.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.120
Later.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.120
3.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.120
2.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.120
1.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.120
No good.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.120
We continue.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.120
Good.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.120
Good.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.120
There is a problem.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
There is a problem.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.120
Please say.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.120
You can speak into the microphone.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.120
If this is easier.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.120
Can you hear me?

38:33.120 --> 38:34.120
Yes, I can hear you.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.120
In fact, it's good to speak into the microphone.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.120
Because then we can record the voice directly.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.120
Don't have to repeat.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.120
There are others next to you.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.120
Sorry.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.120
I want to ask.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.120
That self-contact.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.120
With that.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.120
Self-improvement.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.120
These two.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.120
Outcome.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.120
There is no conflict.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.120
Not two.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.120
Conflict.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.120
Things.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.120
That.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.120
Why.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
It's possible.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.120
In fact, it will.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.120
Two outcomes.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.120
Is it mixed together?

39:01.120 --> 39:02.120
Oh.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.120
It's possible.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.120
It's possible.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.120
Oh.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.120
What you say is not confident.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.120
Wait a minute.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.120
What are you not confident about?

39:08.120 --> 39:09.120
You say.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.120
He wants to have a physical contact.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.120
You can also want.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.120
Self-improvement.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.120
Or.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.120
There is a kind of behavior.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.120
He is self-improvement at the same time.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.120
Self-contact.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.120
Self-contact.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.120
For example.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.120
You say.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.120
When you say Americans.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.120
They are more.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.120
Feel.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.120
When there is a sense of gratitude.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.120
That.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.120
Taiwanese.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.120
When he feels grateful.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.120
He wants.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.120
Self-improvement.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.120
That.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.120
But.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
Physical contact.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.120
With self-improvement.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.120
These two.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.120
There is no conflict.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.120
So is it possible.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.120
In fact, Americans.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.120
When they are grateful.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.120
In addition to wanting physical contact.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.120
I also want self-improvement.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.120
Or.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.120
Taiwanese.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.120
Feel.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.120
When grateful.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.120
Want self-improvement.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.120
Then.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.120
But at the same time.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.120
I also want to do physical contact.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.120
Hey.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.120
Okay.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.120
Hey.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.120
I think.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.120
I think it's possible.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.120
Both behaviors.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.120
Are motivated.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.120
Right.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.120
Okay.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.120
But why do I think.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.120
So.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.120
Let's talk about it.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.120
Physical contact.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.120
In.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.120
Americans will be higher.

40:03.120 --> 40:04.120
Because.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.120
Physical contact.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.120
Is a big move.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.120
It is often used in.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.120
Initiate.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.120
New relationship.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.120
Because you want.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.120
From.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.120
Originally.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.120
Far.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.120
Social distance.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.120
Become.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.120
Literally.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.120
You can meet this person.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.120
But this.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.120
Relationship.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.120
Change.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.120
In a.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.120
Relationship.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.120
Is in the culture of painting.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.120
In fact, it is not easy to happen.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.120
Not even.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.120
Not allowed.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.120
Like you said.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.120
Thank you very much for your teacher.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.120
Then you go.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.120
Kiss him.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.120
This.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.120
Isn't it weird?

40:41.120 --> 40:42.120
But.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.120
In.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.120
Physical contact.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.120
Is fluid.

40:48.120 --> 40:49.120
Can.

40:49.120 --> 40:50.120
Be allowed to change.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.120
The place.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.120
The relationship between Zhenjing and the teacher.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.120
Maybe it can be allowed.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.120
So I.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.120
These two behaviors.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.120
Is.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.120
When I assume.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.120
Independent assumption.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.120
That is to say.

41:00.120 --> 41:01.120
Not a.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.120
But a.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.120
Do you know what I mean?

41:04.120 --> 41:05.120
It's not a blow.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.120
That is to say.

41:06.120 --> 41:07.120
If your enemy.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.120
The other one will be high.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.120
But I assume the first one.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.120
This.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.120
Physical contact.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.120
Then the United States will be higher than Taiwan.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.120
Then the second is.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.120
Self intimacy.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.120
Taiwan will be higher than the United States.

41:16.120 --> 41:17.120
But it's not a.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.120
Relationship.

41:18.120 --> 41:19.120
Do you know what I'm talking about?

41:19.120 --> 41:20.120
I understand.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.120
Thank you.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.120
it is good.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.120
Oh, by the way.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.120
And then.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.120
I didn't finish this just now.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.120
Self intimacy in the United States.

41:27.120 --> 41:28.120
It's not supposed to be.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.120
I assume it's not very effective.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.120
Relatively ineffective.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.120
Not being used.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.120
The reason is.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.120
Because it's too small.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
You're here.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
Kill yourself.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.120
Do that.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.120
This behavior is very.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.120
Obviously.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.120
Not very.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.120
Noticeable.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.120
The effect is not dirty.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.120
Especially in.

41:42.120 --> 41:44.120
People don't pay attention to others.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.120
What are you doing.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.120
When.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.120
So this effect is not dirty.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.120
This is not very.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.120
There is no.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.120
Function.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.120
It's not functional.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.120
Check these two.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.120
Two assumptions.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.120
Oh, by the way.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.120
We chose these two assumptions.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.120
Is deliberately.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.120
One high.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.120
Another low.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
Another high.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.120
This low.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.120
Make that contrast.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.120
So it is.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.120
Strategically selected.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.120
it is good.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.120
What about study1?

42:13.120 --> 42:14.120
We'll ask the recipient.

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
Write some first.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.120
He was helped.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
Very happy.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.120
Very grateful experience.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.120
And then.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.120
Ask him to do one.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.120
No relevant.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.120
Task.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.120
In this task.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.120
Please write something casually.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.120
He usually.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.120
In everyday life.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.120
Will be used to express gratitude.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.120
He can write one to seven.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.120
He wrote it himself.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.120
See how many he wants to write.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.120
At least one.

42:34.120 --> 42:35.120
At most seven.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.120
But this is with the previous.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.120
The experience of writing is not related.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.120
Come again.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.120
We asked him to go back.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.120
Uh.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.120
The previous writing experience.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.120
And then in front of the camera.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.120
Record a passage.

42:45.120 --> 42:46.120
With.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.120
He felt.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.120
Let him feel grateful.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.120
This person.

42:49.120 --> 42:50.120
Express his gratitude.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.120
And.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.120
That instruction is to say.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.120
Let him.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.120
It's like interacting with this person.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.120
The same.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.120
And then this movie.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.120
It looks like this.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.120
Like this.

43:02.120 --> 43:03.120
So.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.120
Zha Yong said this movie.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.120
If I broadcast it.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.120
There will be a very serious lag.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.120
So I put this.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
This.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.120
The website is pasted in the dialogue window.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.120
Then everyone went to click on it.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.120
Separately.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.120
Tell me after watching.

43:45.120 --> 43:46.120
It should be.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.120
Sorry.

44:05.120 --> 44:15.120
I made a mistake. I didn't cut this video.

44:15.120 --> 44:20.120
You only need to watch 1 minute and a half.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.120
1 minute should be enough.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.120
There's nothing after that.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.120
He doesn't know what to say.

44:35.120 --> 44:45.120
Sorry.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.120
I made a mistake.

44:47.120 --> 44:49.120
You only need to watch 1 minute and a half.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.120
1 minute should be enough.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.120
He doesn't know what to say.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.120
He doesn't know what to say.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.120
This is an example.

44:57.120 --> 44:59.120
This is an example.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.120
This is an example.

45:01.120 --> 45:08.120
This is an example.

45:08.120 --> 45:15.120
After all, he insists that his self-improvement is needed.

45:15.120 --> 45:21.120
Or when he has no one to support him, he argues withkh his facial expression.

45:21.120 --> 45:28.120
Or when he has no one to support him, he argues withkh his facial expression.

45:28.120 --> 45:35.120
Self-improvement is a nonsense.

45:35.120 --> 45:40.120
This is the data we have collected.

45:40.120 --> 45:50.120
Next, we will ask some research assistants to grade these videos.

45:50.120 --> 46:00.120
If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

46:00.120 --> 46:10.120
If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

46:10.120 --> 46:20.120
If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

46:20.120 --> 46:30.120
If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

46:30.120 --> 46:43.120
Lastly, if this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

46:43.120 --> 46:50.120
Lastly, if this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

46:50.120 --> 47:02.120
If this video has reciprocity, this video will get 1 point.

47:02.120 --> 47:17.120
If this video has reciprocity, this video will get 1 point.

47:17.120 --> 47:30.120
So we are going to compare the presence and absence of these videos.

47:30.120 --> 47:34.120
So we are going to compare the presence and absence of these videos.

47:34.120 --> 47:38.120
It's a Logistic Multi-Level Linear Model.

47:38.120 --> 47:43.120
It's a Logistic Multi-Level Linear Model.

47:44.120 --> 48:02.120
In this video, we have written 1-7 different ways of expression.

48:02.120 --> 48:08.120
In this video, we have written 1-7 different ways of expression.

48:08.120 --> 48:27.120
Based on these, we can classify the body contact, self-improvement, reciprocity.

48:27.120 --> 48:36.120
Based on these, we can classify the body contact, self-improvement, reciprocity.

48:37.120 --> 48:43.120
There are two of them are self-improvement, and three of them are body contact.

48:43.120 --> 48:52.120
My self-improvement is 1 out of 3, so it's 33%.

48:52.120 --> 49:03.120
My body contact is 50%, because it's 50% of my expression toolbox.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.120
Do you understand?

49:04.120 --> 49:06.120
So we can classify the data in this way.

49:06.120 --> 49:16.120
In this task, we have self-improvement, body contact, and reciprocity.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.120
We use uTest to analyze the data.

49:19.120 --> 49:23.120
You don't need to care about the test, it's just an analysis of the data.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.120
Let's see the result.

49:28.120 --> 49:31.120
In this result, there is a bar.

49:31.120 --> 49:35.120
This bar is the video data.

49:35.120 --> 49:43.120
The box above is the task data.

49:43.120 --> 49:49.120
Do you know what p-value is?

49:49.120 --> 49:52.120
If you don't know, just say you don't know.

49:58.120 --> 50:02.120
3, 2, 1

50:02.120 --> 50:04.120
Ok, everyone knows.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.120
Let's say everyone knows what p-value is.

50:12.120 --> 50:17.120
In the body contact, the blue bar is America, and the red bar is Taiwan.

50:17.120 --> 50:24.120
I don't like the red bar is Taiwan, but I didn't think about it when I chose the color.

50:25.120 --> 50:30.120
The Americans also don't know why I don't like the red bar.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.120
Anyway, it's red.

50:32.120 --> 50:38.120
As you can see, the body contact is higher than Taiwan in general touch.

50:38.120 --> 50:41.120
You can't see the error bar here, but it's higher.

50:41.120 --> 50:44.120
The hug is also high.

50:45.120 --> 50:56.120
In the writing data, the Americans also mentioned more body contact-related methods.

50:56.120 --> 51:00.120
But this one is close, p-value is 0.055.

51:02.120 --> 51:04.120
Let's look at self-improvement.

51:04.120 --> 51:08.120
The results of self-improvement are also close, but now the direction is all the opposite.

51:08.120 --> 51:14.120
Taiwan is better at self-improvement than the U.S.

51:14.120 --> 51:20.120
I don't know how they do it, but at least they say they do it well.

51:20.120 --> 51:37.120
There are more videos explaining that self-improvement is a way of expression.

51:37.120 --> 51:43.120
In the writing data, the Americans also mentioned more self-improvement-related methods.

51:44.120 --> 51:50.120
Finally, there is no noticeable difference in reciprocity or reciprocating kindness.

51:50.120 --> 51:59.120
Even though the blue bar is higher, but there is no noticeable difference.

51:59.120 --> 52:05.120
The results support our assumption.

52:05.120 --> 52:12.120
Taiwan is better at self-improvement than the U.S.

52:12.120 --> 52:14.120
The U.S. uses more body contact.

52:14.120 --> 52:16.120
There is no noticeable difference in reciprocity.

52:16.120 --> 52:22.120
The background information of the victim is not important.

52:22.120 --> 52:25.120
The only thing I want to talk about is this.

52:26.120 --> 52:28.120
In this study,

52:28.120 --> 52:48.120
Taiwan is in NTSU, National Taiwan Sport University.

52:48.120 --> 52:57.120
The victim is in NTSU, and the U.S. is in UNC.

52:57.120 --> 52:59.120
This will cause a problem.

52:59.120 --> 53:01.120
I don't know if you can see my slide.

53:01.120 --> 53:05.120
The U.S. is in the U.S., and the Taiwanese are in Taiwan.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.120
This will cause a problem.

53:07.120 --> 53:14.120
This is because the two groups of people have different cultures, so they have different behaviors and preferences.

53:14.120 --> 53:20.120
Or because they were experimented in different places.

53:20.120 --> 53:23.120
Or because they were experimented in different places, so they have different languages.

53:23.120 --> 53:28.120
If the U.S. people can understand Chinese, they will also behave like Taiwanese.

53:28.120 --> 53:31.120
Or do the same in Taiwan.

53:31.120 --> 53:33.120
This is a confounding.

53:33.120 --> 53:41.120
In Study 2, a methodological change is that we collect information from Taiwanese in the U.S.

53:41.120 --> 53:47.120
We collect information from Taiwanese in the U.N.C.

53:47.120 --> 53:54.120
We use English, so there is no linguistic priming.

53:54.120 --> 54:02.120
We were asked by a reviewer, how do you know this has anything to do with gratitude?

54:02.120 --> 54:05.120
For example, if you ask a Taiwanese, what are you doing right now?

54:05.120 --> 54:09.120
You don't need any background information.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.120
You will see that Taiwanese are more self-improving.

54:11.120 --> 54:14.120
They are self-improving. They are studying and working all day.

54:14.120 --> 54:17.120
The U.S. people will report to the U.N.C. at any time.

54:17.120 --> 54:22.120
The reviewer will ask, how do you know this is not a baseline difference?

54:22.120 --> 54:29.120
How does this have anything to do with gratitude?

54:29.120 --> 54:34.120
Another example, when we are happy, we watch a comedy.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.120
It's funny. We bump into each other.

54:37.120 --> 54:39.120
Look at the NBA players.

54:39.120 --> 54:42.120
One shot, three points.

54:42.120 --> 54:44.120
They bump into each other.

54:44.120 --> 54:47.120
This has nothing to do with gratitude.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.120
I bumped into him.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.120
It's not his fault.

54:51.120 --> 54:53.120
Maybe he passed the ball to me.

54:53.120 --> 54:55.120
Not necessarily.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.120
So body contact doesn't have to happen in gratitude.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.120
There may be other positive emotions.

54:59.120 --> 55:04.120
On the other hand, is self-improvement possible in other positive emotions?

55:04.120 --> 55:06.120
It's possible.

55:06.120 --> 55:10.120
When I feel that I am more powerful, I am more capable.

55:10.120 --> 55:14.120
Am I theoretically more capable of self-improvement?

55:14.120 --> 55:16.120
It's possible.

55:16.120 --> 55:18.120
So self-improvement may not necessarily be gratitude.

55:18.120 --> 55:20.120
It's just a general positivity.

55:20.120 --> 55:24.120
This positivity indicates that I have more resources now to do this.

55:24.120 --> 55:29.120
Another thing we need to control in Study 2 is

55:33.120 --> 55:35.120
another positive emotion.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.120
We need to show that this difference

55:39.120 --> 55:41.120
is not entirely caused by gratitude,

55:41.120 --> 55:43.120
but gratitude has a special effect

55:43.120 --> 55:45.120
on the cultural difference.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.120
So we ask the reader

55:47.120 --> 55:51.120
when a stranger or a close other

55:51.120 --> 55:53.120
feels grateful

55:53.120 --> 55:55.120
or amused

55:55.120 --> 55:57.120
by our positive emotions.

55:57.120 --> 55:59.120
There are 4 conditions.

55:59.120 --> 56:01.120
2x2

56:01.120 --> 56:03.120
4 conditions

56:03.120 --> 56:05.120
The reader will answer 4 times

56:05.120 --> 56:07.120
in different combinations.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.120
The reader will ask

56:11.120 --> 56:13.120
if you want to thank this person

56:13.120 --> 56:15.120
verbally

56:15.120 --> 56:17.120
or touch that person

56:17.120 --> 56:19.120
for whom you feel thankful.

56:19.120 --> 56:21.120
This is body contact.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.120
Repay the person.

56:23.120 --> 56:25.120
This is reciprocity.

56:25.120 --> 56:27.120
Pay you forward means

56:27.120 --> 56:29.120
you are good to me,

56:29.120 --> 56:31.120
I am good to the third person.

56:31.120 --> 56:33.120
Socialize with the person.

56:33.120 --> 56:35.120
This is another thing that was mentioned in Study 1.

56:35.120 --> 56:37.120
He is good to me.

56:37.120 --> 56:39.120
I feel grateful.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.120
Let's go shopping with him tomorrow morning.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.120
In this behavior,

56:43.120 --> 56:45.120
shopping does not really do anything to this person.

56:45.120 --> 56:47.120
But this is a socialization behavior.

56:47.120 --> 56:49.120
Let's play together.

56:49.120 --> 56:51.120
We think this behavior cannot be

56:51.120 --> 56:53.120
because it does not

56:53.120 --> 56:55.120
have a direct benefit to the other person.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.120
So it cannot be reciprocity.

56:57.120 --> 56:59.120
He did not pay you forward because there is no third person.

56:59.120 --> 57:01.120
Will there be touch? I don't know.

57:01.120 --> 57:03.120
It's not verbally thanks.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.120
Verbal thanks means I will thank him.

57:05.120 --> 57:07.120
So he is isolated.

57:07.120 --> 57:09.120
Finally, improve yourself.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.120
This is self-improvement.

57:11.120 --> 57:13.120
So how many questions does the reader answer?

57:13.120 --> 57:15.120
2x2x123456

57:15.120 --> 57:17.120
Answer 24 questions.

57:17.120 --> 57:19.120
Finally,

57:19.120 --> 57:21.120
for each behavior,

57:21.120 --> 57:23.120
for each emotion,

57:23.120 --> 57:25.120
for each relationship,

57:25.120 --> 57:27.120
we ask two different questions.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.120
The first one is

57:29.120 --> 57:31.120
how likely you are

57:31.120 --> 57:33.120
to do this behavior.

57:33.120 --> 57:35.120
This is the likelihood

57:35.120 --> 57:37.120
and preference of their behavior.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.120
The other one is

57:39.120 --> 57:41.120
whether you want to do it or not.

57:41.120 --> 57:43.120
But generally, if someone does it,

57:43.120 --> 57:45.120
do you think this behavior is bizarre?

57:45.120 --> 57:47.120
Can you understand?

57:47.120 --> 57:49.120
This is the second question.

57:49.120 --> 57:51.120
Is it understandable?

57:51.120 --> 57:53.120
OK.

57:53.120 --> 57:55.120
What's the question?

57:55.120 --> 57:57.120
The reader did a lot of rating.

58:01.120 --> 58:03.120
3, 2, 1

58:03.120 --> 58:05.120
Let's assume there is no question.

58:05.120 --> 58:07.120
Let's look at the result.

58:09.120 --> 58:11.120
This analysis is tricky

58:11.120 --> 58:13.120
because we don't compare

58:13.120 --> 58:15.120
the scores of Taiwanese and Americans.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.120
In the past,

58:17.120 --> 58:19.120
I found that

58:19.120 --> 58:21.120
this kind of rating scale

58:21.120 --> 58:23.120
is problematic in cross-cultural research.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.120
Because some people

58:25.120 --> 58:27.120
such as Japanese, Taiwanese,

58:27.120 --> 58:29.120
and South Korean

58:29.120 --> 58:31.120
will deliberately avoid

58:31.120 --> 58:33.120
extreme scores.

58:33.120 --> 58:35.120
For example,

58:35.120 --> 58:37.120
if the score is 1 to 9,

58:37.120 --> 58:39.120
we will cut it off.

58:39.120 --> 58:41.120
If the score is 2 to 8,

58:41.120 --> 58:43.120
we will cut it off.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.120
No matter what the score is,

58:45.120 --> 58:47.120
we will cut it off.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.120
Why?

58:49.120 --> 58:51.120
Because

58:51.120 --> 58:53.120
if you think about

58:53.120 --> 58:55.120
the world of Tai Chi,

58:55.120 --> 58:57.120
or the so-called

58:57.120 --> 58:59.120
bias thinking,

58:59.120 --> 59:01.120
if I ask you

59:01.120 --> 59:03.120
if you think you are smart,

59:03.120 --> 59:05.120
you might say

59:05.120 --> 59:07.120
you think you are smart,

59:07.120 --> 59:09.120
but are you extremely smart?

59:09.120 --> 59:11.120
You might say no.

59:11.120 --> 59:13.120
Then you might think

59:13.120 --> 59:15.120
there are smart people in the world.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.120
But are you really stupid?

59:17.120 --> 59:19.120
Probably not.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.120
There are probably more stupid people in the world.

59:21.120 --> 59:23.120
So you go down to the bottom,

59:23.120 --> 59:25.120
but you don't see the bottom,

59:25.120 --> 59:27.120
and you go back.

59:27.120 --> 59:29.120
So in such a

59:29.120 --> 59:31.120
extremist culture,

59:31.120 --> 59:33.120
people tend to avoid extreme scores.

59:33.120 --> 59:35.120
Any score is.

59:35.120 --> 59:37.120
Any score is.

59:37.120 --> 59:39.120
Any score is.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.120
So we made a

59:43.120 --> 59:45.120
adjustment here.

59:45.120 --> 59:47.120
We standardize the scores

59:47.120 --> 59:49.120
of Taiwan and the US.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.120
We standardize the scores of Taiwan and the US.

59:51.120 --> 59:53.120
We only keep within cultural variation.

59:53.120 --> 59:55.120
Then we do

59:55.120 --> 59:57.120
the principal component analysis.

59:57.120 --> 59:59.120
the principal component analysis.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.120
No matter what you know,

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.120
I don't need to explain.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.120
I don't need to explain.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.120
I will explain how to interpret the result later.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.120
Then we put these six

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.120
behaviors

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.120
in each culture.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.120
So the scores of each culture

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120
are standardized to 0.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.120
mean to 0, standard deviation to 1.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.120
mean to 0, standard deviation to 1.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.120
Then for these six scores, we run the principal component analysis.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.120
Then for these six scores, we run the principal component analysis.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.120
Then we found that

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.120
these six scores

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.120
can form two components.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.120
can form two components.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.120
With these two components,

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.120
we can effectively summarize

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.120
the variation of these six behaviors.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.120
the variation of these six behaviors.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.120
We named these two components

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.120
We named these two components

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.120
expression and affiliation.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.120
You will know why later.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.120
But let's talk about how to interpret the result.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.120
But let's talk about how to interpret the result.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.120
As you can see,

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.120
there are six behaviors.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.120
there are six behaviors.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.120
The inner circle of the radar

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.120
is negative 0.5 to 0.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.120
is negative 0.5 to 0.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.120
For example,

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.120
if reciprocating kindness is 0,

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.120
if reciprocating kindness is 0,

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.120
it has nothing to do with the expression component.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.120
it has nothing to do with the expression component.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.120
If it is negative,

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.120
it is completely negative.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.120
If the component is higher,

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.120
the reciprocating kindness will be lower.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.120
The middle circle is 0 to 0.5.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.120
The middle circle is 0 to 0.5.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.120
The outer circle is 0.5 to 1.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.120
The outer circle is 0.5 to 1.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.120
It's a strong link.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.120
It's a strong link.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.120
There are six behaviors.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.120
There are six behaviors.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.120
The blue line is the same as the United States.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.120
The blue line is the same as the United States.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.120
For the United States,

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.120
the expression component

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.120
can summarize

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.120
can summarize

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.120
some behavior variations.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.120
The most is verbal acknowledgement.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.120
It's almost equal to verbal acknowledgement.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.120
Perfect correlation.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.120
There is also reciprocating kindness.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.120
There is also reciprocating kindness.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.120
These three behaviors

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.120
can be used on the spot.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.120
can be used on the spot.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.120
Body contact

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.120
has a high loading.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.120
For the Americans,

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.120
for the Americans,

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120
for the Americans,

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.120
the use of body contact

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.120
is similar to verbal acknowledgement.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.120
is similar to verbal acknowledgement.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.120
is similar to verbal acknowledgement.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.120
Self-improvement is almost zero.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.120
Self-improvement is almost zero.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.120
But if you look at the results in Taiwan,

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.120
But if you look at the results in Taiwan,

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.120
verbal acknowledgement,

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.120
reciprocating kindness,

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.120
and pay you forward are all outside the circle.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.120
We will use these three behaviors

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.120
to express gratitude.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.120
We all know in our lives.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.120
But body contact is now

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.120
I remember this point 3.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.120
A very awkward position.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.120
A very awkward position.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.120
But at the same time,

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.120
self-improvement has gone out.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.120
Self-improvement

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.120
Self-improvement

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.120
is similar to

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.120
verbal acknowledgement,

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.120
pay you forward,

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.120
and reciprocating kindness.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.120
We see that

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120
these three behaviors

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.120
verbal acknowledgement, pay you forward,

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.120
and reciprocating kindness

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.120
are not cultural differences.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.120
But

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.120
But

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.120
the two behaviors

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.120
self-improvement and body contact

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.120
the two behaviors

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.120
are different.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.120
The two behaviors are different.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.120
This component is named

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.120
expression

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.120
because it is

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.120
derived from verbal acknowledgement

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120
and reciprocating kindness.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.120
derived from verbal acknowledgement

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.120
It is very expressive.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.120
On the other hand,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.120
the second component

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.120
is socializing.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.120
It is more interactive.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.120
It is more interactive.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.120
It is more interactive.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.120
The two cultures are relatively high.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.120
The two cultures are relatively high.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.120
Interestingly,

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.120
if the component 1

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.120
if the component 1

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.120
is not explained,

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.120
it will be pushed here, including socializing.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.120
For both cultures, socializing is pushed here.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.120
For both cultures, socializing is pushed here.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.120
We call it affiliation.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.120
But for Americans,

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.120
self-improvement is pushed here.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120
Body contact is negative.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.120
Body contact is negative.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120
For Taiwanese,

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.120
For Taiwanese,

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.120
self-improvement is not

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.120
under the same category as socializing.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.120
self-improvement is not under the same category as socializing.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.120
But body contact is.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.120
You can imagine.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.120
You can imagine.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.120
You can imagine.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.120
You can imagine.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.120
When do we have contact with others?

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.120
When do we have contact with others?

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.120
Only in a long-term, intimate relationship.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.120
Only in a long-term, intimate relationship.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.120
But when can we do self-improvement?

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.120
When can we do self-improvement?

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.120
When it's time to do it.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.120
So it is expression.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.120
So it is expression.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.120
But affiliation-wise,

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.120
body contact is the concept.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.120
But in contrast,

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.120
body contact is the concept.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.120
body contact is the concept.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.120
What to do is your own business.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.120
But for long-term relationship,

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.120
they will do self-improvement.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.120
they will do self-improvement.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.120
But it's not in the same context.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.120
But it's not in the same context.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.120
Last one.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.120
Last one.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.120
Last one.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.120
Excluding asking people in these two cultures,

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.120
asking people in these two cultures,

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.120
can you understand?

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.120
If someone did it,

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.120
if someone did it,

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.120
It was not very well understood.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.120
The picture you see is the part of understanding.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.120
The picture you see is the part of understanding.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.120
There is little difference between the two cultures,

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.120
Especially the expression,

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.120
the Americans and Taiwanese

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.120
almost overlap.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.120
This shows that Americans

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.120
can understand what self-improvement is.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.120
It can be used to express gratitude.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.120
It can be used to express gratitude.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.120
Taiwan is OK.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.120
Taiwan is OK.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.120
But naturally,

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.120
it's not that the two cultures can't understand each other.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.120
It's just that their behavior choices are different.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.120
It's just that their behavior choices are different.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120
The implication of this is that

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.120
the expression of gratitude

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.120
The expression of gratitude

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.120
is a conscious behavior.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.120
is a conscious behavior.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.120
In front of me,

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.120
I can think of these options,

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.120
and I consciously choose this

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.120
and I consciously choose this

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.120
because it fits my context

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.120
or my culture or cultural context.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.120
or my cultural context.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.120
My options are only some.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.120
My options are only some.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.120
Only in my culture.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.120
Only in my culture.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.120
Let's summarize it.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.120
Verbal acknowledgment,

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.120
reciprocal kindness, and paying you forward

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.120
are the same in both cultures.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.120
But bodily contact

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.120
But bodily contact

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.120
Bye-bye.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120
Bye-bye.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.120
Sky is gone.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.120
Sky is gone.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.120
Sky is gone.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.120
Sky is gone.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.120
In the US,

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.120
bodily contact

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.120
and these three universal behaviors

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120
and these three universal behaviors

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.120
are tied together,

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.120
but there is no self-improvement.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.120
On the other hand, in Taiwan,

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.120
self-improvement is tied,

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.120
but bodily contact is not.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.120
What is implication?

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.120
What is implication?

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.120
We call it universal.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.120
We call it universal.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.120
Obviously,

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.120
emotions are expressed

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.120
in different cultures.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.120
Is there anything

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.120
in cross-cultural

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.120
that is universal?

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.120
that is universal?

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.120
In our research,

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.120
although the behavior is different,

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.120
although the behavior is different,

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.120
but the function,

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.120
at least gratitude,

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.120
is the same.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.120
It is to build or maintain relationships.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.120
Gratitude is used to support

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.120
interpersonal relationships.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.120
Just because interpersonal relationships

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.120
are in different cultures,

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.120
in different structures,

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.120
in different ways,

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.120
so you have to fit the relational structure

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.120
to use different relationships.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.120
So functional universal exists.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.120
If you keep this function

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.120
in the second line,

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.120
if you make this function

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.120
a constant,

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.120
then you have to adjust the behavior

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.120
to fit the culture.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.120
That's what we want to say.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.120
Thank you.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.120
Any questions?

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.120
Let me answer the question.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.120
Is it because the country is

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.120
confused, so it develops extreme

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.120
individualism, or

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.120
is it because the people in the country

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.120
have the characteristics of individualism?

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.120
I think this question can be divided into

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.120
two levels.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.120
The first is that

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.120
they are such a country,

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.120
so they develop such a culture.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.120
Then you dig up the culture,

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.120
it may not be individualism,

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.120
it may not be confusion.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.120
So is it the current situation

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.120
that affects their culture,

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.120
or is it the current culture

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.120
that affects their current situation?

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.120
Or is it a specific culture,

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.120
or is it American culture?

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.120
Is it because they are in a

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.120
confused environment,

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.120
or is it American culture?

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.120
Is it a specific case,

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.120
or is it a general culture?

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.120
Let me make it simple.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.120
It's the United States.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.120
I think both exist in the United States.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.120
The history of the United States

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.120
is about immigration.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.120
Immigration to a new continent.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.120
So it's a country

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.120
that's in a state of confusion.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.120
In such a natural environment,

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.120
as I just argued,

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.120
you need to form

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.120
a form of individualism

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.120
and a way of

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.120
living

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.120
to create

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.120
a new natural environment,

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.120
a new continent.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.120
So it looks like

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.120
it's possible for

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.120
confusion to form individualism.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.120
But at the same time,

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.120
why did Mayflower

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.120
come to the United States in the first place?

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.120
Because of religious reform.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.120
What is religious reform?

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.120
It's when churches

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.120
form a rigid

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.120
social organization.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.120
They want to

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.120
connect with God.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.120
Is this religious reform?

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.120
No, it's not.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.120
Mayflower is the UK.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.120
But if we

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.120
look at new religion reform

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.120
it's a form of individualism.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.120
Individualism

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.120
forces people to

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.120
live in a state of confusion.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.120
That's where the UK came from.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.120
But what I'm talking about

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.120
is American culture and natural environment.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.120
If you

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.120
dig it up

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.120
into an empty X,

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.120
what would it be?

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.120
If you dig it up into an empty X,

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.120
what would it be?

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.120
I think both are possible.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.120
Maybe

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.120
we need more

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.120
evidence to support it.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.120
But at least

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.120
in East Asian culture,

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.120
I think both

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.120
are possible.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.120
A study found that

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.120
in places where

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.120
there's a flood,

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.120
compared to

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.120
wheat fields,

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.120
it's easier to

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.120
form collectivism.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.120
Why?

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.120
Because you need to

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.120
work with others.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.120
So natural environment

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.120
creates culture.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.120
On the other hand,

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.120
people who are

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.120
used to collectivism

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.120
will they

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.120
enhance the environment?

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.120
I think they will.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.120
It's simple.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.120
You can't

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.120
just let it go.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.120
It's been happening in history.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.120
So

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.120
I think the UK-UK relationship

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.120
is also possible, at least in East Asian culture.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.120
But I can't say

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:55.120
how far it can go.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.120
I've answered this question.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.120
Here's another question.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.120
There's a small question.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.120
Have you seen a similar research

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.120
but in European culture?

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.120
I'm curious

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.120
if European culture is similar to

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.120
American or Asian culture.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.120
Some European cultures

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.120
are similar.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.120
I've seen

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.120
a similar article.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.120
It's from the UK.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.120
The result

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.120
is my interpretation.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.120
The UK's gratitude

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.120
is stuck

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.120
in the American way

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.120
and the

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.120
collectivism way.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.120
I think the article

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.120
is funny.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.120
It's like

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.120
all people see white people

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.120
as the same race,

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.120
but all research is about Americans.

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.120
All people see

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.120
Western culture as the same race,

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.120
but it's all about Americans.

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.120
He can't stand it

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.120
because he's British.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.120
Fukuyama

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.120
talks about

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.120
trust between people

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.120
as a

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.120
social capital.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.120
Social capital is

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.120
something that can be fulfilled.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.120
Let me put it this way.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.120
He thinks people's trust

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.120
can be fulfilled.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.120
He's a

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.120
Japanese-American.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.120
His first name is

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.120
Francis.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.120
He's American.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.120
He has a strong Japanese identity.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.120
He thinks

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.120
culture should be divided.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.120
He looks at Italy,

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.120
Germany,

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.120
France, South and North.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.120
He divides them.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.120
His argument is

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.120
that

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.120
he divides

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.120
several different collectivism.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.120
At least he thinks

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.120
Italy,

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.120
South and

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.120
Mexico,

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.120
and some South American countries

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.120
are collectivism.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.120
I don't know if you have

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.120
friends in Mexico.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.120
Their family concept is anti-Semitism.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.120
It's like

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.120
East Asian culture.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.120
They also have

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.120
honor culture.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.120
If you insult

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.120
my family,

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.120
I'll kill you.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.120
If you insult my family,

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.120
I'll kill you.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.120
But I have to kill you.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.120
You can see this

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.120
in the UK

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.120
and Mexico.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.120
That's right.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.120
Fashion Fury is like this.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.120
Everything is for family.

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.120
When I was in class,

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.120
I told my students

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.120
that it's quite special.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.120
You're investigating

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.120
a car thief.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.120
You can catch him.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.120
But you can't.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.120
He felt the strong family bond.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.120
So he

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.120
stole a car.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.120
That's Fashion Fury.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.120
So

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.120
there's

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.120
another thing

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.120
I want to say.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.120
We didn't

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.120
push it

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.120
to individualism

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.120
and collectivism.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.120
When we talk about

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.120
individualism, we're talking about

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.120
America.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.120
Collectivism is like

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.120
Taiwan, Japan, Korea.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.120
We don't know

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.120
whether other countries

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:39.120
can fit

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.120
this

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.120
dimensionalized

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.120
distinction.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.120
So I'm careful

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.120
comparing Taiwan and America.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.120
These two specific

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.120
entities.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.120
We're not

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.120
drawing two dots on a dimension.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120
But when we draw,

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.120
we still follow

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.120
the past research.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.120
It's a limitation.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.120
Any other questions?

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.120
Hello.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.120
Hello.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.120
You go first.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.120
The self-improvement

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.120
you mentioned earlier.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.120
Is it

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.120
a common

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.120
professional term?

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.120
Or

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.120
is it special?

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.120
It sounds

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.120
like

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.120
you're grateful

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.120
for the self-improvement.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.120
It sounds like

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.120
you want to do

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.120
what you want

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.120
according to your expectations.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.120
You want to satisfy

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:51.120
your partner's expectations.

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.120
But what I do

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.120
when I satisfy

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.120
my partner's expectations

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120
doesn't mean

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.120
I'm improving something.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.120
Do you understand?

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.120
I understand.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.120
In this case,

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.120
your research still

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.120
classified as self-improvement.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.120
But in fact,

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.120
it's not improving anything.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.120
It's just satisfying

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.120
your partner's expectations.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.120
That's what I mean.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.120
I agree.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.120
From this perspective,

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.120
it's still

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.120
satisfying your partner's expectations.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.120
It's like reciprocity.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.120
But interestingly,

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.120
if we ask

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.120
what you expect

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.120
from your partner,

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.120
you expect

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.120
a better

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.120
social role.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.120
For example,

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.120
if my mom wants me to become

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.120
a better student,

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.120
or she wants me to repay her.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.120
There's a cultural difference

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.120
in expectation.

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.120
If you say

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.120
you satisfy your partner's expectations,

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.120
but we found

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.120
cultural differences.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.120
You're just

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.120
using the difference

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.120
in expectation

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.120
to explain.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.120
Otherwise,

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.120
the result won't be there.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.120
I think

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120
your question is

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.120
interesting and good.

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.120
Because it shows

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.120
that

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.120
on the surface,

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.120
there's a cultural difference

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.120
in appreciation

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.120
and universality.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.120
But

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.120
we need to dig deeper.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.120
For example,

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.120
you think the expectation is the same,

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.120
but the result

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.120
is different.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.120
I can accept that.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.120
Do you have an answer?

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.120
Yes.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.120
There's an interesting point

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.120
about expectation.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.120
I didn't expect that.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.120
I have another question.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.120
You said that

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.120
appreciation can help

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.120
interpersonal relationships.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.120
Am I right?

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.120
Yes.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.120
When you talk about interpersonal relationships,

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.120
you need to think about yourself

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.120
and your partner.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.120
When I appreciate my partner,

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.120
it's just a one-way relationship.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.120
It's not about

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.120
how my partner reacts to my appreciation.

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.120
If it's not about

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.120
how my partner reacts to my appreciation,

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.120
it's hard to talk about

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.120
the impact of appreciation

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.120
on interpersonal relationships.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.120
I only talked about one-way relationship.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.120
I didn't talk about

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.120
how my partner reacts to my appreciation.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.120
I can't talk about

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.120
how my relationship

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.120
with my partner

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.120
will improve

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.120
after the whole process.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.120
If we need to think about

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.120
how to improve

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.120
interpersonal relationships,

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.120
we need to think about

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.120
how to improve

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.120
our partner's reaction.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.120
How to design

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.120
such a research?

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.120
I think

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.120
this is a

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.120
good question.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.120
I think

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.120
this is a good question.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.120
It sounds like

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.120
it's a compliment.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.120
I think

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.120
it's a good question.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.120
As I said before,

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.120
I totally agree with you.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.120
As I said before,

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.120
emotion culture

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.120
has a set of

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.120
ways of expression.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.120
In addition to a group of people

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.120
who are used to this way of expression,

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.120
at the same time,

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.120
a group of people

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.120
who can understand

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.120
their partner's way of expression

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.120
can achieve

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.120
their goal.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.120
Otherwise, it's useless.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.120
So,

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.120
in this project,

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.120
in addition to the difference in expression,

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.120
we also assume

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.120
the difference in perception.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.120
As you said,

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.120
people who receive appreciation

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.120
can interpret it

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.120
as expected,

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.120
and turn this interpretation

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.120
into

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.120
a friendly signal

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.120
to promote the relationship.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.120
We are doing this now.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.120
We are doing this now.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.120
This should not be

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.120
an answer to your question.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.120
I just said I agree.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.120
We are doing this now.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.120
But I understand.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.120
As you said,

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.120
when we study

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.120
how a person expresses

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.120
his appreciation,

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.120
it also represents

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.120
appreciation.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.120
I can understand.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.120
Thank you.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.120
Okay.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.120
Thank you, everyone.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.120
We are running out of time.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.120
But it was a great talk.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.120
Thank you for your questions.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.120
Thank you again to our speaker,

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.120
Zhang Yanping.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.120
Thank you, everyone.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.120
Now, it's my turn to share the screen.

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.120
Wait for me.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.120
Now,

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.120
can you see

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.120
my screen?

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.120
Can you?

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.120
I can see myself.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120
So,

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.120
you can see Zhang Yanping's website, right?

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.120
Can you?

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.120
Okay.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.120
If you have any questions,

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120
you can go to this website,

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.120
sites.google.com

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.120
slash view

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.120
slash ypzhang.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.120
This is Zhang Yanping's website.

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.120
If you have any questions,

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.120
or if you want to collaborate,

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.120
you can contact him.

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.120
Thank you again, Zhang Yanping.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.120
That's all for today.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.120
Thank you, everyone.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.120
Bye-bye.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.120
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.120
Next week, it's my turn to talk.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.120
The topic is

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.120
quite technical.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.120
Next week, it's cryogenic engineering

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.120
in various

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.120
advanced experiments.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.120
See you next week.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.120
Bye-bye.
