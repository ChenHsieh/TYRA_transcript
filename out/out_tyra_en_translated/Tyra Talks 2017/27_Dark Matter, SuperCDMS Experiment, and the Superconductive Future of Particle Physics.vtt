WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Okay

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Oh

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
F

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Oh, I forgot

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Share

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Share screen

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Wow

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Okay

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
is

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Dark Matter Super CDMS

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
which is what I'm doing right now

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
and the Super Conductive Future

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
of Particle Physics

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
which is

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
what I'm doing right now

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Okay, next page

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
The topic I'm going to talk about today

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
will be divided into two parts

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
The first part is

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
the physical part

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm going to talk about Dark Matter

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
which is mainly

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
focused on

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
the direct detection

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
part of the experiment

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
What is its physics?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
What is the current

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
state of the field?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
What is everyone's goal? What are the difficulties?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
How to do this experiment? How to measure this thing?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
It should be more reliable

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
and more interesting

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
The second part will be my own work

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
which is quite R&D

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
People who are interested in

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
technology may be more interested

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
But it should be very related

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
My screen is a bit laggy

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
First of all, because we have already

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
introduced it before

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
What is

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
the basic example

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
of a

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
model and a theoretical basis

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So I'm going to talk about it very quickly

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
So basically

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Can you see my mouse?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Can you see my mouse?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Can you see it?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
There are many basic examples

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We think these basic examples

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
are the basic materials

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
we know

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
in the universe

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
But

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
because of some reasons

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
we think there are still things in the universe

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
that we don't know

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
We can't use this model to explain

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
But anyway, this is called Standard Model

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
It is the best description

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
If you are

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
interested in this

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
You can look it up on Wikipedia

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
There are six quarks

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
three leptons

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
neutrinos

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
and X

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Okay

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
The point I want to talk about today

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
will focus on

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
the ones you can see on the screen

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
The red one is a mole

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
The blue one is a neutrino

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Basically, this is

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
the most important example for us

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Because honestly, in life

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
the most important thing is

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
the things you are interested in

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
the things you breathe

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
and the things that make up you

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
These are the only two

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Okay

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Then

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Sorry, there are electrons

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
These are the three

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
There is another important one

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
The white ghost

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
It is called light

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It sounds very mysterious

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
like a laser gun

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
these things

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
exchange light like baseball

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
and they will

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
reach the energy balance

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Basically, the heat balance

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
After reaching the heat balance

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
everything will have a black hole

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Okay

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
This is very important

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Because my family often ask me

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Is dark matter a black hole?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Actually, it is not

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
You will know why

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
It is very vague

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
This is the universe we usually see

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
When we look at it

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
the whole universe is black

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Then you will say

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Why do we think

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
everything is the matter we know

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
and it will exchange light

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
like a baseball

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
This is actually

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
the universe we see

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
with a good instrument

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Like this

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
The whole universe is basically bright

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
The different colors

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
are basically the same as the black hole

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It corresponds to different temperatures

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You see the brightest one in the middle

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It is the galactic plane

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
There are many planets

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
and a lot of energy

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So there will be a lot of energy

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Okay

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
My mouse

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Okay, you see the back

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
This part is very red

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
The energy here is very low

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It only has a foreground

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It only has a background

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
The background is the whole background of the universe

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It is very cold

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
It is only 3 degrees K

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
But basically it has a temperature

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
So we can still see it

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Okay

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
This picture is basically

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
filled with colors

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
How can we say there is any dark matter

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
that we don't know

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Let me see the next page

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Because there was a very wise man

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
He said

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Vader was seduced by

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
The dark side of the force

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
The dark side of the force

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
The force is what gives Jedi his power

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It's an energy field

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
created by all living things

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
It surrounds us

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It permits us

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
It binds the galaxy together

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It sounds very confusing

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I don't know what he is talking about

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
So I will focus on it

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
The dark side of the force

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It is the dark side that binds us together

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
This phrase is from 1976

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
So you can imagine

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
This is probably the time

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
when we started to be interested in

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
dark matter

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I think this statement is correct

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
We started to have dark matter

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Okay

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
So

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Actually

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
What does this mean

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
There is a picture here

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
The center is the brightest part

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
The brightest part is the center of our galaxy

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Then the horizontal axis

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
is the distance from the center of the galaxy

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
to the outside

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
The vertical axis is

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
the particle

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
in that position

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
The speed of rotation around the center of the galaxy

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Then you can see

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
the yellow data

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
The yellow data is

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
the stars over there

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Okay, like the sun

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So we can see those stars

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
are moving

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
We know how fast they are moving

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Then the yellow data

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
is the part of the galaxy

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
That is

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
the size of the galaxy

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
300 years ago

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
But then we found

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
We can keep looking out

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
According to the dark radiation we just used

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Our instrument is getting better

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
We can see the infrared

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Then we see

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
the blue hyperfine structure

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
The blue dot

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
That's basically

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
the light source

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
You can keep pushing

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
to the outside

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
The position of 50,000 light years

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
It can be connected

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
This is what we know now

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
The size of a galaxy

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Okay

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Then we go through

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
to see

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
What we see

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
The speed of these particles

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
We can go

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Okay, there's a point

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
According to the relativity

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
It's basically Newton's law

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
According to

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
the traditional law we know

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
We can guess

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
We just see the speed

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
We can guess how much mass there is

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It goes around this kind of thing

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It goes around the inner side of the orbit

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
So we get

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
We get the following line

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Okay

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
But actually

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
What we observe

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
The speed of rotation is the line above

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
So in the middle

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You will find that

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
The speed of rotation

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
is the speed of the line above

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
The actual weight of the orbit

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
is much more than

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
what we can see

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Okay

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So we really can't see it

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
In the 1980s

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
That's because our instrumentation

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
is not good enough

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
There's nothing you can't see

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So for a while

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Dark matter still had some

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
controversy

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Then in the 1980s to the 1990s

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
We started to know

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
that everything we can see is almost right

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So we started to think

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Is it that the particles we know

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
can meet this nature

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
The answer is yes

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
There are three kinds of particles

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
There are three kinds

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Anyway, there is one

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
There are three kinds of particles

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It does have this nature

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
But what we know

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Here is a point

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
We think we don't know

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Some people

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
What we already know

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It basically has something to do

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
with the particles we already know

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Because the particles and the particles

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
are composite

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
They have a proportional relationship

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Because they will

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
use it when they change

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
So according to all the stars we observe

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Those stars are the particles and the particles

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
We can reverse the most

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
How many particles are there

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Can it

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
cover our

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
missing mass budget

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
The answer is that it can't exceed 6%

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Can't exceed 6% at most

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
So basically we think

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
It may be new physics

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
The more things

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
The answer is that it shouldn't be like this

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Because the quality you see

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
You estimate it as a line

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So you mean

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
If I have more images I can't see

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Will fit the original data

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
That is to say, when the upper line is

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
When the upper line is more

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So why is it bigger when the upper line is more

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Let's write a book

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Is it easier to turn like this

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Then assume that the middle is symmetrical

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
You can think of it as all in the middle

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Ok

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Just that

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Transverse speed

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Yes yes yes

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Oh no

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It's the speed of turning

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
So actually you can see

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Its speed

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
What is the real speed

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Hundreds of kilometers per hour

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
That every second

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
So it's really slow

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Basically it is

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It doesn't have to be close to the speed of light

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Ok

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
This number will be a bit important

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
So actually darkmatter

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
There are a lot of clues

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I won't say it's evidence

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I haven't measured it yet

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So there are a lot of clues

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
This clue is actually the most suspicious

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
There are a lot of reasons for him

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Don't think like this

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
But darkmatter has a lot of other clues

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I put it in the background

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
If you are interested, you can ask

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Ok

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So anyway

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
We have to have extra quality

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
To produce extra power

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Or somehow you want your theory

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
To produce extra power

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
To explain this question

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Is there any use of darkmatter?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Ok

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Then I will jump directly to

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
This is what I saw recently

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I think it's very interesting

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
That article

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
And I think you should know better than me

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Ok

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Ok

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You should know who this is

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Yes

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
This is my

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
This is the latest issue of CERN Courier

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
An article

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
It's

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I magnified the focus

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
But I still have citations

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
So I magnified the citation

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It says

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Let's see where to start

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Ok

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Let's see

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Let's see

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Let's see

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Here

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It says

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Basically they say

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
EPR pair

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
EPR pair

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Refer to ER Einstein Rosenbridge

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And one part that connects the two

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Part of the black hole geometry

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And then

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
This idea spring

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
By many theorists

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
In particular in the context

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Of ADS-CFT correspondence

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Ok

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Let's look back

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
The point is

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
The problem with this theory is

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I think it's motivated by

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
What I just said

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
So it can work

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
In galaxy scale

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
But the problem is

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
It can't

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Or it's not good enough

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
In phenomenology

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
To work

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
To estimate

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Something bigger

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Something bigger

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
For example, I just said

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
A galaxy

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Then it will have a

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Modified gravity effect

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
But the problem is

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
We have another observation

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
If there are two galaxies

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Then these two galaxies

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Have a dark matter

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Then they contrast

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
We can see two

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Things like matter

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Dark matter and non-active matter

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
This kind of local

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Dynamic behavior

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
It doesn't have a good way to explain

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Its work now

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Is to say

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
If it is a whole universe

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It will have

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Modified CMB

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Is it effective?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Ok

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I actually framed another part

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
How would

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Emergent gravity affect

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
The physics

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Someone asked me

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
There are many different explanations

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
For example, extra dimension

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
EREPR

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Modified gravity

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Modified Newtonian dynamics

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's a standard name

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
But why do we want to do dark matter

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I think the reason is simple

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Because dark matter can be done

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Even if you

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Don't think it's a good

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Maybe it's the right theory

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
But rule out and prove it

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Should be equally important

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So we are doing this now

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
But I would say this mod is difficult to do

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
But someone is thinking

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
For example, microgravity

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Some light experiment

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
That

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
The details

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I think you should know better than me

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So I don't really understand

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
There can be special

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
That

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It means

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Right

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So what I just imagined

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Assuming there is an extra dimension

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Contact

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Then your thinking

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
3 plus 1

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Will be proportional to

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
This contact

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Its size

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
So if you are here

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Bigger or smaller

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
It's more likely to be proportional

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
To the outside

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
But this

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Compactify

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Dimension

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Right

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Assuming the size

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Is not constant

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Here is so big

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Then it means in different places

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Four or more

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Its size will be different

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Should be possible

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I don't know how they do it

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
But

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
The point is that someone thinks so

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Then

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I think

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I'll jump back

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Faster

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Where did I say

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Ok

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Actually

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
It's more interesting

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
That

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
If someone is interested in other

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Various

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Prediction

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Prediction

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Various observations

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
We have a missing mass

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
A

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
So

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
What you see now

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Is our Milky Way

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
This is what we think of Milky Way

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
The Milky Way we see

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Then next to it, I help you zoom in

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
That's our solar system

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Then we go around the sun

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
The third one over there

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Why is this important

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Because we do experiments on the earth

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Everyone knows how important it is

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
What about the picture in the upper left corner

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Is to say

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
This is not a special phenomenon

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That is to say, only our Milky Way Galaxy

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Because before

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
A lot of people think

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Will you observe like this

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Is it because we are in the Milky Way

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
So we are in the Milky Way

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
That is not the center of gravity

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Then observe there

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Then you have to correct it

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Such a

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
A constant change

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
That

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Will there be a problem with this experiment

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
But this thing

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It's basically a

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
A

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
A whole observation of the 70s

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Completely broken

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
This person later got that

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
President's Freedom Award

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
He observed a lot of galaxies

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Then there is such a phenomenon

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
So what you see in the upper left corner is

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I said that

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The speed of rotation

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
It's really flat, isn't it?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
But if you

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Gmm is equal to R squared

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
In fact, it should be

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
In contrast to once

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
That is, it will keep going down

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Uh, once

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
V squared will be in contrast to R

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
V squared will be in contrast to R

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
OK, so we really think

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
What should it look like

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
It should look like this

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It's a little bit of lag

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
There is a halo

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Something like a light cloud

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
OK, so this thing is called Dark Matter Halo

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Then we are in that

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Inside, so we have been constantly

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
In Dark Matter Halo

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Uh, moving is being soaked inside

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
A feeling of being soaked inside

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I have a question, then you

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Uh, that is to say

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
How big is it

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Its scale

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Its effect will come out slowly

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Because you want to look at the Galaxy scale

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Then I said, for example, the solar system scale or the galaxy group scale

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
It will also have a laser curve

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Then when you draw it out

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Is it the same as that

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Oh, I forgot to put that thing

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
That is

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
This is very interesting, you can ask a question

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
That is

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
How long does it take for us to turn the sun

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
One year, right?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Then we solar system

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
How long does it take to turn the galaxy

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
OK

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Basically, there is no life

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Can feel the difference

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
So you can imagine

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
We are in a

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
With

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The center of the galaxy as the origin

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Coordinate inside

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Surrounding the sun to do local rotation

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Can you

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
So basically in this Dark Matter Halo

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Inside

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
We are actually in a fixed position

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Local place will keep turning

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
So what will you get in the end

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
You will

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
If you measure the local

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
The speed of that halo

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I said

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Dark Matter

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Wait a minute, you just asked

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
The speed of the planet

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Ok, let me tell you

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
The speed of the earth itself around the sun

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Will dominate this

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
This measurement

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
OK

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So actually someone found something very interesting

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
It should be said that Propose is a very interesting concept

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Because we are

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Relative to our life

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
And the time scale we use

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
We are in Dark Matter Halo

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Solar system in Dark Matter Halo

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Basically fixed

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
That point is not moving

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Your whole life will not change

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
A pixel on the earth

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
But the earth has been around

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
So the earth is equal to

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
The solar system is sitting in a

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Constant Dark Matter Week

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
A Dark Matter

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Wind inside

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Keep moving in the same direction

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Then we have half a year

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Half a year is against it

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Half a year is against it

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
This is called Dark Matter Annual Modulation

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
It can be a

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Probing

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Dark Matter as a particle

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
A very important phenomenon

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
About ten years ago

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
They measured

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
And then all the other people couldn't

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Reproduce that experiment

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Do you know this

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
In addition to the

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The scale of the solar system

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It's a little bit bigger

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
But smaller than the galaxy

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
But smaller than the galaxy

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
See

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
There are a lot of stars in the galaxy

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Is a lot of

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Oh, I don't know

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I don't know

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I don't know

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Because usually we

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
We are

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Anyway, everyone is talking about

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
What clues are there in Dark Matter

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Just use a few scales

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Galaxy

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's a bunch of galaxies

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
It's called Megastructure

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And then there's the whole universe

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
There are about four

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Will there be a star group in the middle

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I don't know

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Maybe someone is doing it

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I don't know

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I don't know

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
The next one

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
But

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Oh, yeah, I have that doll up there

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
That's it

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
So

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Then we think it's weird

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Since we're sitting on the whole earth

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Including ourselves

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Do you feel like you're being blown by the wind

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Or has the ghost been pushing you

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
The answer is no

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
So

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
A very popular theory

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
That is

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
We're all surrounded by

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Dark Matter

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
OK, just like we're all surrounded by air

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
But they basically

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Won't put their

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Momentum to us

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
It won't interact with us

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
OK

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
This is smaller than air

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Because we're actually air

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't feel the interaction

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
But Dark Matter basically has a theory

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
The first two are the substances we already know

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And then they interact with each other

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
In the form of throwing the ball

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So they can pass on

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
That's what we know

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And then

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It's all Dark Matter next to it

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
But Dark Matter has no way to catch the ball

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Just stand there and watch

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Of course

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But he has gravity

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah, so

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
So we put one over there

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Gravity pole

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's the only thing that can interact with us

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It's pulling us

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
So we can

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Basically this is the only

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
We can see that

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
The reason for the Rotational Curve

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
OK

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Because it has a gravitational interaction with us

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Can this be localized?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Let's say we have a

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Dark Matter here

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Let's say it's a ball

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Would it enhance

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
The gravitational pull between the substances?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
How does it interact with you?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Oh, yeah, that's what I just said

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Microgravity

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
This thing is very interesting

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
You either measure a very large scale

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
why

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Because you can have a very large group of Dark Matter

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
You can measure the great pull

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Then this approach will become

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
There is a

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
What is it called?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Lensing is Gravitational Lensing

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
In fact, we can use what we know

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Baryonic Matter

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But a lot of people are doing

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
There is a galaxy far away

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Then it also has a

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Dark Matter Halo

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And then there's something behind it

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
So we can see what's behind it

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Then we can see

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
The effect of this galaxy

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Can we go to

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
So this lens

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
How heavy is it?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Then we can see how bright this lens is

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
So we can guess how heavy its Baryonic Matter is

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I don't know

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I don't know why I have to talk about Baryonic Matter when I do astronomy

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Standard Model of Matter

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
How heavy is it?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Then this is a way

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
There are a lot of measurements

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Measurement and

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Does it match?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
But it's a total

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Because if you measure it like this, it's a total

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Because you're looking at a very far

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
A very far galaxy

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
As a mirror

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
A lens is not a mirror

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
So a lot of people are doing

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Is what you said

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Can I do it on Earth?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
For example, I'm on the table

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I know how heavy this apple is

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
How heavy that banana is

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
How big is the gravitational pull between them

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
But if there's Dark Matter in the middle

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
How much should it change

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
The problem with this is that you can control all the experiments

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
But their signals are small

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Because things are light

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So it's hard to do

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
But if there's a breakthrough in this part

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
It will be a completely different

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
For Theory

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
But this is

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
This is more like what you're talking about

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
We're measuring the magnitude of the current current

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
This we know

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Because if Dark Matter

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
If it's small, it's not

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
But it's like this

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
So

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
The problem here is

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
How big is your sensitivity?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
How big is your experiment sensitivity?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Because we're measuring the magnitude

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
It should all be from astronomy

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Just look at the big

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Gravitational Source

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I don't know

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I don't know what they're doing right now

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
But someone is doing it

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
This is actually a very interesting experiment for me

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
But I think it's been five or ten years

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Should all be very

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Test performance

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
There will be no breakthrough

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I have a question

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Dark Matter seems to be man-made

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Oh

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
This is a completely

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Different idea

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
You have to talk about

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Just talk about man-made

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
That's what LHC wants to do

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I'll talk about it later

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Yeah, because if it's man-made

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Maybe you can measure the difference

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Oh, I know what you mean

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Theoretically, right?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's Gravity

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
If it's a pile of matter

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
But I don't think I can measure it

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
The reason is the same as just now

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Because your weight is small, it's hard to measure

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
So now the problem is

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Of course we know there is

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Golden mass

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
But I'm not sure if it's dark matter

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
No one knows what it is

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
But what you can imagine is

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
You can modify what you originally used to do

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Assuming something

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Assuming Newton's law is right

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
That is, there is less matter

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Or Newton's law

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Then you have to modify that

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Anyway, either case

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
You have to come up with a theory

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
What we are doing is to treat it as a particle

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Yes, it's a particle

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
To do

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Its only interaction is gravity

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
OK

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
This is what I want to talk about

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
So it just stands there and doesn't do anything, right?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
So our current assumption is

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Dark matter doesn't interact

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
This sentence is correct

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
If you talk to astronomers

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
In all of our roles

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Dark matter will never work with you

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
What are you doing

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
OK

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
But what is our hope

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Our hope is

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Next page

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Next page

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
It's a very, very, very

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Small chance

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
It's actually going to be with us

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
This red

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Red is straight or neutral, I forgot

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Anyway, it interacts with our normal matter

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
But what are its conditions

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Its condition is to be small

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
That is to say

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
You want this opportunity to be small

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
In all previous experiments

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
It looks like it has no interaction

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But you will feel that

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
It's already so small, so why do you have to assume it

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
There is actually another reason

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Because

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
We are directly

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Attack Dark Matter

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Before we measure directly

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
We have a lot of other theoretical examples

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
It predicts

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
New example

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
OK

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
It's not just what we know now

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Then these new examples

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
With

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
The whole complete

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
The larger and more complete theory

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Its interaction is very weak

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Weak to all other

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
The experiments we have done before

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It looks like it has no interaction

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
But it is not completely

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
This is the point

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Then it is more important

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
That value

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Is what we should be able to measure

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
As long as we design a

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Dedicated experiment

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
So some people think

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
This is very important

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
In fact, we can't measure

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
It's not that it doesn't interact

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
But we don't have a very sensitive way to measure it

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
So we always thought it was completely

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
But in fact

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
If we measure it today

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
We think it should interact with us

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
This sensitive detector

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
There is still no interaction

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Then we can rule out the old theory

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Which we did many times

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I will talk about it later

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
So what is the current situation

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
The current situation is

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
The earth is over there

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Red is our experiment

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
We put it on the earth

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Then we are in the dark matter

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
So as the center of the coordinate

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Dark matter has been hitting us crazy

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Then we hope that many

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
One will hit our detector

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Then hit the detector

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
The situation is actually quite serious

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Like you hit the ball

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I wrote it there

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Come in and out

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
It passes a little bit of kinetic energy to the detector

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Then what we want to measure is this little bit of kinetic energy

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
it is good

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
This is what we want to do

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
How do we actually do it?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Okay, let's start to move on

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
That is to say our project

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
This is not our project

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
But I want to talk about it first

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
The two most popular methods on the earth

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Then I want to

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Then we have to say in our work

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Why do we think this is better

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
This is the first method

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Called Time Projection Chamber

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
That red line is dark matter

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Dark matter comes in

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
After a lot of times

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It hit the bucket

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Detected matter in the basket

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Then like hitting the ball

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Then go out

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Then it passes the energy to the line like a caterpillar

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
What is that line?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Inside the bucket

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Is our so-called

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Target Matter

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
What do I usually talk about?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Anyway, it's Target Matter

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Then it passes a little energy to this

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Material

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
The atomic box of this element

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Then the atomic box

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
After some energy

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Pass this energy to it

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Electrons on the track

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
The electrons will move forward and then fall

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Then the light will come out

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
The light is the yellow line of the caterpillar

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
OK

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Then this flash of light

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
It will spread out

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
The PMT above and below

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
PMT is called Photon Multiplier Tube

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Photon Multiplier Tube

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Photon Multiplier Tube

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Basically it is a very sensitive light sensor

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
You can measure that light

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Then I just talked about it

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Then it will absorb the energy

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Pass it to the electrons and then fall

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Then you know that the moonlight

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
The light released is a fixed color

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Is a fixed energy

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
So you look at the energy of this color

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
How strong it means

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
How many electrons are released

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Then you can push it back

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
How much energy did it eat

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
OK

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
This is the first signal

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Then the second signal

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Did I just say

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It will have an electron moonlight

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Then the electron moonlight

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
In addition to this kind of falling

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
This ratio is separated

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
OK

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
What about these electrons

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It is in this up and down vertical direction

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Put a very, very strong power plant

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I wrote it there

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It's probably thousands of volts per centimeter

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
For one

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
You look at the picture below

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
The vertical direction of the barrel is probably tens of thousands of volts

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
It will use this very strong power plant

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Put

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The electron is pulled all the way

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Just drag it all the way

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It's a virtual caterpillar on top

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
OK, that virtual caterpillar hit the detector

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
It has a secondary signal

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
So there is such a method

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Can you

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Then because it is pulled up

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Speed ​​is a fixed speed

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
It's probably a fixed speed

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Is the electron in the material

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Drifting speed

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
So you count that

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Flash, flash is basically a moment

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Just flash and see

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
The speed at which you receive the electron

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The time difference in the middle

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Can you reverse the distance

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
OK, do you know what I mean

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
If you have a row of electrons being drifted

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Then every one reaches a different distance

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
You reverse the whole thing and you get a track

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Then through this track

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
You can vary

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Roughly

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Different

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Hit your example

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
So you can tell

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Is it that we already know the particle hit us

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Or its behavior is consistent

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
This is what we should expect

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
This is called Time Projection Chamber

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
What about its problem

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
OK, let's talk about its advantages

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Its advantage is

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
The material is usually

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Liquified

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
What

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
That

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Xenon

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Or

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Argon

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Argon, Xenon

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
These are the two types of deflection

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
So it's actually a very heavy element

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Then we

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
We know the heavy element

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It's a bit like

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
If you hit a heavy thing today

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Hit the air molecules with you

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
The air molecules will get more

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Energy or something heavy

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
It should be heavy

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
So if today Dark Matter hits

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Hit a heavier atomic box

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
It can leave more energy

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Then we know that this energy is equal to the square of M

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
The square of the atomic box

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
So the signal is very big

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And it's actually easy to scale up

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Why scale up is important

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Because basically there are

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
How many Dark Matters pass through your detector

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
How big is it with your detector

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
How many atomic boxes are there

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
So if you have a two-fold detector

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Basically

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
The rate of the expected signal should be twice

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
They are easy to put a lot of

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
They are basically a big bucket

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
A super high voltage

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
It sounds crazy, but it's actually easy

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Basically

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
To summarize

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
This is state-of-the-art optimization

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Of a widely used

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
High-energy physics technology

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Invented in the 70s

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
OK

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
They want to state-of-the-art

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Optimize this very widely used

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
What are the benefits

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
They can scale up very quickly

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And they know what problems they will encounter

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So currently this approach

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Is the most sensitive

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
In terms of event rate

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
OK

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
The second one

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Another one is Solid State Detector

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Why is this thing

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Let me talk about it

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
What you see on the picture now

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
The part that I enlarged

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
That little metal box

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Inside that metal box is next to this

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Carton

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
That blue thing

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Is a solid state

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Its principle is actually the same as the one

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
The state of the art

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
You run in and hit it

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Then give it energy

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Energy makes it flash

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
OK, and then the flash

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Light

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Can be blown out

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
And then the top and bottom of this picture

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
That label

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Called TES

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
TES is

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
We know the most sensitive on Earth

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
What is it

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
It's called Transition Edge Sensor

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I'll talk about it later

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
OK

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
It's very, very sensitive

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And then

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
In addition to this signal

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You can also get another signal

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's a deposit

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Basically it's heat

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It's heat in the crystal

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Because energy is heat

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
If you think about it

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Then the heat will flow out

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
The whole box is hollow

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Nothing

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
So heat can't get out

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Heat stays inside

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
OK

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
The only track that can be sent out

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
It's the top and bottom

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
It has two caterpillar wires

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
It will send heat bath

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
So you can eat all these heat

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Then measure the heat

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Then you

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
What is it called

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
You can identify

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
What hit us

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Is it a particle we know

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Or a particle we don't know

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
OK

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
What is the advantage

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
This kind of Solid State Detector

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Can be operated under cryogenic temperature

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
For exquisite energy resolution

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
With ultra-low noise

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
What does it mean

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
It's super expensive

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
OK

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
It can have a lot of special phenomena

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Our collaborators

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
In Berkeley

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
In different laboratories

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
This kind of thing

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
It can play a lot of magic

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Recoil threshold depends on material property

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
You can invent

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Very exotic material

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Then let them eat

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
This

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
After hitting the ball

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
How to send it to you

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Then you measure

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
OK

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I know that Chicago University is now leading

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
They are doing CCD

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
To put it bluntly

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
The CCD chip in your camera

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Take it to Dark Matter

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
After hitting

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Then walk a small line

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Different particles walk that line

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
The behavior will be different

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
So you can be very, very

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Accurate judgment

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
How much energy is flowing now

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
What kind of particle is it

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Then come again

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Because we do superconductor

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
It is also a very sensitive material

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And graphene

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
What is graphene?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
What is special about graphene?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Its conductivity

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
is

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Not all the same

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
It's the same in every direction

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Like your guide

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
It's basically like this

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
It's like this

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
It's on the same plane

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
There are six directions

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
It's not zero

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Then in the other six directions

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
It's not zero

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Or it's the six-fold symmetry

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's very interesting

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
When your particles come in

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
If it runs in the direction of the conductor

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
It can

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
No matter how small the energy

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It can pull

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I should just talk about bandgap

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Leave a place for bandgap

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
It's even weirder

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
It's superfluid

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
It's superfluid

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It's also very sensitive

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And it's even weirder

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Fermi arc

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
This is what we did in Caltech

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
It's basically in a certain direction

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Its bandgap is also zero

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
You can imagine

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
These things

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
They are all superfluid

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
But what's the problem

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
The problem is that they look like

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
It's the subject of research

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Instead of using it to study other people

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
It's very, very expensive

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
But why is this interesting

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I'll tell you later

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Its dilemma

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It's harder to scale up

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Without meeting new challenges

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
While maintaining your budget and sensitivity

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
You know

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
The biggest experimental background is sensitivity

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
No, it's your budget

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Can you understand

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
OK

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
So after talking about

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Time projection chamber

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
And solid state detector

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
This is a monoplot

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
It's the whole field

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
The current state

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Horizontal

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
It's your assumption

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
The quality of dark matter

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Why do I say assumption

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Because no one measured

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
If you measure it, you know where it can be drawn

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
You assume

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
How heavy is the dark matter you can't measure

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
OK

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Then you have to know

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
How heavy is the dark matter particle

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Then you know

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
The dark matter halo

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
How heavy is the total dark matter

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
So you know

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
How many

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Particle in terms of number

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
The flux has been flowing through you

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Then you can't measure

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Then you can know

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
The chance of interaction with me

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Can't be greater than how much

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Otherwise I should measure

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
So the axis is the chance of interaction

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Is the upper limit of that opportunity

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
This is

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
The interaction between dark matter and detector

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
The chance must be less than that line

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
If it's higher than that line

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
We should measure

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
This is the logic of the picture

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
So it actually has two directions

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
One way is that you

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
The bigger the detector

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Like that time projection chamber

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
In theory, you can expect more events

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
If it can be measured

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
So if you can't measure it, you can keep the line down

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
It means that the higher the sensitivity

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
You still can't measure

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Then the other one is that you can measure

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
The smaller the energy

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Then can you know that

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Because very light particles hit you

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
The energy left is very small

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Then can you go to the left of this picture

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
To draw that line

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Because you know you can measure this kind of energy

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
But you didn't measure

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Then you can put it there

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
This part

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Is the solid state

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
This is the main direction of this field

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Everyone wants to push down

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
To make the detector bigger

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
But if you want to push to the left

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
You need a better detector

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Then you will ask

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
What if to the right

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
To the right is like this

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Why do we want to do a dedicated experiment

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
To measure dark matter

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Because we have a very very

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Very powerful machine

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
We have been using it

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
When they built it

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Their reason besides looking for

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
The exposure

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
They actually want to find

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I think it's fair to say

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
The super symmetry theory

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Then the example of the super symmetry theory

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It used to be the best for dark matter

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
The most anticipated thing

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Their goal

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Basically around TEV

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Or sub-TEV

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
So that's where I put the soil

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Then you will ask

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Do we want to measure them now

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
The answer is that LHC has not been able to measure

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
And it has exceeded

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
The earliest version

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Super symmetry theory

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
In other words, we have basically ruled out

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
The original super symmetry theory

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
So now there are a lot of super symmetry theories

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
They are looking at the original super symmetry theory

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
According to our continuous measurement

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
They think it is a

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Super symmetry theory should have

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
What new phenomenon

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Looking at this thing

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So basically you keep going

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Is more sensitive

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
To measure the super symmetry theory

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Is there anything wrong?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
But it can't be measured

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
It's already weird

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
If you are interested

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
You can ask me

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
So now Susie's

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
The expectations are probably all on the map

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Everyone is surprised

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Because almost all of them are in the places we have ruled out

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
So now a lot of new theories

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Come out

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
If it's not a super symmetry theory

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
It's another one we've never thought of

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
The dark side

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Just like you know

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
It's the dark world

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
We can't see it

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It's very weak

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Interact with the world we see

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
But it's a completely

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Standalone dark world

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
It can have very light particles

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Then we have to have

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Very new technology

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Go to the left of this picture

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
So this is our goal

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Then you can see the top

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Inside the SSD frame

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
The four lines on the far left

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
That's basically what we experimented

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Four different operations

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
This is the most leading

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Then we are going to propose the next technology

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Push us down again

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Push it to the left

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Sorry

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
So this should be

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
OK, this is the last page

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
So the first part

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Do you have any questions?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Oh, this is

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Ok, this is

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Our most popular theory now

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
It's called

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Let's talk about popular

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Anyway, it's everyone

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
