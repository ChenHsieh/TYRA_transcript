1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's start recording.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, I got it. Thank you.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's start.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Yanping.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm your host today.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But I'll probably talk for a while

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then I'll be gone.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Because my wife's waist is twisted

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to the point where she can't hold the baby.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So...

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to have an emergency meeting later.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So today,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
let's welcome Hanxi to share

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
with us...

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He's the only one who has a webcam

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so he's Hanxi.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He's going to share

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
with us about the

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
law related to

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
public safety.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Because

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hanxi...

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is Hanxi right?

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, that's right.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My Chinese isn't very good.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hanxi used to

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
study law.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But then he went to the police station

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to study...

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He studied for a while

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in Yang Ming's police station.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then he came back to study law.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
His major is

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the law related to

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
public safety.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hanxi will share the details with us later.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No problem.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're happy to have Hanxi here today

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
because he's probably our first law student.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Also, he's probably our first...

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I guess,

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
pure humanist.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So we're happy that we can finally

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
expand to a more complete

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
academic field.

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There are people in all fields.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Without further ado,

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
let's give a round of applause to welcome Hanxi.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm the only one in charge of filming.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Because

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
today's guest is not alone.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Today's guest is not alone.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me briefly introduce myself.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm a friend of Yuhui.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's get to know each other.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why is my microphone

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
turned off all of a sudden?

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's like

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
a small roundtable.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's like a chat.

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not a formal report.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Since we have the opportunity,

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
let's get to know each other.

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay.

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not sure

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
which school you're from.

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So let's...

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let me introduce myself.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me introduce myself.

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm from UNC.

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm from Beka.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm majoring in social psychology.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Who's next?

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello.

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hi.

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let me introduce myself first.

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm from DC.

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm George Washington.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm majoring in mechanical engineering.

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm majoring in

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
high-performance computing.

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's related to supercomputers.

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's related to supercomputers.

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm doing an internship

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in Tennessee.

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So you're not in DC.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll be back in September.

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll be back in September.

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Cool.

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So your name is

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Zhuang Ping...

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Bi Yue.

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Zhuang Bi Yue.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Bi Yue Xuan Hua.

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's switch to Caltech.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We have two people here.

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm Zhuang Ye You.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm working in Caltech

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and NASA JPL.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm working on dark matter experiments.

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm Yu Zhe Jing.

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can call me Zhe.

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm studying in Taiwan University.

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm studying in Taiwan University.

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm working in Caltech.

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I used to work in chemical engineering.

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm working in environmental engineering.

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's cool.

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's cool.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So there's one more person.

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He left a comment

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
in the chat room.

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, okay.

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's studying geography.

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's studying geography.

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What field is he studying?

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Geography is pretty broad.

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It ranges from biology to natural science.

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm pretty interested in this.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we're going to

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
chat with Zhuang.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Physical Geography.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You've been to Charleston.

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to start.

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm going to hand over my video.

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to hand over my video.

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hello, everyone.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm at Georgetown

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
studying law.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you have any questions,

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
feel free to ask.

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can see my screen.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think you can hear me.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you have any questions,

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
feel free to ask.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm happy to share

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
my research topic with you.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm at Georgetown Law School.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm at Georgetown Law School.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a big classroom.

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The signal here is very good.

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm preparing this topic

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
about obesity

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and soda tax.

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm preparing this topic

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
about obesity

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and soda tax.

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm preparing this topic

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
about obesity

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
for the first time.

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
For the first time.

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think I'm getting a little bit

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think I'm getting a little bit

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
a little bit

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
a little bit

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
a little bit

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
a little bit

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
a little bit

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
a little bit

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
a little bit

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
a little bit

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
a really little bit

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
a really little bit

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
a really little bit

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
a really little bit

175
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
a really little bit

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
a really little bit

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
a really little bit

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
a really little bit

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
a really little bit

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
a really little bit

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
a really little bit

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
a really little bit

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
a really little bit

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
a really little bit

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
a really little bit

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
a really little bit

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
a really little bit

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
a really little bit

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
a really little bit

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a really little bit

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
a really little bit

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
a really little bit

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think the host just mentioned a little bit

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
but I can still give a brief introduction

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to myself

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to put it simply, it's actually a little bit

197
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
complicated, because I

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
like you guys who are watching this video

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I have studied in a lot of schools

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and right now

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
George Student University is probably the fifth

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
so there might be some of you here

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
whether it's Taitung University or Yangming University

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
or even UW

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
University of Washington

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In my field,

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
on the one hand, I was born with a background in law

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
just like everyone is familiar with

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
well, law

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and being a lawyer

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I was born with a background in law and training

212
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I also studied law

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and now I am studying law

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
on the other hand, I am a little bit different

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
from other law students

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
in that I have my

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
medical background

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and work experience

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
how should I put it

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
that is

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
my first full-time job

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
as you can see

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
my first full-time job

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
was in Seattle

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
ICHS

226
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
International Community Health Service

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
International Community

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Health Service

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that was when I was

230
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
in UW

231
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
in 2007, after graduating from law school

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I went there to work

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that was my first full-time job

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
before that, I was a lawyer in Taiwan

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but I hadn't worked there

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that was my first full-time job

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
for a lawyer in Taiwan

238
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
in my mindset

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
to work in a hospital

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
that was a big surprise

241
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
so that year

242
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
to some extent

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I got interested in medical law

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and then

245
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I jumped out

246
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
when I came back to Taiwan

247
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I kept my medical background

248
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
so I kept my medical background

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
in the health law field

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
so

251
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
can everyone hear me?

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
because

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it's weird

254
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
because I can't hear everyone

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
we can hear you

256
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
so welcome

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to speak up

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
it's my first time

259
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
feeling like this

260
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you can't see anyone

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
it's like a speech

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
can you speak up?

263
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't hear you

264
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
can you speak up?

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
will it be better if I speak up?

266
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
if you don't mind

267
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can see your face

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
it's like a speech

269
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not wearing any clothes

270
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
so I don't want to speak

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not wearing any clothes

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
so I don't want to speak

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm not wearing any clothes

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not wearing any clothes

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
there's an answer on the screen

276
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
no problem, thank you

277
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
we can

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
we can turn on the video

279
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
yes

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you can turn off the sound

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
at least there's a video

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
it feels better

283
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
talking to a real person

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ok, thank you

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
to put it simply

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm a lawyer

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
a lawyer from Taiwan

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
but I'm interested in public safety law

289
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
so I chose this topic

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
it's 6.20pm

291
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
it's 6.20pm

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it's quite simple

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
my presentation will be divided into 3 parts

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
introduction

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
background

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
why we chose sugar

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
why we chose soda

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and public safety intervention

299
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and public safety intervention

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
second

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
case study

302
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
one of my research point

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
is the case of soda tax

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
last

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I want to talk about

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
soda tax

307
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Caltech is in LA

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Caltech is in LA

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
so if there are

310
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
students from San Francisco

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
or Berkeley

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
they are

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
in the area of soda tax

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
because there's soda tax in the city

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
it might feel better

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but it's a trend

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
cities are moving towards it

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
so maybe

319
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you will have the same problem

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I talked to LA

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
public safety

322
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
officer

323
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
it might not happen in a short time

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
but it's a trend

325
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
anyway

326
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
you can listen to

327
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
their opinions

328
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
after listening

329
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
there's pros and cons

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you can discuss

331
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
ok

332
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
sorry

333
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to ask

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
what is the concept of soda tax

335
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
in California

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
California

337
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
California

338
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
California

339
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
California

340
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
city

341
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
city

342
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
city tax

343
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
city tax

344
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
city tax

345
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
city tax

346
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
city tax

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
city tax

348
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
city tax

349
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
city tax

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
city tax

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
city tax

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
city tax

353
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
city tax

354
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
city tax

355
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
city tax

356
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
city tax

357
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
city tax

358
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
city tax

359
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
city tax

360
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
city tax

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
city tax

362
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
city tax

363
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
city tax

364
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
city tax

365
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
city tax

366
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
city tax

367
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
city tax

368
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
city tax

369
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
city tax

370
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
city tax

371
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
city tax

372
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
city tax

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't know if you will talk about it later

374
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I just want to ask

375
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Does the tax cover the range of hand-shaken drinks?

376
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Like bubble tea

377
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
like bubble tea

378
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
For now

379
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
For now

380
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This is a good question

381
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Because most of it

382
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Most of the tax

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Is based on that

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The finished product of the drink

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
To tax

386
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If it's a freshly made drink

388
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Freshly squeezed juice or freshly brewed

389
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If it includes

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It doesn't look like it, but I can

391
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I think it depends on the definition

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It doesn't include

393
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But I can check again

394
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is a good question

395
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Especially in Taiwan

396
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If you want to pass

397
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Does this hand-shaken drink include

398
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't think it's in the definition

399
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But I can help you confirm this

400
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Thank you

401
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Okay

402
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's cut it into three parts

403
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
To discuss

404
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll do the introduction part first

405
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay

406
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I want to tell you

407
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Why did we choose sugar?

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why did we choose soda?

409
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is a trend in the world

410
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You may have noticed

411
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You may not have noticed

412
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But if you use Google

413
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Use Google as a keyword

414
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Search

415
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This is what I did

416
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yesterday

417
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You can see

418
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The anti-sugar fad

419
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Is now a trend

420
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Bloomberg

421
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The anti-sugar fad

422
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Has become a trend

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Has become a trend

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's a trend

425
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's a trend

426
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This is

427
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
For those who are not in New York

428
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
For those who are not in New York

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This week

430
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There is a company called

431
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Kind

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000

452

Kind

453
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Kind

454
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Kind

455

457

463

464

Kind

465
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Kind

466
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Kind

467
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500

468

469

Kind

470
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Kind

471
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
FDA

472

FDA

484
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
FDA

485
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
FDA

486
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
FDA

487
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
FDA

488
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
FDA

489
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
FDA

490
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
FDA

491
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
FDA

492
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
FDA

493
00:17:36,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Coca-Cola, Pepsi and others agree to keep sugar in the drink in Singapore

494
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I have a question

495
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I think there's a catch

496
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
For example, Pepsi

497
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
They don't want to reduce their sales

498
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Coca-Cola as well

499
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
So they said reducing sugar

500
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Is it really reducing sugar?

501
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
And then change it into other sugar-containing types

502
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Or do they have any strategies to change their ingredients and taste, etc.

503
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Or do they just want to keep it as it is?

504
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Or do they want to keep it as it is?

505
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Or do they just want to keep it as it is?

506
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,500
In fact, the regulation of sugar in the sugar drink

507
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Has included artificial sugar

508
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
So some parts have

509
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Like Diacok

510
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Some tags have included it

511
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
So it's included

512
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Of course, some cities don't have it

513
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
So this is also a controversial point

514
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Whether artificial sugar is included

515
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I think the question is good

516
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Because if you look at the sales

517
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
If you look at the sales

518
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Now the consumer's preference is

519
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Reduce sugar in some drinks

520
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I think the manufacturers naturally develop this kind of thing

521
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
I am following up

522
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
I think

523
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Even our school cafeteria

524
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I think

525
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
At least this half year

526
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
They sell sparkling water

527
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
And even the one with favor

528
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
The proportion of sparkling water is rising

529
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
And then the proportion of traditional sugar-containing drinks

530
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Then I think this

531
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
According to some reports, this is a trend

532
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
So for Coca-Cola

533
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
In fact, Coca-Cola and Pepsi

534
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
There are actually a lot of drinks

535
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
It can actually

536
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Adjust its proportion

537
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Or adjust the amount of each product

538
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
It can still

539
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Find a way to maintain a certain profit

540
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
As a manufacturer

541
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
It has a lot of strategies that can be applied

542
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I think it should

543
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Indeed reduce the amount of Coca-Cola

544
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Or it may launch more

545
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Like it now has this

546
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Different types of Coca-Cola

547
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Then do it like this

548
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
The proper distribution is

549
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
I don't know if I answered your question

550
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Yes, thank you

551
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
OK, you're welcome

552
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Ok

553
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
We have seen this international trend

554
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Basically for sugar

555
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
For sugar-containing drinks

556
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
The next question is to ask

557
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Why

558
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Why do we want to fight this

559
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Sugar-containing and sugar-containing drinks

560
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
What is the reason behind this

561
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
The main reason behind the reason is

562
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Of course the health part

563
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
In fact, sugar-containing drinks

564
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
The two main issues

565
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
One is that traditionally

566
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Everyone thinks of it as a tooth

567
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
This is one of the issues

568
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
But let's leave the tooth

569
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
The most important part here is obesity

570
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
What is the problem with obesity

571
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Because of obesity

572
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
I use this picture

573
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
In fact

574
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
There are several factors that cause obesity

575
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Probably sitting in front of the computer

576
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Like we don't move

577
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Inactive

578
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
This may cause obesity

579
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Lack of exercise

580
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Another one is diet

581
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
The ratio of the amount you eat

582
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
What kind of food

583
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Then it will lead to obesity

584
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
What is the problem with obesity

585
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
The following is what most people are talking about

586
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
NCD

587
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Non-Communicable Disease

588
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
In Chinese, it can be translated as chronic disease

589
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
There are four main types of chronic diseases

590
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
The first one on the left is cardiovascular disease

591
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Heart disease

592
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
High blood pressure

593
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
The second one

594
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
It's about blood flow

595
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Diabetes

596
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
The second one is respiratory disease

597
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
The last one is cancer

598
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Obesity

599
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
It will lead to cardiovascular disease

600
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Diabetes

601
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Risk factors for cancer

602
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Risk factors for cancer

603
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Even

604
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Leading to chronic disease

605
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Especially diabetes

606
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Related to obesity

607
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
One of the strongest

608
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
OK

609
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
What is the problem with obesity

610
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
OK

611
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
The main problem with obesity

612
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
In fact, it is very realistic

613
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
In addition to causing patients to suffer from this disease

614
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
The main thing is for family care

615
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Because this is a chronic disease

616
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
In addition to our whole society

617
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
If it's really related to everyone

618
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
The main thing is the increase in medical expenses

619
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
It's realistic, whether it's the United States or Taiwan

620
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
This chronic disease

621
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
In fact, because it takes a long time

622
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Medical costs

623
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
The cost of care is very considerable

624
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
In Taiwan, I can give an example

625
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Our annual budget for health insurance

626
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
The cost is about 600 billion

627
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
10% of it

628
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Is used to

629
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Diabetes patients

630
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
So the annual cost of health insurance

631
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
At least 60 billion is used for diabetes

632
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Diabetes

633
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Of course, there are many reasons for diabetes in Taiwan

634
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Maybe everyone knows

635
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Food with problems

636
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Detergent, pollution, etc.

637
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
But diabetes

638
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
The cost of diabetes is so high

639
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
This is a very direct reason

640
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
So for each country

641
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
If you can control obesity

642
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Can control

643
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Can greatly reduce these chronic diseases

644
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Relatively reduce medical costs

645
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Why are we looking for this

646
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Sugar-free drinks

647
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Everyone is studying science

648
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
This is probably a national high school

649
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Natural science or chemistry

650
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I mentioned the dissolution of sugar

651
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
200 grams of sugar

652
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Can be dissolved in 100ml of water

653
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
At room temperature

654
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
About this

655
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
The picture on the left is also provided by netizens

656
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Actually

657
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
I was very surprised when I first saw it

658
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
It's like Coca-Cola

659
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
The smallest 350ml

660
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
There is a sugar content of about 9 to 10 grams

661
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
You can see

662
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
The more

663
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
This

664
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Or this

665
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Lemonade or some juice

666
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Ice tea, etc.

667
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
If you drink a big can of cola

668
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
You eat so much sugar

669
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Actually

670
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
If you don't drink drinks

671
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
You won't be crazy

672
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Eat a bunch of sugar

673
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
But in the drink

674
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
It's a liquid

675
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
It's easy to take too much at once

676
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
More than

677
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Everyone should take an average of

678
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
More than ten times

679
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
This is why

680
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Why

681
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Hello

682
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
I have a small question

683
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
About this picture

684
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
The cola on it

685
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
And the red cow

686
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Mountain Dew

687
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
It's all man-made

688
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
So I can understand that sugar is added by people

689
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
But for example, the juice below

690
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
The meaning of those sugar cubes

691
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Except for him

692
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
After extracting the juice

693
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
After extraction

694
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Added so many sugar cubes

695
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
That means

696
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
There are so many sugar in that drink

697
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Including natural and

698
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
The total amount of sugar

699
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
You asked a very good question

700
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
This is also

701
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
This is also the United States

702
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
I will talk about the FDA later

703
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
In the new nutrition fact

704
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
To make a distinction

705
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Is it this added sugar

706
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Or the sugar it already has

707
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
It lists two different things

708
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
I believe the list here

709
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Basically all included

710
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Is the original sugar

711
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Plus sugar

712
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
But in fact

713
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
In addition to the original

714
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
If you look at the new nutrition fact

715
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
It's still much more than natural

716
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
In other words

717
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Real fruit sugar

718
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Compared to the drink

719
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
To make you drink

720
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
It's actually artificially added

721
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
The ratio is much higher

722
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
This is also his terrible place

723
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
If the real lemonade comes out

724
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
May be too sour

725
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
So you will attract everyone to drink

726
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
He added a lot of sugar

727
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
This is also what I will slowly introduce

728
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Please say

729
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
I think Zhang Yong just asked

730
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
The question is very interesting

731
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
And let me think of another question

732
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
But before you ask me a question

733
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Let me talk about this video first

734
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I think the two below

735
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Although it looks like juice

736
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
But the two of them should not be natural

737
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
So this question

738
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
In these six specific cases

739
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Should not be established

740
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Because if you go to buy that drink

741
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
You buy that lemonade

742
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
It says on it

743
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
How much is the real juice

744
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Very exaggerated

745
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
So that's actually artificial

746
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
But suppose we can find one today

747
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Find a juice

748
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
For example, fresh juice

749
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
In addition to the ingredients

750
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
The difference in the amount of sugar

751
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
In addition to the difference in the amount of sugar

752
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Will there be some differences in the type of sugar

753
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Because I always hear people say

754
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Because I don't study chemistry

755
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
But I always hear people say that refined sugar

756
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
With natural sugar in fruit

757
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Is actually a different thing

758
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
This thing

759
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Is it considered

760
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
At the time of the law

761
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
In the data I checked

762
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
In terms of reality

763
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
These sugar powder artificial sugar and natural sugar

764
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Is there a difference in the risk to the human body

765
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Is there a difference in the risk to the human body

766
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Is there a difference in the risk to the human body

767
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Everyone thinks there may be

768
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Even some people make some distinctions

769
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Which is safer and which is not dangerous

770
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Like some artificial sugar

771
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Actually extracted from a plant

772
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Some are chemically synthesized

773
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
The situation is not the same

774
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
But these data

775
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
There is no overwhelming evidence

776
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Can prove which is dangerous

777
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Which is safer

778
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
But we believe

779
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
But we believe

780
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Indeed these sugar powder is different

781
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
May have different effects

782
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
But so far

783
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Scientific evidence

784
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
As far as I know

785
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Of course because I'm not a scientist

786
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
The data I see

787
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
It's not really clear

788
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Which is dangerous

789
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Which is safe

790
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Because it brings

791
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
The main part is the heat

792
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
This fat

793
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
This fat itself is a risk

794
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Risk to the human body

795
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
What you said

796
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
The other additional risk

797
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
I think there may be

798
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
But so far

799
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
It's not clear which is the highest risk

800
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
Even without considering

801
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
High sugar content

802
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
This is a problem

803
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
You said there may even be additional risks

804
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
In addition to causing

805
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
In addition to causing

806
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Some artificial sugar powder

807
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
There may be additional risks of cancer

808
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
I heard people say this

809
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
But there is no accurate evidence

810
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
To prove that it is dangerous

811
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
So when you say sugar

812
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
The word sugar

813
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
In your presentation

814
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
It covers basically all

815
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
I don't know

816
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Maybe it's just

817
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Something that can produce sweetness

818
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Yes yes

819
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Basically like this

820
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Even for this

821
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
We are talking about

822
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Soda tax, sugary, sweetened

823
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Beverage tax

824
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Most of the laws

825
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Include these

826
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
In addition to 100% natural juice

827
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Will be excluded

828
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
As long as you add artificial

829
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Whether it's sugar

830
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Will be included

831
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
In the tax law

832
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Most of the definitions are included

833
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Unless you sell

834
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
100% natural juice

835
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
If you don't add anything else

836
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Otherwise you will be taxed

837
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
In many cities

838
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
This is also what I said in the first video

839
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Because

840
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Everyone calls it soda tax

841
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
It's easy to say

842
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
This is a water tax

843
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Or this is a cola tax

844
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
In fact, the more correct statement

845
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
With their official words

846
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Sugary, sweetened, beverage

847
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Sugary, sweetened, beverage

848
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Sugary, sweetened, beverage tax

849
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
So you see

850
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
This is a simple chart

851
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Oh, I forgot to say

852
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Disclaimer

853
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Many of these charts

854
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Are not my original

855
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
I found it on the Internet

856
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Because I don't have time

857
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
To add the source

858
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Some are in my notes

859
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
So this is a special statement

860
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
But this is not my theory

861
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I will add it

862
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
When the video is finished

863
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Because this is left

864
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
For our private academic use

865
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
So it is recommended to use it

866
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
So you can see

867
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
Energy drink

868
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Red Bull, vitamin water

869
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Sports drink

870
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Gel powder

871
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
We often drink sports drinks

872
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
This is actually a lot of sugar

873
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Even juice

874
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
A lot of juice sold on the market

875
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
It is not 100% natural juice

876
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
It may be naturally concentrated

877
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Then restore

878
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Add a lot of artificial flavors

879
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Colors and so on

880
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
So just like the classmate said

881
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
It is actually artificial juice

882
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Even including

883
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Ice tea

884
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Ice coffee

885
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
It actually adds

886
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
The sugar content is also very high

887
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Like we just saw

888
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Peach ice tea

889
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
7 tablespoons

890
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Sugar

891
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
In fact, it is the same as Coca-Cola

892
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
So these are all within the scope

893
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
To be taxed

894
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Ok

895
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Then we have seen

896
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
It was mentioned in the introduction

897
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Sugar and

898
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Soda are our target

899
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Because it will create fat

900
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Fat is what we want to avoid

901
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
A major danger factor for leprosy

902
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Then next

903
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
How to avoid

904
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Intervention

905
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
This is a picture on the Internet

906
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Including

907
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
U.S. sugar consumption

908
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
You can see a very obvious trend

909
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
Almost a linear trend

910
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
From 1822 to 2005

911
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
The consumption of sugar

912
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Has been rising

913
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
This is what I want to talk about

914
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
From the point of view of the law

915
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
The government's intervention measures

916
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Can be divided into four categories

917
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
The first is the so-called complete ban

918
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
As you are familiar with

919
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
I use the picture of this drug

920
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
For this drug

921
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
The government's way is to ban

922
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Even with criminal law

923
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Basically can't hold

924
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Can't sell, can't make

925
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Can't use such a thing

926
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
This is the law

927
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Even in terms of drugs

928
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
This kind of ban

929
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
For example, we just talked about drugs

930
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
In fact, there are different levels of drugs

931
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
It may not be the same in all countries

932
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
I don't know what's going on in your city

933
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
But at least in Washington D.C.

934
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
A while ago, it was a hot topic

935
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Legalization of drugs

936
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Basically you are here

937
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
It's not a crime

938
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
But in Taiwan

939
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Drugs are the second level of drugs

940
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Same thing

941
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
So the first level

942
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Of course the first level is the most serious

943
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
But the second level

944
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
In fact, the relevant criminal law is also quite serious

945
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
When I was a lawyer in Taiwan

946
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
I just witnessed

947
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Especially foreigners

948
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
The case of using marijuana in Taiwan

949
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Of course they all want to advocate

950
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
In our country, marijuana is legal

951
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Some even say that he went to the Netherlands to use

952
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Then returned to Taiwan

953
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
It was detected that there was marijuana

954
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Anyway, we can see

955
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
This is the first way

956
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Then use criminal law to regulate

957
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
The second example

958
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
I said it was a mode

959
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
I said it was a restriction

960
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
This is also easy to understand

961
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
I use cigarettes and alcohol

962
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Everyone is familiar

963
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
The government can regulate

964
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
You can only buy cigarettes or alcohol at the age of 18 or 21

965
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Even the purchase of cigarettes and alcohol

966
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Restrictions

967
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
I don't know how you are in the city

968
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Like where I live

969
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
It's actually Maryland

970
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
I don't sell alcohol in the city

971
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Basically, you have to buy alcohol

972
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Go to the liquor store

973
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
It's basically using that way

974
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Make you feel less convenient

975
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
You want to go shopping

976
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
By the way, bring a bottle of beer back

977
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
It's quite difficult

978
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
You need to drive to the store to buy

979
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Sometimes you think it's troublesome

980
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Reduce your drinking capacity

981
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Even for the behavior after use

982
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
For example, you can't drive after drinking

983
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Can't drive a plane

984
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Can't drive a bus

985
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Restricted

986
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
For example, cigarettes and alcohol

987
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
The third one is more interesting

988
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
I call it Nudge

989
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Why talk about this

990
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
I don't know if everyone has heard of Nudge

991
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
This is actually

992
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
I use this picture

993
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
It's actually a book cover

994
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
It is almost

995
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
One of the most famous law professors in the United States

996
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
He is

997
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Case Sunstein

998
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
He has been to Taiwan

999
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
He advocated

1000
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
Nudge

1001
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Nudge is actually not a novel

1002
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
It's not worth it

1003
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
He basically said

1004
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Use information to provide

1005
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Environmental settings or speech

1006
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
To affect human behavior

1007
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
The most famous example in his book

1008
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
The manager in the cafeteria

1009
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
As long as he changes the position of the vegetables

1010
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Will affect the amount of vegetables

1011
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
The amount of vegetables for children

1012
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
In other words, if he moves it

1013
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
To the front, the middle, where everyone sees it

1014
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
I saw it at the beginning

1015
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
It's easy for everyone to take more vegetables

1016
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I hate vegetables

1017
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Anyway, the first time you see it, you will take it

1018
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Will affect the amount

1019
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
This is actually not so much

1020
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
Because in fact

1021
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
All department stores, supermarkets

1022
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Even the bookstore boss knows

1023
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
He wants to sell the most

1024
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Put it in the best position

1025
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
But this mentioned

1026
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
This is a bit

1027
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
I use information to provide

1028
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Use position settings to change human behavior

1029
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Unknowingly change human behavior

1030
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
But basically this is not really forced

1031
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
This is to let the parties

1032
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Make decisions with their own free will

1033
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
It's just that his so-called free will

1034
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Unknowingly received some of my default settings

1035
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Or some of these

1036
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Position settings

1037
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Information provided

1038
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Affects your own decisions

1039
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
This is the third mode

1040
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
I call it light push

1041
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
The fourth is actually

1042
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Basically the government does not care

1043
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Just open

1044
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Fully provided by the market mechanism

1045
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Like Taiwan

1046
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
If it is Taiwan's

1047
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Just mentioned this

1048
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Or these sugar

1049
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
There is no control at the moment

1050
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
You can add as much sugar as you want

1051
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
But it's possible because everyone is afraid of getting fat

1052
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
So the habit is to say less sugar, micro sugar, no sugar, etc.

1053
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
The government basically does not interfere

1054
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
So there may be

1055
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
These four modes

1056
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
These four modes

1057
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Can actually be used

1058
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
For sugar-free drinks

1059
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
We want to reduce everyone's intake

1060
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
To achieve this

1061
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Reduce fat

1062
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
That

1063
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
That

1064
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Sugar is of course not difficult to understand

1065
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
The first one is of course not difficult to understand

1066
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Or we will ban it

1067
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Just mentioned

1068
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Artificially added sugar

1069
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Even artificial sugar

1070
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
We can ban it

1071
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Like anti-fat

1072
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
The fourth is also not difficult to understand

1073
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Just open

1074
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Basically the current situation

1075
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Taiwan's situation is that sugar is not in charge

1076
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
In fact

1077
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
The more interesting thing is actually the second

1078
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
The so-called restrictions and the third light push

1079
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
The second restriction is actually like the example of Singapore

1080
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
They set 12% sugar content

1081
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
In fact, there are restrictions in the United States

1082
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
That is to say

1083
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Many school vending machines

1084
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Are not allowed to sell some sugar-free drinks

1085
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
He uses this place restriction

1086
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Especially for elementary school students, middle school students, etc.

1087
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Restrict their access to sugar-free drinks

1088
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
This possibility, etc.

1089
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
This is also a restriction

1090
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
About restrictions

1091
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
I want to introduce a case

1092
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
We don't have any students studying in New York

1093
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
There used to be a mayor in New York

1094
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
His name is Michael Bloomberg

1095
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
He is the boss of Bloomberg

1096
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
He used to be the mayor of New York City

1097
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
From 2002 to 2013

1098
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
This person is a billionaire

1099
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Very rich

1100
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
I remember he didn't know the news

1101
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Often take money out to do things

1102
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
He is also famous for public health

1103
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Very enthusiastic

1104
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
This may be related to his undergraduate degree

1105
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
But anyway

1106
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
He invested a lot in public health

1107
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Bloomberg Foundation

1108
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Sponsored a lot of public health research

1109
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
He is also very concerned about obesity in New York

1110
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Even for sugar-free drinks

1111
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
He came up with a way

1112
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
One of the ways

1113
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
This is called

1114
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Potion cap

1115
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
Simply put

1116
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Restrict these vegetarian restaurants

1117
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Can't sell large cups of drinks

1118
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Restrict the amount of drinks

1119
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
The size of the cup

1120
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Simply put, you can buy a small cup

1121
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
No matter how many cups you want

1122
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
But the restaurant can't put such a large cup

1123
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Sell ​​a large cup of drinks

1124
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Restrict the amount of a cup

1125
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
In 2012, he proposed this policy

1126
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
This policy

1127
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Later died

1128
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
You can imagine

1129
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
When it was first launched

1130
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Many people are very angry

1131
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Restaurant owners are very angry

1132
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Because selling drinks is making money

1133
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
The biggest in the United States

1134
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
American Beverage Association

1135
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Very powerful

1136
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
They also pay

1137
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Advertisement etc.

1138
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
One of the most famous

1139
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
I drew a picture

1140
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
He was laughed at

1141
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Old mother

1142
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Nanny

1143
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
We don't need a nanny

1144
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Tell us how much cola to drink

1145
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
This example and this picture

1146
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Too famous

1147
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Discuss relevant issues

1148
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Even in New York

1149
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
People often talk about this

1150
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Why did this thing die later?

1151
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
The interesting part of the United States

1152
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
The interesting part of the public service law

1153
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
They are using the method of litigation

1154
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
They filed a lawsuit

1155
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Challenge New York

1156
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Administration

1157
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
The court basically believes

1158
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Bloomberg is not

1159
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Use through their parliament

1160
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
New York City Parliament

1161
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
To restrict this portion through the law

1162
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
It is used in a similar administrative order

1163
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
To stipulate the portion of the restaurant

1164
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
The court believes that this should be

1165
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
The facts stipulated by the law

1166
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
You can't do it directly with administrative regulations

1167
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
New York City's law

1168
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
New York City's law

1169
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
So it was postponed

1170
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Anyway

1171
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
The case was lost

1172
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
But he had tried this

1173
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
New York City

1174
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Is it possible to add soda tax?

1175
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
I have a plan in my research

1176
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
I will interview public officials in New York

1177
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
They are proposing

1178
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
It won't happen so soon

1179
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
But they have tried

1180
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
Use this portion

1181
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Another case

1182
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
This is a British case

1183
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,500
If you have been to the UK

1184
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
They called

1185
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Traffic light system

1186
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
You can see

1187
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
He listed several items

1188
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
Fat

1189
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
saturated fat

1190
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
And this

1191
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Sugar and salt

1192
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
He used this traffic light

1193
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
If the product contains sugar

1194
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Or salt

1195
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Far more than one person

1196
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
You have to mark a red light

1197
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
Remind everyone

1198
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
If it is normal, use yellow light

1199
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
If it is safe, use green light

1200
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
So you can buy a product

1201
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
You can see

1202
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
It is marked in the front

1203
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
So this is what we just talked about

1204
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Nudge

1205
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
Let consumers decide

1206
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Do I want to buy this product

1207
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
But

1208
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,500
It is a pity

1209
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Since 2013

1210
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
This policy is voluntary

1211
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
It is not mandatory

1212
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
In the UK

1213
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
You can provide information to consumers

1214
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
But there is no law

1215
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Next is the US

1216
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Nutrition facts

1217
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,500
This is the law

1218
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
On the left

1219
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
