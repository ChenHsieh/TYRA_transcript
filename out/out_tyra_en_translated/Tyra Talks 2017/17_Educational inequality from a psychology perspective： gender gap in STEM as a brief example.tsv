0	10000	Hello everyone, I am Zhang Yanyong, the host today.
10000	19000	We are very happy to invite Xie Dayang, Diane Xie, to talk to us about her field of research and her current research topic.
20000	27000	Diane's main field of research is psychology and education psychology.
27000	30000	She is currently a second-year PhD student at UC Irvine.
30000	47000	In the field of education psychology, Diane is particularly interested in how family, culture, and so on outside of school affect young people's motivation and results in school.
47000	61000	Her topic today is Educational Inequality from a Psychology Perspective, Gender Gap in STEM as a Brief Example.
61000	69000	Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about gender in the Hollywood industry.
69000	77000	Everyone has different views on gender recognition.
77000	80000	We are very happy to invite Diane to talk to us about this topic.
80000	88000	Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that if you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone, otherwise you won't be able to hear me.
88000	90000	Okay, you can start.
91000	93000	This is very interesting.
93000	95000	Thank you, Diane, for your introduction.
95000	97000	It seems like I am very good at introducing myself, but I am actually not that good.
97000	101000	I am very honored to share my research with everyone today.
101000	105000	I don't know if I can see six people today.
105000	107000	I will ask questions later.
107000	111000	From the introduction of everyone, it seems that almost everyone is a science major.
111000	115000	So I chose a topic that is more related to science in education psychology.
115000	121000	It is about the inequality of education in STEM, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
121000	127000	As Diane said, this is one of the questions that I can answer in my research direction.
127000	132000	I am currently in the second year of UCI Education College.
132000	141000	Although I am in the Education College, the main research methods that I use and the methods that our professors and lab use are mainly from development psychology.
141000	154000	In general, I study social culture, interpersonal relationships, activity experience, and other things that are greater than the individual.
154000	157000	We call them social cultural factors.
157000	161000	How to affect the psychological development of the individual, which is the second link,
161000	169000	individual psychological development, and then affect the behavior and cognition of the individual, etc.
170000	172000	So this is a big direction.
172000	175000	It sounds very mysterious and very broad.
175000	180000	This is partly because my research has just started and I can't speak very professionally.
180000	185000	Also because my research has just started, so I will be very nervous today.
185000	189000	If you find that I speak faster and faster or start to be biased,
189000	195000	you are welcome to interrupt me at any time to ask questions or tell me to speak slower or I don't make sense.
195000	197000	I won't be angry.
197000	199000	I really hope everyone will help me.
199000	203000	Okay, so let's get into today's topic.
203000	208000	To start today's topic, I actually want to start with a question.
208000	210000	So if you can turn on the microphone, that would be great.
210000	212000	I just want to ask a very philosophical question.
212000	214000	Why are you here?
214000	216000	Specifically, why did you join Tyra?
216000	224000	Why did you choose a Saturday afternoon 3 o'clock and listen to some academic sharing here?
224000	226000	Why did you choose to get a Ph.D.?
226000	231000	Why did you choose to enter the academic circle with so many potential opportunities?
231000	235000	Does anyone want to share why?
240000	242000	Does anyone want to speak first?
245000	246000	Count to 10.
246000	248000	If no one wants to speak first, I will demonstrate.
248000	251000	Okay, 1, 2, 3, 10.
251000	253000	I will demonstrate first.
254000	256000	Why did I join Tyra?
256000	264000	I think this question is more like why I decided to join Tyra.
264000	272000	I think this has to do with why I chose to get a Ph.D. and why I chose to stay in the academic circle.
272000	274000	I think there's a very important reason.
274000	276000	It's because I think...
276000	279000	I thought about the reasons behind it.
279000	281000	Why is it like this?
281000	285000	I thought about it and found new things.
285000	288000	Then I threw it back to solve the problem I was facing.
288000	291000	If I succeeded, I felt very accomplished.
291000	299000	So I hope I can continue to use this to do what I want to do in my life.
299000	300000	So I will stay in the academic circle.
300000	304000	Of course, the condition of staying in the academic circle is to get a Ph.D.
304000	311000	Also, Tyra, to a certain extent, started from this motivation.
311000	314000	How should I put it?
314000	317000	If I can communicate with others and have more ideas,
317000	323000	then I can think about the problems I'm facing and solve them.
323000	326000	Then I can get this kind of feeling.
326000	327000	Something like that.
330000	331000	Anyone else wants to speak?
331000	332000	Don't just let me speak.
332000	333000	Don't be shy.
334000	335000	Can I speak?
337000	339000	Hello, can you hear me?
340000	341000	I'm Chi Chi.
345000	346000	Can you hear me clearly?
351000	353000	Why did I join Tyra?
353000	359000	Because I'm quite interested in interdisciplinary learning.
359000	366000	In the past, most of the people I met were interdisciplinary learners.
366000	371000	So I thought it was interesting.
371000	373000	But I wasn't very active.
373000	376000	I only participated in a few programs.
376000	378000	Actually, today is the second program.
378000	386000	Because I didn't quite understand the topic.
386000	388000	So it was a bit difficult.
388000	392000	But now I'm trying to develop.
392000	396000	I think my purpose is simple.
396000	401000	I hope I can be a public intellectual.
401000	406000	So what I write and talk can be heard by people from different fields.
406000	410000	Because my learning background in the past has made me narrow.
410000	416000	Because the people I talk to are all from the same field.
416000	422000	So I don't think I have the opportunity to talk to people from different fields.
422000	424000	So I participated in this activity.
424000	429000	On the one hand, I'm curious about things in different fields.
429000	434000	On the other hand, I hope to communicate with different people.
434000	440000	I can think about how to make people from different fields understand what I'm studying.
441000	443000	Thank you very much.
443000	445000	Does anyone else want to share?
447000	449000	I'll talk about it.
449000	451000	Hello everyone, my name is Qiyun.
451000	458000	I wanted to join Taira because I thought the plan was a bit cool.
458000	463000	I can use the Internet and hear that everyone is Taiwanese.
463000	466000	And research in different fields.
467000	472000	Why do I want to get a PhD?
472000	475000	Mainly because I'm interested in my major.
475000	477000	I do math.
477000	481000	And I want to keep doing research.
481000	484000	So I have to get a PhD.
484000	486000	That's about it.
490000	492000	Thank you very much.
492000	494000	Anyone else wants to share?
497000	499000	Okay, I'll assume this is a no.
499000	505000	I started with this question because I've always been interested in this topic.
505000	507000	I just wanted to hear everyone talk about it.
507000	511000	The second is to bring everyone into the topic I'm going to talk about today.
511000	513000	Education.
513000	515000	Education.
515000	520000	From what I just heard, we give it a lot of value.
521000	527000	Like someone said, I hope what I do today will be more valuable in the future.
527000	532000	Or I hope what I do today will be more valuable in the future.
532000	535000	So I see it mainly as knowledge and strength.
535000	539000	We can see that we believe that education is a positive thing.
539000	541000	Just like what I just shared, it's almost all positive.
541000	544000	But if my question is why I want to get a PhD.
544000	547000	You can also say that I lost something in the past few years.
547000	549000	But no one said that.
549000	551000	This gives a very positive value.
551000	559000	This is a very common idea that people don't even question.
559000	561000	Education can give us a better future.
561000	563000	So we want to learn.
563000	565000	Everyone has already gotten a PhD.
565000	568000	I don't need to say that everyone is the best example.
568000	575000	So if we want to look at the value we give to education.
576000	582000	If we look at the level of education alone and the so-called successful indicators.
582000	583000	For example, income.
583000	586000	We can see a very beautiful straight line.
586000	589000	If we look at education and unemployment rate.
589000	592000	We see a beautiful inverse relationship.
592000	596000	It seems that education can really bring social mobility.
596000	598000	The so-called opportunity to climb up.
598000	601000	Just like this picture next to it.
602000	605000	This is a very strong idea.
605000	606000	Just like I just said.
606000	609000	We give education a very just value.
609000	614000	So it's not hard to see that we put a lot of resources into education.
614000	621000	For example, this year the United States allocated nearly $700 million to the Department of Education.
621000	625000	If we look at the state level.
625000	628000	Take California as an example.
628000	633000	The cost of education is actually greater than human resource health.
633000	640000	It is also far greater than the cost of judicial administration or natural resource protection.
640000	645000	So this is just a quick introduction to the topic I want to talk about today.
645000	648000	Everything sounds very reasonable at the moment.
648000	652000	Because education is a channel for everyone to climb up.
652000	657000	So society should ensure that everyone gets equal education opportunities.
657000	662000	That's why we can see the role of the state government is to invest money in education.
662000	668000	This is also a very tempting idea.
671000	674000	Since education is a chance to turn around.
674000	678000	We can say that we give education to the disadvantaged.
678000	680000	They should climb up.
680000	684000	Education has become a tool to reduce inequality in society.
685000	690000	I will talk about the topic of inequality today.
690000	693000	Although this idea is very tempting.
693000	697000	But the problem is that if education itself is inequality.
697000	700000	Then it may amplify inequality in society.
700000	702000	Instead of reducing inequality.
702000	706000	Of course, we don't want to see the reduction of inequality.
706000	710000	So the question for scholars is to ask.
710000	712000	Is education itself inequality?
713000	715000	This is a big question.
715000	717000	The short answer is yes.
717000	719000	Education is inequality.
719000	721000	But inequality is very complicated.
721000	725000	There are many reasons behind it.
725000	728000	The second reason is that they are related to each other.
728000	732000	Let me give you an example.
732000	738000	In the United States, the most discussed inequality in education is racial inequality.
738000	743000	Specifically, it is the inequality between black and white people.
743000	745000	If we look at this picture.
745000	754000	The blue line is the performance of white children in mathematics.
754000	757000	This is the performance of the ninth grade.
757000	760000	We can see that the blue line is far higher than the black line.
760000	763000	The orange line is the performance of Latin children.
763000	764000	The green line.
764000	768000	This is just one example.
768000	774000	The same achievement gap can be seen at different ages.
774000	777000	It can be seen in different subjects.
777000	781000	I put a link below.
781000	787000	This is just one of the research units tracking these data.
787000	793000	To see how much racial inequality is now.
793000	795000	To see if there is any improvement.
795000	798000	From this picture, we can see that the X axis is the time.
798000	803000	After so many years, there is still no improvement.
803000	805000	The gap is still very large.
805000	810000	Many people will start to think about the reason for this gap.
810000	817000	Of course, some people will wonder if it is because the resources of black children's schools are poor.
818000	824000	It sounds like the racial discrimination of schools is outdated.
824000	829000	It should not be abolished after the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s.
829000	832000	Why do we still see such a big gap?
832000	836000	One of the reasons is that the reason just now is very good.
836000	842000	But if we look at the data, we will find that there is still isolation.
842000	848000	The fact is that most white children still go to schools for white children.
848000	853000	Most black children still go to schools for black children.
853000	859000	The schools that the latter go to are usually those schools that are less well-off.
859000	866000	One of the people just said that schools are different now.
866000	869000	We found that the problem of schools still exists.
869000	872000	Why does this problem still exist after so many years?
872000	877000	There are many reasons that are related to each other.
877000	882000	For example, why is there a difference in schools?
882000	886000	One of the reasons is that there is a difference in income.
886000	890000	On average, the income of black families is lower than that of white families.
890000	893000	So the places they can live in are different.
893000	897000	The places they live in are different, so the school district they go to is different.
897000	903000	So if we put the income gap and the achievement gap together,
903000	909000	we will find that this is happening at the same time, and it is probably related to each other.
909000	911000	So now things are getting more and more complicated.
911000	913000	We just said that it may be because the schools are different.
913000	916000	OK, now we find that their economic level is also different.
916000	918000	Then give another example.
918000	920000	In addition to these two, we can also look at the family.
920000	926000	If we add the family in, we will find that the parents' education level
926000	929000	also has a gap between black and white people.
929000	934000	This gap and the achievement gap just now are also affecting each other.
934000	937000	So now things are getting more and more complicated.
937000	939000	It's not just the school itself.
939000	943000	There is also a problem with the inequality of income in the whole society.
943000	947000	Now we say that the parents' education level is also problematic.
947000	952000	Sometimes I think it's a bit of a ghost gun.
952000	954000	It's a vicious cycle.
954000	957000	For example, if there is a so-called gap in the family,
957000	961000	you can imagine that the parents with a lower level of education
961000	966000	will naturally have fewer books at home.
966000	970000	Or they don't have those connections to participate in better extracurricular activities.
970000	973000	Then it leads to their next generation's poor income.
973000	977000	Then, as I said at the beginning, it's not about income, it's about education.
977000	979000	Then education is related to income.
979000	983000	Then it's like this, it's a vicious cycle.
983000	988000	So I want to stop here.
988000	991000	Because I find that I speak faster and faster.
991000	993000	It's probably because I'm getting more and more nervous.
993000	995000	And here...
995000	997000	I actually just have a question.
997000	1001000	Please say it.
1001000	1003000	My question is like this.
1003000	1008000	For example, the income gap or the education gap.
1008000	1012000	I may not have heard what you just said.
1012000	1014000	What is its definition?
1014000	1019000	At least in this picture, what is the meaning of the gap?
1019000	1023000	Because I don't quite understand why there are so many dots.
1023000	1025000	Is there no face?
1025000	1028000	The dot is a week.
1028000	1030000	Every dot is a week.
1030000	1032000	Oh, the dot is a week.
1032000	1037000	It's too exaggerated to put it on.
1037000	1039000	So this should answer your question.
1039000	1044000	As I said, the education gap is...
1044000	1046000	Back to what I said at the beginning.
1046000	1050000	Education is a tool that can help people climb up.
1050000	1054000	But this gap means that some people climb higher, some people climb lower.
1054000	1058000	And if we're talking about the racial achievement gap,
1058000	1060000	white people climb higher, black people climb lower.
1060000	1062000	And if it's the income gap,
1062000	1066000	some people climb higher, some people climb lower.
1067000	1069000	So...
1071000	1073000	Can I ask a question?
1073000	1076000	This is the first time I've seen this graph.
1076000	1078000	What does it mean?
1078000	1080000	The dots and the axis.
1080000	1082000	What does that mean?
1082000	1084000	Right.
1084000	1087000	That axis, that gap.
1087000	1092000	For example, this graph is actually a combination of many graphs.
1092000	1095000	The x-axis is talking about the income gap.
1096000	1098000	Each dot is a week.
1098000	1104000	So if the income of white people in this week is twice as high as that of black people,
1104000	1107000	then the x-axis is a 2.
1107000	1109000	If it's higher...
1109000	1111000	It starts from 0.
1111000	1115000	So 0 and above mean that white people are higher than black people.
1115000	1117000	And the achievement gap means that
1117000	1123000	the learning performance of white people is higher than that of black people.
1123000	1125000	So there's a gap like this.
1125000	1127000	This graph means that
1127000	1130000	these two gaps are related to each other.
1130000	1132000	And it's a positive relationship.
1134000	1138000	For example, if your income gap is high in the same week,
1138000	1142000	then your learning performance gap will also be high.
1143000	1145000	Does that make sense?
1145000	1147000	Or is it getting more and more confusing?
1148000	1150000	Can I ask a question?
1150000	1153000	So the circle means that each week is different.
1153000	1156000	And the diagonal line is the standard line.
1156000	1158000	The middle line.
1158000	1161000	And the x-axis is the income gap.
1161000	1163000	What is the y-axis?
1164000	1166000	The y-axis is talking about
1166000	1174000	the gap between white people and black people.
1177000	1180000	So you can see that the y-axis is all 0 and above.
1180000	1182000	It means that every week,
1182000	1185000	the average income of white people is higher than that of black people.
1186000	1189000	And how much is higher
1189000	1197000	is proportional to the gap between white people and black people.
1197000	1202000	And the middle line is a standard line.
1203000	1207000	It seems like someone wants to ask a question.
1207000	1209000	Go ahead.
1211000	1213000	No, I just want to...
1213000	1215000	Because I've seen this graph.
1215000	1217000	But what I see is that
1217000	1219000	all the cities in the U.S.
1219000	1221000	and then make a comparison.
1221000	1226000	It's also racial inequity.
1226000	1228000	And then look at the gap between them.
1228000	1233000	The gap between cities and schools is the biggest.
1233000	1235000	So the bigger the circle,
1235000	1238000	it means that the city...
1238000	1240000	But in your graph, it's a state.
1240000	1242000	That state means that
1242000	1245000	the bigger the gap between the poor and the rich,
1245000	1248000	the bigger the circle.
1248000	1250000	And the smaller the circle means that
1250000	1252000	there's not much difference.
1252000	1254000	But that's what I see in the graph.
1254000	1256000	But you just said that
1256000	1259000	there's a lot of integration.
1259000	1261000	So I don't know if it's because
1261000	1263000	American education, at least before K-12,
1263000	1266000	was defined by property tax.
1266000	1268000	So because of this,
1268000	1270000	under the foundation of funding,
1270000	1274000	there will be the difference you just mentioned.
1274000	1276000	The better the school district,
1276000	1278000	if my parents can afford it,
1278000	1280000	the better the school district.
1280000	1282000	Of course, the more resources I have here,
1282000	1284000	the more money I have,
1284000	1286000	I can attract better teachers.
1286000	1289000	But if I'm poor in this area,
1289000	1291000	I can't...
1291000	1294000	Because this is a different education system from Taiwan.
1294000	1296000	It's the funding part.
1296000	1299000	So there will be a gap like this.
1301000	1303000	Thank you for the supplement.
1303000	1305000	And then I just said...
1305000	1308000	So this graph...
1308000	1310000	Like you said,
1310000	1312000	if you want to look for it,
1312000	1314000	it's related to education
1314000	1316000	and the achievement gap.
1316000	1318000	You can find any Y-axis
1318000	1320000	or X-axis you want.
1320000	1322000	But I made this introduction
1322000	1324000	mainly to introduce
1324000	1326000	the concept of
1326000	1328000	inequality in education.
1328000	1330000	And then I want to say
1330000	1332000	that there are many reasons
1332000	1334000	behind inequality in education.
1334000	1336000	And those reasons are
1336000	1338000	the reasons that affect and interfere with each other.
1338000	1341000	So to understand inequality in education,
1341000	1344000	you have to think about many aspects.
1344000	1348000	And this is the conclusion I will come back to.
1348000	1350000	And then...
1350000	1353000	Like the example I just gave,
1353000	1355000	if we only say that inequality in education
1355000	1358000	is because of the difference in school resources,
1358000	1359000	then we can say that
1359000	1360000	we will intervene.
1360000	1361000	We take black children
1361000	1363000	and take white children to school.
1363000	1366000	This thing has indeed been done.
1366000	1368000	But we will find that this is not enough.
1368000	1370000	Because you solve the difference in school hardware.
1370000	1371000	But like we just said,
1371000	1373000	there is still an income gap.
1373000	1374000	So you have to solve
1374000	1377000	why the income gap
1377000	1379000	in this society is so big.
1379000	1381000	Of course, this is not enough.
1381000	1382000	Because we still haven't solved
1382000	1384000	the problem of parents' education level.
1384000	1386000	Do we have to give parents
1386000	1388000	some employment guidance, etc.?
1388000	1390000	This is just...
1390000	1392000	to point out that
1392000	1394000	education should be a tool
1394000	1397000	to reduce inequality in society.
1397000	1398000	If we can think of it this way,
1398000	1400000	I think it's a very tempting idea.
1400000	1403000	But if we don't carefully measure
1403000	1407000	the social factors behind it,
1407000	1409000	such as race, class, etc.,
1409000	1412000	we may accidentally
1412000	1414000	cause more inequality.
1414000	1416000	So...
1416000	1418000	I want to bring this into today's topic.
1418000	1419000	My topic is
1419000	1421000	gender inequality in education.
1421000	1423000	What kind of inequality
1423000	1425000	does gender social factors
1425000	1427000	have in education?
1427000	1429000	So...
1431000	1432000	I forgot to show this page.
1432000	1435000	I put it here.
1435000	1436000	If you are interested in
1436000	1438000	finding out the picture
1438000	1439000	and reading it,
1439000	1441000	you can pause the video
1441000	1443000	and go to the link above.
1443000	1445000	But now...
1445000	1446000	I'm going to change it to
1446000	1448000	talk about the inequality of my topic today,
1448000	1451000	which is inequality in gender and education.
1451000	1455000	If we look at the 1960s,
1455000	1457000	there was a time when
1457000	1459000	girls couldn't even go to college.
1459000	1461000	Of course, we're a long way from that time.
1461000	1463000	A lot of things have happened in history,
1463000	1465000	such as the rise of feminism, etc.
1465000	1467000	We can see that the college degrees
1467000	1469000	and higher education degrees
1469000	1471000	that girls received
1471000	1473000	have been increasing.
1473000	1475000	It's getting higher and higher.
1475000	1476000	Very good.
1476000	1479000	If we look at the picture from 2016,
1479000	1481000	we can see that
1482000	1486000	the degrees that girls received
1486000	1488000	are even higher than that of boys
1488000	1490000	in colleges and universities.
1490000	1492000	So if we only look at
1492000	1496000	the effect of education,
1496000	1497000	we can say that
1497000	1499000	gender inequality
1499000	1501000	has been reduced to a very small extent
1501000	1503000	compared to before.
1503000	1506000	But today I still want to talk about this topic
1506000	1508000	because gender still has
1508000	1512000	an inequality in education.
1512000	1515000	If we don't look at the education level,
1515000	1518000	but look at what boys and girls are learning.
1518000	1522000	So I'm going to summarize this data
1522000	1524000	and compare different subjects,
1524000	1527000	and I chose the university level,
1527000	1530000	the university degrees given by different subjects
1530000	1531000	in 2015,
1531000	1534000	and draw the proportion of girls in those degrees.
1534000	1537000	So if we look at psychology,
1537000	1539000	we can see that
1539000	1542000	77% of psychology graduates
1542000	1544000	are girls.
1544000	1547000	So if we look at social science,
1547000	1549000	in the middle,
1549000	1551000	we can see that
1551000	1553000	half of the graduates are boys,
1553000	1555000	and half of the graduates are girls.
1555000	1557000	This picture is very interesting.
1557000	1560000	You can look at any subject you are interested in.
1560000	1562000	But one of the phenomena
1562000	1565000	is that if we look at the extreme level,
1565000	1567000	we can see that
1567000	1569000	there are very few girls
1569000	1571000	in the red area.
1571000	1573000	You will find that
1573000	1575000	they are all related to math,
1575000	1577000	including math itself,
1577000	1580000	physical science, engineering, and CS.
1580000	1583000	Especially if you look at engineering and CS,
1583000	1586000	there are only less than 20% of girls,
1586000	1588000	less than 20%.
1588000	1592000	Compared to the rest of the subjects,
1592000	1594000	it is very different.
1594000	1596000	The phenomenon I saw today
1596000	1598000	is that in math,
1598000	1601000	the number of boys is greater than the number of girls.
1601000	1604000	I call it gender inequality in STEM.
1604000	1606000	This phenomenon
1606000	1609000	has been studied by a lot of people.
1609000	1612000	It is also a phenomenon that everyone cares about.
1612000	1614000	Because there are a lot of people
1614000	1616000	who are interested in this phenomenon.
1616000	1618000	For example,
1618000	1620000	there are a lot of people
1620000	1622000	who are interested in STEM.
1622000	1624000	First of all,
1624000	1627000	STEM has been very popular in the past few years.
1627000	1630000	Many countries want to push STEM.
1630000	1632000	So you can imagine
1632000	1634000	if you don't let girls in,
1634000	1636000	do you lose a lot of your potential?
1636000	1638000	So now a lot of forces
1638000	1640000	want to push girls into STEM.
1640000	1642000	So this phenomenon
1642000	1644000	has been studied by a lot of people.
1644000	1646000	I will briefly summarize
1646000	1648000	some of the phenomena
1648000	1650000	that have been studied in STEM.
1650000	1652000	For example,
1652000	1654000	I divided this argument
1654000	1656000	into Nature and Nurture.
1656000	1658000	Of course,
1658000	1660000	most people will choose
1660000	1662000	the point they want to stand
1662000	1664000	between the two.
1664000	1666000	But if it is the Nurture side,
1666000	1668000	they will argue that
1668000	1670000	boys and girls are not equal
1670000	1672000	in the field of math.
1672000	1674000	This is a socialized phenomenon.
1674000	1676000	For example,
1676000	1678000	we have a stereotype
1678000	1680000	that boys study science
1680000	1682000	and girls study liberal arts.
1682000	1684000	This leads us to treat
1684000	1686000	boys and girls differently.
1686000	1688000	So it is a socialization process.
1688000	1690000	We socialize based on gender.
1690000	1692000	This is what we see today.
1692000	1694000	Other socialization processes,
1694000	1696000	for example,
1696000	1698000	when a child is just born,
1698000	1700000	he is a boy,
1700000	1702000	so we buy him a Lego.
1702000	1704000	If he is a girl,
1704000	1706000	we buy her a Lego.
1706000	1708000	We socialize based on gender.
1708000	1710000	This is what we see today.
1710000	1712000	Other socialization processes,
1712000	1714000	for example,
1714000	1716000	when a child is just born,
1716000	1718000	he is a boy,
1718000	1720000	so we buy him a Lego.
1720000	1722000	If he is a girl,
1722000	1724000	we buy her a Lego.
1724000	1726000	This is what we see today.
1726000	1728000	Other socialization processes,
1728000	1730000	for example,
1730000	1732000	when a child is just born,
1732000	1734000	he is a boy,
1734000	1736000	so we buy him a Lego.
1736000	1738000	If he is a girl,
1738000	1740000	we buy her a Lego.
1740000	1742000	This is what we see today.
1742000	1744000	Other socialization processes,
1744000	1746000	for example,
1746000	1748000	when a child is just born,
1748000	1750000	he is a boy,
1750000	1752000	so we buy him a Lego.
1752000	1754000	This is what we see today.
1754000	1756000	Other socialization processes,
1756000	1758000	for example,
1758000	1760000	when a child is just born,
1760000	1762000	he is a boy,
1762000	1764000	so we buy him a Lego.
1764000	1766000	This is what we see today.
1766000	1768000	Other socialization processes,
1768000	1770000	for example,
1770000	1770000	
1770000	1772000	he is a boy,
1772000	1774000	so we buy him a Lego.
1774000	1776000	This is what we see today.
1776000	1778000	Other socialization processes,
1778000	1780000	for example,
1780000	1782000	when a child is just born,
1782000	1784000	he is a boy.
1784000	1786000	This is what we see today.
1786000	1790000	If you look at the above topics,
1790000	1792000	family studies,
1792000	1794000	psychology, education,
1794000	1796000	you can study the gender inequality
1796000	1798000	in those areas.
1798000	1800000	However,
1800000	1802000	that is another group of people,
1802000	1804000	or another topic,
1804000	1806000	because you have to study
1806000	1808000	what is happening
1808000	1810000	in those areas.
1810000	1812000	However,
1812000	1814000	if there is no gender inequality,
1814000	1816000	then all the people
1816000	1818000	in the picture are in the 50s.
1818000	1820000	Obviously not.
1820000	1822000	This is what I want to talk about
1822000	1824000	today.
1824000	1826000	The following topics
1826000	1828000	are related to math.
1828000	1830000	So you mean
1830000	1832000	gender inequality
1832000	1834000	and inequality
1834000	1836000	of men
1836000	1838000	are two different things?
1838000	1840000	If you are simply saying
1840000	1842000	that the conclusion is
1842000	1844000	different in numbers,
1844000	1846000	of course it is the same.
1846000	1848000	However,
1848000	1850000	there are many reasons
1850000	1852000	behind the inequality.
1852000	1854000	For example,
1854000	1856000	in science,
1856000	1858000	science is a subject
1858000	1860000	that men study.
1860000	1862000	It is about science,
1862000	1864000	not psychology.
1864000	1866000	So if I use science
1866000	1868000	to explain psychology,
1868000	1870000	that is not right.
1870000	1872000	If I use psychology
1872000	1874000	to explain
1874000	1876000	gender inequality,
1876000	1878000	that is not right.
1878000	1880000	Does that make sense?
1880000	1882000	Does that make sense?
1882000	1884000	Okay.
1884000	1886000	Okay.
1886000	1888000	Maybe you are right.
1888000	1890000	Now I want to talk about
1890000	1892000	nature.
1892000	1894000	What I just said is
1894000	1896000	that the phenomenon
1896000	1898000	we see
1898000	1900000	is not caused by
1900000	1902000	individuals.
1902000	1904000	It is caused by
1904000	1906000	external social factors.
1906000	1908000	Nature is saying
1908000	1910000	that the phenomenon
1910000	1912000	we see
1912000	1914000	is caused by
1914000	1916000	gender inequality.
1916000	1918000	Whether it is
1918000	1920000	the degree of math,
1920000	1922000	or the attitude towards math,
1922000	1924000	it is different.
1924000	1926000	So we see
1926000	1928000	that
1928000	1930000	if everything
1930000	1932000	is socialized,
1932000	1934000	after so many years,
1934000	1936000	after so many years,
1936000	1938000	why is there still a gap?
1938000	1940000	It means that there is
1940000	1942000	an external force
1942000	1944000	to explain
1944000	1946000	this phenomenon.
1946000	1948000	And if
1948000	1950000	there is only
1950000	1952000	socialization,
1952000	1954000	then in a
1954000	1956000	gender-equal
1956000	1958000	society,
1958000	1960000	we should see this reduction,
1960000	1962000	but we don't.
1962000	1964000	They also
1964000	1966000	say that
1966000	1968000	there is a difference
1968000	1970000	between
1970000	1972000	women and men.
1972000	1974000	Women prefer
1974000	1976000	human-to-human interaction.
1976000	1978000	They also prefer
1978000	1980000	human-to-human interaction.
1980000	1982000	So maybe it is not
1982000	1984000	because of math,
1984000	1986000	but because women are
1986000	1988000	drawn to other areas,
1988000	1990000	such as medicine,
1990000	1992000	or architecture.
1992000	1994000	So if we
1994000	1996000	look at the numbers
1996000	1998000	and say that
1998000	2000000	we don't have 50%,
2000000	2002000	then it is incorrect.
2002000	2004000	Because we shouldn't have
2004000	2006000	set 50% at the beginning,
2006000	2008000	if women didn't want to
2008000	2010000	go into math.
2010000	2012000	It means that
2012000	2014000	although
2014000	2016000	there is no difference
2016000	2018000	in IQ
2018000	2020000	between men and women,
2020000	2022000	on average,
2022000	2024000	people don't say that
2024000	2026000	men are smarter than women.
2026000	2028000	However,
2028000	2030000	if you look at math,
2030000	2032000	men are better at
2032000	2034000	problem solving and mental rotation
2034000	2036000	than women,
2036000	2038000	and women are better at calculation.
2038000	2040000	So if you look at
2040000	2042000	higher education,
2042000	2044000	it is not about
2044000	2046000	basic calculation.
2046000	2048000	It is more about
2048000	2050000	problem solving
2050000	2052000	and mental rotation.
2052000	2054000	At that time,
2054000	2056000	you will see
2056000	2058000	the gender difference.
2058000	2060000	At the end,
2060000	2062000	both sides
2062000	2064000	will argue.
2064000	2066000	For example,
2066000	2068000	the last point,
2068000	2070000	even if there is
2070000	2072000	a gender difference at the beginning,
2072000	2074000	it is not over time.
2074000	2076000	For example,
2076000	2078000	when we take the exam,
2078000	2080000	we focus on the so-called
2080000	2082000	math that men are good at.
2082000	2084000	For example,
2084000	2086000	when you interview people,
2086000	2088000	you are looking at a specific
2088000	2090000	math talent.
2090000	2092000	So even if there is
2092000	2094000	a gender difference,
2094000	2096000	it is not over time.
2098000	2100000	That's it.
2102000	2104000	I briefly covered
2104000	2106000	some points
2106000	2108000	about gender inequality
2108000	2110000	in math.
2110000	2112000	I also posted a video
2112000	2114000	about two psychologists
2114000	2116000	who were invited
2116000	2118000	to give a speech
2118000	2120000	for Nature.
2120000	2122000	Although it was not
2122000	2124000	a public speech,
2124000	2126000	they gave a very
2126000	2128000	detailed and logical
2128000	2130000	speech.
2130000	2132000	You can watch it
2132000	2134000	if you are interested.
2134000	2136000	This list
2136000	2138000	can go on and on.
2138000	2140000	There are many
2140000	2142000	possible explanations.
2142000	2144000	At the beginning,
2144000	2146000	I said that
2146000	2148000	my research direction
2148000	2150000	is to see how social factors
2150000	2152000	affect personal development
2152000	2154000	and behavior.
2154000	2156000	As I said,
2156000	2158000	social factors affect
2158000	2160000	individuals,
2160000	2162000	I am more
2162000	2164000	on the side of Nature.
2164000	2166000	Next,
2166000	2168000	I will talk about
2168000	2170000	two projects I have done.
2170000	2172000	I will talk about
2172000	2174000	how they
2174000	2176000	discuss
2176000	2178000	how women
2178000	2180000	are more likely to
2180000	2182000	have more boys.
2184000	2186000	As I said,
2186000	2188000	social factors affect
2188000	2190000	individual psychological development
2190000	2192000	and behavior.
2192000	2194000	In the middle,
2194000	2196000	we need to identify
2196000	2198000	what we are interested in
2198000	2200000	in psychological development.
2200000	2202000	I chose to study motivation.
2202000	2204000	This is a psychological factor.
2204000	2206000	I am interested in
2206000	2208000	how social factors
2208000	2210000	affect psychological factors.
2210000	2212000	How does it affect
2212000	2214000	individual behavior?
2218000	2220000	The concept of
2220000	2222000	learning motivation
2222000	2224000	is abstract.
2224000	2226000	Many different scholars
2226000	2228000	have discussed it.
2228000	2230000	They use different theories
2230000	2232000	to define it.
2232000	2234000	Of course,
2234000	2236000	I can try different theories
2236000	2238000	and start from different theories.
2238000	2240000	The first project
2240000	2242000	I want to introduce
2242000	2244000	is a simple theory.
2244000	2246000	It is called
2246000	2248000	Fixed Growth Mindset.
2248000	2250000	The person who proposed this theory
2250000	2252000	wrote a book a few years ago.
2252000	2254000	It is very popular.
2254000	2256000	This theory has been studied a lot.
2256000	2258000	His theory
2258000	2260000	is very simple.
2260000	2262000	He divided learning motivation
2262000	2264000	into two categories.
2264000	2266000	The first one is
2266000	2268000	Fixed Mindset.
2268000	2270000	It means
2270000	2272000	whether you are good
2272000	2274000	in a certain subject.
2274000	2276000	Some people
2276000	2278000	don't have a good math brain.
2278000	2280000	This is Fixed Mindset.
2280000	2282000	Or
2282000	2284000	I am good at math.
2284000	2286000	Something like this.
2286000	2288000	The second category
2288000	2290000	is Growth Mindset.
2290000	2292000	It means
2292000	2294000	whether you are good
2294000	2296000	in a certain subject.
2296000	2298000	It depends on the person.
2298000	2300000	If I am lazy today,
2300000	2302000	no matter how smart I am,
2302000	2304000	after a while,
2304000	2306000	even if I am smart,
2306000	2308000	if I am lazy,
2308000	2310000	I might
2310000	2312000	turn from a math person
2312000	2314000	to a non-math person.
2314000	2316000	Even if I am not good at math,
2316000	2318000	if I work hard,
2318000	2320000	I might become a math person one day.
2322000	2324000	It is a very simple concept.
2326000	2328000	He proposed this
2328000	2330000	because he thinks
2330000	2332000	if we want to talk about
2332000	2334000	the outcome of math,
2334000	2336000	Growth Mindset
2336000	2338000	is healthier than Fixed Mindset.
2338000	2340000	Because
2340000	2342000	people always encounter setbacks.
2342000	2344000	If you are a Fixed Mindset person,
2344000	2346000	you can
2346000	2348000	put a label on yourself.
2348000	2350000	For example,
2350000	2352000	if I have a Fixed Mindset,
2352000	2354000	I am not a math person.
2354000	2356000	So,
2356000	2358000	it is less likely
2358000	2360000	to continue studying math.
2360000	2362000	On the other hand,
2362000	2364000	if you are a Growth Mindset person,
2364000	2366000	and you encounter setbacks,
2366000	2368000	your
2368000	2370000	learning motive will tell you
2370000	2372000	that it doesn't matter
2372000	2374000	because you still have room for improvement.
2376000	2378000	He proposed this
2378000	2380000	theory,
2380000	2382000	and there are many
2382000	2384000	researches that show
2384000	2386000	that Growth Mindset
2386000	2388000	is healthier
2388000	2390000	than Fixed Mindset.
2390000	2392000	It is also
2392000	2394000	better for future development.
2394000	2396000	If we add in gender,
2396000	2398000	I can ask
2398000	2400000	if the reason why
2400000	2402000	we see fewer girls
2402000	2404000	entering science classes
2404000	2406000	is because
2406000	2408000	of the setbacks
2408000	2410000	we encountered
2410000	2412000	before higher education.
2412000	2414000	If there are more
2414000	2416000	Growth Mindset students,
2416000	2418000	they can continue
2418000	2420000	entering higher education.
2420000	2422000	So,
2422000	2424000	we can see that
2424000	2426000	there are more boys
2426000	2428000	than girls.
2428000	2430000	So,
2430000	2432000	if we want to
2432000	2434000	improve our learning
2434000	2436000	motives,
2436000	2438000	we need to
2438000	2440000	think about
2440000	2442000	how to
2442000	2444000	improve our learning
2444000	2446000	motives.
2446000	2448000	So,
2448000	2450000	we need to
2450000	2452000	think about
2452000	2454000	how to
2454000	2456000	improve our learning
2456000	2458000	motives.
2458000	2460000	So,
2460000	2462000	we need to
2462000	2464000	think about
2464000	2466000	how to
2466000	2468000	improve our learning
2468000	2470000	motives.
2470000	2472000	So,
2472000	2474000	we need to
2474000	2476000	think about
2476000	2478000	how to
2478000	2480000	improve our learning
2480000	2482000	motives.
2482000	2484000	So,
2484000	2486000	we need to
2486000	2488000	think about
2488000	2490000	how to
2490000	2492000	improve our learning
2492000	2494000	motives.
2494000	2496000	So,
2496000	2498000	we need to
2498000	2500000	think about
2500000	2502000	how to
2502000	2504000	improve our
2504000	2506000	learning
2506000	2508000	motives.
2508000	2510000	So,
2510000	2512000	we need to
2512000	2514000	think about
2514000	2516000	how to
2516000	2518000	improve our
2518000	2520000	learning
2520000	2522000	motives.
2522000	2524000	So,
2524000	2526000	we need to
2526000	2528000	think about
2528000	2530000	how to
2530000	2532000	improve our
2532000	2534000	learning
2534000	2536000	motives.
2536000	2538000	So,
2538000	2540000	we need to
2540000	2542000	think about
2542000	2544000	how to
2544000	2546000	improve our
2546000	2548000	learning
2548000	2550000	motives.
2550000	2552000	So,
2552000	2554000	we need to
2554000	2556000	think about
2556000	2558000	how to
2558000	2560000	improve our
2560000	2562000	learning
2562000	2564000	motives.
2564000	2566000	So,
2566000	2568000	we need to
2568000	2570000	think about

2574000	2576000	learning
2576000	2578000	motives.
2578000	2580000	So,
2580000	2582000	we need to
2582000	2584000	think about
2584000	2586000	how to

2588000	2590000	learning
2590000	2592000	motives.
2592000	2594000	So,
