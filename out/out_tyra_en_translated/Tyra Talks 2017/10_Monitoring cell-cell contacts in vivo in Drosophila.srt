1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, no problem.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello everyone, I'm Dinghao.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm a postdoc at Caltech.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,920
The topic I'm going to talk about

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
is mainly my research on some of my papers.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,440
My research is about

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,320
designing an artificial system

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,320
and hoping to use that system to detect cell-cell contacts.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,520
My ultimate goal is to use this system

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,360
to dissect the entire neural circuit.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,800
Oh, in the field of neuroscience,

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,520
the most important answer that everyone wants to know

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,560
is how our brain functions,

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,040
so that we have all kinds of different emotions

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,040
and how reactions to the environment stimulate.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,440
How to stimulate.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
But about 100 years ago,

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Raymond Kahar had a very elegant study.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
And the elegant study proved that

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,680
our brain or neural system

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,040
is mainly operated by these neurons or other cells

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,840
to transmit all kinds of neural messages

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,880
and ultimately have a behavior.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,920
This is a very famous neural doctrine.

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,520
So a lot of research now

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,320
is focused on how different neurons

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,760
communicate with each other.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,840
This is a very complicated problem

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
because our brain is a huge machine.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,680
Like what I'm showing in this picture,

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
it's a reward circuit.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,840
This actually includes a lot of brain areas,

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,600
like the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex,

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,480
and the famous basal ganglia,

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,880
nucleus, convent, VTA.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,120
These different brain areas connect with each other

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
and operate and calculate

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,160
to achieve a goal.

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,800
And another more complicated aspect

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,280
is that even in the same brain area,

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,120
there are different neurons

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,320
that receive different messages.

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,960
And after synchronization,

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
it's transmitted to another brain area.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,160
And the calculation of the other brain area

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
may be transmitted back.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,920
So these connections are what we...

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,880
What we want to answer right now

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,200
is the idea of connectome.

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,440
We hope that by understanding these connectome,

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,880
we can have a blueprint

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,240
of how our brain or neural system

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,440
is wired.

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,560
And then we can use this basic knowledge

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,600
to calculate

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,160
the changes in the message transmission

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,080
of the neural cells

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,120
that may lead to different behaviors.

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
Like this.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,480
But in fact,

61
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,680
in addition to neural cells,

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,160
there are many other different cells,

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,800
such as glial cells.

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,560
Many studies have found that

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,720
these glial cells

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,080
actually affect the function of our neural neurons.

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
For example,

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
like this astrocyte,

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,600
the heart-shaped neural cell,

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
is...

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,920
It has been found that it can actually

72
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,480
clean up some of our neurotransmitters

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,480
and make it turn over faster.

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
And it's also found that...

75
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,960
Sorry.

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,040
It's found that it can actually transmit some signal

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,040
and affect the whole synaptic property.

78
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,560
So the connectome or microcircuit

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,120
that we originally thought of

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,440
is like this.

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
In addition to neural cells,

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,320
we still need to consider

83
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
the function of these neural glial cells

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,480
to have a more complete picture

85
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,240
of how our brain functions.

86
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,480
And then I mentioned earlier

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,720
that understanding these microcircuits

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,480
can help us know how our brain works.

89
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Another point is that

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
many...

91
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,320
We already know that there are many neurological disorders.

92
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
It actually has something to do with

93
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
the wiring of the neural circuit.

94
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,920
Like schizophrenia,

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,760
phrenia,

96
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,440
or some psychological diseases.

97
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,760
It actually has something to do with it.

98
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,200
If we know how the normal brain works,

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,760
we can further study

100
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,400
the causes of these disorders.

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,520
I hope to get some answers

102
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,400
to help these patients.

103
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,640
So far,

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,200
there are many different tools

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,840
that have been developed

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
to help us understand

107
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,520
how to dissect,

108
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,360
that is, to analyze the entire brain circuit

109
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,760
or neural connection.

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,600
Here are some examples that are commonly used.

111
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,800
For example, Serial Electron Microscopy,

112
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
which is an electronic microscope.

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,200
There is another one called GRASP.

114
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,640
Its full name is

115
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,600
GFP Green Fluorescent Protein Reconstitution

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
Across Synaptic Partner.

117
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,680
This means that it has a fluorescent protein

118
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,640
that divides engineering into two parts.

119
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,200
I will explain this later.

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,280
There is also Tango.

121
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,760
There is another popular tool

122
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,840
called Rabie Virus

123
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,520
to trace neural connection.

124
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,040
These are all great tools,

125
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,320
but they all have different

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,560
shortcomings.

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,920
For example, Serial EM

128
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,240
is to take a small sample

129
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,760
and cut it into pieces.

130
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,880
Then use EM to take the whole image

131
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,880
and then reconstruct it.

132
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,240
Then look at its very fine-detailed

133
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,240
neural morphology

134
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,120
or the connection of different neural cells.

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
Usually, a small one-millimeter-cube

136
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,880
size sample

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,920
takes about five or six years

138
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,800
to complete its analysis.

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,680
It also requires a lot of human power.

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,000
So this is not a very efficient method.

141
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
Because it is not very efficient,

142
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,040
it can only analyze a small sample of an animal.

143
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,320
If you want to analyze 10 different animals,

144
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
different variations,

145
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,600
it may be a bit difficult

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,360
or require more time and more manpower.

147
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,480
Another is CRESP, a genetic tool.

148
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,880
It can be used in

149
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,320
mice or

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm going to talk about Drosophila fruit flies.

151
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,800
It is mainly divided into two parts of this fluorescent protein.

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,040
Normally, it emits green light.

153
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,120
After dividing it into two parts,

154
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,680
they will not emit light.

155
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,960
Only when the two parts are very close,

156
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,800
they will be re-combined

157
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,280
like this.

158
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,480
So the two parts themselves do not emit light.

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,280
When they are re-combined, they will emit light,

160
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,120
and you can see the green light.

161
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,800
Then it can detect

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,880
that two cells are close to each other.

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Its disadvantage is that

164
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
it...

165
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
Sorry.

166
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,520
It can only see where it is in contact with.

167
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,560
It can't make any further modifications

168
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,600
to affect cell poverty.

169
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
In addition,

170
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,720
its binding is irreversible.

171
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,360
So there is a concern that

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,280
it may affect the connection between the cells.

173
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,640
The dynamic.

174
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
Connection to dynamic.

175
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
Another system is called Tango.

176
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,400
It mainly has a G-protein couple receptor.

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,760
Its feature is that

178
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,040
when it binds its ligand,

179
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,400
it will recruit a protein called arresting.

180
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,120
Arresting comes to activate

181
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,120
its downstream signaling transduction.

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Then the engineer added a protease to this protein.

183
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,600
Then this receptor has a transcription factor.

184
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,400
Then there is a sequence in front of it

185
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,680
that will be cut by this protease.

186
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,600
So when the protein is binded,

187
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,280
the protease will cut this part.

188
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Then it will release the intracellular transcription factor

189
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
and drive downstream gene excretion.

190
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,920
Its advantage is that

191
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,840
it has these reported proteins,

192
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,800
either fluorescent proteins

193
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,880
or mutant proteins.

194
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,360
You can control some of the features in its cells.

195
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,680
But the disadvantage is that

196
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,960
it is only limited to G-protein couple receptors.

197
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,480
In our neural system,

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
there are many...

199
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,800
For example, this is a dopamine receptor.

200
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,840
It is a G-protein couple receptor.

201
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,640
But there are many receptors that are just IN channels.

202
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,920
So it can't be used in this place.

203
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,680
In the mammalian,

204
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,680
there is a very popular tool

205
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,480
called re-engineering the RebVirus.

206
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,480
It can monosynaptically trace upstream neurons.

207
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,480
The point that needs to be considered

208
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,360
is that we need to do surgery

209
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,360
to inject this virus into the brain

210
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,080
to express,

211
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,480
to let this virus

212
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,480
to transmit to its Gag cells.

213
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,560
It has cytotoxicity.

214
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,200
So usually the research

215
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,240
can only be completed within a week.

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,840
Otherwise, the cells will die.

217
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,040
But another point is that

218
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I just mentioned that it can only be used in the mammalian.

219
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Even so, its efficiency is not very good.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,440
I have tried this tool before.

221
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,160
Different brain regions.

222
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,760
Some brain regions may have special neurons.

223
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,760
It's harder to let the RebVirus

224
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,040
jump to their upstream partner.

225
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,960
So the important purpose of my research

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
is to generate a system

227
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,240
that can be used on all transgenic animals.

228
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,480
I hope it won't have any toxicity.

229
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,680
So we can safely study

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the property and function of these cells.

231
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,280
In addition to tracing the neuron

232
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,360
or the connection between the cells,

233
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,000
we can also manipulate their property.

234
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,760
So my main design here is that

235
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,560
if a cell, not necessarily a neuron,

236
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,240
has a ligand

237
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,240
and the other cells have a corresponding receptor,

238
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,120
when these two cells have contact,

239
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,440
the binding will generate a cell signaling

240
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,240
to the downstream cell.

241
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Then we can either express some fluorescent reporter protein,

242
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,680
or express some gene or mutant that we are interested in.

243
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,080
Or it can be RNAi.

244
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,080
So here, we used a very important

245
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,080
signaling pathway in animals,

246
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Delta protein and Notch protein's signaling pathway.

247
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
So let me briefly introduce

248
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
the structure of Notch protein.

249
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,080
It has a very long hRSA domain.

250
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Most of it is EGF repeat.

251
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,080
This domain will bind its ligand, Delta,

252
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,080
and when they bind,

253
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,080
the current hypothesis is that

254
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,080
if the ligand is endocytosed,

255
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,080
that is, if it is brought in by the cell membrane,

256
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
it will generate a force.

257
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,080
It will open this structure called NRR.

258
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,080
After Notch binds,

259
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,080
there will be two cutting points

260
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,080
that will be cut off by Proteus.

261
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,080
One is S2 and the other is S3.

262
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,080
So the original S2 cutting point

263
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,080
is in the NRR structure.

264
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,080
So it's embedded inside the structure,

265
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,080
and Proteus can't digest the S2 site.

266
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,080
So it won't be cut off

267
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
until Delta binds.

268
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,080
After it binds, it opens this structure,

269
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,080
and the S2 site can be cut off.

270
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Next, its transmembrane domain

271
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
also has a cutting point called S3.

272
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
S3 will also be cut off.

273
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Then its intracellular domain

274
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
is a transcription factor.

275
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
It can move to the cell membrane

276
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,080
to activate downstream gene expression.

277
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,080
So here we use this logic.

278
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,080
We replace some domains

279
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,080
that will affect the cell's endogenous domain,

280
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
like EGF repeat,

281
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
it will bind the endogenous Delta ligand.

282
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:00,080
So we replace it with an antibody here.

283
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Then its intracellular domain

284
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,080
will drive endogenous downstream gene expression.

285
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
So we also replace it

286
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,080
with a yeast transcription factor called GAL4.

287
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,080
So our idea is that

288
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,080
our new synthetic receptor

289
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,080
can recognize its own ligand.

290
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,080
I'm using CD19 here.

291
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
After it binds,

292
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,080
it uses the NRR domain in the middle

293
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
and transmembrane domain.

294
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,080
It will have S2, S3 cleavage.

295
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Then it will release intracellular GAL4.

296
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Then it can drive either GFP

297
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
or any gene expression.

298
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
It depends on what kind of study we want to do.

299
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,080
We call this whole section track.

300
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,080
It's Transcellular Activation of Transcription.

301
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,080
First, I'll test

302
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,080
whether our designed ligand and receptor can work.

303
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,080
So we use it in the cell line.

304
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Here I show you the control.

305
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Red represents the ligand.

306
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,080
The cell line with or without ligand.

307
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,080
My reporter is GFP.

308
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,080
So when you see the cell with receptor,

309
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
it has no GFP

310
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,080
because the co-culture cell has no ligand.

311
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,080
When I change the co-culture cell

312
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,080
to the cell with CD19,

313
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:13,080
you can see that most of the receptors

314
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,080
and positive cells

315
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,080
start to show GFP.

316
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Here you can see the difference in the amount of GFP.

317
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,080
You can see that the amount of GFP

318
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,080
increases with the co-culture time.

319
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,080
The blue line is the control cell.

320
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,080
The orange line is the test group.

321
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,080
To make sure that they have cell-cell contact,

322
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,080
not because my ligand-positive cell

323
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,080
releases any weird factor

324
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,080
to trigger the downstream gene expression.

325
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:11,080
So I put the receptor cell

326
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,080
and the ligand-positive cell

327
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,080
in the same play.

328
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
But I put less CD19.

329
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,080
So they generate their own colonies.

330
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,080
When they grow up,

331
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
only when the two colonies

332
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
have direct contact with each other,

333
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,080
the ligand-cell line and the receptor-cell line

334
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
will have contact.

335
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,080
This is the receptor-positive colony.

336
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,080
This is the ligand-positive colony.

337
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Only when they have direct contact with each other,

338
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,080
the cells produce green ligand.

339
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
The rest are dark.

340
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,080
We use the cell-cell line to prove

341
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,080
that our system can function normally

342
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,080
and detect cell-cell contact.

343
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,080
We hope to use it in the in vivo system.

344
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
We use the fruit-gene model.

345
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,080
It is a well-established genetic model.

346
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,080
We have a lot of tools to study it.

347
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,080
The life cycle is relatively short.

348
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,080
The fruit-gene model is about two weeks

349
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,080
from the soft to the mature.

350
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,080
The most important thing is that

351
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,080
the nerve system is similar to the mammalian brain.

352
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,080
We hope to use the nerve system

353
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,080
to imply the mammalian brain.

354
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
We hope to use the nerve system

355
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,080
to imply the mammalian brain.

356
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Let me briefly introduce the central nervous system of Drosophila.

357
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,080
They still have neurons and glia.

358
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Their neurons are not like our brain.

359
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,080
There are a bunch of neurons in the brain.

360
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Their synapses are in the same area.

361
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Drosophila's cell body is mainly

362
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,080
around the edge of the nervous system.

363
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,080
around the edge of the nervous system.

364
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,080
These regions have no synapses or connections.

365
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,080
These regions have no synapses or connections.

366
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,080
This is the area where the synapse is located.

367
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,080
This is the area where the synapse is located.

368
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Besides neurons, there are many other glia cells.

369
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I will introduce these in more detail later.

370
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,080
I will introduce these in more detail later.

371
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,080
One thing to remember is that

372
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,080
most of the things I will talk about later are not neurons.

373
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,080
most of the things I will talk about later are not neurons.

374
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,080
First, we want to test

375
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,080
whether our system can detect any different cell-cell contact.

376
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,080
First, we want to test

377
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,080
whether our system can detect any different cell-cell contact.

378
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Next, we want to see

379
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:25,080
whether our system can detect

380
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,080
neural-to-neural contact.

381
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Next, we want to see

382
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,080
whether our system can detect

383
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,080
neural-to-neural contact.

384
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,080
First, it's glial-to-neural.

385
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,080
There are different types of glial cells

386
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,080
in ToSoftware.

387
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Different glial cells

388
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,080
have different levels of contact.

389
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,080
For example,

390
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,080
surface glial

391
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,080
is like a protective film.

392
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,080
They don't have much contact

393
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,080
with other types of glial cells.

394
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,080
For example, cortex glial

395
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,080
is protected by

396
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,080
neural soma.

397
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,080
Astrocyte is infiltrated

398
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,080
by synapse.

399
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Different types of astrocyte

400
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,080
have more contact with neural soma.

401
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,080
First,

402
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,080
if a person is in a glial cell,

403
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,080
can we detect neural-to-neural contact?

404
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,080
We display receptor protein

405
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,080
in all neurons.

406
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Next, we display it

407
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,080
in glial cell ligand.

408
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,080
The diagram shows

409
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,080
the lava brain of Drosophila.

410
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,080
There are two parts, the central brain

411
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,080
and the ventral nerve core,

412
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,080
which is like the spinal cord.

413
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,080
If there is no ligand,

414
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Drosophila's background is weak.

415
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Only in other tissues.

416
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,080
When ligand is shown in astrocytes,

417
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,080
many neurons are labeled.

418
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,080
This is because

419
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,080
ligand and receptor are combined

420
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,080
to trigger GFP protein.

421
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,080
This is another driver.

422
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,080
It is called ELAM.

423
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,080
This is an astrocyte-specific gene.

424
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,080
As you can see,

425
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,080
ligand is shown in astrocytes.

426
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,080
Ripple is shown in glial cells.

427
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,080
The pattern is different.

428
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,080
The pattern is different.

429
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,080
The pattern is different.

430
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,080
I will zoom in later.

431
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,080
I will zoom in later.

432
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,080
We don't see much GFP expression.

433
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,080
We don't see much GFP expression.

434
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,080
I will zoom in later.

435
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,080
I will zoom in later.

436
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,080
I will zoom in later.

437
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,080
I will zoom in later.

438
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,080
We don't see much ligand expression.

439
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,080
We don't see much ligand expression.

440
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,080
The neurons project the process

441
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,080
to the glial cells.

442
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,080
to the glial cells.

443
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,080
That's the reason

444
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,080
the neurons show strong GFP expression.

445
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,080
that's the reason the neurons show strong GFP expression.

446
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Now,

447
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,080
this proves

448
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,080
that this tool can work in Drosophila.

449
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Can we use our system

450
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,080
to label astrocytes?

451
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Mainly because

452
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,080
astrocytes has been proven

453
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,080
to control synaptic function.

454
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,080
to control synaptic function.

455
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,080
It can adjust synaptic contact

456
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,080
It can adjust synaptic contact

457
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,080
to remove unused synaptic

458
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,080
It can help synaptic formation

459
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,080
It can help synaptic formation

460
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,080
It can help synaptic formation

461
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,080
astrocyte is able to help

462
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,080
neurotransmitter

463
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,080
it can control the neurotransmitter release

464
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:33,080
It can control neuronal activity

465
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,080
In theory, all these studies depict

466
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,080
that astrocytes are homogenous

467
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,080
So now they explore

468
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,080
if you knock down gene function

469
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,080
or mutate gene

470
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,080
all the astrocytes will be affected

471
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Studies can't say

472
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,080
I want to look at this area

473
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:18,080
to change this part of the astrocyte

474
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,080
to look at the specific function of this part of the astrocyte

475
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,080
So we want to use our system

476
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,080
if we can selectively label

477
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:40,080
the neurons in the brain

478
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,080
we can selectively label

479
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:52,080
the astrocytes in the brain

480
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,080
So our idea is

481
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,080
we want to show the ligand in a different way

482
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
in the neuron

483
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,080
this neuron innovates this neuron

484
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,080
There are many different astrocytes around here

485
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Maybe only a part of it will go to this place

486
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,080
to control the function of this neuron

487
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,080
We just want to selectively label this astrocyte

488
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:28,080
and not this astrocyte

489
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,080
So we want to show the receptor in all the astrocytes

490
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:41,080
and show the ligand in different neurons

491
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:48,080
and selectively label the sub-population of the astrocytes

492
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:56,080
I hope we can study the astrocyte function more precisely after the improvement

493
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,080
So the first thing I use is

494
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,080
the same brain of the fruit fly

495
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,080
The first choice is the mushroom body neuron

496
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:24,080
There are about 600 mushroom body neurons called K-on cells in the brain

497
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:30,080
The reason why people are interested in mushroom body

498
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:38,080
is because it is an important structure of alphanumeric learning and memory

499
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,080
So here we show you a control

500
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,080
If there is no ligand in the K-on cells

501
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,080
then we see very few alphanumeric cells

502
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,080
The purple here is the glial cell marker

503
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,080
So I just want to tell you

504
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,080
After we label these cells, it will actually be a glial cell

505
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,080
So when I show the ligand in the mushroom body

506
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:21,080
We can see that we label the astrocytes around it

507
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,080
So the red here is the mushroom body

508
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:34,080
We can see that these astrocytes

509
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,080
This is a single-plane confocal image

510
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,080
So we can see that these astrocytes are really

511
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,080
how to say

512
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,080
next to the ligand positive neuron process

513
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,080
They have intermingled to each other

514
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,080
It's surrounded by the ligand positive cell

515
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,080
We want to further test our system

516
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,080
how robust our system is

517
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,080
So we want to use fewer cells

518
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,080
So there were about 600 mushroom body neurons

519
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Now there are only 21 alphanumeric neurons

520
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,080
The alphanumeric neuron is the cell body

521
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,080
It's at the tip of the head

522
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,080
It will project a very long axon

523
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,080
to the Drosophila lava brain

524
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,080
This area is called the antenna lobe

525
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:44,080
It's a bit like our mammalian sleeves

526
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,080
They will receive the olfactory sensory input

527
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,080
The first thing we see here is the control

528
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Without ligand, the antenna lobe is very clean

529
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:06,080
When the ligand is shown in the olfactory sensory neuron axon terminal

530
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,080
We can label these astrocytes

531
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,080
that infiltrate the antenna lobe region

532
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,080
We want to narrow it down further

533
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,080
to four cells

534
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Here we use a PDF neuron

535
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,080
It's a very important circadian pacemaker

536
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:43,080
If you remember, this year's Nobel Peace Prize

537
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,080
was about the function of the PDF neuron

538
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,080
There are only four PDF neurons in the lava brain

539
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,080
in each hemisphere

540
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,080
They only have a very thin axon

541
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,080
and project to the dorsal part of the brain

542
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,080
We want to see if our system can detect

543
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:21,080
such a small connection between the astrocyte and the axon

544
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Contact

545
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Here I show you the control

546
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,080
I forgot to mention

547
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,080
The PDF neurons I use

548
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:40,080
are not only in the central brain

549
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,080
but also in the ventral nerve core

550
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:49,080
These are the PDF positive neurons

551
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:55,080
I also look at the ventral nerve core

552
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Here we can see that the control is very clean

553
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,080
If a ligand is present in the PDF neuron

554
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,080
We can label the astrocytes

555
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,080
that make contact with the PDF neuron

556
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Here I show you a few different samples

557
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,080
We can see that our system is very consistent

558
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:31,080
We can see consistent labeling in different animals

559
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,080
The next question we want to ask is

560
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Can our system let us understand

561
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,080
compared to the previous study

562
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:57,080
what's the new thing that we can know by our system

563
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:03,080
The previous study showed that

564
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:10,080
the astrocyte in the ventral nerve core

565
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:18,080
the distribution is very stereotypical

566
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Different astrocytes

567
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:29,080
are located in different locations

568
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,080
They are located in different locations

569
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,080
They are located in a fixed area

570
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,080
For example, the red astrocyte

571
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,080
is in the dorsal lateral part of the ventral nerve core

572
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:49,080
It only innovates the dorsal lateral part

573
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:55,080
It only labels the lateral part of the ventral nerve core

574
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,080
The yellow one is in the dorsal midline

575
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,080
It labels the dorsal midline part of the ventral nerve core

576
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,080
The astrocyte in the ventral part

577
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:15,080
labels the ventral midline part of the ventral nerve core

578
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,080
This study shows that

579
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,080
the astrocyte is boring

580
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,080
It doesn't change much

581
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:32,080
The ventral nerve core is a very stereotypical structure

582
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,080
It's a different repeat of the neural mirror

583
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:44,080
It's a different repeat of the neural mirror

584
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,080
It's a repeated circuit

585
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I don't know if the central brain has a more complex system

586
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,080
I don't know if the central brain has a more complex system

587
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:07,080
I use LIGAND to represent the Ophiatory Sensor Neuron

588
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I use LIGAND to represent the Ophiatory Sensor Neuron

589
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:23,080
We want to know if the astrocyte near the ventral nerve

590
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:28,080
has a different distribution

591
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,080
We have the induction

592
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,080
We divide the ventral nerve into 8 different areas

593
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:44,080
I want to see where the astrocyte is

594
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,080
I found that the cell body of the astrocyte

595
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,080
I found that the cell body of the astrocyte

596
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,080
is mainly in the medial part

597
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,080
is mainly in the medial part

598
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:10,080
the medial sector and the ventral lateral sector

599
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:17,080
This is more in line with the previous research

600
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,080
where is the astrocyte near the ventral nerve

601
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:27,080
They also know that it is mainly in these two parts

602
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:34,080
But further research on the distribution of different individuals

603
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:47,080
I found that the astrocyte infiltration is different

604
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:56,080
In the brain, the astrocyte is mainly located in the lateral part

605
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,080
In the brain, the astrocyte is mainly located in the lateral part

606
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:06,080
The astrocyte is mainly in the medial part

607
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,080
The astrocyte is mainly in the medial part

608
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:21,080
The two areas are only one astrocyte

609
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,080
The two areas are only one astrocyte

610
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:31,080
But in this area, I have labeled three different astrocytes

611
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:39,080
In conclusion, in the central brain of Drosophila

612
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,080
it is not as stereotypical as the ventral nerve core

613
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,080
it has more diversity or change

614
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:52,080
it has more diversity or change

615
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:57,080
We hope that in the future

616
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:04,080
we can use our system to manipulate the astrocyte properties

617
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,080
and see if the population of the astrocyte

618
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,080
will affect any special function

619
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,080
or it actually needs a larger population

620
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,080
or it actually needs a larger population

621
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:30,080
to manipulate the neural signaling path

622
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:36,080
In addition, I only study the astrocyte

623
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,080
In the future, we hope to expand our tool

624
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,080
In addition to the astrocyte glial cell

625
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,080
we can study other different glial cells

626
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,080
such as cortex glial

627
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,080
It is wrapped outside the cell neurons

628
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:58,080
Its function is probably very different from the astrocyte

629
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,080
We hope to do further research in the future

630
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:10,080
In the next part, I want to focus on neural-to-neural

631
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:24,080
We use the same design

632
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,080
to test whether it can be used in

633
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,080
tracing neural-to-neural connection

634
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:37,080
We mainly focus on Drosophila's olfactory system

635
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,080
I mentioned the olfactory sensor neuron

636
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,080
Why do we want to use this system?

637
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Because the connectome here has been studied very thoroughly

638
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,080
It can be used in DSN or EM

639
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:05,080
It can be used in DSN or EM

640
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
So we know that

641
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:14,080
if we express the ligand on a certain type of neuron

642
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,080
it may be connected to some different neurons

643
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,080
So we can know if our system

644
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,080
has only labeled some new things

645
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,080
or if it has missed some different things

646
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,080
to test whether our system is perfect

647
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,080
So in the antenna lobe

648
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,080
the olfactory sensor neuron we just mentioned

649
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,080
will project its axon to the antenna lobe

650
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,080
Different olfactory sensor neurons

651
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,080
will only show one olfactory receptor

652
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:04,080
These olfactory sensor neurons

653
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,080
will only innovate to a certain

654
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:15,080
antenna lobe called gomulus

655
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:23,080
It will be connected to a certain type of projection neuron

656
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:29,080
The projection neuron is green

657
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,080
It will pass the olfactory sensor input

658
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,080
to the olfactory system

659
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,080
like the mushroom body

660
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,080
In addition to the projection neuron

661
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,080
the antenna lobe has another type of neuron

662
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,080
called local interneuron

663
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,080
It is a GABAergic inhibitor neuron

664
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,080
It will innovate the entire antenna lobe

665
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:05,080
to be a bridge between different gomulus

666
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:14,080
In the LABA central nervous system

667
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,080
if there is no ligand

668
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,080
we can see that the background is very weak

669
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,080
There is no other labeling

670
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:34,080
But if I put the ligand in the olfactory sensor neuron

671
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,080
we can see that

672
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:45,080
we can label a few downstream neurons

673
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,080
There are some markers

674
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,080
These neurons are GABAergic neurons

675
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:01,080
It means that they are local interneurons

676
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,080
But in this case

677
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,080
we don't see the main projection neurons

678
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,080
being labeled

679
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,080
So

680
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,080
So

681
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,080
So

682
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,080
So

683
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,080
So

684
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,080
So

685
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,080
In the current design

686
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:32,080
The track system

687
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,080
is not yet

688
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,080
How to say

689
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
optimized

690
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,080
to detect

691
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
neural neural contact

692
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,080
So

693
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,080
We missed a lot

694
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,080
We want to say that there will be labels

695
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Maybe

696
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,080
labeled neurons

697
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,080
So in the future

698
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,080
we may need to make further improvements

699
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,080
to improve our system

700
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,080
to make use of the new neural circuits

701
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,080
There are some new promising results

702
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,080
Hope to share with you soon

703
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,080
I think that's it

704
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,080
Thank you

705
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:40,080
Hello

706
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:49,080
How this is

707
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:56,080
Hello

708
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,080
Hi

709
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:06,080
Hello

710
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,080
Can you hear me?

711
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,080
Yes

712
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,080
I see a question

713
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:19,080
Can we use it on humans?

714
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,080
At the moment, we can't

715
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,080
Because we can't

716
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,080
Because my system is mainly used on

717
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,080
transgenic animals

718
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,080
So I don't know if CRISPR

719
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,080
will develop to what level

720
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,080
Will it be able to generate transgenic humans?

721
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,080
If it doesn't work

722
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,080
then we probably

723
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,080
can't use it

724
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
And

725
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,080
But the advantage of this tool is

726
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,080
we can use it on different animals

727
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,080
If CRISPR is so successful

728
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,080
then it can be very convenient

729
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,080
to use it on transgenic

730
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,080
like a fish

731
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,080
or other non-genetic

732
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,080
or other non-genetic

733
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,080
For example

734
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,080
I saw a dolphin

735
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,080
It has a very special behavior

736
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,080
It draws a beautiful picture to attract the opposite sex

737
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,080
I think its neural circuit is really amazing

738
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,080
I want to study it

739
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,080
If we use my tool

740
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,080
and add CRISPR

741
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:54,080
I think it can be used on different animals

742
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,080
That is to say

743
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,080
But

744
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,080
We still need to improve

745
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,080
to make my system more promising

746
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,080
more robust

747
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,080
And

748
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,080
I don't know if there are any other questions

749
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,080
Hello

750
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,080
I have a question

751
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,080
It's a simple question

752
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,080
Do you experiment with mice?

753
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,080
Is it a mouse?

754
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Or a bird?

755
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,080
You just said a mouse

756
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
Do you experiment with a bird?

757
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,080
Yes

758
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,080
Is it alive?

759
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,080
The experiments on behavior are all alive

760
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,080
But in the end we need to sacrifice them

761
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:06,080
and study the changes in their brains

762
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,080
or something

763
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:14,080
Is it still alive?

764
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,080
Is it conscious?

765
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,080
Or is it dead?

766
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,080
Just take out its brain

767
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,080
and see what happens

768
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,080
Both

769
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:33,080
Now we have a postdoc

770
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,080
He is using

771
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,080
He is making a miniature microscope

772
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,080
Let me see if I can

773
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,080
Sorry, can you hear me?

774
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,080
Yes

775
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,080
Our house was on fire

776
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,080
and I was kicked out

777
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
What happened?

778
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,080
Anyway, I was kicked out

779
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,080
and now I'm back

780
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,080
There is no internet out there

781
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,080
It's ok

782
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,080
You just said

783
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,080
Yuqing

784
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,080
Yuqing, right?

785
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
Yes

786
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,080
He asked

787
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,080
Do you experiment with a mouse?

788
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
Is it alive?

789
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,080
The experiments on behavior are all alive

790
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,080
We have a postdoc

791
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,080
who made a small microscope

792
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,080
and put it on their heads

793
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
and put it on their heads

794
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,080
and put it on their heads

795
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,080
We hope that

796
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,080
we can see

797
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,080
and add some

798
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,080
photoreceptors

799
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,080
and they can see

800
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,080
the neural activity

801
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,080
We want to use these two things

802
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,080
to see the brain of a living animal

803
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,080
to see the brain of a living animal

804
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,080
how a living animal

805
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,080
how a living animal

806
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,080
how a living animal

807
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,080
lives

808
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,080
Most of the cases are

809
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,080
after we do the research

810
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,080
even after the behavior

811
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,080
we will sacrifice the mouse

812
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,080
we will sacrifice the mouse

813
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,080
and then see

814
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,080
whether our modifications

815
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,080
have changed

816
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,080
whether our modifications

817
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,080
have changed

818
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,080
How do I get my video out?

819
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,080
I feel like you said

820
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,080
you made the microscope very small

821
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,080
and then put it on your head

822
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,080
and look at it

823
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,080
I feel like it's amazing

824
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,080
There is a company

825
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,080
that specializes in

826
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,080
selling this device

827
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,080
selling this device

828
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,080
selling a super small microscope

829
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,080
selling a super small microscope

830
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,080
but it still has some

831
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,080
but it still has some

832
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,080
disadvantages

833
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,080
like it can't adjust

834
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,080
focus

835
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,080
it can only observe

836
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,080
the surface

837
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,080
the surface

838
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,080
of the brain

839
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,080
Isn't that supposed to be

840
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,080
on the head?

841
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,080
Isn't that supposed to be

842
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,080
on the head?

843
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,080
Isn't that supposed to be

844
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,080
on the head?

845
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,080
Do you have that

846
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,080
Do you have that

847
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,080
I can't remember his name

848
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,080
I can't remember his name

849
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,080
I can't remember his name

850
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,080
Let me think

851
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,080
KALTECH

852
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,080
Ni Yuli

853
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,080
Ni Yuli

854
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,080
Did you talk to him?

855
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,080
because they now

856
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,080
do non-invasive

857
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,080
do non-invasive

858
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,080
and they want to

859
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,080
the firing pattern

860
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,080
the firing pattern

861
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,080
but they want to

862
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,080
do it on people

863
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,080
because you can't

864
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,080
do it on people

865
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,080
and I was thinking

866
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,080
I don't know if you talked about this

867
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,080
I posted a question

868
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,080
because

869
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,080
if you do it like this

870
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,080
either

871
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,080
Guoying's head

872
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,080
has to be very transparent

873
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,080
or you have to

874
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,080
put something on the rat's bone

875
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,080
but I don't think it's possible on people

876
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,080
yeah

877
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,080
because

878
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,080
my system

879
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,080
has two things

880
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,080
you have to etopic express

881
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,080
two ligand and receptor

882
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,080
and reporter, three

883
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,080
yeah

884
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,080
if you can't

885
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,080
do something like

886
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,080
transgenic animal or

887
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,080
other virus

888
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,080
there's nothing you can do

889
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,080
and human brain

890
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,080
has limitations

891
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,080
but

892
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
I mentioned

893
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,080
I don't know if you're here

894
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,080
and

895
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,080
CRISPR

896
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,080
is very popular

897
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,080
it can

898
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,080
make it easier

899
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,080
for us

900
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,080
to change

901
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,080
different animal

902
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,080
genetic profile

903
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,080
you can do transgenic animal

904
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,080
so

905
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,080
using

906
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,080
CRISPR

907
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,080
we should have more opportunities

908
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,080
to test on different

909
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,080
animals

910
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,080
like rabies virus

911
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,080
this

912
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,080
tool is very good

913
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,080
there's a lot of paper

914
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,080
published

915
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,080
but the problem is

916
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,080
we can't use

917
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,080
on birds

918
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,080
because

919
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,080
birds can't get rabies

920
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,080
that's rabies virus

921
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,080
so

922
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,080
this tool

923
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,080
because it's transgenic

924
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,080
if CRISPR looks promising

925
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,080
we can use it

926
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,080
on different animals

927
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,080
like I mentioned

928
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,080
I saw

929
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,080
dolphin

930
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,080
not dolphin

931
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,080
dolphin

932
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,080
puffer fish

933
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,080
puffer fish

934
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,080
dolphin

935
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,080
it has

936
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,080
a very strange

937
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,080
behavior

938
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,080
it will draw

939
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,080
on the sand

940
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,080
very

941
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,080
symmetric pattern

942
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,080
to attract

943
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,080
it will feel

944
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,080
amazing

945
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,080
if I have a chance

946
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,080
I want to study

947
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,080
animal brain

948
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,080
really?

949
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,080
why?

950
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,080
I don't know

951
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,080
but the pattern

952
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,080
it draws

953
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,080
is like

954
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,080
wheat field

955
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,080
very big

956
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,080
like this

957
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,080
for its size

958
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,080
it's big

959
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,080
so I think

960
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,080
it's interesting

961
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,080
ok

962
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,080
but for humans

963
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,080
because it's transgenic

964
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,080
the tool we can use

965
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,080
is functional MRI

966
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,080
but

967
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,080
it can't be that good

968
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,080
so I'm

969
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,080
thinking

970
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,080
how to

971
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,080
understand

972
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,080
our

973
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,080
animal brain

974
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,080
I was thinking

975
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,080
if you change

976
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,080
LIGAND to

977
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,080
some

978
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,080
magnetic field

979
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,080
or electrical field

980
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,080
you can use

981
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,080
MRI

982
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,080
to locate it

983
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,080
but the resolution

984
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,080
is not high enough

985
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,080
it looks like a piece

986
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,080
here and there

987
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,080
so it's useless

988
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,080
yes

989
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,080
I remember

990
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,080
I saw

991
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,080
a speech

992
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,080
he was using

993
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,080
X-ray

994
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,080
to look at

995
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,080
the structure

996
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,080
of the brain

997
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,080
he

998
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,080
he chose

999
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,080
very small

1000
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,080
X-ray is very traditional

1001
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,080
so I think

1002
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,080
they want to say

1003
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,080
if they use X-ray

1004
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,080
to dissect the brain

1005
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,080
the resolution will be good

1006
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,080
maybe in the future

1007
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,080
it can be used

1008
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,080
in human

1009
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,080
or large animals

1010
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,080
ok

1011
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,080
like this

1012
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,080
but

1013
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,080
I don't know

1014
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,080
how much

1015
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,080
it can be

1016
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,080
maybe in the future

1017
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,080
maybe

1018
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,080
I think

1019
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,080
there's a big gap

1020
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,080
I think

1021
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,080
animal model

1022
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,080
can help a lot

1023
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,080
but animal model

1024
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,080
and human

1025
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,080
there's a gap

1026
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,080
both sides

1027
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,080
both sides

1028
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,080
don't know how to cross

1029
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,080
there's no bridge

1030
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,080
yes

1031
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,080
maybe

1032
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,080
the closest

1033
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,080
is

1034
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,080
primate

1035
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,080
primate

1036
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,080
yes

1037
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,080
I think

1038
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,080
especially in my department

1039
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,080
it's very obvious

1040
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,080
if it's primate

1041
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,080
it's

1042
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,080
obvious

1043
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,080
like

1044
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,080
aggression

1045
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,080
mating behavior

1046
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,080
or even

1047
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,080
hierarchy

1048
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,080
but if it's higher

1049
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,080
like stroke

1050
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,080
primate

1051
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,080
it's very close

1052
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,080
but if it's

1053
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,080
social, complicated social behavior

1054
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,080
like

1055
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,080
psychology

1056
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,080
people do jealousy

1057
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,080
this thing

1058
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,080
I've heard people say

1059
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,080
that

1060
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,080
they do love

1061
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,080
on mice

1062
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,080
and they say

1063
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,080
it's not just mating, it's love

1064
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,080
and I think

1065
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,080
how do you know what love is

1066
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,080
it hurts

1067
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,080
yes

1068
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,080
yes

1069
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,080
so

1070
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,080
I was thinking

1071
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,080
this system

1072
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,080
the limit

1073
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,080
but

1074
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,080
on human

1075
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,080
there's still

1076
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,080
human

1077
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,080
brain function

1078
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,080
limitation

1079
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,080
yes

1080
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,080
yes

1081
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,080
yes

1082
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,080
but

1083
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,080
human

1084
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,080
can't do research

1085
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,080
yes

1086
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,080
but I think it's cool

1087
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,080
I think your

1088
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,080
resolution is really high

1089
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,080
it's quite

1090
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,080
quite big

1091
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,080
I don't know where the people in the front sit

1092
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,080
but I feel it's quite amazing

1093
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,080
and

1094
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,080
it increases a lot

1095
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,080
you can see very detailed things

1096
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,080
actually

1097
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,080
because it's mainly

1098
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,080
social contact

1099
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,080
so it depends on

1100
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,080
we can test

1101
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,080
its sensitivity

1102
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,080
what minimal

1103
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,080
area you need

1104
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,080
to detect

1105
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,080
to see the difference

1106
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,080
so

1107
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,080
yes

1108
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,080
it depends on

1109
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,080
how much

1110
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,080
you can touch

1111
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,080
and your

1112
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,080
concentration

1113
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,080
is it high enough

1114
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,080
to see

1115
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,080
downstream

1116
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,080
but you can

1117
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,080
adjust it

1118
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,080
my main work

1119
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,080
is to adjust

1120
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,080
this tool

1121
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,080
so it can be used

1122
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,080
on

1123
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,080
neural circuits

1124
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,080
and

1125
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,080
yes

1126
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,080
don't

1127
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,080
I'm the only one talking

1128
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,080
do you have questions?

1129
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,080
do you have questions?

1130
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,080
YuQing

1131
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,080
asked a question

1132
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,080
I don't know

1133
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,080
is Jenny still here?

1134
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,080
I don't know

1135
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,080
I'm here

1136
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,080
YuQing is here

1137
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,080
Jenny

1138
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,080
there's another one

1139
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,080
I think

1140
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,080
in the future

1141
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,080
maybe

1142
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,080
after more information

1143
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,080
maybe

1144
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,080
this is the basic

1145
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,080
maybe in the future

1146
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,080
we still need

1147
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,080
telekinesis

1148
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,080
or computer simulation

1149
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,080
to understand

1150
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,080
brain function

1151
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,080
now

1152
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,080
I can only provide a tool

1153
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,080
or a blueprint

1154
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,080
an established

1155
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,080
blueprint

1156
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,080
in the future

1157
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,080
as I mentioned

1158
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,080
we can adjust

1159
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,080
the level

1160
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,080
of cell poverty

1161
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,080
to be more selective

1162
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,080
to do research

1163
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,080
do you have questions?

1164
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,080
please

1165
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,080
there's a medicine

1166
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,080
called LSD

1167
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,080
is it

1168
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,080
I think

1169
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,080
I don't know

1170
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,080
if it's related

1171
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,080
after taking the medicine

1172
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,080
does the brain

1173
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,080
how

1174
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,080
is it related

1175
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,080
to the research

1176
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,080
after taking it

1177
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,080
LSD is

1178
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,080
like

1179
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,080
hallucination

1180
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,080
it's like

1181
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,080
I don't know

1182
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,080
I don't know

1183
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,080
it's mainly

1184
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,080
related to

1185
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,080
I'm not sure

1186
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,080
what's it called

1187
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,080
it's like

1188
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,080
in the same place

1189
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,080
I forgot the word

1190
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,080
what's it called

1191
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,080
it's in the

1192
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,080
circuit

1193
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,080
so

1194
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,080
it's like

1195
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,080
reward circuit

1196
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,080
mainly in that part

1197
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,080
like

1198
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,080
that area

1199
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,080
the brain area

1200
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,080
it's related to

1201
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,080
reward

1202
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,080
and addiction

1203
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,080
it's related

1204
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,080
talking about

1205
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,080
reward system

1206
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,080
I'm not a

1207
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,080
biopsychologist

1208
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,080
but

1209
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,080
reward system is very popular

1210
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,080
you might have mentioned

1211
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,080
but I missed it

1212
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,080
besides addiction

1213
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,080
it's also

1214
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,080
like

1215
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,080
many psychological diseases

1216
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,080
like

1217
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,080
autism

1218
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,080
or

1219
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,080
they have

1220
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,080
abnormal

1221
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,080
repetitive behaviors

1222
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,080
they keep doing it

1223
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,080
and they'll

1224
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,080
what

1225
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,080
like OCD

1226
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,080
they said

1227
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,080
it's because of their reward system

1228
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,080
so when they do

1229
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,080
these behaviors

1230
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,080
their reward system will keep firing

1231
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,080
and it's abnormal

1232
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,080
you don't need

1233
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,080
to do it

1234
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,080
they're doing

1235
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,080
imaging research

1236
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,080
right

1237
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,080
so like

1238
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,080
I mentioned

1239
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,080
we're

1240
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,080
researching

1241
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,080
connectome

1242
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,080
the other purpose is

1243
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,080
we have a normal

1244
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,080
reference

1245
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,080
then we can

1246
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,080
look into

1247
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,080
schizophrenia

1248
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,080
it's related to

1249
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,080
brain problems

1250
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,080
related

1251
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,080
diseases

1252
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,080
what's the difference

1253
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,080
like schizophrenia

1254
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,080
there's a theory

1255
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,080
excitatory and inhibitory

1256
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,080
balance

1257
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,080
there's a difference

1258
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,080
is there less connection

1259
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,080
or

1260
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,080
synaptic strength

1261
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,080
less

1262
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,080
I think our department has many

1263
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,080
researchers who like your research

1264
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,080
because our department

1265
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,080
our department's

1266
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,080
biopsychology and

1267
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,080
clinical psychology are quite similar

1268
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,080
clinical psychology is

1269
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,080
doing schizophrenia

1270
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,080
they push people in

1271
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,080
all kinds of patients

1272
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,080
but

1273
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,080
I remember

1274
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,080
there's a talk

1275
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,080
about functional MRI

1276
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,080
right

1277
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,080
it's about ADHD

1278
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,080
I remember

1279
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,080
it's about imaging

1280
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,080
they're doing

1281
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,080
they're doing

1282
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,080
function structure

1283
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,080
MRI used to do

1284
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,080
too big or too small

1285
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,080
which side is thick

1286
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,080
which side is thin

1287
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,080
they're doing

1288
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,080
firing pattern

1289
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,080
it's called functional

1290
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,080
right

1291
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,080
I remember

1292
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,080
it's 7.25

1293
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,080
any questions

1294
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,080
if not

1295
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,080
3, 2, 1

1296
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,080
thank you

1297
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,080
thank you

1298
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,080
thank you

1299
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,080
sorry

1300
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,080
we'll continue

1301
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,080
any ideas

1302
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,080
ok

1303
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,080
ok

1304
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,080
thank you

1305
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,080
I don't know which one

1306
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,080
the blue one

1307
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,080
fire station
