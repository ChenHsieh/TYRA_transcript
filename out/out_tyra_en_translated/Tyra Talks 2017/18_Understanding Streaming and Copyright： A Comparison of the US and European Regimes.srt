00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ok, welcome everyone to today's Tara Talk. I'm today's host, Zhang Yanyong. We are very honored to be able to invite our speaker today, Lu Yi, which is a very special field. Because most of our Tara Talks are based on material science or science, but today we invited Lu Yi to talk about the topic of material science.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The topic that Lu Yi will talk about is the discussion of copyright in streaming, a comparison of the U.S. and European regimes, understanding streaming and copyright.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Lu Yi is currently a candidate for the doctorate of law at the University of Washington. His main field is the law of intellectual property rights, anti-Thorax and economic analysis.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:08,000
At the same time, he also served as a legal advisor to the 2H online store during his time at school. He is now in the doctoral class. Before he was in the doctoral class, he was an intern at the U.S. and European law firms in Washington.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He is also very interested in the spirit of entrepreneurs, so he joined the China Entrepreneurship Interaction Association to serve as a counselor.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He regularly holds meetings and talks to promote the spirit of entrepreneurs in Taiwan. Before he came to the United States, he was an intern at the U.S. Department of Justice.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:44,000
During his time at school, he represented Taiwan in the international business dialogue in Germany and the Harvard-Asia International Relations Conference.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He also has a very handsome photo on my bio. If you are interested, please take a look.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:04,000
During his time at school, he represented Taiwan in the international business dialogue in Germany and the Harvard-Asia International Relations Conference. He also has a very handsome photo on my bio. If you are interested, please take a look.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you are interested, please take a look.

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The online streaming service we use now is also part of the online streaming service. In fact, the online streaming service has changed a lot of human privacy habits, including YouTube and Hulu.

12
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In fact, the online streaming service has changed a lot of human privacy habits, including YouTube and Hulu.

13
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is my outline today. I will briefly share with you.

14
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Because today's PowerPoint is shared by me in the seminar at the Department of Justice, so the content may be a bit deep for everyone.

15
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
First, if you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt me.

16
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Second, because I am thinking about everyone's state, I will not talk so deeply in each session.

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you have any more detailed questions, you can ask me in person or leave a message to ask me.

18
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is the order of my speech today.

19
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
First, I will tell you why I am doing this research and how I do it.

20
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Next, I will start with a little bit of technology.

21
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But this technology is not as much data as Li Gong-ge.

22
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will only briefly talk about the background structure of the streaming service.

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Fourth, I will take some European and American cases related to streaming and compare them.

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In the end, I will find something in this comparison.

25
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can say that if future companies want to do this, they often ignore some things.

26
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I hope to make some suggestions.

27
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If the audience here is interested in this area in the future, you can listen to it and refer to my thoughts.

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is the online streaming service.

29
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There are many services, including music, video, audio, and news.

30
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Amazon, Spotify, Hulu, and Netflix.

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is the background.

32
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Traditional media, in addition to doing wireless TV, are now jumping in to do streaming.

33
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
For example, NBC and ABC are also actively jumping in to do this.

34
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Next, why do we need to pay attention to streaming?

35
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There is a name in the lower right corner, which is Cleaning Perkins.

36
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Cleaning Perkins is a well-known startup in the U.S.

37
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It specializes in online business.

38
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
At the beginning of this year, it published a research report.

39
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It shows that consumers use the internet, and companies invest in it.

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is a very interesting intersection.

41
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This shows the perspective of corporate investment.

42
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:05,000
In the past, corporate investment was mostly in traditional media, such as TV or large-screen advertising.

43
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This year, the data shows that at the end of this year,

44
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the investment of online investment will exceed the investment of traditional media.

45
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What does this show?

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It shows that companies are starting to shift from traditional media to the internet.

47
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
At the end of this year, the investment of online investment will exceed the investment of traditional media.

48
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's talk about corporate investment first.

49
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's look at it from the perspective of the market.

50
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In 2017, when we estimated the market,

51
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
this report is from McKinsey, a well-known management company.

52
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:24,000
McKinsey predicts that the annual growth rate of streaming will continue to rise compared to 2014.

53
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If you look at the three numbers, North America, Western Europe, and Central Eastern Europe,

54
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
in 2017, they still accounted for about 1 to 1.5 percent of the total number.

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is why I chose to compare the European and American systems.

56
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's look at it from the perspective of per capita consumption.

57
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
From the perspective of the company, the investment is slowly increasing,

58
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and the per capita consumption is increasing.

59
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The market is still concentrated in the North American and European markets.

60
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is one of the main reasons why I want to study.

61
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is one of the main reasons why I want to study.

62
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Next, let's talk about the core research.

63
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
First, let's talk about the structure.

64
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The structure of streaming is mainly divided into three parts.

65
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The first part is the aggregation on the far left.

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Basically, if you use a TV as a metaphor,

67
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
streaming only changes the signal from wireless or wired to the Internet.

68
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
To put it simply, the structure in the background is actually divided into three parts.

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The first part is the aggregation.

70
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The aggregation is the content created by TV or major media companies.

71
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
These streaming will collect these signals and put them on the cloud.

72
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think everyone has heard of the storage format on the cloud,

73
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the so-called MP4.

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It compresses the storage process.

75
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It compresses the storage process.

76
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
During the compression process,

77
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the original wireless or wired signal will be transformed into the cloud storage format.

78
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
From signal to format.

79
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Under this format, MP4 allows the streaming process to be relatively stable.

80
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It is also a technology standard that has been in progress.

81
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Maybe in a few years, it won't be MP4 anymore.

82
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It may be faster and more fluid.

83
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Of course, there may be many reasons why the Internet media is lagging.

84
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Storage format is one of them.

85
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
MP4 becomes a very important part of the entire streaming structure in the second stage of storage.

86
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
After storage, it is sent.

87
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In fact, in the part of sending, it will also be converted from the storage format to the format of sending.

88
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I won't go into detail about the format of sending.

89
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If you are interested, you can check on the Internet.

90
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What is HLS?

91
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What is MPEG-DASH?

92
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What is Smooth Streaming?

93
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
These are the technical terms.

94
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Basically, it is converted from the storage format to the format of sending.

95
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There is something called Streaming Endpoint in the middle.

96
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Streaming Endpoint is a bit like the concept of a middle book.

97
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
When it is converted from storage to sending,

98
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Streaming Endpoint allows consumers at the back end to see the videos without the sense of lag.

99
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is the main structure of streaming.

100
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I converted the original signal into a storage format and then sent it out.

101
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It is smooth in this process.

102
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But there is a storage in the middle.

103
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And the so-called gathering function.

104
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Gathering process.

105
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The problem will appear at the very beginning.

106
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why is gathering a common problem in streaming?

107
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's go back to the paper itself.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Excuse me.

109
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay.

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There is a question about this page.

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The feature of streaming is that it can store the data in the cloud.

112
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then there is a distribution.

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You mentioned today that you want to focus on the region.

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That is, the United States, Europe, and so on.

115
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But if today you can imagine that someone is in Asia.

116
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Then he can somehow use VPN or something to watch Netflix.

117
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The data is not in the Asian region.

118
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
In this case, where should we focus on the legal discussion?

119
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Or how do you define the region itself?

120
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This question is quite interesting.

121
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
OK.

122
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
From my perspective.

123
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
From my perspective, if the storage is in another country.

124
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But from the legal point of view.

125
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You always have to choose a country to sue him.

126
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Right?

127
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You always have to choose a country to sue him.

128
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If the storage is in another country today.

129
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Suppose your storage is in Taiwan.

130
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
OK.

131
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But you sue him in the United States.

132
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This problem will appear in the issue of evidence collection.

133
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's not about what's in the law.

134
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can sue someone.

135
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But if your storage is abroad.

136
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then there will be an issue of evidence collection.

137
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The so-called issue of evidence collection is that.

138
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
For example, we may have heard of it before.

139
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Very famous case.

140
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That is, Mega Upload was bought by the United States.

141
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know if you know the case of Mega Upload.

142
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Mega Upload is a network sharing.

143
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a bit like P2P file sharing.

144
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's like Grogs.

145
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
After he was bought in the United States.

146
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He moved his server to Australia.

147
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then you can't catch him in the United States.

148
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You know what I mean?

149
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The United States has no right to catch him.

150
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Only Australia can catch him.

151
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So that's Mega Upload.

152
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think the interesting thing about streaming is.

153
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Aggregation part.

154
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll talk about it later.

155
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Sometimes it will use different methods to collect signals.

156
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't know if this answers your question.

157
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Because this question is quite interesting.

158
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't know.

159
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because of his understanding of the question.

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
My question has been answered.

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But I don't know what he thinks now.

162
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let me see.

163
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He said yes.

164
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
OK, thank you.

165
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I guess I'll talk more later.

166
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Right?

167
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But I think this question is interesting.

168
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That is.

169
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you put it in another country.

170
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
By the way.

171
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This structure is actually the same in Europe and the United States.

172
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
OK, but.

173
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He is in different areas.

174
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He will have different technical restrictions.

175
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That is.

176
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's what the questioner just mentioned.

177
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That is, I'm on the distribution side.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He can restrict that.

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't want.

180
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's say I'm in the United States now.

181
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't let Asians see.

182
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is stipulated in the contract.

183
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That is.

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The contract comes from.

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The front end is the so-called media company.

186
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He will stipulate that.

187
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you are downstream.

188
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
For example, downstream is like streaming.

189
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You want to play my media.

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Then I have to have regional restrictions.

191
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
OK.

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you don't do it.

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Then you violate the contract.

194
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's another question.

195
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
OK.

196
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It should be.

197
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I hope there is an answer.

198
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Next is a little deeper.

199
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That is.

200
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Talk about these two cases.

201
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
One is I think.

202
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In the copyright.

203
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
In our industry.

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The first case is that everyone will know.

205
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's ABC to sue Aureal.

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Aureal has fallen.

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Because of this case.

208
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Then after half a year.

209
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Fox sued Dish Network again.

210
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
OK, Dish Network.

211
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I think if everyone is in the United States.

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Must have heard of it.

213
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
OK, what happened to the two of them?

214
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
OK.

215
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The first point is.

216
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Aureal, this company.

217
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
When he was still alive.

218
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I emphasize because he is gone.

219
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
When he was alive.

220
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He provides a very powerful service.

221
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He opened a platform on the Internet.

222
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Then every consumer.

223
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
As long as every month.

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Give him 12 dollars.

225
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Then you can.

226
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
After 12 dollars.

227
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You can choose inside.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Some channels you want.

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
After choosing these channels.

230
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Aureal will follow.

231
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
These options you choose.

232
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Then catch the signal.

233
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
OK.

234
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If you are sensitive.

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You should have heard it now.

236
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm going to catch the signal.

237
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Did Aureal give money to these?

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Broadcaster.

239
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
These media companies.

240
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No.

241
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He used the method of technology.

242
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Catch these signals.

243
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
After catching.

244
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
12 dollars per month.

245
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He makes money like this.

246
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Of course this thing.

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's funny.

248
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He seems to be in January 2013.

249
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Get up this service.

250
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The next month will be sued.

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Because this.

252
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's obviously illegal.

253
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Because you didn't pay at all.

254
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This question is back to just now.

255
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
This paragraph.

256
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Because the source of your signal.

257
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's illegal.

258
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You didn't give money at all.

259
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
These media companies.

260
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Of course these media companies will be angry.

261
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because he can't get a dime.

262
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Then your.

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Your client gave money to Aureal.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Aureal did not give money to them.

265
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This question is here.

266
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
OK.

267
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So this case is like this.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
How to fight.

269
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's it.

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
All the way to.

271
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Federal Criminal Procedure Court.

272
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
OK.

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
OK.

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This is a little show.

275
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The law behind it.

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If everyone.

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I assume that everyone should not be legal.

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So I won't talk about it.

279
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
OK.

280
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is actually their violation of the law.

281
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
OK.

282
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That is to say.

283
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
There is a very important right in the copyright law.

284
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It is public transmission.

285
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Or public broadcast.

286
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
OK.

287
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That.

288
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This one in front.

289
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Broadcaster.

290
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That is to say.

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
In the name of the media.

292
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That is to say.

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You didn't pass my authorization today.

294
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Then go.

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Steal my signal.

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Then play.

297
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So it violates my public broadcast.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The right to broadcast.

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
OK.

300
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So.

301
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Then.

302
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Uh.

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Let me make it simple.

304
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Because most people.

305
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Should be here.

306
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Should not know.

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
A state of American law.

308
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That is to say.

309
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Uh.

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The state of American law.

311
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
With.

312
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Taiwan's Constitutional Court.

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
A bit like.

314
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But.

315
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It can be handled with cases here.

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
OK.

317
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The U.S. Federal Criminal Procedure Court.

318
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It will only take less than 50 cases a year.

319
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
OK.

320
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Very few.

321
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That is to say.

322
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The concept of succession.

323
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That.

324
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Criminal Procedure Court.

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Uh.

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Not the Criminal Procedure Court.

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Federal.

328
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Uh.

329
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Supreme Court.

330
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He.

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Accept this case.

332
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There must be a law.

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Very serious.

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Legal explanation.

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Will accept.

336
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This is the first point.

337
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
OK.

338
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The second point is.

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He.

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In the judgment.

341
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Uh.

342
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Often take.

343
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Legal history to do.

344
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
OK.

345
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
To do the explanation.

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That way.

347
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Then he may be wrong.

348
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Wait a minute.

349
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That is to say.

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Uh.

351
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Federal.

352
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Supreme Court.

353
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He.

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Will have the so-called.

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Majority opinion.

356
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
With the so-called.

357
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Dissenting opinion.

358
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Then I will only introduce today.

359
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Majority opinion.

360
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Because I think.

361
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The discussion is too deep.

362
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Everyone.

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
May not be able to accept.

364
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Unacceptable.

365
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So.

366
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Uh.

367
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I will introduce to you today.

368
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
His so-called.

369
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The majority opinion.

370
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
OK.

371
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because the U.S. is a pretty.

372
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Uh.

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
In the law.

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He is a.

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Very open.

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Can't say open.

377
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Very encouraging.

378
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Or.

379
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We can't.

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There.

381
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Are the same ideas.

382
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
To debate.

383
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
A.

384
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
System.

385
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So he will allow.

386
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The U.S. Supreme Court.

387
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
At the Supreme Court.

388
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Inside.

389
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He will have the so-called majority opinion.

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Majority opinion.

391
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And.

392
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Dissonance of minority opinion.

393
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Because they are all one opinion.

394
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
OK.

395
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Then.

396
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Uh.

397
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Right.

398
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Wrong not necessarily.

399
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Because they are just standing.

400
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Stand.

401
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
At one of.

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
More.

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The result of the vote.

404
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But the result of the vote.

405
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Does not mean.

406
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Their opinion is right.

407
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Because.

408
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
There are many people on the scene.

409
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's not about the law.

410
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So let me explain.

411
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The status of the U.S. Supreme Court.

412
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So.

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He will have.

414
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The so-called majority opinion.

415
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
With minority opinion.

416
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Now.

417
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The screen is seen.

418
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Is the majority opinion.

419
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They are.

420
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
When judging this case.

421
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What is their logical sequence?

422
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The first is that he put.

423
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Uh.

424
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Before he dug out.

425
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There are two times in the United States.

426
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Uh.

427
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The revision of the Constitution.

428
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
One is in 1906.

429
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
One is in 1976.

430
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The revision of the Constitution in 1976.

431
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He put.

432
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The front.

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He put this.

434
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The so-called cable TV.

435
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Put it in the revision of the Constitution.

436
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
OK.

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The first point.

438
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It makes people feel strange.

439
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
OK.

440
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's the judge.

441
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He thinks.

442
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He actually put.

443
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Cable this thing.

444
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So.

445
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Let's make it clear.

446
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What is cable?

447
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
HBO.

448
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
OK.

449
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's.

450
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He put HBO.

451
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
With.

452
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This thing.

453
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's the online stream.

454
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
In fact.

455
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This thing.

456
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's a very strange.

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Process.

458
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Because.

459
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
How do you get HBO.

460
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Go with.

461
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you compare with Aurel?

462
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah.

463
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So.

464
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The first point.

465
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It makes people feel strange.

466
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But he did it.

467
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
OK.

468
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That.

469
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Uh.

470
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
HBO.

471
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He's in.

472
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
19.

473
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
He came out in the 1970s.

474
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Uh.

475
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
70.

476
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Or 80.

477
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I forgot a little.

478
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He is.

479
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
From the so-called cable TV.

480
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Cable TV.

481
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's what we all know now.

482
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Wireless TV.

483
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The way to sign a wireless TV.

484
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's me.

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Uh.

486
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Call.

487
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It used to be a call.

488
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He might be online registration now.

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Or what.

490
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Then call to HBO.

491
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Then.

492
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
He will sign with you.

493
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
OK.

494
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That.

495
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
1976.

496
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
In fact, these two.

497
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Cases.

498
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
These two cases are.

499
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
One is called Fortnite.

500
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
One is.

501
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Teleprompter.

502
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
These two cases.

503
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
These two cases.

504
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He said.

505
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Cable TV.

506
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He is.

507
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's not.

508
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's not.

509
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's not.

510
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's not.

511
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's not.

512
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The so-called.

513
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We talked about it earlier.

514
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Public transmission and public broadcast.

515
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
OK.

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Then.

517
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But in.

518
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In 1976.

519
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
When the law was revised.

520
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He actually put these two.

521
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Cases.

522
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's.

523
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Two slaps.

524
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Because these two cases.

525
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Federal.

526
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Supreme Court case.

527
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Basically.

528
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Should.

529
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Congress.

530
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Is.

531
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
To respect.

532
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But Congress does not respect.

533
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Congress.

534
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
No matter.

535
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's the judgment of the Federal Supreme Court.

536
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He said.

537
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
HBO.

538
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Uh.

539
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This.

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Like HBO.

541
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Or like other cable TV.

542
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
They are.

543
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Their state of transmission.

544
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Is.

545
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Public transmission.

546
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
OK.

547
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So this is.

548
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
A little bit.

549
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Legislative history.

550
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And.

551
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And this is true.

552
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
In this.

553
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
In the majority opinion.

554
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
He is.

555
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The judge of the Supreme Court.

556
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Take this.

557
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Legislative.

558
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
This.

559
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
History and purpose.

560
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
To explain.

561
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He said.

562
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Uh.

563
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Today you.

564
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The operating mode of ARIEL.

565
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This is what we all see.

566
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
This.

567
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
This operating mode.

568
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
With.

569
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The so-called cable TV.

570
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Very similar.

571
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Where is the point?

572
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He said.

573
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
First.

574
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He said.

575
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Cable TV and ARIEL.

576
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Can all choose Taiwan.

577
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
OK.

578
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He said.

579
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Then he said.

580
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Uh.

581
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
They said.

582
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Just turn on the TV.

583
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Then.

584
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
One is to turn on the TV.

585
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
One is to turn on the computer.

586
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
OK.

587
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's it.

588
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This is them.

589
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Their first.

590
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Very similar place.

591
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
OK.

592
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The second point is.

593
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He.

594
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That.

595
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That ARIEL.

596
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He will go to the side.

597
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That is to say.

598
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No.

599
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You.

600
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
This is not the same as.

601
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That cable TV.

602
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Where is the difference?

603
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I have a cable TV today.

604
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He may be a line.

605
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Then a line.

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Can be at the same time.

607
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
In an apartment.

608
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I admit.

609
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But you today.

610
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
ARIEL.

611
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What is my state?

612
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I log in every person.

613
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Password.

614
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Account password.

615
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Then choose Taiwan.

616
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
He.

617
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
My choice.

618
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
With your choice.

619
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Different.

620
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That is to say.

621
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Everyone.

622
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Everyone is here.

623
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I.

624
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Today I log in ARIEL.

625
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I like to see.

626
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's different from what you like to see.

627
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
My choice.

628
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The result.

629
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Different from your result.

630
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That.

631
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
How can this thing be called.

632
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Public transmission.

633
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Public.

634
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Because.

635
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Must be public.

636
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Transmission.

637
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
ARIEL.

638
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Very capricious.

639
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
OK.

640
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He thinks.

641
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
No.

642
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You are just a process.

643
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The so-called public.

644
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You are just a process of transmission.

645
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
In the end.

646
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Still a lot of people watching together.

647
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He does not think.

648
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He thinks.

649
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I am today.

650
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Cable.

651
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Also a line.

652
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
A line to sign.

653
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You ARIEL.

654
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Also a person.

655
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
A person.

656
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
A person to log in.

657
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That.

658
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
A person.

659
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
A person to log in.

660
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
With a line.

661
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
A line to sign.

662
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The conclusion is the same.

663
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Are very.

664
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What is the conclusion?

665
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Many people can see.

666
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
For example.

667
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
If I have ten people to log in.

668
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Then.

669
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I can.

670
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
For ARIEL.

671
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Customers.

672
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
There are ten people.

673
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
To see.

674
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Then.

675
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Then the judge thought.

676
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You.

677
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
This is the same as Cable.

678
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Cable.

679
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
In 1976.

680
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I think it's public.

681
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Public transmission.

682
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
With public broadcast.

683
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So he thinks.

684
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
He thinks.

685
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Cable TV.

686
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
With ARIEL.

687
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The so-called streaming mode.

688
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Is the same.

689
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
OK.

690
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So the conclusion is.

691
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
They are the same.

692
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So.

693
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because they are the same.

694
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So.

695
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
In 1976.

696
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The law.

697
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Say you are illegal.

698
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yes.

699
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The law.

700
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I think this is.

701
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Public transmission.

702
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Then you.

703
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You are not.

704
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Authorized.

705
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So it's illegal.

706
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yes.

707
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The conclusion is.

708
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
OK.

709
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Then.

710
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I don't know if you have.

711
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Any questions.

712
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Just.

713
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll stop for a while.

714
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Because it's important here.

715
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
In fact.

716
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I have a question.

717
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But the question.

718
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
May be more like.

719
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
A technical question.

720
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That is.

721
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes.

722
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
HBO.

723
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
For example.

724
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
With.

725
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
For example.

726
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
21st century.

727
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Or with FOX.

728
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Buy the rights to the movie.

729
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
He is.

730
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
No matter if he has.

731
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Go pay that money to buy.

732
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
He knows what his object is.

733
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But I haven't used this.

734
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
ARIEL.

735
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So I don't know.

736
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
He is like.

737
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The same.

738
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Just say.

739
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
For example.

740
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I want to listen to Justin Bieber's album.

741
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I want to go.

742
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I know I'm collecting.

743
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
What data.

744
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Or.

745
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's a bit like a pirate bay.

746
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
He just put it there.

747
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
For others to use.

748
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
He is passive.

749
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Um.

750
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I think.

751
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
How to answer.

752
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That is.

753
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You.

754
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Because he's gone.

755
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Then I'm not.

756
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Actually, I haven't used it either.

757
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Because.

758
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
He has been shut down.

759
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That.

760
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
My understanding is.

761
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
He is actually a bit like.

762
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The concept of one-stop service.

763
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I don't know how to say that.

764
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That is to say.

765
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
After you log in.

766
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He is.

767
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He started.

768
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's a bit like Wix.

769
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't know if that's the right way to describe it.

770
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That is.

771
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Because I'm using Wix.

772
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
When you make a website.

773
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He is.

774
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Maybe at the beginning.

775
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Give you some options.

776
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Then you hook up.

777
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Hook up.

778
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
He will automatically do it for you.

779
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This is Wix.

780
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
His recent function.

781
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I think he's a bit like this.

782
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
His service is a bit like this.

783
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That is to say.

784
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
After I log in today.

785
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Then.

786
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I just have to choose.

787
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Have.

788
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I like to watch.

789
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Program.

790
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
He will go.

791
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Catch this signal.

792
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
That's it.

793
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That is.

794
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
He will.

795
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Take the initiative.

796
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Catch this signal.

797
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Then you can watch.

798
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That is.

799
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
His concept is like this.

800
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Um.

801
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Thank you.

802
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Thank you.

803
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Thank you.

804
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Thank you.

805
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Thank you.

806
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Thank you.

807
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I have a question.

808
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I would like to ask.

809
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It is still.

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
For this Ariel.

811
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Um.

812
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The way to use it.

813
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Because I haven't used it before.

814
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh yeah.

815
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But I want to.

816
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The question is.

817
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He said.

818
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
After I got in.

819
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Hook up.

820
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Then he would give me one.

821
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Because Wix is after I hooked up.

822
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
He would let me see me.

823
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What does the website look like.

824
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Then I will.

825
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
My website.

826
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Look like this.

827
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Right.

828
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Right.

829
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But.

830
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Then Ariel said.

831
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
After I hooked up.

832
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Because according to your.

833
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Your favorite.

834
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
This questionnaire or something.

835
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I recommend you this package.

836
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Then this is my package.

837
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Or.

838
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
After I hooked up.

839
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He gave me a shuffle.

840
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Then.

841
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Randomly.

842
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Give me.

843
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Directly.

844
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The picture came out.

845
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Then started to broadcast.

846
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Right.

847
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
A movie.

848
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because if it is a break.

849
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That's really random.

850
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Then I can't imagine.

851
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
He is.

852
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
How many.

853
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That one.

854
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
How many people have autonomy.

855
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
All can be discussed.

856
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But relative to the first one.

857
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Because the first one.

858
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Actually buy.

859
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Different.

860
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Cable package.

861
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
In fact, it is very similar.

862
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He just added a questionnaire.

863
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
In front.

864
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Then I think the judge.

865
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This.

866
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Do a comparison.

867
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I don't think it's weird.

868
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Right.

869
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This is.

870
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Is that you stand in the angle of Ariel.

871
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Ariel.

872
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
He said so.

873
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Ariel.

874
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He is.

875
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
He said so.

876
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Because indeed.

877
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
His model is very similar to the first one.

878
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Is.

879
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The first one is.

880
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I hook.

881
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Hook.

882
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
His business model is the first one.

883
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That's what you just said.

884
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Hey.

885
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Hello.

886
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm listening.

887
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm listening.

888
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm listening.

889
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In fact, he actually hooked.

890
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
In fact, what you just said is.

891
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That's right.

892
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
He belongs to the first one.

893
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's me.

894
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
After I choose.

895
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Only those.

896
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Signal.

897
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
He went to catch the signal.

898
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
He is according to your preference.

899
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
To catch the signal.

900
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
OK.

901
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
After catching the signal.

902
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You can only see those.

903
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Things you catch the signal.

904
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
OK.

905
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That.

906
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
OK.

907
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's right.

908
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So he belongs to this kind.

909
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He is like.

910
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
He is indeed like Cable.

911
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's right.

912
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But.

913
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
His controversial point is.

914
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
OK.

915
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I can talk later.

916
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It depends on whether you can understand.

917
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Can I ask another question?

918
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Which one?

919
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Because I just heard.

920
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Cable TV.

921
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm Qiqi.

922
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Sorry.

923
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Hua Lu.

924
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That's it.

925
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Can you hear me?

926
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Can you speak louder?

927
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Sorry.

928
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
OK.

929
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That.

930
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I can.

931
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Can you hear me clearly like this?

932
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes.

933
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
OK.

934
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I ask you.

935
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Just before.

936
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It seems that in June this year.

937
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Google was sued by the EU.

938
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Say they are on the Internet.

939
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Is.

940
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Provided.

941
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Let them.

942
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Is.

943
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Comparison.

944
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Google.

945
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Search.

946
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Search.

947
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The result.

948
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Will favor.

949
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Google.

950
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That.

951
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Business.

952
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
May have.

953
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Google money.

954
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That.

955
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This is also.

956
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You.

957
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Are you talking about this area now?

958
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Is.

959
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We.

960
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
As consumers.

961
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We are using Google.

962
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
This free service.

963
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
When.

964
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We may not be aware.

965
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Say.

966
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Google.

967
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This.

968
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Search engine.

969
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
In fact.

970
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Has already been tampered with.

971
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Uh.

972
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Strictly speaking.

973
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Does not count.

974
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Is.

975
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Strictly speaking.

976
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Does not count.

977
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What I study.

978
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But I.

979
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I probably know that.

980
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Thing.

981
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Like this.

982
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I probably know that.

983
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That thing.

984
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Is.

985
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Uh.

986
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That thing.

987
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Is.

988
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I.

989
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Also in the United States.

990
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Is.

991
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It is not in the copyright law.

992
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It is stipulated in.

993
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It is stipulated in antitrust.

994
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Haha.

995
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
OK.

996
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Is.

997
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If you are interested.

998
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I can talk about it in private.

999
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Because this thing.

1000
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It.

1001
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Is involved in.

1002
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Two area market.

1003
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Different.

1004
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
For.

1005
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Market economy.

1006
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It has different interpretation.

1007
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
OK.

1008
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Is.

1009
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't know how to say that.

1010
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
A little.

1011
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
A little bit.

1012
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Not really a.

1013
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Answer the question.

1014
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Ha.

1015
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So.

1016
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So you are talking about this.

1017
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Ah.

1018
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Ariel.

1019
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
He went to catch.

1020
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That ABC.

1021
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Search engine.

1022
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Is.

1023
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because he is equal to.

1024
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Is.

1025
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Use illegal way.

1026
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
To get others.

1027
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Spend money.

1028
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
To build things.

1029
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
He is because of this.

1030
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Illegal.

1031
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Should say.

1032
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Because of this.

1033
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So ABC sue him.

1034
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
OK.

1035
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That is to say.

1036
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You go to catch.

1037
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Not to catch the search engine.

1038
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Is to catch his signal.

1039
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Is the front.

1040
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
We.

1041
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
In the technical section.

1042
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Is.

1043
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You go to catch.

1044
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
His signal.

1045
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But this signal.

1046
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In fact.

1047
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
In the law.

1048
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
In the US law.

1049
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
He is actually.

1050
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Is a part of the public.

1051
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So he is illegal.

1052
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
To get these signals.

1053
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Because these signals.

1054
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Is to be authorized.

1055
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Is to say.

1056
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
In the middle.

1057
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Streaming company.

1058
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Is to pay.

1059
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
To these.

1060
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Ah.

1061
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Media business.

1062
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But he didn't pay.

1063
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So he was sued.

1064
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
OK.

1065
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
OK.

1066
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Sorry.

1067
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I can.

1068
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Follow this question.

1069
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Ask again.

1070
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Will this.

1071
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Interrupt you.

1072
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Or do you want to.

1073
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Answer together at the end.

1074
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It doesn't matter.

1075
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Because if.

1076
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Can't finish.

1077
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'll jump.

1078
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Good.

1079
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Is related to.

1080
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The question just now.

1081
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
My feeling is.

1082
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Different.

1083
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
My feeling is.

1084
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
These two questions.

1085
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
A little bit different.

1086
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Because today.

1087
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
ABC sue Ariel.

1088
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Is more.

1089
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
ABC production.

1090
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I think so.

1091
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I can't describe it.

1092
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Right.

1093
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The fact that.

1094
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Your wallet.

1095
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Was stolen.

1096
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
By Google.

1097
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
To sell it.

1098
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Not pay.

1099
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
To manufacturer.

1100
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I steal your things.

1101
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
To sell for free.

1102
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And I'm making profit.

1103
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And manufacturer doesn't make a lot of money.

1104
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So manufacturer sued.

1105
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
This intermediary.

1106
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But.

1107
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Google's matter.

1108
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Is more.

1109
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Consumer.

1110
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Power loss.

1111
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Is to say.

1112
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Consumers don't know.

1113
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
When I'm searching.

1114
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Actually.

1115
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Continuously being advertised.

1116
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Then potential.

1117
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
May affect.

1118
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Consumer behavior.

1119
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So I'm always.

1120
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
My wallet has always been.

1121
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Stealing money out.

1122
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So it's more of a consumer harm.

1123
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
More not.

1124
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Manufacturer is harmed.

1125
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But if that's the case.

1126
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
To compare.

1127
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
These two cases.

1128
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Actually not quite the same.

1129
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
My feeling.

1130
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Correct.

1131
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I just said.

1132
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
These two are different things.

1133
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Is.

1134
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
These two.

1135
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Is the latter.

1136
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's more of a market economy.

1137
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That is to say.

1138
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Google that.

1139
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Because Google's problem.

1140
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
In fact.

1141
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Uh.

1142
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
In the EU.

1143
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
In my impression.

1144
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
In my impression.

1145
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If I remember correctly.

1146
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You can.

1147
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Go to Google and see.

1148
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Then in my impression.

1149
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
His.

1150
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
His.

1151
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The point of being sued.

1152
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's because of him.

1153
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because he's in.

1154
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Searching.

1155
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
On technology.

1156
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
He is.

1157
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The strongest.

1158
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
OK.

1159
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Then.

1160
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
He's the strongest.

1161
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
As a result.

1162
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Because he was in 2002.

1163
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Or in 2003.

1164
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
He wanted to enter the EU market.

1165
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
but.

1166
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
A lot of people resist.

1167
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
OK.

1168
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The so-called resistance.

1169
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That is to say.

1170
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I just don't want to use your Google today.

1171
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
This so-called API.

1172
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Or something.

1173
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
OK.

1174
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Fine.

1175
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And then Google.

1176
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
He just.

1177
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Use free.

1178
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The first stage.

1179
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Let a lot of.

1180
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
That kind.

1181
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Consumers or small and medium-sized manufacturers.

1182
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's not the original.

1183
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's.

1184
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Europe also has a similar Google service.

1185
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
OK.

1186
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And now the problem is.

1187
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That is to say.

1188
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Similar to.

1189
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
These services.

1190
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Local service providers.

1191
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
They can't live at all.

1192
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
The reason for not surviving.

1193
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Is because.

1194
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
After Google came in.

1195
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
To a lot of free.

1196
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
To buy these.

1197
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Middlemen.

1198
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Then.

1199
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Put this.

1200
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Put this ad.

1201
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The placement.

1202
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Use Google.

1203
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What about Google.

1204
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Use this method.

1205
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Use commercial means.

1206
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You can't say.

1207
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Right or wrong.

1208
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But he just said.

1209
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You.

1210
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
People are free.

1211
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Then.

1212
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Sign a contract with me.

1213
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But what is the price of signing a contract with me.

1214
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Don't follow the EU.

1215
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't follow.

1216
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Not the EU.

1217
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Don't follow the EU.

1218
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Local.

1219
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Search engine.

1220
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Company cooperation.

1221
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This is the first point.

1222
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Then he.

1223
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Use the contract.

1224
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
To tie.

1225
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
These middlemen.

1226
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This way.

1227
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
OK.

1228
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Then.

1229
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
This is what led to these.

1230
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Originally in Google.

1231
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
European market.

1232
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Rise.

1233
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Similar.

1234
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Search engine.

1235
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Search engine.

1236
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Company.

1237
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
They don't have advertising revenue.

1238
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
OK.

1239
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Then there is no advertising revenue.

1240
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Then.

1241
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What to do.

1242
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Then.

1243
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
As a result, Google.

1244
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
He is using the second trick again.

1245
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That is to say.

1246
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I am today.

1247
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Put the price.

1248
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
May be used very low.

1249
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Right.

1250
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Use it for free first.

1251
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Then use it.

1252
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Put this price.

1253
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
At a fixed price.

1254
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's even lower than other manufacturers.

1255
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Then.

1256
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
In this case.

1257
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Then.

1258
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The third trick is what Qiqi just said.

1259
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That is.

1260
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Since I don't let you.

1261
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Consumer use.

1262
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Second.

1263
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Then.

1264
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Finally.

1265
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I let everyone.

1266
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Can't find you.

1267
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So.

1268
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I think this is.

1269
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This is quite excessive.

1270
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
In Google.

1271
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
In Europe.

1272
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Because he wants to.

1273
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Occupy.

1274
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Occupy.

1275
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
All of Europe.

1276
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Search engine market.

1277
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Then.

1278
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Just let.

1279
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Is to use this business method.

1280
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Let all other.

1281
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
All other.

1282
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Similar to Google.

1283
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
People who serve.

1284
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Can't come in.

1285
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So.

1286
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I will say this thing.

1287
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Is.

1288
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Because in the EU.

1289
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The state of processing.

1290
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Different from the United States.

1291
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So.

1292
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You can.

1293
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You can talk about it later.

1294
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That is.

1295
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
If you are interested.

1296
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You can talk to me in private.

1297
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Because the EU.

1298
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Processing.

1299
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Market economy.

1300
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
With the United States.

1301
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Processing.

1302
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Market economy.

1303
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Attitude is different.

1304
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Very clear.

1305
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Then.

1306
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I have a hidden question.

1307
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That is.

1308
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You just talked about that area.

1309
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The reason he was sued.

1310
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Mainly because.

1311
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
He went to steal someone else's.

1312
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That.

1313
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That.

1314
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Steal.

1315
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Right.

1316
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Then I want another example.

1317
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That is.

1318
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
For example.

1319
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Taiwan.

1320
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Or China.

1321
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Free movies.

1322
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Free movies.

1323
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Provide platform.

1324
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Then he went.

1325
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Catch that.

1326
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Western Hollywood movie.

1327
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Then.

1328
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Then.

1329
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Just put it on that platform.

1330
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Let people watch for free.

1331
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The case you are studying.

1332
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Is.

1333
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Belongs to.

1334
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That look.

1335
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Right.

1336
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
In fact, that is easy to debate.

1337
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That is directly illegal.

1338
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That is.

1339
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Right.

1340
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But.

1341
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I.

1342
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I.

1343
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I.

1344
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I.

1345
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
More details.

1346
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Should.

1347
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
My question is.

1348
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Go.

1349
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Like Ariel.

1350
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I.

1351
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I.

1352
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I don't know.

1353
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Answer you so fast.

1354
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Can you.

1355
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But.

1356
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It does need.

1357
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Some.

1358
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
More rigorous.

1359
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Analysis.

1360
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But you ask me now.

1361
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Is it similar or what?

1362
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But my personal feeling.

1363
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Is similar.

1364
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
My personal feeling.

1365
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
My personal feeling is similar.

1366
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Because.

1367
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I don't know if there is time.

1368
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That is.

1369
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Europe has appeared.

1370
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That is because.

1371
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Today is the United States and Europe.

1372
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Europe also has similar cases.

1373
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But.

1374
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Not in that kind.

1375
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Asia.

1376
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That is to say.

1377
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Asia.

1378
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Put it on.

1379
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It is similar.

1380
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
To.

1381
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Catch the signal.

1382
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Then.

1383
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Catch that.

1384
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Uh.

1385
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Not catching the signal.

1386
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That is to say.

1387
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It provides you with something.

1388
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Then you can.

1389
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Uh.

1390
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Download.

1391
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
A package.

1392
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Then that package.

1393
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Can let you go.

1394
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Free.

1395
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Go to the football game.

1396
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
OK.

1397
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Then that.

1398
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The European court concluded that.

1399
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You are still like this.

1400
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
No payment.

1401
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You are still like this.

1402
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You let consumers.

1403
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
To do.

1404
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Enforce consumers.

1405
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
To create this.

1406
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Illegal behavior.

1407
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Or.

1408
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So.

1409
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I think this is.

1410
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
A case.

1411
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm like.

1412
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I feel like.

1413
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Like you just said.

1414
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But I'm not sure.

1415
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yes.

1416
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Did you answer?

1417
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah.

1418
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Very clear.

1419
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
OK.

1420
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So.

1421
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I want.

1422
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Any questions?

1423
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
OK.

1424
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So.

1425
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh.

1426
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
No problem.

1427
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
321.

1428
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
No.

1429
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
OK.

1430
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So.

1431
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
This is.

1432
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
The so-called.

1433
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That.

1434
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Opinion.

1435
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
OK.

1436
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That.

1437
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I have.

1438
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
In the seminar.

1439
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I mentioned.

1440
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That.

1441
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
A minority.

1442
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh, not a minority.

1443
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That is.

1444
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It is a minority opinion.

1445
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Or.

1446
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Anti-opinion.

1447
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That.

1448
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I think it skipped.

1449
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Because.

1450
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
This.

1451
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
If you are interested.

1452
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You can talk to me in private.

1453
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Because.

1454
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Opposed to opinions.

1455
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
In fact.

1456
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
That is.

1457
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
In fact, in the United States.

1458
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It became.

1459
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Subsequent mainstream opinion.

1460
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
OK.

1461
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So.

1462
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
In private.

1463
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If you have any questions.

1464
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You can ask me again.

1465
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Because after all.

1466
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I understand.

1467
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Is mainstream.

1468
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Oh, not mainstream.

1469
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Is the state of majority opinion.

1470
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
OK.

1471
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Oh, that.

1472
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Then.

1473
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
We look at.

1474
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
This.

1475
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Dish Network.

1476
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Hey.

1477
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I don't think time is enough.

1478
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Let's jump to Europe.

1479
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Can I do this?

1480
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Host.

1481
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
OK.

1482
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
OK.

1483
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
OK.

1484
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But in fact.

1485
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That.

1486
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
We started a little late today.

1487
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So.

1488
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You can probably.

1489
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Talk as much as you want.

1490
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
OK.

1491
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
OK.

1492
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It doesn't matter.

1493
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
OK.

1494
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
OK.

1495
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
OK.

1496
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I.

1497
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Just jump to Europe.

1498
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Because everyone feels.

1499
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Because of this.

1500
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
The United States and Europe.

1501
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Jump over.

1502
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
May feel more interesting.

1503
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Europe is a little bit more.

1504
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Um.

1505
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Let me put it simply.

1506
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Is.

1507
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Everyone may have learned some.

1508
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Law 101.

1509
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Is.

1510
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Is.

1511
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The so-called mainland law.

1512
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
With.

1513
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
British and American law.

1514
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Like this.

1515
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
OK.

1516
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That.

1517
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
If you want me to be concise.

1518
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Say.

1519
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Mainland law.

1520
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
With British and American law.

1521
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I learned this.

1522
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Is it so many years?

1523
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Right.

1524
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So.

1525
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
If you ask me.

1526
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Where is the difference?

1527
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The difference is.

1528
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
The first step.

1529
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
If you have seen it.

1530
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I go back.

1531
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Is.

1532
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
If I study American law.

1533
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
At first.

1534
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Must be from.

1535
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Case facts.

1536
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
With.

1537
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Case.

1538
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That.

1539
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
What does it mean?

1540
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The United States.

1541
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
From.

1542
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
A judgment.

1543
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Thing.

1544
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Run to.

1545
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Run to.

1546
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
This step.

1547
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Run to this law.

1548
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
OK.

1549
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Is.

1550
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So.

1551
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
He has a behavior first.

1552
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Then this behavior.

1553
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
They.

1554
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
The so-called.

1555
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Human judge.

1556
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And then.

1557
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
After organizing these opinions.

1558
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Finally.

1559
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Let the Congress.

1560
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Go to the law.

1561
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And then.

1562
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
With this judgment.

1563
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Very similar.

1564
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Thing.

1565
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So.

1566
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Like just now.

1567
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Uh.

1568
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
A little bit.

1569
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But.

1570
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Is.

1571
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
This is what I just said.

1572
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Hbo.

1573
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
When the law was revised.

1574
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Why.

1575
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Very tricky place.

1576
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Because usually.

1577
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
After the revision.

1578
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Left to Congress.

1579
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Congress should.

1580
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
According to this revision.

1581
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
To do.

1582
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So.

1583
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
This is.

1584
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
American politics.

1585
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
A very strange point.

1586
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
OK.

1587
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That.

1588
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This is the United States.

1589
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Is.

1590
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
From the so-called judgment.

1591
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
To.

1592
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
The state of law.

1593
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That.

1594
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
In.

1595
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Mainland law.

1596
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Is.

1597
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's not the same.

1598
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Mainland law.

1599
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He.

1600
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Is.

1601
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Directly.

1602
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He will.

1603
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Uh.

1604
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The current state.

1605
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Then.

1606
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Directly.

1607
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Set a law.

1608
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Then.

1609
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The following case.

1610
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Is.

1611
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
OK.

1612
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So.

1613
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Probably.

1614
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
American law.

1615
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
With.

1616
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Mainland law.

1617
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The biggest difference is here.

1618
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Is.

1619
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Mainland law.

1620
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
His analysis method.

1621
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
He must be.

1622
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
The method of analysis.

1623
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Must be from.

1624
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The law.

1625
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Or.

1626
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
This.

1627
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So-called.

1628
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Directive.

1629
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Directive.

1630
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Is.

1631
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
This.

1632
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Instructions.

1633
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The so-called instructions of the EU.

1634
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
To do.

1635
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
To do.

1636
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Explain.

1637
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
To.

1638
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
After the explanation.

1639
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Then.

1640
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
What kind of.

1641
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Different ways to explain.

1642
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Is.

1643
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Expanding.

1644
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Or.

1645
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
How to explain.

1646
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
That.

1647
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So.

1648
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
This is.

1649
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Everyone.

1650
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Uh.

1651
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
If it's not a law school.

1652
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Is.

1653
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You can imagine.

1654
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We.

1655
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Before.

1656
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This is how I learned in Taiwan.

1657
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
OK.

1658
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
The teacher will talk about these things first.

1659
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And then.

1660
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Use the so-called hypothetical case.

1661
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Is.

1662
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Some so-called.

1663
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
A lot.

1664
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Then.

1665
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Simulate the operation of this law.

1666
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
May.

1667
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Happen.

1668
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
OK.

1669
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So.

1670
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Now.

1671
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's the same.

1672
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Because.

1673
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Europe is also similar.

1674
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Same as Taiwan.

1675
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's also a major law department.

1676
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So.

1677
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Look at his law.

1678
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Is.

1679
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
This is one of the.

1680
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
A very important law.

1681
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Then.

1682
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
If everyone.

1683
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's not a law school.

1684
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Just take a look.

1685
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Then.

1686
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
As long as you know.

1687
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
There is a.

1688
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
There is a clause.

1689
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
He is talking about this.

1690
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Is.

1691
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
All.

1692
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
EU.

1693
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Member States.

1694
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Is.

1695
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
He must provide this.

1696
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Uh.

1697
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Is.

1698
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Uh.

1699
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Very close to the United States.

1700
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The United States is a public performance.

1701
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
That.

1702
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
The EU is the so-called communication.

1703
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
To the public.

1704
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Of their works.

1705
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
OK.

1706
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So.

1707
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Uh.

1708
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's easy to operate.

1709
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Some people say it's easy to operate.

1710
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The point is here.

1711
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Is.

1712
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Subsequent cases.

1713
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
With.

1714
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Surrounding this.

1715
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
These words.

1716
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
One.

1717
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Two.

1718
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Three.

1719
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Four.

1720
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Five.

1721
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Six.

1722
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Seven.

1723
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
These seven words.

1724
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Is.

1725
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The so-called.

1726
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So.

1727
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Wait a minute.

1728
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Uh.

1729
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The next case will explain.

1730
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What is communication?

1731
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
What is public?

1732
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
OK.

1733
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So.

1734
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
This is the core question.

1735
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
OK.

1736
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So.

1737
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The next case.

1738
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Is.

1739
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
ITV.

1740
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
With.

1741
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
TV.

1742
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Catch up.

1743
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Is.

1744
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's the most recent.

1745
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Can't be the most recent.

1746
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
These years.

1747
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
These years.

1748
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
More important.

1749
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
About.

1750
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Uh.

1751
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
About.

1752
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
This clause.

1753
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
The case.

1754
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
OK.

1755
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But.

1756
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
TV.

1757
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Catch up.

1758
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
His actual.

1759
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
He's running.

1760
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Very close to.

1761
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Come up.

1762
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The difference is.

1763
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The difference is.

1764
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
TV.

1765
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Catch you.

1766
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's not his.

1767
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Catch the signal.

1768
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Only the British Empire area.

1769
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So.

1770
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Only in the United Kingdom.

1771
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Other consumers of the other EU.

1772
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Can't catch it.

1773
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
OK.

1774
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So.

1775
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
TV.

1776
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Catch up.

1777
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
The thing he does is like.

1778
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
He also is.

1779
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Catch the signal.

1780
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And then didn't give money.

1781
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
The early years.

1782
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Now there should be.

1783
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Because they.

1784
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Then later.

1785
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
There should be.

1786
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I see them now.

1787
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Still.

1788
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Running.

1789
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Didn't let Ariel fall.

1790
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Ariel is dead.

1791
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Don't give money.

1792
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
OK.

1793
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
TV.

1794
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Catch up.

1795
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It should have been later.

1796
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
OK.

1797
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
At that time.

1798
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
12 years.

1799
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
11 years.

1800
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
When he came out.

1801
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Didn't give money.

1802
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Don't give money.

1803
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
He was sued.

1804
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's.

1805
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Very close to that Ariel.

1806
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But for us to learn law.

1807
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I think.

1808
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Wow.

1809
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
How to be so brave.

1810
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It's.

1811
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It happened in Europe.

1812
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Then it happened in the United States.

1813
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Then.

1814
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
He was.

1815
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
He was.

1816
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Catch the signal.

1817
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Don't give money.

1818
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
OK.

1819
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Then.

1820
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Then.

1821
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I think this side.

1822
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Is a series.

1823
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The.

1824
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Directed to the so-called communication.

1825
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
To the public.

1826
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Do explanation.

1827
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
OK.

1828
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Then this is the mainland.

1829
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
The boring place.

1830
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh.

1831
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's not as interesting as the United States.

1832
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
He is.

1833
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Directed to this.

1834
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Conditions.

1835
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Do explanation.

1836
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
OK.

1837
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Then he explained that.

1838
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
First.

1839
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Is.

1840
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
His.

1841
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
His.

1842
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I'm sorry.

1843
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'm a little interrupted.

1844
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Correct.

1845
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Is.

1846
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Your side.

1847
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
This.

1848
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
TV catch-up.

1849
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
In 2013.

1850
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yes.

1851
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Then you.

1852
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The one in front of you.

1853
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Ariel.

1854
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
In 2000.

1855
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
If I remember correctly.

1856
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
2014.

1857
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
2014.

1858
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Correct.

1859
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Oh.

1860
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
2014.

1861
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
OK.

1862
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So.

1863
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
OK.

1864
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So.

1865
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
They are in time.

1866
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Did not know each other.

1867
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
What will the other party's result be?

1868
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Do not know.

1869
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Do not know.

1870
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I want to clarify this point.

1871
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Because this is an interesting.

1872
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Correct.

1873
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
OK.

1874
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Oh, really?

1875
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Thank you.

1876
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I.

1877
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But.

1878
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Because if.

1879
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Well.

1880
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
If someone has already tried it first.

1881
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Then he hit the wall.

1882
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Then the other person will know.

1883
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
What do I have to pay attention to?

1884
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But these two.

1885
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's almost parallel.

1886
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Yes.

1887
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
OK.

1888
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes.

1889
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But you can also think about it.

1890
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The EU has already happened.

1891
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
As a result, the United States.

1892
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But they are actually the same.

1893
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Because.

1894
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Their service.

1895
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Actually, it's almost time.

1896
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Just.

1897
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Um.

1898
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But they are one year apart.

1899
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
My feeling.

1900
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I guess.

1901
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Uh.

1902
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Uh.

1903
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
This is the time of judgment.

1904
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
This is the time of judgment.

1905
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What is the time of judgment?

1906
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It should be one year.

1907
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yes.

1908
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But their service time is about the same.

1909
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh.

1910
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
OK.

1911
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I see.

1912
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So they can be more than time.

1913
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Ha ha.

1914
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Oh.

1915
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
OK.

1916
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The number of times you want.

1917
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
At least one year.

1918
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So.

1919
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So they are like this.

1920
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I think their time is about the same.

1921
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Just that time.

1922
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
OK.

1923
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Just happened to show up.

1924
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Ha ha.

1925
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So.

1926
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
OK.

1927
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Of course.

1928
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
The EU judges faster.

1929
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Um.

1930
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
