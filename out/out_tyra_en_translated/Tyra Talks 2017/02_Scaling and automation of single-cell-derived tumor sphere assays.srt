1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My PhD research is mainly in microfluidics for single-cell analysis.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the content of biology, I mainly focus on cancer research.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Because we generally believe that in cancer, the heterogeneity between cells is stronger.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
For example, when we treat cancer, there will always be some antibody cells that can be used for therapy.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So if we can use single-cell analysis to see the different characteristics of each cell,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and find those antibodies to lock them in for treatment,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we believe that it can improve the efficacy of the treatment.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My research is divided into two parts.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The first part is the phenotypic assay, which I will share with you today.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The second part is also what I'm doing now.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because I haven't published the paper yet, so I haven't put it up here yet.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But the whole direction is like what Jake just introduced.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As a sample preparation chip,

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
we can extract circulating tumor cells from the patient's blood.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We get gene expression information from the cancer cells in the blood.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This gene expression information can let us know

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
what kind of drugs we can use to treat these patients to get better results.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For now, to get this gene expression information,

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
we usually use the whole flow of chips.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
In other words, we need to use a knife.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's more invasive, and the cost will be higher.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Today, I will share with you the phenotypic assay.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In the technology development, I mainly focus on scaling and automation

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
in the high-throughput single-cell device sphere assays.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
First, I will tell you why we want to do this tumor sphere assay.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In fact, the purpose is to study these tumor-initiating cells.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
In this process, I will share with you

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
why we need to scale up this assay and automate this assay.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Next, I will tell you how I enable this thing.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then, I will use some experiments to show you the functions of my chip.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Finally, I will conclude my presentation today.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
OK.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, our motivation is to study these so-called cancer stem-like cells.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Our recent research shows that

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
there is a relatively small number of tumor-initiating cells.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They are called cancer stem cells.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Some people think the term cancer stem cells is too strong.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They prefer to call them cancer stem-like cells.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In fact, it is a biological mutation.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They are a group of antibodies

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
with some stem cell-specific cancer cells.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This tissue group has some characteristics.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The first one is that it has a relatively strong chemoresistance.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It will cause tumor relapse.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In this picture, you can see that this is a primitive tumor.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The yellow one is CSC, cancer stem cell.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The blue ones are normal cancer cells.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If we use traditional cancer treatment,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
these ordinary cells can be removed.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So, we can see that the tumor size is reduced in clinical trials.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But what we can't see is this cancer stem cell.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It has a way to stay quiescent

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and not be affected by the drug.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
After we stop giving drugs,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
the tumor relapse occurs.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, in the research scope of CSC,

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we hope to find cancer stem cell-specific therapy.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, I eliminated it for this CSC.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The rest of these normal CSC,

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
sorry, these normal cancer cells,

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
they don't have the ability to self-renew.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, they proliferate.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In the end, the tumor relapse occurs.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So, this is the first reason why we want to study CSC.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The second reason is that we generally believe that

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
CSC has a strong migration ability.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In other words, it is easier to metastasize to the secondary tumor.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We know that cancer transfer is the biggest challenge in cancer therapy

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and the biggest cause of death.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, if we can study CSC more,

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
it will be very helpful in therapy, tracking, and research.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The most traditional way to study CSC is to use surface membrane protein

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
or intracellular enzymatic markers.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
For gene expression or protein expression,

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
we use different methods, such as full cytometry,

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to separate these different types of cells.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then, we can study these CSC groups.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But the challenge is that

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
many of our new markers have not been discovered.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So, we hope to use other methods to study these CSC populations.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
As a substitute, cell behavior is a common choice.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We observe that CSC can survive in a suspension culture environment

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and grow into a single-cell-derived tumor sphere.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
In other words, if it is a normal cancer cell,

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
it cannot be adhered to the substrate environment.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It will produce apoptosis.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But CSC is different.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It can not only survive in a suspension environment,

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but also grow into a new tumor sphere.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, what is the traditional way to do the sphere assay?

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The method is to buy a whale plate,

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
as shown in the picture on the bottom right.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then, dilute the whale plate to a certain level of cell concentration.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The whale plate contains one cell.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
As you can see,

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the low-throughput is a distribution of the probability,

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
or more specifically,

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
96-whale plate contains 20-30 single-cells.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It is labor-intensive.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Someone may ask,

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
can I use automatic cell dispensing,

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
such as flow cytometry,

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to ensure that I can put a cell into a whale?

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
In fact, flow cytometry has a big problem.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because it is a flow-sorting process,

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
it will produce a lot of shear stress.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So, what is the impact of cell behavior assay on downstream?

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We need to observe if the cell is dead.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If the cell is dead,

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
it is not caused by the suspension environment.

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It is caused by the flow-sorting process.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The shear stress is too high,

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and the cell can not bear it.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So, the cell is dead,

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
not because it is not CSC.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
These are the existing technology limitations.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why do we think automation is important?

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
As we mentioned,

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
CSC is a relatively small sub-population.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In the past,

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
only 1-5% of tumor cells have this sphere formation tendency.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We hope this assay can start with a larger single-cell population.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
At least 1,000 single-cells.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Then we can have a reliable statistical power

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to make our assay conclusion.

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So, we think

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to achieve this throughput,

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
microfluidics is an ideal technology

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to make this assay.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, this is our chip schematics.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We want to develop a chip

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
with more than 1,000 single-cells.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because we have a very large throughput,

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
we also need an automatic image analysis.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Otherwise, we have to read it manually.

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It is a very difficult process.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Only in this way,

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
can we make the whole experiment

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
smoothly improve on hardware and software.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So, this is our motivation.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know if there is anything I didn't explain clearly.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Or you can go on.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Ok, let's continue.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I want to ask,

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
why CSC can survive in suspension culture environment?

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is a question.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Did you hear it?

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The question is,

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
why CSC can survive in suspension culture environment?

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is a very interesting question.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will answer it in two ways.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
First,

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the definition of CSC is

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
we only inject 10 cells into the mouse.

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Can these 10 cells

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
generate a new tumor on the mouse?

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If yes,

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we define it as CSC.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The predecessors defined CSC in this way.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then, they used this traditional conventional assay

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to find out

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the cell population of tumors

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
can survive in suspension culture environment.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is the first way to find it out.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why?

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Our idea is

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
CSC can survive in suspension culture environment

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
by moving through the local environment

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to the blood vessel.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The blood vessel is a suspension environment.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If these cells

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
die in the suspension environment,

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
they can't move to other places.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So, we believe

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
CSC can survive in the blood vessel

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and grow into a tumor in a new local environment.

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We simulate this in vivo environment.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is the first way to find out CSC.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is the first way to find out CSC.

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The first way is to verify CSC

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and to find out the correlation between CSC and in-vitro experiment.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The second way is to explain the correlation.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We think CSC can mimic in-vivo environment

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and survive in suspension culture environment

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and grow into a new tumor sphere.

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Does this answer your question?

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay.

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have a related question.

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When CSC is transferred in the blood vessel,

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is it in the form of a single cell

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
or a sphere?

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is a very good question.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Most of the cells

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
are transferred in the form of a single cell.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But in recent years,

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the research of circulating tumor cells

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
found that

199
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
there are more ways to transfer tumor cells

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
in the form of clusters.

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A cluster is not a single cell

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that grows into a sphere

203
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and is transferred to another place.

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Most people believe that

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
a small number of tumor cells

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
fall from the original tumor

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and can be circulated.

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can imagine that

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
in a vast ocean,

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
is it a warship

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
or an aircraft carrier?

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They think that

213
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
a cluster is like an aircraft carrier.

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It is very powerful

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and has a stronger metathesis ability.

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But people think that

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
a cluster fell from the original tumor

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and not a single cell

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
that grows into a sphere

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and is transferred.

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Do you have an answer?

222
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
OK.

224
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Are there any other questions?

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't think so.

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can continue.

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I have a question about operation.

228
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If a worker

229
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
is holding a pipe and dripping,

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
can he catch a single cell?

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The best theoretical limit

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
is 20-30%.

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You can think of it as

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
a cell suspension solution.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's say that

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I know that

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
there are 10k cells

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
in this tube.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
On average,

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
there will be

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
a single cell

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
in 100mL or 10mL.

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
How many cells

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
are there?

245
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
There will be a single cell

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
in 100mL or 10mL.

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There will be a single cell

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
in 100mL or 10mL.

249
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The best theoretical limit

250
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
is 20-30%.

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
In fact,

252
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the control of cell density

253
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
is not ideal

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
when operating.

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So it will be worse than 20-30%.

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It is the operating limit.

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It will be worse.

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But it is almost the same, right?

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
For example,

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
is it 10% less

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
or less than 5%?

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you have good skills,

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
it can be less than 5%.

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If you don't have good skills,

265
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
it can be 5% or less.

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It is difficult to experiment.

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So it's about 15%?

268
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So if you have

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
a 96-well plate,

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
if you have a 96-well plate,

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and you have Taipei

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
almost 100 times,

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and there are only 15 cells,

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and you only have 1-5% single cell

276
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that can grow into a sphere,

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
it's really hard to do.

278
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes.

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Any other questions?

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No.

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You can continue.

282
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
OK.

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I will continue to present.

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So the first thing I want to discuss

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
is how we achieve single cell capture

286
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
in a high-throughput manner.

287
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The way we implement

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is by microfluidics.

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The principle is quite simple.

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We capture single cells

291
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
by channel blocking.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So you can imagine

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
this is a

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
microfluidics microwell

295
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
or microchamber.

296
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
This is a capture site.

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The blue part is the channel.

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This is where the water flows.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
These are the flowing cells.

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
When the cells come in,

301
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
they block this place.

302
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So the flow basically

303
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
stops.

304
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The next cell will go to the next place.

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So each well has only one cell.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
If we only have

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
10-20 chambers,

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
a simple design would be fine.

309
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But in this workbook,

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
we have to scale a chip

311
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
up to tens of thousands.

312
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
At this time,

313
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
this simple duplication

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
will cause a significant flow imbalance.

315
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
In other words,

316
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
if the entire

317
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
flow cell

318
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
comes in,

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
it will mostly be upstream or downstream.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The capture rate will be very, very low.

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How do I

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
make the cell

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
uniformly distributed

324
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
on this

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
array?

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The method I use is

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
circuit modeling.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In fact,

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
microfluidics is like

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
a flow circuit.

331
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Each channel

332
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
has a flow group.

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This flow group is mainly

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
dominated by the capture site.

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Because the flow group is the largest,

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and the size is the smallest.

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The entrance channel and the exit channel

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
are relatively small.

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But because it is very long,

340
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
the build-up resistance is also very large.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can see that the resistance of the entrance channel

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
accumulates from 1 to 200.

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is a circuit like this.

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why didn't

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the simple duplication work?

346
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because if we want

347
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
a good distribution,

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
each branch of the

349
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
current is the same.

350
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We know that

351
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
if the upper short

352
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
here is very small,

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
the lower short here is also very small,

354
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
then this thing can happen.

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But today,

356
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
we put 200

357
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
negligible short here.

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
At this time,

359
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the performance of the current

360
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
will be much worse than what we want.

361
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
How do we balance the current?

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Flow resistance

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
is actually a function

364
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
of channel geometry.

365
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You can see that

366
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
circular and rectangular

367
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
have different functions.

368
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
In short, the longer the channel,

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the higher the flow resistance.

370
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The wider the width,

371
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the smaller the flow resistance.

372
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So we use

373
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
microfabrication

374
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
to make

375
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
this very small

376
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
geometry.

377
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
First, this can achieve

378
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
high flow resistance.

379
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Second, 10x10

380
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
can block our cancer cell.

381
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Because we generally believe that

382
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
the size of the cancer cell

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
is greater than 10 microns.

384
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I will have related data

385
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to explain this later.

386
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We have overcome

387
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
the microwave

388
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
flow resistance

389
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
we have defined here.

390
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What about the entrance channel and the NC channel?

391
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I use this

392
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
microfabrication

393
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
to make 100 microns

394
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
wider and 100 microns higher

395
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
geometry.

396
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So I can make the

397
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
entrance channel and the NC channel

398
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
flow resistance

399
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
smaller than these cancer cells.

400
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
In short,

401
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
we use this microfabrication

402
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
to control our flow resistance.

403
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So we have a

404
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
very good flow circuit

405
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
to achieve single cell capture.

406
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This shows that

407
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
we use three

408
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
different sizes of chips

409
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
to scale.

410
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
From 800 to

411
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
12800

412
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
chamber chips.

413
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The size is probably on a slice.

414
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can see

415
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
that this is a device

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and every

417
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
chamber we can capture

418
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
a single cell.

419
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is a microscope image.

420
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Our cancer cell is labeled here

421
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
as a green fluorescent dye.

422
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You can see that this array

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
has a very good single cell capture.

424
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Now we have

425
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
achieved high-throughput single cell capture.

426
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
How do we

427
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
analyze it?

428
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is a comic.

429
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So

430
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
based on many habits,

431
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
we need to

432
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
automate the readout process.

433
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So how do we do it?

434
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Sorry,

435
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I have a question.

436
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You can see

437
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
that almost every

438
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
size has a single cell capture.

439
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But my question is

440
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
if you drop a sample

441
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
from beginning to end,

442
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
does every size

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
have a cell?

444
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Or if you drop a sample,

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
does every size have a

446
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
10% size capture?

447
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And you have to fill it up again and again.

448
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's a very good question.

449
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So the beauty of MicroFluidics

450
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
is that we put

451
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
cell suspension into the sample.

452
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We don't need any other

453
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
equipment. We use gravity flow.

454
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The cell solution

455
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
will gradually flow in.

456
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So the whole operation is done by a single arrangement.

457
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's not the first time, the second time, the third time.

458
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's done in one go.

459
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's like this.

460
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Tens of thousands of single cell capture.

461
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Is that reasonable?

462
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's reasonable.

463
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm just curious.

464
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
For example,

465
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
how much is the reduction

466
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
of human power?

467
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I see.

468
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It becomes only one arrangement.

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's all captured.

470
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's the reduction we achieved.

471
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So how much is the

472
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
filling ratio of this chip?

473
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Is it more than 95%?

474
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Do you mean that several chambers

475
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
can really capture a single cell?

476
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Is that the question you wanted to ask?

477
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Because this question

478
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
is related to how much time

479
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
you need to spend.

480
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So if it's one time,

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
you can change it to this.

482
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
For example, you drop it once.

483
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
How much is it?

484
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It looks like it's 100%.

485
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
At least it's 100% in my eyes.

486
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
This publication is the most beautiful.

487
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
OK, this capture rate

488
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
is 75%

489
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
in our routine.

490
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It can be optimized online.

491
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But we consider

492
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
other things.

493
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So we think 75% is a better number.

494
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll explain it later.

495
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
OK.

496
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And 12,875.

497
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's a lot.

498
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
After a cell

499
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
is captured,

500
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
this chamber will be

501
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
interrupted and nothing will come in.

502
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's right.

503
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's a very simple principle.

504
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Do you plan to

505
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
compress it

506
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
directly

507
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
or

508
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
do some pre-processing?

509
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
For example,

510
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
how do you differentiate

511
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
different cells?

512
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's a very good question.

513
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The project we want to commercialize

514
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
is

515
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
molecular analysis

516
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
or phenotypic analysis.

517
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
In my other project,

518
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
we do sample preparation.

519
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We want to

520
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
extract

521
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the mRNA transcript

522
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
from single cell

523
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and barcode it.

524
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
We can use Illumina

525
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
to do whole transcript from sequence.

526
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We can't do

527
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
sample preparation

528
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
directly from the protocol.

529
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We need to go through

530
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
upstream cell enrichment.

531
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This is

532
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
very competitive.

533
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There are many vendors

534
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
in the commercial space

535
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
like startups.

536
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
They can provide

537
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
downstream information

538
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
enhancement.

539
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
These startups

540
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
can take the blood

541
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and put it in the instrument.

542
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The result is

543
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
a tumor sample

544
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
after purification.

545
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
These tumor samples

546
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
have very limited meaning.

547
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
If you want to have clinical meaning,

548
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
you need to know

549
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
the gene expression

550
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and gene mutation.

551
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We want to finish the last mile.

552
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The commercially available

553
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
technology is

554
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
upstream

555
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
GTC purification.

556
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
We can do sample preparation

557
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
after purification

558
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to the sequencer

559
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
or next generation sequencing.

560
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Thank you.

561
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The answer is a bit long.

562
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Any other questions?

563
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
No, I can continue.

564
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Okay,

565
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I will continue.

566
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't want to

567
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
analyze so many chambers.

568
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I want to automate

569
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
the process.

570
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I use a biocompatible

571
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
cell

572
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
with green fluorescence.

573
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
We can use

574
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
fluorescence

575
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
to read out the cell.

576
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We thought it would be easy

577
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
to read out the cell.

578
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
However,

579
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
after scanning the image,

580
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
we found that

581
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the cell expression is different.

582
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They take the blood

583
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
with different efficiency.

584
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You can see the picture

585
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
with 5 cells and 6 cells.

586
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Some cells are bright and some are dark.

587
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If we use a simple

588
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
search holding,

589
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
many cells are ignored.

590
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
What should we do?

591
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We need to

592
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
use algorithms

593
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
to make

594
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
the readout more reliable.

595
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
There are four steps.

596
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
First, we do a contrast

597
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
enhancement.

598
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We use a

599
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
contrast enhancement

600
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
for this part.

601
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I will explain why later.

602
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Next, we use K-means clustering

603
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
to find the peak

604
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
of the intensity.

605
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Finally,

606
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
we can extract local maxima

607
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
to find the center

608
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
of each cell.

609
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
These three images

610
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
show the readout

611
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
of two or more cells.

612
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That's it.

613
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Contrast enhancement

614
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
has a tricky part.

615
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The contrast enhancement

616
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
is the goal of histogram equalization.

617
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The sample

618
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
has a dark background.

619
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
After using

620
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
the algorithm,

621
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
the whole circle is bright.

622
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We can't use it.

623
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
We use contrast-limited

624
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
adapted histogram equalization.

625
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We can define

626
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
each enhancement panel

627
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
to be

628
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
660 pixels

629
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
or other arbitrary

630
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
number of pixels

631
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
to do the enhancement.

632
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Under this premise,

633
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
we know

634
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
the size of a single cell

635
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
is several pixels.

636
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We can use this information

637
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
to locally magnify

638
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
the fluorescent signal

639
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of the cell.

640
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Look at the chamber.

641
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We can effectively

642
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
suppress

643
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
the background noise

644
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
to achieve the image analysis.

645
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
These are

646
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
the results of

647
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
the algorithm.

648
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You can see the suspension cell.

649
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
We can effectively

650
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
locate

651
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
each cell.

652
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
This is the state of

653
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
adherent culture.

654
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
We can effectively

655
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
identify one cell, two cells

656
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
or many cells

657
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
to fill the chamber.

658
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Although

659
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
this work is

660
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
focused on

661
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
suspension culture,

662
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
the same capture

663
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
mechanism can be used

664
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
to achieve adherent cell culture.

665
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
This is an example.

666
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The algorithm

667
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
can also do

668
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
size measurement

669
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and sphere size measurement

670
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
to determine

671
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
the size of a sphere.

672
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
These functions

673
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
can only be

674
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
implemented

675
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
on our corpus.

676
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
With this technology

677
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and algorithm,

678
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
we can do

679
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
the device

680
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
test.

681
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The first test is

682
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
the capture rate

683
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
or capture characterization.

684
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
In our test,

685
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
we optimize

686
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
the capture rate

687
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
to 76.5%.

688
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
First, we limit

689
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
the cell loading time

690
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to 15 minutes.

691
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We don't want to

692
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
leave the cell

693
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
for more than 15 minutes.

694
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
If the cell is left for too long,

695
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
it will affect the cell's

696
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
viability or

697
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
the cell's health.

698
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
In this 15-minute loading time,

699
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
we try four different

700
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
results.

701
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
No capture,

702
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
single cell,

703
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
double cell,

704
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
or multiple cell.

705
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
In the different

706
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
cell loading concentration,

707
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
the lower the cell

708
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
concentration,

709
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
the less cells are left.

710
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If we increase

711
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
the loading concentration,

712
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
the more chambers

713
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
are double cell or multiple cell.

714
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
In the cell concentration

715
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
trade-off,

716
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
50k per mL

717
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
in single cell

718
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
is 76.5%.

719
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
In fact,

720
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
if we want to push

721
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
the capture rate,

722
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
we can use

723
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
a lower cell concentration

724
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
for 30 minutes.

725
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I think we can push

726
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
the cell capture rate

727
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
to 80 or 90.

728
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Some friends say

729
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
there are more than 10k chambers

730
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
with 70% of the load.

731
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
This is also good.

732
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We think so, too.

733
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So we set the number here.

734
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Why

735
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
is there a double cell

736
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
or multiple cell

737
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
in higher concentration?

738
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
In the chamber design,

739
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
we must

740
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
let the cell block

741
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the cell capture site

742
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
so that the cell can't get in.

743
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
If the loading concentration

744
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
is high,

745
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
there is a possibility

746
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
that the first cell

747
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
may get in

748
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
before the first cell

749
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
blocks.

750
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's hard to avoid

751
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
two cells

752
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
in the same chamber.

753
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But it doesn't matter.

754
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Even if there is a multiple cell

755
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
or double cell,

756
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
all the data

757
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
is extracted

758
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
from single cell.

759
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
As we mentioned,

760
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
the size of the cancer cell

761
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
is very important.

762
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We don't want

763
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
cells smaller than 10 microns

764
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
or other sizes

765
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
to get in.

766
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It will skew

767
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
or distort

768
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
the whole experiment.

769
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
As we mentioned,

770
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
the cancer cell

771
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
is very

772
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
strange.

773
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So we must

774
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
ensure that

775
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
all sizes can be captured.

776
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So we take

777
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
the cell line

778
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
from the ground

779
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and make it round

780
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
or sphere-shaped

781
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
to quantify

782
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
its size

783
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
with the

784
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
diameter.

785
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Then we put the same cell line

786
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
or cell

787
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
in the tube

788
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
to measure its size.

789
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The distribution

790
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
is next to it.

791
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
As you can see,

792
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
the distribution is very similar.

793
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Here are four images

794
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
showing relatively small cells

795
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
about 11 or 12 microns

796
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
in diameter.

797
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
This is very rare.

798
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
One-thousandth cell

799
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
has a diameter of 40 microns.

800
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
We can effectively

801
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
preserve the size.

802
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
To sum up,

803
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
there are two challenges

804
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
to overcome.

805
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The first one is how to

806
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
scale up the throughput.

807
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The second challenge is

808
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
how to automate

809
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
the readout under

810
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
engineering innovation.

811
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
To scale up

812
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
the throughput

813
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
using a highly parallel

814
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
flow circuit,

815
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
we need

816
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
a compact

817
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
high-density array

818
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
to scale up

819
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
the image processing.

820
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
To scale up

821
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the image processing,

822
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
we need to scan

823
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
each image

824
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
in the device area.

825
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The higher the density,

826
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
the smaller the number

827
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
of frames needed

828
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
for image processing.

829
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
These are the two challenges

830
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
of engineering innovation

831
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
to scale up the throughput.

832
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
In terms of automation,

833
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
we developed a highly adaptive

834
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
algorithm to analyze

835
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
the different single cells.

836
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
We also used

837
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
the function

838
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
to analyze the size

839
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
of the single cell or sphere.

840
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Is there anything

841
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
you want to discuss?

842
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm a bit curious

843
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
about the fluorescent bag.

844
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Our fluorescent bag

845
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
uses CellTracker.

846
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
CellTracker

847
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
is a live technology.

848
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
What does it do?

849
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That's a good question.

850
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
As far as I know,

851
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
it's a bit like

852
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
a metallization product.

853
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
If the cell is alive,

854
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
it will intake

855
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
these bags

856
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
to show the color

857
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
of the cell.

858
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You may want to know

859
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
what the chemical is.

860
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I can send you the link.

861
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm curious

862
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
how you can make sure

863
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
that all the cells

864
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
will eat the bag.

865
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I don't know if

866
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
there is something

867
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
in the sample

868
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
that will be eaten by the cell.

869
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Are you worried

870
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
about the negative force?

871
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes.

872
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
In this chip,

873
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the fluorescence

874
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
is very dim.

875
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
As I said,

876
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
some cells may be very weak.

877
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's very dim.

878
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
These two cells

879
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
seem to be weaker.

880
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We try our best

881
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
to minimize the force

882
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and minimize the negative force.

883
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
As we see in this experiment,

884
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
we use manual

885
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and brightfield imaging

886
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
to verify

887
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
that the negative force

888
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
is less than 5%,

889
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
so we minimize the negative force.

890
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The second is

891
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
that we need

892
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
commercialization projects

893
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
to do molecular analysis.

894
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
In this project,

895
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
the real cell readout

896
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
is from sequencing,

897
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
not from fluorescence reading.

898
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So the readout method

899
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
is different

900
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
with different concerns

901
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and different methods.

902
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I didn't understand

903
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
what you said

904
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
about commercialization.

905
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What is the readout?

906
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We directly see

907
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
how much transcript recovery

908
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
is required.

909
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I have another question.

910
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I just calculated

911
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
the size of the chip.

912
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
For example,

913
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
a cell is about 10 microns,

914
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and a grid is

915
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
several times the width of the cell.

916
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
If you have

917
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
about 10,000 grids,

918
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and we think of it as a square,

919
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
so the length of the grid is about 100 grids,

920
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
then the chip

921
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
will be several centimeters

922
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
long.

923
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Is that right?

924
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yes.

925
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's about it.

926
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
My question is

927
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
you have a several centimeters

928
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
long chip,

929
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and you use a channel

930
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to feed through

931
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
all the slides.

932
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
How many channels

933
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
do you use to feed through

934
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
all the slides?

935
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If there is no clock

936
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
in the feeding line,

937
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
it will be a whole row.

938
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
All the slides

939
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
will not have feeding.

940
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Is that right?

941
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That's a very good question.

942
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You said

943
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
if the channel is broken,

944
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
all the slides will be dead.

945
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yes.

946
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
If the channel is broken,

947
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
there will be no cells.

948
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This is not a problem

949
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
in our experiment.

950
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
There are two reasons.

951
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
First,

952
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
each branch

953
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
has 64 or 32 chips.

954
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So

955
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
even if one branch doesn't work,

956
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
we may lose

957
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
some of the cells.

958
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Second,

959
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
if the channel is 100 microns long,

960
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
it's not easy

961
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
to break it or kill it.

962
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So there is no problem.

963
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Thank you.

964
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
How do you make the channel?

965
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Can you tell us?

966
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Of course.

967
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We use

968
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
microfabrication

969
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
to make photolithography.

970
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We use

971
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
SUA.

972
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The feature is that

973
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
we can make a channel

974
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
with a wide range of thickness.

975
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
For example,

976
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
one micron to several microns.

977
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We can define

978
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
the different

979
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
channel sizes.

980
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Thank you.

981
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Thank you.

982
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I think

983
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
it's a good question.

984
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I think everyone is following.

985
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Thank you.

986
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I have to answer

987
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
how to make

988
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
suspension culture

989
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
based on capture.

990
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
We have a

991
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
capture scheme.

992
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
The chips

993
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
are made of PDMS.

994
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
How do we make sure

995
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
that

996
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
it won't stick

997
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
to the chip?

998
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
We use

999
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
a chemical called

1000
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Peronic F108.

1001
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
The feature is that

1002
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
the two ends

1003
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
of the chemical

1004
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
have a

1005
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
hydrophobic

1006
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
core.

1007
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So what happens

1008
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
when we load

1009
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
the F108 to the chip?

1010
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
The hydrophobic core

1011
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
will stick to

1012
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
the PDMS.

1013
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The two ends

1014
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
or the pegs

1015
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
will expose

1016
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the surface of the channel.

1017
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
When the cell comes in,

1018
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
it sees that there are many pegs.

1019
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Pegs are

1020
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
a kind of

1021
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
anti-biofouling material.

1022
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
If we have

1023
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
these pegs

1024
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
on the surface,

1025
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
the cells won't be able to

1026
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
stick to the PDMS.

1027
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So we can make

1028
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
suspension cell culture.

1029
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
In this work,

1030
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
we show four different

1031
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
breast cancer cell lines.

1032
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You can see

1033
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
the sphere-forming cell

1034
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
at the top,

1035
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and the anoikis cell at the bottom.

1036
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
You can see the single cell

1037
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
at day 7 and 14

1038
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
started to form

1039
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
a humerous sphere.

1040
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The width of the chamber

1041
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
is about 100 microns.

1042
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So you can see

1043
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
the humerous sphere is relatively small.

1044
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The anoikis cell

1045
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
has

1046
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
a debris

1047
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
or cell

1048
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
inside the chip.

1049
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You can see

1050
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
that different cell lines

1051
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
look different.

1052
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Some look like balls.

1053
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Some look like grapes.

1054
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The morphology is slightly different.

1055
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Can you go back to the first page?

1056
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Sure.

1057
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
When you make cell culture,

1058
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
you should release the cell first.

1059
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
At least don't let it

1060
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
get stuck in the channel.

1061
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Right?

1062
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
OK.

1063
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
After completing cell loading,

1064
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
we will wash the cell

1065
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
to make sure

1066
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
there is no cell on the entrance channel.

1067
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Then we will flip the chip over.

1068
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
This is a more detailed

1069
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
experiment process.

1070
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So we flip the chip over

1071
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and the cell will fall into the microwave.

1072
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You can see

1073
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
from this image

1074
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that this is the capture site.

1075
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You flip it over

1076
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and it falls to the bottom.

1077
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Because of the gravity,

1078
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
it falls to the bottom.

1079
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Then it

1080
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
grows into a sphere.

1081
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Or it may die.

1082
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
OK.

1083
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
After flipping the chip over,

1084
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
you need to provide nutrients,

1085
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
right?

1086
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You need to use the same channel chip

1087
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
to do this.

1088
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That's right.

1089
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's easy to do.

1090
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We just take

1091
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
the in-and-out chips

1092
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and put them into CultureMedia.

1093
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
CultureMedia has more chips.

1094
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So it will gradually flow

1095
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to the outlet.

1096
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
We provide nutrients

1097
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
in stages.

1098
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
We change

1099
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
the frequency of Media

1100
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
once a day.

1101
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's our protocol.

1102
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I see.

1103
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Thank you.

1104
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Thank you.

1105
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We use

1106
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
this technology

1107
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
to put the cell in.

1108
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can see the sphere size distribution

1109
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and the sphere formation rate.

1110
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You can see the different cell lines.

1111
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's quite obvious.

1112
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's easy to grow into a sphere.

1113
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
First, the sphere formation rate

1114
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
is high.

1115
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
At the same time,

1116
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
the size is large.

1117
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It's smaller than other cell lines.

1118
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The result is

1119
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
quite consistent.

1120
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It proves

1121
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
the capability

1122
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
of our technology.

1123
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
What else

1124
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
can we do

1125
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
with this technology?

1126
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
We can

1127
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
get the

1128
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
sphere formation rate

1129
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
with this technology.

1130
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
We can see more details

1131
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and information.

1132
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
First, the relationship

1133
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
between stem cell and

1134
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
stem cell.

1135
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's controversial.

1136
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Some people think

1137
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
the smaller cell

1138
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
is related to

1139
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
stem cell gene.

1140
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
The lower the stem cell gene,

1141
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
the smaller the cell.

1142
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
However,

1143
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
mitochondria

1144
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
have more

1145
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
and larger cell lines.

1146
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It increases the size of the cell.

1147
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
At the same time,

1148
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
it makes the cell look more

1149
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
stem-like.

1150
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
What's going on?

1151
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
We can

1152
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
understand stemness

1153
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
from sphere formation rate.

1154
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
We have a good algorithm

1155
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
to analyze

1156
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
the size of mitochondria.

1157
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
We can study the impact of

1158
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
different size groups on sphere formation rate.

1159
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You can see

1160
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
cell size distribution.

1161
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We can see

1162
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
the size of

1163
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the single cell

1164
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
in different cell lines.

1165
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We can see

1166
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
the size of

1167
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
the single cell

1168
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
in different cell lines.

1169
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We can compare

1170
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
the size of

1171
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
inter-cell line.

1172
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We can compare

1173
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the sphere formation rate

1174
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
of the first 30%

1175
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
of mitochondria.

1176
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
The result is very interesting.

1177
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
In the experiment of

1178
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
SOM-159,

1179
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
we can observe

1180
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
that the smaller cell size

1181
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
is larger than

1182
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
the larger cell

1183
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
in the sphere formation rate.

1184
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
However,

1185
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
in SOM-149 and

1186
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
T47,

1187
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
the fourth cell line

1188
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
has no difference.

1189
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
We think

1190
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
in different cell lines

1191
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
or different pathway regulations,

1192
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
they may be different.

1193
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It also explains

1194
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
why other people

1195
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
get different conclusions.

1196
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
We can't study the correlation

1197
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
directly from size.

1198
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
We have to look at

1199
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
gene regulation

1200
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
to determine whether it is CSE.

1201
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Size is not a reliable

1202
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
CSE marker.

1203
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
This is

1204
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
the conclusion.

1205
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Next,

1206
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
we can check the size

1207
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
of the sphere in

1208
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Day 0, Day 7, and Day 14.

1209
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
We can see

1210
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
the growth

1211
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
in each stage.

1212
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We can see

1213
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
that in each cell line,

1214
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
some cells

1215
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
grow very fast in the first week

1216
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and not so fast in the second week.

1217
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
In contrast,

1218
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
some cells grow very slow

1219
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
in the first week,

1220
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
but in the second week,

1221
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
they grow bigger.

1222
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
This is

1223
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
the plot

1224
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
on the

1225
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
scattering plot.

1226
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
If we put

1227
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Day 7's sphere diameter

1228
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
on X,

1229
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Day 14's on X,

1230
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
we can see

1231
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
that Day 7's

1232
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
sphere diameter

1233
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
is basically

1234
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
1X.

1235
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
If Day 14's

1236
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
sphere diameter

1237
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
is 1X,

1238
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Day 14's

1239
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
sphere diameter

1240
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
is 1X.

1241
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Day 14's

1242
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
sphere diameter

1243
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
is 1X.

1244
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Day 14's

1245
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
sphere diameter

1246
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
is 1X.

1247
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Day 14's

1248
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
sphere diameter

1249
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
is 1X.

1250
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Day 14's

1251
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
sphere diameter

1252
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
is 1X.

1253
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
In the theory of

1254
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
cancer stem cells,

1255
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
oncologists believe

1256
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
that there is

1257
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
a tumor-stem cell hierarchy,

1258
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
meaning that

1259
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
it can't further differentiate

1260
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
into regular cells.

1261
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
We believe that

1262
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
these progenitor cells

1263
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
are not yet

1264
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
fully compatible,

1265
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
so they can also

1266
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
produce a tumor sphere.

1267
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
However,

1268
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
it is not a stem cell,

1269
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
so it can't

1270
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
self-renew

1271
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
after proliferating

1272
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
several times.

1273
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
On the other hand,

1274
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
cancer stem cells

1275
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
have a quiescent property,

1276
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
which means

1277
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
they don't like proliferation.

1278
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
They may grow slowly at first,

1279
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
but it doesn't mean

1280
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
they don't want to.

1281
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
When I showed this result

1282
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
to our collaborators,

1283
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
they were very interested.

1284
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
In their hypothesis,

1285
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
although there are

1286
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
so many sphere-forming cells,

1287
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
this cell line

1288
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
is a special cell line

1289
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
with a lot of progenitor cells

1290
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
and strong sphere-forming capability.

1291
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That's why

1292
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
the proliferation rate

1293
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
in the second week

1294
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
is so much lower.

1295
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
SOM149 is more

1296
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
compatible with

1297
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
oncologists' cancer stem cell model.

1298
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It may be quiescent at first,

1299
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
but it can continue

1300
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
to proliferate.

1301
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Through this technology,

1302
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
we can see

1303
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
the proliferation

1304
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
of single-cell

1305
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
derived sphere

1306
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
and

1307
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
study the

1308
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
cancer stem cell hierarchy.

1309
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This is the second part

1310
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
of our technology presentation.

1311
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
To sum up,

1312
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
the high-throughput single-cell

1313
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
derived sphere as a chip

1314
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
can scale from

1315
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
800 to

1316
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
more than 10,000 wells.

1317
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
The capture rate

1318
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
is now

1319
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
around 76%.

1320
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
When capturing the cell,

1321
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
the representative cell size

1322
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
per population

1323
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
is equal to the block.

1324
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We can make sure

1325
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
that we didn't

1326
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
change the cell

1327
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
in the cell process.

1328
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We didn't scale the result.

1329
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
We also used

1330
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
genetic analysis algorithm

1331
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
to help us

1332
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
do cell counting

1333
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and cell sphere size measurement.

1334
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Without these functions,

1335
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
it is difficult to

1336
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
quantify the sphere formation rate

1337
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and observe the dynamic

1338
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
of sphere formation.

1339
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
At the end of the presentation,

1340
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I told you

1341
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
about two different

1342
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
experimental results.

1343
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
The first one is

1344
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
the comparison of cell size

1345
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and cell strength.

1346
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
We don't think

1347
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
cell size is a good CSE marker.

1348
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
We think

1349
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
there are more

1350
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
gene regulation

1351
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
that we need to study

1352
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
in the cell,

1353
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
not just cell size.

1354
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
We also showed

1355
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
the ability to track

1356
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
the process of sphere formation.

1357
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
This can help oncologists

1358
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
to study

1359
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
tumor stem

1360
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and cancer stem cell hierarchy

1361
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
to help them understand

1362
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
the details.

1363
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
This work

1364
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
was published in

1365
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Lab on a Chip last August.

1366
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
If you are interested,

1367
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
you can check it out.

1368
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Thank you

1369
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
our lab

1370
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
for being with me

1371
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
for an hour.

1372
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
If you have any questions,

1373
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
feel free to ask.

1374
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I have a question.

1375
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Can you go back to the page

1376
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
before the conclusion?

1377
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
This page?

1378
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yes.

1379
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I have a question.

1380
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
How do you rule out

1381
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
the size of the culture well?

1382
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's about 100 microns.

1383
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
How do you rule out

1384
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
the size of the chamber?

1385
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The speed

1386
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
is not limited

1387
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
to the size of the space.

1388
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's the

1389
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
characteristic of the sphere.

1390
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Is the entrance small?

1391
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'm asking

1392
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
the size of the chamber

1393
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
is not limited

1394
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
to the size of the chamber.

1395
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
The size of the chamber

1396
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
is not limited

1397
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
to the size of the chamber.

1398
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That's a good question.

1399
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
The entrance

1400
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
is set at

1401
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
50 microns.

1402
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
We observed

1403
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
the cell population.

1404
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The cell population

1405
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
is not more than 50.

1406
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
If a cell

1407
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
is very powerful,

1408
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
it will grow fully in the first week.

1409
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
How do I know

1410
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
if it will grow slowly

1411
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
in the first week?

1412
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That's a good question.

1413
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
In fact, we set 100 microns.

1414
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
From our experience,

1415
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
very few cells can grow

1416
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
more than 100 microns.

1417
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
The reason you can see so much

1418
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
is because our data is

1419
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
very large.

1420
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
We can observe

1421
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
very few cases

1422
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
in our data.

1423
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
If you are really interested,

1424
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
it's not difficult

1425
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
to solve this problem.

1426
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
We can change the chamber size

1427
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
to 150 microns

1428
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
to solve the problem.

1429
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
However,

1430
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
in the context of work,

1431
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
the chamber size is a minority.

1432
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's not the focus of our research.

1433
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Our focus is to demonstrate

1434
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
the capability.

1435
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So we set 100 microns

1436
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
as the chamber size.

1437
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I have a question.

1438
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
How do you

1439
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
quantify

1440
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
the gene performance

1441
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
of a single cell?

1442
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
This is my

1443
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
other work.

1444
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
If you are interested

1445
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
in the gene performance

1446
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
of a single cell,

1447
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
you can read

1448
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
a paper published

1449
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
in Cell.

1450
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It basically

1451
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
barcodes

1452
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
each cell

1453
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
and transcript.

1454
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
From next-generation sequencing,

1455
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
we can infer

1456
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
which cell

1457
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
this transcript

1458
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
comes from.

1459
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
We can quantify

1460
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
the strength of gene performance

1461
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
by this way.

1462
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
The way it captures

1463
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
messenger RNA is

1464
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
to put a

1465
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
poly-T-tail to capture

1466
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
a poly-A-tail.

1467
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So they can hybridize

1468
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
and barcode.

1469
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I have already captured

1470
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
these cells.

1471
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
How do you transfer them

1472
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
to a single-cell RNA-seq

1473
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
device?

1474
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
In molecular

1475
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
analysis,

1476
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
we use

1477
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
a bead

1478
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
as our

1479
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
mRNA-captured carrier.

1480
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
This technology

1481
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
is introduced

1482
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
by Dropseq.

1483
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
They introduce

1484
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
this technology

1485
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and license it

1486
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
to a company.

1487
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
We buy the product

1488
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
from the company

1489
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
and put the bead

1490
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
into our chip

1491
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
to capture mRNA.

1492
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We take the bead

1493
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and do downstream amplification

1494
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
for gene sequencing.

1495
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It sounds like

1496
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
we will succeed.

1497
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
We still have a long way to go.

1498
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Yes.

1499
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
We don't have any more questions.

1500
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Thank you again

1501
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
for the wonderful lecture.

1502
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Thank you for inviting me.

1503
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Thank you.
