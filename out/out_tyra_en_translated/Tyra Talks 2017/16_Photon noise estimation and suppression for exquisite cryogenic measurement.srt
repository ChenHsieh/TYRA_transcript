1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, let's welcome everyone to participate in today's TARA speech.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today's speaker is Mr. Zhang Yanyong.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He is now a Ph.D. student in astronomy and physics at Caltech.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Before coming to Caltech, he studied at NTU Physics and NTU Mechanics.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
During his time at NTU, he specialized in accelerometers,

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
half astronomy and half accelerometers, high-performance physics experiments.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now he is at Caltech, he specializes in dark matter experiments,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which are more astronomical.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So today's speech is mainly about...

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Zhang Yanyong.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's mainly about how they detect their detectors in design experiments.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to share it with you.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Some of it has nothing to do with today's speech,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but it has a lot to do with the speaker.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Zhang Yanyong is a disciplined, self-trained athlete.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He is a good trainer.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you are interested in running, cycling, or surfing,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
he has a lot of experience.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He also likes to discuss these things with you.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Lastly, as you have heard,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
today is Zhang Yanyong's birthday.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Actually, it's not yesterday, it's today.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know why Zhang Yanyong...

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Did Zhang Yanyong say that he was drunk yesterday because it was his birthday?

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not easy to forget your birthday.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I decided to sing a happy birthday song for Zhang Yanyong.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You can open the microphone and sing together.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's welcome Zhang Yanyong to share his research with us.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll turn off the microphone.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Can you hear me?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because I found that the new version of BlueJeans

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
can't use a lot of screens on Linux.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So the topic I'm going to talk about is

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Photon Noise Estimation and Suppression for Explicit Cryogenic Measurement.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why did I choose this topic?

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The reason is...

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Of course, this is very specific.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's an example of what we're doing right now.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But we all know that

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
any experiment needs to pursue a higher sensitivity.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The current trend in the world is that we're going to do it at a lower temperature.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because basic statistical physics tells us that

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
no matter what system it is,

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
its noise is basically related to temperature.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So the lower the temperature, the lower the noise.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So today I want to talk about something more general.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
For most people, whether they're listening now

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
or watching on the Internet,

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
those who are doing experiments

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and want to take it,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
whether you want to put your experiment device into a liquid nitrogen

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
or a liquid nitrogen solution,

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
or like we use cryogenic dilution fridge,

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
are all useful technologies.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In order to further promote its sensitivity in our experiments,

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
we developed an application of this technology.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Next slide.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
what our traditional concept of noise is.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why these concepts are very meaningful

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
if you think through the details.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But it's not something we can apply directly to our experiments.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
First of all, what you're seeing now is called

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
thermal noise,

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
which we think is traditionally classical noise.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Of course, we have to say it's Johnson-Nyquist noise

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
because Johnson-Nyquist is the person who invented it.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Its feature is that it's very wide,

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that is, it's maybe 10 hertz.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What you see on the screen

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
may be from 10 hertz to tens of millions of hertz.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's the whole range

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that you can see this kind of noise signal.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And it's flat, so it's called white noise.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's like white light.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We know that Johnson found that

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
this noise only has to do with the temperature

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
of the instrument that produces this noise,

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
or the equivalent temperature.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It doesn't have to do with anything else.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
For example, I have a resistor today,

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and it keeps producing noise.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This resistor, whether it's made of cement,

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
wire, metal, or air,

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it doesn't matter.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
As long as the temperature of this thing is like that,

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
its noise is like that.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is a very special thing.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So at the beginning of the 20th century,

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
it was a very special physics.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That is, you would have expected

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
that this thing would keep producing that noisy signal.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Should it be related to its material?

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The answer is no.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But later on, the development of quantum mechanics

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
immediately made people think,

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
isn't this the same as black radiation?

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What is black radiation?

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Black radiation is its light or energy.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Its energy is kT,

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and it only has to do with temperature.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because no matter what material it is,

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
they exchange energy with light.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I've already said that.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So here's a question.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What is it that makes this classical system

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
reach thermal equilibrium?

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The answer is light.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No matter what material it is, it's all light.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So this light becomes...

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Later on, Planck found that

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
as long as light reaches thermal equilibrium,

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
this thing will emit light.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It has nothing to do with material.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It has nothing to do with temperature.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then it's called black radiation.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But we also know that black radiation

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
is the most important thing in human history.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It is the first direct evidence,

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and it has been explained,

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and it has started the so-called quantum era.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Without quantum mechanics,

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
without the phenomenon of quantum being brought into physics,

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
there is no way to explain black radiation.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So here's a very strange thing.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We say this is a classical system.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Classical thermal equilibrium has this phenomenon.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But without quantum mechanics,

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
there is no way to explain it.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So why does this happen?

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you put any material in a temperature,

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
put it in a temperature environment,

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
which is more scientific,

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
which is called photon bath.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Then through these quantum particles,

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
which is what we call photons,

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
exchange energy to reach thermal equilibrium,

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
there will be this classical effect.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why is this thing?

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because in fact...

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why is the classical description

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
applicable to the quantum phenomenon?

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It has a very important reason.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This reason will also tell me today

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
why it is very relevant to future experiments.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Because in past experiments,

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
we usually think that

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I operate in classical regime,

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think classical,

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that is, T equals 4KT.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If I operate in quantum regime,

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think quantum.

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But why is this important?

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because I have already said that

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
in this classical noise,

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it actually comes from quantum effect.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But why can we use

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
classical treatment to think about this thing?

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because if you look at the textbook

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
or you look at the wiki,

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
roughly, usually at a normal temperature,

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I write Montaigne here.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In fact, I just want to imply that

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
in fact, we are not doing

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the experiment we are doing now in the future.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
At a normal size,

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
for example, as big as your palm,

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
a normal temperature,

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
for example, a thing of room temperature,

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
it emits a ray of black radiation.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That ray of light

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
is every second,

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
every square meter,

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
it will emit 10 to 20 times of radiation.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So much that it's like

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
when you go to drink water,

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you won't feel a drop of water

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
hitting your tongue.

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's like a continuous state.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So a classical description can be used.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So it can be calculated as 4KT.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But we can't forget that

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
if you look at its spectrum,

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
it can't be explained by classical physics.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It must be quantized.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's why we started the quantum era.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So I can ask a question.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If your tongue is really sensitive,

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
when you drink water,

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
can you feel a drop of water?

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Think about this question.

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I will continue to talk later.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Then everyone will know

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
why I'm asking this question.

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This question is actually quite interesting.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Next time you drink water,

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you can think about

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
if I can feel a drop of water

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
on my tongue.

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is the first type.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Now let's look at the second type.

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The second type is called shock noise

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
or Poisson noise.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Of course, Poisson comes from

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Poisson distribution.

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think most people who study quantum mechanics

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
have studied it.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is a mathematical description.

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
When you have a fixed probability,

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you can calculate

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
the probability of something happening

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
in the fixed probability.

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But sometimes I see it,

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and the last chance I see it

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
is the biggest.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The last chance I see it is the smallest.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If you look at the picture on the right,

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
for example, let's look at the blue and purple.

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
On average,

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
there is a certain probability

225
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that you will see something

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
four times.

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For example, you see it four times

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
in one minute.

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If you see it five times

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
in one minute,

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
it will be smaller.

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you see it six times,

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
it will be smaller.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But you actually have a chance

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to see it 50 or 20 times

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
in one minute.

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But the chance is very small.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You see it is very small here.

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And zero times is also very small.

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This thing is called Poisson distribution.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It is a system

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that requires quantization

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to be resolvable.

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
For example,

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
if the leaves fall down for a minute,

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
how many pieces can you see?

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You can see this quantization.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why?

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What we are implying here is that

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
as a detector,

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the resolution of your timing

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
is much higher than

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the frequency at which the leaves fall down,

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
rather than the

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
frequency at which the leaves fall down.

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So you can see this quantization.

257
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So it becomes shot noise.

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But you will suddenly find that

259
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
shot noise is a peak.

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's bulging here,

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
on the right side of the picture.

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's not like the picture above.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a whole screen.

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But in theory,

265
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
they are just different.

266
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you have that kind of resolution

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
that can see

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the leaves fall down

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
or the frequency

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
of the water molecules hitting the tongue?

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But its nature

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is very different.

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You see this shot noise.

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's a very narrow band.

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's a peak here.

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And it's due to quantization.

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's due to the quantum nature

278
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
of carrier or event.

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The example I just gave

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
is the leaves falling down.

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But I can give another example.

282
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
For example,

283
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
if there is a導線 today,

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you charge it.

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The resistance of the導線 is very small.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So through the current,

287
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the particles of the electron

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
are very, very, very many.

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So it feels like

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the thermal noise

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I just mentioned.

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's also very typical.

293
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's how people measure

294
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
thermal noise.

295
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But it's exactly the same thing.

296
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If I put a導線 today

297
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and use the pressure to do it,

298
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is the resistance super, super big?

299
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's so big

300
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that you can't measure it.

301
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Uh,

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
a dozen,

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
a dozen,

304
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
a dozen,

305
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
a dozen,

306
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
a dozen,

307
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
a dozen,

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
a dozen,

309
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
a dozen,

310
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
a dozen,

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
a dozen,

312
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
a dozen,

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
a dozen,

314
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
a dozen,

315
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
a dozen,

316
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
a dozen,

317
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
a dozen,

318
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
a dozen,

319
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
a dozen,

320
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
a dozen,

321
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
a dozen,

322
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
a dozen,

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
a dozen,

324
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
a dozen,

325
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
a dozen,

326
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
a dozen,

327
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
a dozen,

328
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
a dozen,

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
a dozen,

330
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
a dozen,

331
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
a dozen,

332
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
a dozen,

333
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
a dozen,

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
a dozen,

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
a dozen,

336
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
a dozen,

337
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
uh,

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
a visionure

339
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
dozen thousand.

340
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So how was

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
that pressure-cousine

342
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and小光

343
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,000


344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
showed

345
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
a video

346
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
but if you give it

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
a very,

348
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
very,

349
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
very large voltage

350
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
it can destroy

351
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
that

352
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
then let it pull

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
out a

354
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
pull out a

355
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
good

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
like this

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
is shot

358
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
noise

359
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
but shot noise

360
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
in the

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
inside

362
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
is usually

363
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
happening

364
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in you

365
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
have to

366
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
apply

367
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
a very,

368
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
very large

369
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
energy

370
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
to stimulate

371
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
this thing

372
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
may happen

373
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
in a small

374
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
opportunity

375
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
that

376
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you can see

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
but see the

378
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
number is very

379
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
few,

380
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
so once,

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
twice,

382
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
three times

383
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
you can see

384
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
quantization

385
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
but we

386
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
want to do

387
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
experiments

388
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
in the future

389
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
good

390
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm

391
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm

392
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
good

393
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
so

394
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
in principle

395
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
any

396
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
signal

397
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
can be

398
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
uh

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
poisson

400
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
if we

401
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
have infinite

402
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
timing

403
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
resolution

404
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you will

405
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
feel

406
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and then

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
return to

408
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the original

409
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
state to

410
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
feel the

411
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
next

412
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
molecule

413
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
in fact,

414
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
you can

415
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
feel the

416
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
shot noise

417
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
when you

418
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
drink

419
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
water

420
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
is that

421
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
you are

422
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
hit by the

423
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
tongue

424
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
is not a

425
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
fixed

426
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
water

427
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
pressure

428
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
ok

429
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
good

430
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
that

431
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
we

432
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
why

433
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
we

434
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
actually

435
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
like a

436
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
can feel

437
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
when drinking

438
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
water molecules

439
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
hit us

440
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
one by one

441
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
we want to

442
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
resolve

443
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
there is no

444
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
such a

445
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
resolution

446
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
experiment

447
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
for example

448
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
we generally

449
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
expect in

450
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the simulation

451
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
ah

452
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
every five years

453
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
or ten years

454
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
of operation

455
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
why

456
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
five years

457
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
or ten

458
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
years

459
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
because

460
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
this is the

461
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
DOE

462
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
theory

463
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
we can see

464
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
usually expect

465
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
for example,

466
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
five or ten

467
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
events will

468
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
happen

469
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and then

470
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
ah

471
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
for example,

472
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
like the

473
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
dark matter

474
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
or like

475
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
ah

476
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
no

477
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
DOE

478
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
beta

479
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
beta

480
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
change

481
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
or

482
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
DOE

483
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
hit the

484
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
atomic box

485
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and then

486
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the original

487
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
DOE

488
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and then

489
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
bounce out

490
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
this rare

491
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and then

492
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
of course

493
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
we can not

494
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
take them

495
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
that we observe

496
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
several times

497
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to

498
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
ah

499
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
to translate into

500
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
there is no

501
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
new physics

502
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to make these

503
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
things happen

504
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
is very

505
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
important

506
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
so we are

507
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
basically doing

508
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
this

509
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
good

510
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
but I just

511
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
said ah

512
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
you see oh

513
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
every five years

514
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
can see a few

515
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
events

516
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
means that

517
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you can see

518
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
a year

519
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
probably

520
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ah

521
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
normal

522
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
energy

523
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
excitation

524
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
for example,

525
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
the magnetic field of the earth

526
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
for example,

527
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
you give it a voltage

528
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because you want to

529
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
charge

530
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
this thing

531
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to reach a

532
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
physical

533
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
stable

534
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
time

535
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
it

536
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
every second

537
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
per square meter

538
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
area

539
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
to release

540
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
ten

541
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
twenty-one

542
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
square

543
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
light

544
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
has been crazy

545
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to hit

546
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
your

547
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
detector

548
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
what

549
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
every year

550
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you can see

551
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
ten twenty-five

552
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
square

553
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
ah

554
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
light

555
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and then

556
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
this middle

557
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
may be involved

558
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
a

559
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
ok

560
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
one of

561
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
this you want to

562
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
see the

563
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
event

564
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
so basically

565
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
you can not

566
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
tell

567
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
you can not

568
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
tell

569
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that

570
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
ah

571
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
this

572
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
this

573
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
in my

574
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
detector

575
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
inside

576
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
trigger

577
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
up

578
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
this

579
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
event

580
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
this

581
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
first

582
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
second

583
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
is basically

584
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you only have

585
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
ten twenty-five

586
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
square

587
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
one-third

588
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
of the

589
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
opportunity

590
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
to store

591
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
data

592
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the rest

593
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
is the

594
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
trash

595
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
that

596
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
this

597
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
basically

598
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
is

599
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
that

600
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you can not

601
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
have a good

602
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
data

603
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
is

604
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
data

605
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
acquisition

606
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
system

607
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and

608
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
electronics

609
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to store

610
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
it

611
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and

612
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
all the

613
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
trash

614
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
so we have to

615
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
find a way to

616
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
deal with

617
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
this thing

618
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
that is

619
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the simplest

620
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and most

621
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
intuitive

622
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and basically

623
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
all have

624
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to do

625
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
high sensitivity

626
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
experiment

627
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
no matter

628
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
what

629
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I know

630
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
now the

631
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
grassland

632
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
there are people

633
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
doing

634
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
them to put

635
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
the sensor

636
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
because if

637
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
you go to

638
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
look at the

639
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
black radiation

640
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
of the

641
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
black radiation

642
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
of the

643
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
light

644
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
of the

645
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
flux

646
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
that

647
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
is what

648
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the flow

649
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
is proportional

650
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
to the

651
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
temperature of

652
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
three times

653
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
so for

654
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
example,

655
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
300k is

656
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
probably

657
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
room temperature

658
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and then

659
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
30

660
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
is now

661
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
common

662
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
we know

663
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that

664
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
it can

665
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
but it

666
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
only has one

667
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
super small

668
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
point that

669
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
is not

670
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
because that

671
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
it is basically

672
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
studying the

673
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
temperature of the

674
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
change itself

675
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
it can not

676
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
contain a

677
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
experiment

678
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
in a container

679
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
we know

680
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
now can

681
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
be stable

682
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and long

683
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
time

684
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
operation

685
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
is about

686
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
230

687
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
minikelvin

688
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
we say

689
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
if you put

690
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
a room temperature

691
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
of the

692
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
device

693
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
temperature

694
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
is 423

695
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
12 times

696
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
that above

697
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
the above

698
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I just said

699
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
every second

700
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
every square

701
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
meter

702
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
there will be 21

703
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
so you

704
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
do this

705
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you do this

706
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
to reduce it

707
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
to every second

708
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
square meter

709
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
there will be

710
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
9 times

711
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
of light

712
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
value

713
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
that if you

714
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
want to

715
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
operate

716
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
for example,

717
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
how many years

718
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
you now

719
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
may have

720
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
10

721
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
12 times

722
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
12

723
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
13 times

724
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
montre

725
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and so on

726
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
but you have

727
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
one year

728
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
so we

729
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
now have

730
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
12 to

731
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
12 to

732
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
13 times

733
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
12 to

734
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
13 times

735
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
to reduce

736
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
how can we do it?

737
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
we can do another thing

738
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
is that we can find

739
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
some things

740
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
he absorbed

741
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
infrared light

742
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
is very strong

743
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
ok

744
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I give an example

745
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
for example

746
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
for example

747
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
there are some

748
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
plastic materials

749
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
your eyes

750
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
see it is transparent

751
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
such as

752
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the acrylic

753
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
box

754
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
but in fact

755
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
he is

756
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
infrared

757
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is not completely

758
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
transparent

759
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
infrared hit him

760
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
will be completely

761
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
absorbed

762
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
OK

763
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
then I thought

764
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
that good

765
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that's great

766
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
that I put

767
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
my experiment

768
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
all wrapped in

769
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
this kind of

770
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
acrylic inside

771
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
that would not

772
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
get it

773
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the answer is not

774
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
because

775
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
why

776
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
an external

777
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
environment

778
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
will put out

779
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
infrared

780
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
because it is

781
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
a black body

782
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
that he put out

783
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
infrared purpose

784
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
or its function

785
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
is what

786
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the temperature

787
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
is lower than

788
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
his thing

789
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
or will absorb

790
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
his infrared

791
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
things

792
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
to heat balance

793
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
OK

794
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
so you

795
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
you can say

796
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
good

797
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I put a

798
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
box on my

799
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
experiment

800
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
equipment

801
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
at first

802
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
you will find

803
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
infrared

804
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
noise

805
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
is to hit

806
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
your detector

807
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
infrared

808
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
noise

809
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
suddenly

810
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
down

811
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
but slowly

812
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
slowly

813
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
slowly

814
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
slowly

815
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
super

816
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
this box

817
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
will also become

818
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
that source

819
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
temperature

820
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and then he became

821
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
source temperature

822
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and then

823
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
no matter what material

824
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
it is a black body

825
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
it is a black body

826
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
he put out

827
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
the photon

828
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
just related to

829
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
its temperature

830
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
so basically

831
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
you cover

832
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
a photon

833
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
a black body

834
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and that you do

835
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
not want

836
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the temperature

837
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
next to your

838
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
detector

839
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
so we

840
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
searched

841
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
a lot of

842
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
material

843
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
if we

844
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
exchange

845
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
privately

846
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
but usually

847
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
can not be used to

848
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
say that we have a

849
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
lot of material

850
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
is a material

851
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
library

852
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
for this thing

853
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
to compile

854
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
a super

855
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
material library

856
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and then we found

857
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
one thing

858
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
is that we

859
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
picked a few

860
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
of its absorption

861
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
very strong

862
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
material

863
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and its

864
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
material

865
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
its own

866
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
thermal conductivity

867
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
is very good

868
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
so you just

869
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
put this

870
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
material

871
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
on another

872
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
temperature

873
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
it can

874
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
continue to

875
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
take this

876
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
300k light

877
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
up and

878
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
pass it

879
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
away

880
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
it can continue

881
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
to maintain

882
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
the 50k

883
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
it touched

884
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
that thing

885
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
so it

886
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
is equal to

887
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
you put a

888
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
300k

889
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
noise

890
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
photon

891
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
source

892
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
into a

893
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
50k

894
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
photon

895
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
source

896
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
but

897
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
see the picture

898
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
on the right

899
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
this is just

900
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I want to say

901
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
that if you

902
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
but this thing

903
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
took us a lot of

904
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
time

905
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
that we also

906
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
hope that

907
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
all kinds of

908
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
applications

909
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
can be

910
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
exchanged

911
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and then we

912
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
can have

913
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
collaborators

914
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
need this

915
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
thing we

916
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
are all

917
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
welcome

918
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
so good

919
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and then

920
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
next

921
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I take a look

922
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I did

923
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
this wrong

924
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
but

925
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
next

926
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
is that

927
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
we want to

928
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
say

929
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
traditionally

930
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
if you

931
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
look at

932
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
how much light

933
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
hit

934
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
us in

935
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
this

936
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
particle physics

937
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
inside

938
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
we usually

939
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
know that

940
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
we are in the

941
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
accelerator

942
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
inside

943
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the collision

944
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
particle

945
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
particle

946
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
energy

947
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
are very,

948
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
very high

949
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
high to

950
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
its wavelength

951
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I do not know

952
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
you know

953
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the wavelength

954
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
is probably

955
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the energy

956
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
of the

957
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
wavelength

958
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
is usually

959
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
very,

960
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
very,

961
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
very high

962
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
zlich

963
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
is small

964
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
is using

965
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
because

966
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
now

967
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
on the

968
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
keyboard

969
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
keyboard

970
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
from which

971
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the radius

972
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
radius

973
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
right

974
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
how big

975
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
is probably

976
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
a little

977
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
less than

978
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
1.22

979
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Ok

980
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
if

981
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
you see

982
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
now

983
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
that

984
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you think

985
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
it is a dense

986
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
that I can tell you

987
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
that is probably

988
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
0.0

989
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
0.1

990
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
to 0.1

991
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
mm

992
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
is about 100

993
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
microns

994
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
OK

995
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
good

996
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
that if there is a

997
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
particle

998
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
it in

999
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
that

1000
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
strong

1001
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
magnet

1002
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
magnet

1003
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
is made

1004
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
out of

1005
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
its energy

1006
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is 14

1007
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
so its

1008
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
length

1009
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
is smaller

1010
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
than

1011
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
nanometer

1012
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
so

1013
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
this

1014
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
is a

1015
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
space

1016
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
right

1017
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
it can pass

1018
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
directly

1019
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it will not

1020
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
touch anything

1021
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
so

1022
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
on the

1023
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
traditional

1024
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
particle

1025
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
simulation

1026
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
all of

1027
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
these

1028
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
tool

1029
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
kits

1030
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
assume

1031
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that

1032
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
these

1033
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
particles

1034
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
are a

1035
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
point

1036
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
without

1037
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
size

1038
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and

1039
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
when it

1040
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
travels

1041
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
it

1042
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
will

1043
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
travel

1044
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
in

1045
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
a

line

1048
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so

1049
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
this is

1050
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
what you

1051
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
see

1052
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
these

1053
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
lines

1054
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
are

1055
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
particles

1056
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
in

1057
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
simulation

1058
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
it

1059
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
travels

1060
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
in

1061
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000

line

1063
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
so

1064
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
we

1065
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
put

1066
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
the

1068
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000

1071
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and

1072
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
we

1073
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
can

1074
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
simulate

1075
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
but

1076
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
we have

1077
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
to draw

1078
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
a line

1079
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and

1080
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
get an

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
event

1082
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
so

1083
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
we

1084
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
just

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000

year

1090
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
we

1091
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
have to

1092
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000

you

you
