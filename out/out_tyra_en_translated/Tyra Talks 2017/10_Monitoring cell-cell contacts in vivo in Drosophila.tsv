0	5000	Okay, no problem.
5000	7680	Hello everyone, I'm Dinghao.
7680	10480	I'm a postdoc at Caltech.
10480	11920	The topic I'm going to talk about
11920	15360	is mainly my research on some of my papers.
15360	19440	My research is about
19440	23320	designing an artificial system
23320	28320	and hoping to use that system to detect cell-cell contacts.
28560	32520	My ultimate goal is to use this system
32520	36360	to dissect the entire neural circuit.
39120	42800	Oh, in the field of neuroscience,
42800	47520	the most important answer that everyone wants to know
47520	50560	is how our brain functions,
50560	55040	so that we have all kinds of different emotions
55040	60040	and how reactions to the environment stimulate.
60040	61440	How to stimulate.
63560	68560	But about 100 years ago,
70200	75200	Raymond Kahar had a very elegant study.
77360	81680	And the elegant study proved that
81680	86680	our brain or neural system
88040	93040	is mainly operated by these neurons or other cells
94160	98840	to transmit all kinds of neural messages
98840	100880	and ultimately have a behavior.
100880	103920	This is a very famous neural doctrine.
106880	110520	So a lot of research now
111320	116320	is focused on how different neurons
118280	121760	communicate with each other.
121760	123840	This is a very complicated problem
123840	128800	because our brain is a huge machine.
128800	130680	Like what I'm showing in this picture,
130680	132040	it's a reward circuit.
133400	135840	This actually includes a lot of brain areas,
135840	138600	like the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex,
138600	142480	and the famous basal ganglia,
142480	145880	nucleus, convent, VTA.
145880	149120	These different brain areas connect with each other
149120	153040	and operate and calculate
153040	156160	to achieve a goal.
156160	159800	And another more complicated aspect
159800	162280	is that even in the same brain area,
162280	164120	there are different neurons
164120	166320	that receive different messages.
166320	168960	And after synchronization,
168960	170200	it's transmitted to another brain area.
170200	172160	And the calculation of the other brain area
172160	173760	may be transmitted back.
174920	178920	So these connections are what we...
178920	181880	What we want to answer right now
181880	185200	is the idea of connectome.
185200	188440	We hope that by understanding these connectome,
188440	191880	we can have a blueprint
191880	195240	of how our brain or neural system
195240	198440	is wired.
198440	201560	And then we can use this basic knowledge
201560	203600	to calculate
203600	208160	the changes in the message transmission
208160	211080	of the neural cells
211080	213120	that may lead to different behaviors.
214280	215120	Like this.
215120	217480	But in fact,
217480	219680	in addition to neural cells,
219680	222160	there are many other different cells,
222160	223800	such as glial cells.
223800	227560	Many studies have found that
227560	228720	these glial cells
228720	233080	actually affect the function of our neural neurons.
235600	236600	For example,
236600	238000	like this astrocyte,
239320	241600	the heart-shaped neural cell,
241600	242440	is...
243600	246920	It has been found that it can actually
246920	250480	clean up some of our neurotransmitters
251600	254480	and make it turn over faster.
254480	257040	And it's also found that...
258080	258960	Sorry.
258960	263040	It's found that it can actually transmit some signal
263040	268040	and affect the whole synaptic property.
269840	273560	So the connectome or microcircuit
273560	276120	that we originally thought of
276120	277440	is like this.
277440	278640	In addition to neural cells,
278640	280320	we still need to consider
280320	282960	the function of these neural glial cells
282960	285480	to have a more complete picture
285480	288240	of how our brain functions.
289360	291480	And then I mentioned earlier
291480	294720	that understanding these microcircuits
294720	298480	can help us know how our brain works.
298480	300480	Another point is that
300480	301320	many...
301320	304320	We already know that there are many neurological disorders.
304320	307600	It actually has something to do with
307600	312600	the wiring of the neural circuit.
313840	315920	Like schizophrenia,
315920	316760	phrenia,
316760	321440	or some psychological diseases.
321440	322760	It actually has something to do with it.
322760	326200	If we know how the normal brain works,
326200	329760	we can further study
329760	332400	the causes of these disorders.
332560	336520	I hope to get some answers
336520	338400	to help these patients.
339720	341640	So far,
342680	346200	there are many different tools
346200	347840	that have been developed
347840	350240	to help us understand
350240	351520	how to dissect,
351520	355360	that is, to analyze the entire brain circuit
355360	357760	or neural connection.
357760	360600	Here are some examples that are commonly used.
360600	364800	For example, Serial Electron Microscopy,
364800	366720	which is an electronic microscope.
369360	375200	There is another one called GRASP.
375200	376640	Its full name is
376640	381600	GFP Green Fluorescent Protein Reconstitution
381600	384160	Across Synaptic Partner.
384160	386680	This means that it has a fluorescent protein
386680	389640	that divides engineering into two parts.
394640	396200	I will explain this later.
396200	397280	There is also Tango.
397280	400760	There is another popular tool
400760	402840	called Rabie Virus
402840	405520	to trace neural connection.
407640	411040	These are all great tools,
411040	414320	but they all have different
415320	416560	shortcomings.
416560	418920	For example, Serial EM
418920	422240	is to take a small sample
422240	425760	and cut it into pieces.
425760	429880	Then use EM to take the whole image
429880	433880	and then reconstruct it.
433880	438240	Then look at its very fine-detailed
440120	441240	neural morphology
441480	445120	or the connection of different neural cells.
445120	450160	Usually, a small one-millimeter-cube
452040	454880	size sample
454880	458920	takes about five or six years
458920	462800	to complete its analysis.
462800	467680	It also requires a lot of human power.
467680	471000	So this is not a very efficient method.
471600	473800	Because it is not very efficient,
473800	479040	it can only analyze a small sample of an animal.
479040	483320	If you want to analyze 10 different animals,
483320	484320	different variations,
484320	486600	it may be a bit difficult
486600	489360	or require more time and more manpower.
489360	492480	Another is CRESP, a genetic tool.
492480	495880	It can be used in
495880	498320	mice or
498320	501120	I'm going to talk about Drosophila fruit flies.
501120	505800	It is mainly divided into two parts of this fluorescent protein.
505800	509040	Normally, it emits green light.
509040	510120	After dividing it into two parts,
510120	512680	they will not emit light.
512680	514960	Only when the two parts are very close,
514960	518800	they will be re-combined
521640	523280	like this.
523280	525480	So the two parts themselves do not emit light.
525480	528280	When they are re-combined, they will emit light,
528280	530120	and you can see the green light.
530120	531800	Then it can detect
533120	537880	that two cells are close to each other.
537880	542440	Its disadvantage is that
544240	545080	it...
548600	549440	Sorry.
551080	554520	It can only see where it is in contact with.
554560	558560	It can't make any further modifications
558560	560600	to affect cell poverty.
560600	561720	In addition,
561720	566720	its binding is irreversible.
566720	571360	So there is a concern that
571360	575280	it may affect the connection between the cells.
575280	576640	The dynamic.
576640	577920	Connection to dynamic.
579440	582800	Another system is called Tango.
582920	587400	It mainly has a G-protein couple receptor.
587400	588760	Its feature is that
588760	591040	when it binds its ligand,
591040	594400	it will recruit a protein called arresting.
594400	598120	Arresting comes to activate
598120	603120	its downstream signaling transduction.
603800	608800	Then the engineer added a protease to this protein.
608800	613600	Then this receptor has a transcription factor.
613600	615400	Then there is a sequence in front of it
615400	618680	that will be cut by this protease.
618680	621600	So when the protein is binded,
621600	623280	the protease will cut this part.
623280	628280	Then it will release the intracellular transcription factor
629360	632000	and drive downstream gene excretion.
634160	636920	Its advantage is that
636920	640840	it has these reported proteins,
642320	643800	either fluorescent proteins
643800	647880	or mutant proteins.
649360	654360	You can control some of the features in its cells.
660800	662680	But the disadvantage is that
662680	665960	it is only limited to G-protein couple receptors.
666840	670480	In our neural system,
670480	671320	there are many...
673160	674800	For example, this is a dopamine receptor.
674800	676840	It is a G-protein couple receptor.
676840	681640	But there are many receptors that are just IN channels.
681640	683920	So it can't be used in this place.
687840	690680	In the mammalian,
690680	695680	there is a very popular tool
695720	700480	called re-engineering the RebVirus.
700480	705480	It can monosynaptically trace upstream neurons.
708480	713480	The point that needs to be considered
713960	717360	is that we need to do surgery
717360	720360	to inject this virus into the brain
720360	723080	to express,
723080	726480	to let this virus
726480	731480	to transmit to its Gag cells.
731640	734560	It has cytotoxicity.
734560	736200	So usually the research
736200	739240	can only be completed within a week.
739240	740840	Otherwise, the cells will die.
742240	744040	But another point is that
744040	749040	I just mentioned that it can only be used in the mammalian.
753200	757000	Even so, its efficiency is not very good.
757000	759440	I have tried this tool before.
759440	762160	Different brain regions.
762160	765760	Some brain regions may have special neurons.
765760	770760	It's harder to let the RebVirus
772200	775040	jump to their upstream partner.
777480	781960	So the important purpose of my research
782000	784880	is to generate a system
784880	789240	that can be used on all transgenic animals.
789240	792480	I hope it won't have any toxicity.
792480	794680	So we can safely study
796000	801000	the property and function of these cells.
803400	808280	In addition to tracing the neuron
808280	811360	or the connection between the cells,
811720	814000	we can also manipulate their property.
816760	821760	So my main design here is that
822240	826560	if a cell, not necessarily a neuron,
826560	830240	has a ligand
830240	835240	and the other cells have a corresponding receptor,
836120	841120	when these two cells have contact,
842040	846440	the binding will generate a cell signaling
846440	849240	to the downstream cell.
850360	855360	Then we can either express some fluorescent reporter protein,
856680	861680	or express some gene or mutant that we are interested in.
862200	864080	Or it can be RNAi.
865080	869080	So here, we used a very important
869080	874080	signaling pathway in animals,
874080	878080	Delta protein and Notch protein's signaling pathway.
878080	880080	So let me briefly introduce
880080	882080	the structure of Notch protein.
882080	885080	It has a very long hRSA domain.
885080	888080	Most of it is EGF repeat.
888080	892080	This domain will bind its ligand, Delta,
893080	898080	and when they bind,
898080	903080	the current hypothesis is that
903080	906080	if the ligand is endocytosed,
906080	911080	that is, if it is brought in by the cell membrane,
911080	913080	it will generate a force.
913080	918080	It will open this structure called NRR.
919080	924080	After Notch binds,
924080	929080	there will be two cutting points
929080	934080	that will be cut off by Proteus.
934080	939080	One is S2 and the other is S3.
939080	943080	So the original S2 cutting point
943080	946080	is in the NRR structure.
947080	951080	So it's embedded inside the structure,
951080	956080	and Proteus can't digest the S2 site.
958080	962080	So it won't be cut off
962080	964080	until Delta binds.
964080	968080	After it binds, it opens this structure,
968080	972080	and the S2 site can be cut off.
972080	975080	Next, its transmembrane domain
975080	977080	also has a cutting point called S3.
979080	981080	S3 will also be cut off.
981080	983080	Then its intracellular domain
983080	985080	is a transcription factor.
985080	988080	It can move to the cell membrane
988080	993080	to activate downstream gene expression.
994080	1000080	So here we use this logic.
1000080	1004080	We replace some domains
1004080	1009080	that will affect the cell's endogenous domain,
1009080	1011080	like EGF repeat,
1011080	1013080	it will bind the endogenous Delta ligand.
1013080	1020080	So we replace it with an antibody here.
1020080	1022080	Then its intracellular domain
1022080	1026080	will drive endogenous downstream gene expression.
1026080	1027080	So we also replace it
1027080	1031080	with a yeast transcription factor called GAL4.
1034080	1037080	So our idea is that
1039080	1042080	our new synthetic receptor
1042080	1046080	can recognize its own ligand.
1046080	1049080	I'm using CD19 here.
1051080	1053080	After it binds,
1053080	1056080	it uses the NRR domain in the middle
1056080	1058080	and transmembrane domain.
1058080	1061080	It will have S2, S3 cleavage.
1061080	1067080	Then it will release intracellular GAL4.
1067080	1072080	Then it can drive either GFP
1072080	1075080	or any gene expression.
1075080	1078080	It depends on what kind of study we want to do.
1080080	1085080	We call this whole section track.
1085080	1090080	It's Transcellular Activation of Transcription.
1092080	1095080	First, I'll test
1095080	1100080	whether our designed ligand and receptor can work.
1100080	1103080	So we use it in the cell line.
1103080	1106080	Here I show you the control.
1106080	1109080	Red represents the ligand.
1109080	1113080	The cell line with or without ligand.
1115080	1120080	My reporter is GFP.
1120080	1127080	So when you see the cell with receptor,
1127080	1129080	it has no GFP
1129080	1133080	because the co-culture cell has no ligand.
1133080	1139080	When I change the co-culture cell
1140080	1145080	to the cell with CD19,
1145080	1153080	you can see that most of the receptors
1153080	1156080	and positive cells
1156080	1161080	start to show GFP.
1162080	1169080	Here you can see the difference in the amount of GFP.
1169080	1174080	You can see that the amount of GFP
1174080	1177080	increases with the co-culture time.
1177080	1182080	The blue line is the control cell.
1182080	1186080	The orange line is the test group.
1187080	1193080	To make sure that they have cell-cell contact,
1193080	1197080	not because my ligand-positive cell
1197080	1200080	releases any weird factor
1200080	1203080	to trigger the downstream gene expression.
1203080	1211080	So I put the receptor cell
1211080	1214080	and the ligand-positive cell
1214080	1218080	in the same play.
1218080	1220080	But I put less CD19.
1220080	1225080	So they generate their own colonies.
1225080	1230080	When they grow up,
1230080	1232080	only when the two colonies
1232080	1234080	have direct contact with each other,
1234080	1237080	the ligand-cell line and the receptor-cell line
1237080	1239080	will have contact.
1239080	1245080	This is the receptor-positive colony.
1245080	1248080	This is the ligand-positive colony.
1248080	1252080	Only when they have direct contact with each other,
1252080	1257080	the cells produce green ligand.
1257080	1260080	The rest are dark.
1261080	1265080	We use the cell-cell line to prove
1265080	1270080	that our system can function normally
1270080	1274080	and detect cell-cell contact.
1274080	1278080	We hope to use it in the in vivo system.
1278080	1282080	We use the fruit-gene model.
1282080	1287080	It is a well-established genetic model.
1288080	1295080	We have a lot of tools to study it.
1295080	1299080	The life cycle is relatively short.
1299080	1303080	The fruit-gene model is about two weeks
1303080	1308080	from the soft to the mature.
1308080	1313080	The most important thing is that
1313080	1318080	the nerve system is similar to the mammalian brain.
1318080	1323080	We hope to use the nerve system
1323080	1328080	to imply the mammalian brain.
1328080	1333080	We hope to use the nerve system
1333080	1338080	to imply the mammalian brain.
1338080	1344080	Let me briefly introduce the central nervous system of Drosophila.
1344080	1350080	They still have neurons and glia.
1350080	1355080	Their neurons are not like our brain.
1355080	1360080	There are a bunch of neurons in the brain.
1360080	1365080	Their synapses are in the same area.
1365080	1370080	Drosophila's cell body is mainly
1370080	1375080	around the edge of the nervous system.
1375080	1380080	around the edge of the nervous system.
1380080	1385080	These regions have no synapses or connections.
1385080	1390080	These regions have no synapses or connections.
1390080	1395080	This is the area where the synapse is located.
1395080	1400080	This is the area where the synapse is located.
1400080	1405080	Besides neurons, there are many other glia cells.
1405080	1410080	I will introduce these in more detail later.
1410080	1415080	I will introduce these in more detail later.
1415080	1420080	One thing to remember is that
1420080	1425080	most of the things I will talk about later are not neurons.
1425080	1430080	most of the things I will talk about later are not neurons.
1430080	1435080	First, we want to test
1435080	1440080	whether our system can detect any different cell-cell contact.
1440080	1445080	First, we want to test
1445080	1450080	whether our system can detect any different cell-cell contact.
1450080	1455080	Next, we want to see
1455080	1465080	whether our system can detect
1465080	1470080	neural-to-neural contact.
1470080	1475080	Next, we want to see
1475080	1480080	whether our system can detect
1480080	1485080	neural-to-neural contact.
1485080	1490080	First, it's glial-to-neural.
1490080	1495080	There are different types of glial cells
1495080	1500080	in ToSoftware.
1500080	1505080	Different glial cells
1505080	1510080	have different levels of contact.
1510080	1515080	For example,
1515080	1520080	surface glial
1520080	1525080	is like a protective film.
1525080	1530080	They don't have much contact
1530080	1535080	with other types of glial cells.
1535080	1540080	For example, cortex glial
1540080	1545080	is protected by
1545080	1550080	neural soma.
1550080	1555080	Astrocyte is infiltrated
1555080	1560080	by synapse.
1560080	1565080	Different types of astrocyte
1565080	1570080	have more contact with neural soma.
1570080	1575080	First,
1575080	1580080	if a person is in a glial cell,
1580080	1587080	can we detect neural-to-neural contact?
1587080	1592080	We display receptor protein
1592080	1597080	in all neurons.
1597080	1602080	Next, we display it
1602080	1607080	in glial cell ligand.
1607080	1612080	The diagram shows
1612080	1617080	the lava brain of Drosophila.
1617080	1622080	There are two parts, the central brain
1622080	1627080	and the ventral nerve core,
1627080	1632080	which is like the spinal cord.
1632080	1637080	If there is no ligand,
1637080	1642080	Drosophila's background is weak.
1642080	1647080	Only in other tissues.
1647080	1652080	When ligand is shown in astrocytes,
1652080	1657080	many neurons are labeled.
1657080	1662080	This is because
1662080	1667080	ligand and receptor are combined
1667080	1672080	to trigger GFP protein.
1672080	1677080	This is another driver.
1677080	1682080	It is called ELAM.
1682080	1687080	This is an astrocyte-specific gene.
1687080	1692080	As you can see,
1692080	1697080	ligand is shown in astrocytes.
1697080	1702080	Ripple is shown in glial cells.
1702080	1707080	The pattern is different.
1707080	1712080	The pattern is different.
1712080	1717080	The pattern is different.
1717080	1722080	I will zoom in later.
1722080	1727080	I will zoom in later.
1727080	1732080	We don't see much GFP expression.
1732080	1737080	We don't see much GFP expression.
1737080	1742080	I will zoom in later.
1742080	1747080	I will zoom in later.
1747080	1752080	I will zoom in later.
1752080	1757080	I will zoom in later.
1757080	1762080	We don't see much ligand expression.
1762080	1767080	We don't see much ligand expression.
1767080	1772080	The neurons project the process
1772080	1777080	to the glial cells.
1777080	1782080	to the glial cells.
1782080	1787080	That's the reason
1787080	1792080	the neurons show strong GFP expression.
1792080	1797080	that's the reason the neurons show strong GFP expression.
1797080	1802080	Now,
1802080	1807080	this proves
1807080	1812080	that this tool can work in Drosophila.
1812080	1817080	Can we use our system
1817080	1822080	to label astrocytes?
1822080	1827080	Mainly because
1827080	1832080	astrocytes has been proven
1832080	1837080	to control synaptic function.
1837080	1842080	to control synaptic function.
1842080	1847080	It can adjust synaptic contact
1847080	1852080	It can adjust synaptic contact
1852080	1857080	to remove unused synaptic
1857080	1862080	It can help synaptic formation
1862080	1867080	It can help synaptic formation
1867080	1872080	It can help synaptic formation
1872080	1877080	astrocyte is able to help
1877080	1882080	neurotransmitter
1882080	1886080	it can control the neurotransmitter release
1886080	1893080	It can control neuronal activity
1893080	1898080	In theory, all these studies depict
1898080	1903080	that astrocytes are homogenous
1903080	1908080	So now they explore
1908080	1915080	if you knock down gene function
1915080	1918080	or mutate gene
1918080	1924080	all the astrocytes will be affected
1924080	1928080	Studies can't say
1928080	1931080	I want to look at this area
1931080	1938080	to change this part of the astrocyte
1938080	1944080	to look at the specific function of this part of the astrocyte
1944080	1949080	So we want to use our system
1949080	1953080	if we can selectively label
1953080	1960080	the neurons in the brain
1960080	1965080	we can selectively label
1965080	1972080	the astrocytes in the brain
1972080	1977080	So our idea is
1977080	1982080	we want to show the ligand in a different way
1982080	1984080	in the neuron
1984080	1987080	this neuron innovates this neuron
1987080	1992080	There are many different astrocytes around here
1992080	1995080	Maybe only a part of it will go to this place
1995080	1998080	to control the function of this neuron
1998080	2001080	We just want to selectively label this astrocyte
2001080	2008080	and not this astrocyte
2008080	2015080	So we want to show the receptor in all the astrocytes
2015080	2021080	and show the ligand in different neurons
2021080	2028080	and selectively label the sub-population of the astrocytes
2028080	2036080	I hope we can study the astrocyte function more precisely after the improvement
2036080	2040080	So the first thing I use is
2040080	2046080	the same brain of the fruit fly
2046080	2052080	The first choice is the mushroom body neuron
2052080	2064080	There are about 600 mushroom body neurons called K-on cells in the brain
2064080	2070080	The reason why people are interested in mushroom body
2070080	2078080	is because it is an important structure of alphanumeric learning and memory
2079080	2083080	So here we show you a control
2083080	2087080	If there is no ligand in the K-on cells
2087080	2092080	then we see very few alphanumeric cells
2092080	2096080	The purple here is the glial cell marker
2096080	2100080	So I just want to tell you
2100080	2105080	After we label these cells, it will actually be a glial cell
2106080	2113080	So when I show the ligand in the mushroom body
2113080	2121080	We can see that we label the astrocytes around it
2121080	2125080	So the red here is the mushroom body
2126080	2134080	We can see that these astrocytes
2134080	2138080	This is a single-plane confocal image
2138080	2142080	So we can see that these astrocytes are really
2142080	2145080	how to say
2145080	2150080	next to the ligand positive neuron process
2150080	2154080	They have intermingled to each other
2154080	2159080	It's surrounded by the ligand positive cell
2159080	2164080	We want to further test our system
2164080	2168080	how robust our system is
2168080	2171080	So we want to use fewer cells
2171080	2175080	So there were about 600 mushroom body neurons
2175080	2180080	Now there are only 21 alphanumeric neurons
2180080	2184080	The alphanumeric neuron is the cell body
2184080	2187080	It's at the tip of the head
2187080	2191080	It will project a very long axon
2191080	2195080	to the Drosophila lava brain
2195080	2198080	This area is called the antenna lobe
2198080	2204080	It's a bit like our mammalian sleeves
2204080	2209080	They will receive the olfactory sensory input
2209080	2213080	The first thing we see here is the control
2213080	2218080	Without ligand, the antenna lobe is very clean
2218080	2226080	When the ligand is shown in the olfactory sensory neuron axon terminal
2227080	2232080	We can label these astrocytes
2232080	2237080	that infiltrate the antenna lobe region
2242080	2246080	We want to narrow it down further
2246080	2249080	to four cells
2249080	2253080	Here we use a PDF neuron
2253080	2257080	It's a very important circadian pacemaker
2257080	2263080	If you remember, this year's Nobel Peace Prize
2263080	2267080	was about the function of the PDF neuron
2267080	2271080	There are only four PDF neurons in the lava brain
2271080	2276080	in each hemisphere
2276080	2280080	They only have a very thin axon
2281080	2286080	and project to the dorsal part of the brain
2286080	2291080	We want to see if our system can detect
2291080	2301080	such a small connection between the astrocyte and the axon
2301080	2303080	Contact
2303080	2306080	Here I show you the control
2307080	2311080	I forgot to mention
2311080	2315080	The PDF neurons I use
2315080	2320080	are not only in the central brain
2320080	2324080	but also in the ventral nerve core
2324080	2329080	These are the PDF positive neurons
2329080	2335080	I also look at the ventral nerve core
2335080	2340080	Here we can see that the control is very clean
2340080	2345080	If a ligand is present in the PDF neuron
2345080	2349080	We can label the astrocytes
2349080	2353080	that make contact with the PDF neuron
2355080	2359080	Here I show you a few different samples
2359080	2364080	We can see that our system is very consistent
2364080	2371080	We can see consistent labeling in different animals
2376080	2380080	The next question we want to ask is
2380080	2386080	Can our system let us understand
2387080	2390080	compared to the previous study
2390080	2397080	what's the new thing that we can know by our system
2397080	2403080	The previous study showed that
2403080	2410080	the astrocyte in the ventral nerve core
2410080	2418080	the distribution is very stereotypical
2418080	2422080	Different astrocytes
2422080	2429080	are located in different locations
2429080	2432080	They are located in different locations
2432080	2436080	They are located in a fixed area
2436080	2439080	For example, the red astrocyte
2439080	2443080	is in the dorsal lateral part of the ventral nerve core
2443080	2449080	It only innovates the dorsal lateral part
2449080	2455080	It only labels the lateral part of the ventral nerve core
2455080	2459080	The yellow one is in the dorsal midline
2459080	2465080	It labels the dorsal midline part of the ventral nerve core
2465080	2468080	The astrocyte in the ventral part
2468080	2475080	labels the ventral midline part of the ventral nerve core
2475080	2480080	This study shows that
2480080	2483080	the astrocyte is boring
2483080	2486080	It doesn't change much
2486080	2492080	The ventral nerve core is a very stereotypical structure
2492080	2497080	It's a different repeat of the neural mirror
2497080	2504080	It's a different repeat of the neural mirror
2504080	2507080	It's a repeated circuit
2507080	2513080	I don't know if the central brain has a more complex system
2513080	2516080	I don't know if the central brain has a more complex system
2516080	2527080	I use LIGAND to represent the Ophiatory Sensor Neuron
2527080	2537080	I use LIGAND to represent the Ophiatory Sensor Neuron
2537080	2543080	We want to know if the astrocyte near the ventral nerve
2543080	2548080	has a different distribution
2548080	2553080	We have the induction
2553080	2557080	We divide the ventral nerve into 8 different areas
2557080	2564080	I want to see where the astrocyte is
2564080	2569080	I found that the cell body of the astrocyte
2569080	2574080	I found that the cell body of the astrocyte
2574080	2577080	is mainly in the medial part
2577080	2582080	is mainly in the medial part
2582080	2590080	the medial sector and the ventral lateral sector
2590080	2597080	This is more in line with the previous research
2597080	2600080	where is the astrocyte near the ventral nerve
2600080	2607080	They also know that it is mainly in these two parts
2607080	2614080	But further research on the distribution of different individuals
2614080	2627080	I found that the astrocyte infiltration is different
2627080	2636080	In the brain, the astrocyte is mainly located in the lateral part
2636080	2641080	In the brain, the astrocyte is mainly located in the lateral part
2641080	2646080	The astrocyte is mainly in the medial part
2646080	2652080	The astrocyte is mainly in the medial part
2652080	2661080	The two areas are only one astrocyte
2661080	2664080	The two areas are only one astrocyte
2664080	2671080	But in this area, I have labeled three different astrocytes
2671080	2679080	In conclusion, in the central brain of Drosophila
2679080	2683080	it is not as stereotypical as the ventral nerve core
2683080	2686080	it has more diversity or change
2686080	2692080	it has more diversity or change
2692080	2697080	We hope that in the future
2697080	2704080	we can use our system to manipulate the astrocyte properties
2704080	2710080	and see if the population of the astrocyte
2710080	2715080	will affect any special function
2715080	2718080	or it actually needs a larger population
2718080	2721080	or it actually needs a larger population
2721080	2730080	to manipulate the neural signaling path
2730080	2736080	In addition, I only study the astrocyte
2736080	2741080	In the future, we hope to expand our tool
2741080	2743080	In addition to the astrocyte glial cell
2743080	2746080	we can study other different glial cells
2746080	2749080	such as cortex glial
2749080	2753080	It is wrapped outside the cell neurons
2753080	2758080	Its function is probably very different from the astrocyte
2758080	2763080	We hope to do further research in the future
2763080	2770080	In the next part, I want to focus on neural-to-neural
2771080	2784080	We use the same design
2784080	2789080	to test whether it can be used in
2789080	2791080	tracing neural-to-neural connection
2791080	2797080	We mainly focus on Drosophila's olfactory system
2797080	2801080	I mentioned the olfactory sensor neuron
2806080	2809080	Why do we want to use this system?
2809080	2814080	Because the connectome here has been studied very thoroughly
2814080	2819080	It can be used in DSN or EM
2819080	2825080	It can be used in DSN or EM
2825080	2827080	So we know that
2827080	2834080	if we express the ligand on a certain type of neuron
2834080	2838080	it may be connected to some different neurons
2838080	2841080	So we can know if our system
2841080	2844080	has only labeled some new things
2844080	2848080	or if it has missed some different things
2848080	2853080	to test whether our system is perfect
2854080	2858080	So in the antenna lobe
2860080	2864080	the olfactory sensor neuron we just mentioned
2864080	2867080	will project its axon to the antenna lobe
2867080	2871080	Different olfactory sensor neurons
2871080	2875080	will only show one olfactory receptor
2876080	2884080	These olfactory sensor neurons
2884080	2887080	will only innovate to a certain
2887080	2895080	antenna lobe called gomulus
2895080	2903080	It will be connected to a certain type of projection neuron
2904080	2909080	The projection neuron is green
2909080	2914080	It will pass the olfactory sensor input
2914080	2917080	to the olfactory system
2917080	2919080	like the mushroom body
2919080	2921080	In addition to the projection neuron
2921080	2924080	the antenna lobe has another type of neuron
2924080	2926080	called local interneuron
2926080	2930080	It is a GABAergic inhibitor neuron
2930080	2935080	It will innovate the entire antenna lobe
2935080	2945080	to be a bridge between different gomulus
2948080	2954080	In the LABA central nervous system
2954080	2956080	if there is no ligand
2956080	2961080	we can see that the background is very weak
2961080	2966080	There is no other labeling
2966080	2974080	But if I put the ligand in the olfactory sensor neuron
2974080	2976080	we can see that
2976080	2985080	we can label a few downstream neurons
2986080	2990080	There are some markers
2990080	2995080	These neurons are GABAergic neurons
2995080	3001080	It means that they are local interneurons
3001080	3005080	But in this case
3005080	3009080	we don't see the main projection neurons
3009080	3011080	being labeled
3011080	3013080	So
3013080	3015080	So
3015080	3017080	So
3017080	3019080	So
3019080	3021080	So
3021080	3023080	So
3023080	3027080	In the current design
3027080	3032080	The track system
3032080	3034080	is not yet
3034080	3036080	How to say
3036080	3038080	optimized
3038080	3040080	to detect
3040080	3042080	neural neural contact
3042080	3044080	So
3044080	3048080	We missed a lot
3048080	3052080	We want to say that there will be labels
3052080	3054080	Maybe
3054080	3056080	labeled neurons
3056080	3058080	So in the future
3058080	3062080	we may need to make further improvements
3062080	3064080	to improve our system
3064080	3068080	to make use of the new neural circuits
3068080	3073080	There are some new promising results
3073080	3077080	Hope to share with you soon
3083080	3085080	I think that's it
3085080	3087080	Thank you
3094080	3100080	Hello
3100080	3109080	How this is
3109080	3116080	Hello
3116080	3121080	Hi
3121080	3126080	Hello
3126080	3128080	Can you hear me?
3128080	3130080	Yes
3130080	3134080	I see a question
3134080	3139080	Can we use it on humans?
3139080	3143080	At the moment, we can't
3143080	3147080	Because we can't
3148080	3152080	Because my system is mainly used on
3152080	3154080	transgenic animals
3154080	3157080	So I don't know if CRISPR
3157080	3159080	will develop to what level
3159080	3163080	Will it be able to generate transgenic humans?
3163080	3165080	If it doesn't work
3165080	3167080	then we probably
3167080	3169080	can't use it
3169080	3171080	And
3172080	3176080	But the advantage of this tool is
3176080	3181080	we can use it on different animals
3181080	3184080	If CRISPR is so successful
3184080	3187080	then it can be very convenient
3187080	3191080	to use it on transgenic
3191080	3194080	like a fish
3194080	3197080	or other non-genetic
3197080	3201080	or other non-genetic
3201080	3205080	For example
3205080	3209080	I saw a dolphin
3209080	3213080	It has a very special behavior
3213080	3217080	It draws a beautiful picture to attract the opposite sex
3217080	3221080	I think its neural circuit is really amazing
3221080	3223080	I want to study it
3224080	3226080	If we use my tool
3226080	3228080	and add CRISPR
3228080	3234080	I think it can be used on different animals
3234080	3237080	That is to say
3237080	3239080	But
3239080	3243080	We still need to improve
3243080	3247080	to make my system more promising
3247080	3249080	more robust
3250080	3252080	And
3252080	3256080	I don't know if there are any other questions
3266080	3268080	Hello
3271080	3273080	I have a question
3273080	3276080	It's a simple question
3276080	3280080	Do you experiment with mice?
3280080	3282080	Is it a mouse?
3282080	3284080	Or a bird?
3284080	3286080	You just said a mouse
3286080	3288080	Do you experiment with a bird?
3288080	3290080	Yes
3290080	3292080	Is it alive?
3295080	3298080	The experiments on behavior are all alive
3298080	3301080	But in the end we need to sacrifice them
3301080	3306080	and study the changes in their brains
3306080	3308080	or something
3308080	3314080	Is it still alive?
3314080	3319080	Is it conscious?
3319080	3322080	Or is it dead?
3322080	3325080	Just take out its brain
3325080	3327080	and see what happens
3327080	3329080	Both
3329080	3333080	Now we have a postdoc
3333080	3335080	He is using
3335080	3339080	He is making a miniature microscope
3341080	3343080	Let me see if I can
3348080	3350080	Sorry, can you hear me?
3350080	3352080	Yes
3354080	3356080	Our house was on fire
3356080	3358080	and I was kicked out
3359080	3361080	What happened?
3361080	3363080	Anyway, I was kicked out
3363080	3365080	and now I'm back
3365080	3367080	There is no internet out there
3367080	3369080	It's ok
3369080	3371080	You just said
3371080	3373080	Yuqing
3373080	3375080	Yuqing, right?
3375080	3377080	Yes
3377080	3379080	He asked
3379080	3381080	Do you experiment with a mouse?
3381080	3383080	Is it alive?
3385080	3387080	The experiments on behavior are all alive
3387080	3389080	We have a postdoc
3389080	3391080	who made a small microscope
3391080	3393080	and put it on their heads
3393080	3395080	and put it on their heads
3395080	3397080	and put it on their heads
3397080	3399080	We hope that
3399080	3401080	we can see
3401080	3403080	and add some
3403080	3405080	photoreceptors
3405080	3407080	and they can see
3407080	3409080	the neural activity
3409080	3411080	We want to use these two things
3411080	3413080	to see the brain of a living animal
3413080	3415080	to see the brain of a living animal
3415080	3417080	how a living animal
3417080	3419080	how a living animal
3419080	3421080	how a living animal
3421080	3423080	lives
3427080	3429080	Most of the cases are
3429080	3431080	after we do the research
3431080	3433080	even after the behavior
3433080	3435080	we will sacrifice the mouse
3435080	3437080	we will sacrifice the mouse
3437080	3439080	and then see
3439080	3441080	whether our modifications
3441080	3443080	have changed
3443080	3445080	whether our modifications
3445080	3447080	have changed
3449080	3451080	How do I get my video out?
3467080	3469080	I feel like you said
3469080	3471080	you made the microscope very small
3471080	3473080	and then put it on your head
3473080	3475080	and look at it
3475080	3477080	I feel like it's amazing
3477080	3479080	There is a company
3479080	3481080	that specializes in
3481080	3483080	selling this device
3483080	3485080	selling this device
3485080	3487080	selling a super small microscope
3487080	3489080	selling a super small microscope
3489080	3491080	but it still has some
3491080	3493080	but it still has some
3493080	3495080	disadvantages
3495080	3497080	like it can't adjust
3497080	3499080	focus
3499080	3501080	it can only observe
3501080	3503080	the surface
3503080	3505080	the surface
3505080	3507080	of the brain
3513080	3515080	Isn't that supposed to be
3515080	3517080	on the head?
3517080	3519080	Isn't that supposed to be
3519080	3521080	on the head?
3521080	3523080	Isn't that supposed to be
3523080	3525080	on the head?
3529080	3531080	Do you have that
3531080	3533080	Do you have that
3533080	3535080	I can't remember his name
3535080	3537080	I can't remember his name
3537080	3539080	I can't remember his name
3539080	3541080	Let me think
3541080	3543080	KALTECH
3543080	3545080	Ni Yuli
3545080	3547080	Ni Yuli
3547080	3549080	Did you talk to him?
3549080	3551080	because they now
3551080	3553080	do non-invasive
3553080	3555080	do non-invasive
3555080	3557080	and they want to
3557080	3559080	the firing pattern
3559080	3561080	the firing pattern
3561080	3563080	but they want to
3563080	3565080	do it on people
3565080	3567080	because you can't
3567080	3569080	do it on people
3569080	3571080	and I was thinking
3571080	3573080	I don't know if you talked about this
3573080	3575080	I posted a question
3575080	3577080	because
3577080	3579080	if you do it like this
3579080	3581080	either
3581080	3583080	Guoying's head
3583080	3585080	has to be very transparent
3585080	3587080	or you have to
3587080	3589080	put something on the rat's bone
3589080	3591080	but I don't think it's possible on people
3591080	3593080	yeah
3593080	3595080	because
3595080	3597080	my system
3597080	3599080	has two things
3599080	3601080	you have to etopic express
3601080	3603080	two ligand and receptor
3603080	3605080	and reporter, three
3605080	3607080	yeah
3607080	3609080	if you can't
3609080	3611080	do something like
3611080	3613080	transgenic animal or
3613080	3615080	other virus
3615080	3617080	there's nothing you can do
3617080	3619080	and human brain
3619080	3621080	has limitations
3621080	3623080	but
3623080	3625080	I mentioned
3625080	3627080	I don't know if you're here
3627080	3629080	and
3629080	3631080	CRISPR
3631080	3633080	is very popular
3633080	3635080	it can
3635080	3637080	make it easier
3637080	3639080	for us
3639080	3641080	to change
3641080	3643080	different animal
3643080	3645080	genetic profile
3645080	3647080	you can do transgenic animal
3647080	3649080	so
3649080	3651080	using
3651080	3653080	CRISPR
3653080	3655080	we should have more opportunities
3655080	3657080	to test on different
3657080	3659080	animals
3659080	3661080	like rabies virus
3661080	3663080	this
3663080	3665080	tool is very good
3665080	3667080	there's a lot of paper
3667080	3669080	published
3669080	3671080	but the problem is
3671080	3673080	we can't use
3673080	3675080	on birds
3675080	3677080	because
3677080	3679080	birds can't get rabies
3679080	3681080	that's rabies virus
3681080	3683080	so
3683080	3685080	this tool
3685080	3687080	because it's transgenic
3687080	3689080	if CRISPR looks promising
3689080	3691080	we can use it
3691080	3693080	on different animals
3693080	3695080	like I mentioned
3695080	3697080	I saw
3697080	3699080	dolphin
3699080	3701080	not dolphin
3701080	3703080	dolphin
3703080	3705080	puffer fish
3705080	3707080	puffer fish
3707080	3709080	dolphin
3709080	3711080	it has
3711080	3713080	a very strange
3713080	3715080	behavior
3715080	3717080	it will draw
3717080	3719080	on the sand
3719080	3721080	very
3721080	3723080	symmetric pattern
3723080	3725080	to attract
3725080	3727080	it will feel
3727080	3729080	amazing
3729080	3731080	if I have a chance
3731080	3733080	I want to study
3733080	3735080	animal brain
3735080	3737080	really?
3737080	3739080	why?
3739080	3741080	I don't know
3741080	3743080	but the pattern
3743080	3745080	it draws
3745080	3747080	is like
3747080	3749080	wheat field
3749080	3751080	very big
3751080	3753080	like this
3753080	3755080	for its size
3755080	3757080	it's big
3757080	3759080	so I think
3759080	3761080	it's interesting
3761080	3763080	ok
3763080	3765080	but for humans
3765080	3767080	because it's transgenic
3767080	3769080	the tool we can use
3769080	3771080	is functional MRI
3771080	3773080	but
3773080	3775080	it can't be that good
3775080	3777080	so I'm
3777080	3779080	thinking
3779080	3781080	how to
3781080	3783080	understand
3783080	3785080	our
3785080	3787080	animal brain
3787080	3789080	I was thinking
3789080	3791080	if you change
3791080	3793080	LIGAND to
3793080	3795080	some
3795080	3797080	magnetic field
3797080	3799080	or electrical field
3799080	3801080	you can use
3801080	3803080	MRI
3803080	3805080	to locate it
3805080	3807080	but the resolution
3807080	3809080	is not high enough
3809080	3811080	it looks like a piece
3811080	3813080	here and there
3813080	3815080	so it's useless
3815080	3817080	yes
3817080	3819080	I remember
3819080	3821080	I saw
3821080	3823080	a speech
3823080	3825080	he was using
3825080	3827080	X-ray
3827080	3829080	to look at
3829080	3831080	the structure
3831080	3833080	of the brain
3833080	3835080	he
3835080	3837080	he chose
3837080	3839080	very small
3839080	3841080	X-ray is very traditional
3841080	3843080	so I think
3843080	3845080	they want to say
3845080	3847080	if they use X-ray
3847080	3849080	to dissect the brain
3849080	3851080	the resolution will be good
3851080	3853080	maybe in the future
3853080	3855080	it can be used
3855080	3857080	in human
3857080	3859080	or large animals
3859080	3861080	ok
3861080	3863080	like this
3863080	3865080	but
3865080	3867080	I don't know
3867080	3869080	how much
3869080	3871080	it can be
3871080	3873080	maybe in the future
3873080	3875080	maybe
3875080	3877080	I think
3877080	3879080	there's a big gap
3879080	3881080	I think
3881080	3883080	animal model
3883080	3885080	can help a lot
3885080	3887080	but animal model
3887080	3889080	and human
3889080	3891080	there's a gap
3891080	3893080	both sides
3893080	3895080	both sides
3895080	3897080	don't know how to cross
3897080	3899080	there's no bridge
3899080	3901080	yes
3901080	3903080	maybe
3903080	3905080	the closest
3905080	3907080	is
3907080	3909080	primate
3909080	3911080	primate
3911080	3913080	yes
3913080	3915080	I think
3915080	3917080	especially in my department
3917080	3919080	it's very obvious
3919080	3921080	if it's primate
3921080	3923080	it's
3923080	3925080	obvious
3925080	3927080	like
3927080	3929080	aggression
3929080	3931080	mating behavior
3931080	3933080	or even
3933080	3935080	hierarchy
3935080	3937080	but if it's higher
3937080	3939080	like stroke
3939080	3941080	primate
3941080	3943080	it's very close
3943080	3945080	but if it's
3945080	3947080	social, complicated social behavior
3947080	3949080	like
3949080	3951080	psychology
3951080	3953080	people do jealousy
3953080	3955080	this thing
3955080	3957080	I've heard people say
3957080	3959080	that
3959080	3961080	they do love
3961080	3963080	on mice
3963080	3965080	and they say
3965080	3967080	it's not just mating, it's love
3967080	3969080	and I think
3969080	3971080	how do you know what love is
3971080	3973080	it hurts
3973080	3975080	yes
3975080	3977080	yes
3977080	3979080	so
3979080	3981080	I was thinking
3981080	3983080	this system
3983080	3985080	the limit
3985080	3987080	but
3987080	3989080	on human
3989080	3991080	there's still
3991080	3993080	human
3993080	3995080	brain function
3995080	3997080	limitation
3997080	3999080	yes
3999080	4001080	yes
4001080	4003080	yes
4003080	4005080	but
4005080	4007080	human
4007080	4009080	can't do research
4009080	4011080	yes
4011080	4013080	but I think it's cool
4013080	4015080	I think your
4015080	4017080	resolution is really high
4017080	4019080	it's quite
4019080	4021080	quite big
4021080	4023080	I don't know where the people in the front sit
4023080	4025080	but I feel it's quite amazing
4025080	4027080	and
4027080	4029080	it increases a lot
4029080	4031080	you can see very detailed things
4031080	4033080	actually
4033080	4035080	because it's mainly
4035080	4037080	social contact
4037080	4039080	so it depends on
4039080	4041080	we can test
4041080	4043080	its sensitivity
4043080	4045080	what minimal
4045080	4047080	area you need
4047080	4049080	to detect
4049080	4051080	to see the difference
4051080	4053080	so
4053080	4055080	yes
4055080	4057080	it depends on
4057080	4059080	how much
4059080	4061080	you can touch
4061080	4063080	and your
4063080	4065080	concentration
4065080	4067080	is it high enough
4067080	4069080	to see
4069080	4071080	downstream
4071080	4073080	but you can
4073080	4075080	adjust it
4075080	4077080	my main work
4077080	4079080	is to adjust
4079080	4081080	this tool
4081080	4083080	so it can be used
4083080	4085080	on
4085080	4087080	neural circuits
4087080	4089080	and
4089080	4091080	yes
4091080	4093080	don't
4093080	4095080	I'm the only one talking
4095080	4097080	do you have questions?
4097080	4099080	do you have questions?
4099080	4101080	YuQing
4101080	4103080	asked a question
4103080	4105080	I don't know
4105080	4107080	is Jenny still here?
4107080	4109080	I don't know
4109080	4111080	I'm here
4111080	4113080	YuQing is here
4113080	4115080	Jenny
4115080	4117080	there's another one
4117080	4119080	I think
4119080	4121080	in the future
4121080	4123080	maybe
4123080	4125080	after more information
4125080	4127080	maybe
4127080	4129080	this is the basic
4129080	4131080	maybe in the future
4131080	4133080	we still need
4133080	4135080	telekinesis
4135080	4137080	or computer simulation
4137080	4139080	to understand
4139080	4141080	brain function
4141080	4143080	now
4143080	4145080	I can only provide a tool
4145080	4147080	or a blueprint
4147080	4149080	an established
4149080	4151080	blueprint
4153080	4155080	in the future
4155080	4157080	as I mentioned
4157080	4159080	we can adjust
4159080	4161080	the level
4161080	4163080	of cell poverty
4167080	4169080	to be more selective
4169080	4171080	to do research
4175080	4177080	do you have questions?
4177080	4179080	please
4179080	4181080	there's a medicine
4181080	4183080	called LSD
4183080	4185080	is it
4185080	4187080	I think
4187080	4189080	I don't know
4189080	4191080	if it's related
4191080	4193080	after taking the medicine
4193080	4195080	does the brain
4195080	4197080	how
4197080	4199080	is it related
4199080	4201080	to the research
4201080	4203080	after taking it
4203080	4205080	LSD is
4205080	4207080	like
4207080	4209080	hallucination
4211080	4213080	it's like
4213080	4215080	I don't know
4215080	4217080	I don't know
4217080	4219080	it's mainly
4219080	4221080	related to
4221080	4223080	I'm not sure
4227080	4229080	what's it called
4229080	4231080	it's like
4231080	4233080	in the same place
4235080	4237080	I forgot the word
4237080	4239080	what's it called
4239080	4241080	it's in the
4241080	4243080	circuit
4243080	4245080	so
4245080	4247080	it's like
4249080	4251080	reward circuit
4255080	4257080	mainly in that part
4261080	4263080	like
4263080	4265080	that area
4265080	4267080	the brain area
4267080	4269080	it's related to
4269080	4271080	reward
4271080	4273080	and addiction
4273080	4275080	it's related
4277080	4279080	talking about
4279080	4281080	reward system
4281080	4283080	I'm not a
4283080	4285080	biopsychologist
4285080	4287080	but
4287080	4289080	reward system is very popular
4289080	4291080	you might have mentioned
4291080	4293080	but I missed it
4293080	4295080	besides addiction
4295080	4297080	it's also
4297080	4299080	like
4299080	4301080	many psychological diseases
4301080	4303080	like
4303080	4305080	autism
4305080	4307080	or
4307080	4309080	they have
4309080	4311080	abnormal
4311080	4313080	repetitive behaviors
4313080	4315080	they keep doing it
4315080	4317080	and they'll
4317080	4319080	what
4319080	4321080	like OCD
4321080	4323080	they said
4323080	4325080	it's because of their reward system
4325080	4327080	so when they do
4327080	4329080	these behaviors
4329080	4331080	their reward system will keep firing
4331080	4333080	and it's abnormal
4333080	4335080	you don't need
4335080	4337080	to do it
4339080	4341080	they're doing
4341080	4343080	imaging research
4343080	4345080	right
4345080	4347080	so like
4347080	4349080	I mentioned
4349080	4351080	we're
4351080	4353080	researching
4353080	4355080	connectome
4355080	4357080	the other purpose is
4357080	4359080	we have a normal
4359080	4361080	reference
4361080	4363080	then we can
4363080	4365080	look into
4365080	4367080	schizophrenia
4367080	4369080	it's related to
4369080	4371080	brain problems
4371080	4373080	related
4373080	4375080	diseases
4375080	4377080	what's the difference
4379080	4381080	like schizophrenia
4381080	4383080	there's a theory
4383080	4385080	excitatory and inhibitory
4385080	4387080	balance
4387080	4389080	there's a difference
4393080	4395080	is there less connection
4395080	4397080	or
4397080	4399080	synaptic strength
4399080	4401080	less
4403080	4405080	I think our department has many
4405080	4407080	researchers who like your research
4407080	4409080	because our department
4409080	4411080	our department's
4411080	4413080	biopsychology and
4413080	4415080	clinical psychology are quite similar
4415080	4417080	clinical psychology is
4417080	4419080	doing schizophrenia
4423080	4425080	they push people in
4425080	4427080	all kinds of patients
4429080	4431080	but
4433080	4435080	I remember
4435080	4437080	there's a talk
4437080	4439080	about functional MRI
4439080	4441080	right
4441080	4443080	it's about ADHD
4443080	4445080	I remember
4445080	4447080	it's about imaging
4447080	4449080	they're doing
4449080	4451080	they're doing
4451080	4453080	function structure
4453080	4455080	MRI used to do
4455080	4457080	too big or too small
4457080	4459080	which side is thick
4459080	4461080	which side is thin
4463080	4465080	they're doing
4465080	4467080	firing pattern
4467080	4469080	it's called functional
4469080	4471080	right
4471080	4473080	I remember
4475080	4477080	it's 7.25
4477080	4479080	any questions
4481080	4483080	if not
4483080	4485080	3, 2, 1
4485080	4487080	thank you
4487080	4489080	thank you
4489080	4491080	thank you
4491080	4493080	sorry
4493080	4495080	we'll continue
4495080	4497080	any ideas
4497080	4499080	ok
4499080	4501080	ok
4501080	4503080	thank you
4503080	4505080	I don't know which one
4505080	4507080	the blue one
4507080	4509080	fire station
