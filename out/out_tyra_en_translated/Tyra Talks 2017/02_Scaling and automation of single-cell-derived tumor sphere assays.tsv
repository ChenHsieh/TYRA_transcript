0	9000	My PhD research is mainly in microfluidics for single-cell analysis.
9000	14000	In the content of biology, I mainly focus on cancer research.
14000	22000	Because we generally believe that in cancer, the heterogeneity between cells is stronger.
22000	31000	For example, when we treat cancer, there will always be some antibody cells that can be used for therapy.
31000	37000	So if we can use single-cell analysis to see the different characteristics of each cell,
37000	42000	and find those antibodies to lock them in for treatment,
42000	47000	we believe that it can improve the efficacy of the treatment.
48000	53000	My research is divided into two parts.
53000	59000	The first part is the phenotypic assay, which I will share with you today.
59000	62000	The second part is also what I'm doing now.
62000	67000	Because I haven't published the paper yet, so I haven't put it up here yet.
67000	71000	But the whole direction is like what Jake just introduced.
71000	75000	As a sample preparation chip,
75000	83000	we can extract circulating tumor cells from the patient's blood.
83000	89000	We get gene expression information from the cancer cells in the blood.
89000	93000	This gene expression information can let us know
93000	99000	what kind of drugs we can use to treat these patients to get better results.
99000	102000	For now, to get this gene expression information,
102000	107000	we usually use the whole flow of chips.
107000	111000	In other words, we need to use a knife.
111000	115000	It's more invasive, and the cost will be higher.
115000	121000	Today, I will share with you the phenotypic assay.
121000	126000	In the technology development, I mainly focus on scaling and automation
126000	130000	in the high-throughput single-cell device sphere assays.
130000	136000	First, I will tell you why we want to do this tumor sphere assay.
136000	140000	In fact, the purpose is to study these tumor-initiating cells.
140000	143000	In this process, I will share with you
143000	149000	why we need to scale up this assay and automate this assay.
149000	154000	Next, I will tell you how I enable this thing.
154000	160000	Then, I will use some experiments to show you the functions of my chip.
160000	164000	Finally, I will conclude my presentation today.
165000	166000	OK.
166000	171000	So, our motivation is to study these so-called cancer stem-like cells.
171000	174000	Our recent research shows that
174000	179000	there is a relatively small number of tumor-initiating cells.
179000	181000	They are called cancer stem cells.
181000	186000	Some people think the term cancer stem cells is too strong.
186000	189000	They prefer to call them cancer stem-like cells.
189000	192000	In fact, it is a biological mutation.
192000	195000	They are a group of antibodies
195000	199000	with some stem cell-specific cancer cells.
199000	202000	This tissue group has some characteristics.
202000	206000	The first one is that it has a relatively strong chemoresistance.
206000	208000	It will cause tumor relapse.
208000	212000	In this picture, you can see that this is a primitive tumor.
212000	215000	The yellow one is CSC, cancer stem cell.
215000	218000	The blue ones are normal cancer cells.
218000	222000	If we use traditional cancer treatment,
222000	225000	these ordinary cells can be removed.
225000	231000	So, we can see that the tumor size is reduced in clinical trials.
231000	234000	But what we can't see is this cancer stem cell.
234000	237000	It has a way to stay quiescent
237000	240000	and not be affected by the drug.
240000	242000	After we stop giving drugs,
242000	245000	the tumor relapse occurs.
245000	248000	So, in the research scope of CSC,
248000	252000	we hope to find cancer stem cell-specific therapy.
252000	257000	So, I eliminated it for this CSC.
257000	260000	The rest of these normal CSC,
260000	263000	sorry, these normal cancer cells,
263000	266000	they don't have the ability to self-renew.
266000	268000	So, they proliferate.
268000	273000	In the end, the tumor relapse occurs.
273000	276000	So, this is the first reason why we want to study CSC.
276000	280000	The second reason is that we generally believe that
280000	282000	CSC has a strong migration ability.
282000	287000	In other words, it is easier to metastasize to the secondary tumor.
287000	293000	We know that cancer transfer is the biggest challenge in cancer therapy
293000	295000	and the biggest cause of death.
295000	297000	So, if we can study CSC more,
297000	302000	it will be very helpful in therapy, tracking, and research.
302000	312000	The most traditional way to study CSC is to use surface membrane protein
312000	316000	or intracellular enzymatic markers.
316000	320000	For gene expression or protein expression,
320000	326000	we use different methods, such as full cytometry,
326000	329000	to separate these different types of cells.
329000	332000	Then, we can study these CSC groups.
332000	335000	But the challenge is that
335000	338000	many of our new markers have not been discovered.
338000	344000	So, we hope to use other methods to study these CSC populations.
344000	352000	As a substitute, cell behavior is a common choice.
352000	360000	We observe that CSC can survive in a suspension culture environment
360000	364000	and grow into a single-cell-derived tumor sphere.
364000	367000	In other words, if it is a normal cancer cell,
367000	373000	it cannot be adhered to the substrate environment.
373000	377000	It will produce apoptosis.
377000	381000	But CSC is different.
381000	384000	It can not only survive in a suspension environment,
384000	387000	but also grow into a new tumor sphere.
387000	392000	So, what is the traditional way to do the sphere assay?
392000	395000	The method is to buy a whale plate,
395000	398000	as shown in the picture on the bottom right.
398000	405000	Then, dilute the whale plate to a certain level of cell concentration.
405000	408000	The whale plate contains one cell.
408000	411000	As you can see,
411000	416000	the low-throughput is a distribution of the probability,
416000	418000	or more specifically,
418000	424000	96-whale plate contains 20-30 single-cells.
425000	428000	It is labor-intensive.
428000	430000	Someone may ask,
430000	433000	can I use automatic cell dispensing,
433000	436000	such as flow cytometry,
436000	440000	to ensure that I can put a cell into a whale?
440000	444000	In fact, flow cytometry has a big problem.
444000	447000	Because it is a flow-sorting process,
447000	450000	it will produce a lot of shear stress.
450000	455000	So, what is the impact of cell behavior assay on downstream?
455000	458000	We need to observe if the cell is dead.
458000	461000	If the cell is dead,
461000	464000	it is not caused by the suspension environment.
464000	467000	It is caused by the flow-sorting process.
467000	469000	The shear stress is too high,
469000	471000	and the cell can not bear it.
471000	473000	So, the cell is dead,
473000	476000	not because it is not CSC.
476000	481000	These are the existing technology limitations.
481000	485000	Why do we think automation is important?
485000	487000	As we mentioned,
487000	491000	CSC is a relatively small sub-population.
491000	493000	In the past,
493000	499000	only 1-5% of tumor cells have this sphere formation tendency.
499000	505000	We hope this assay can start with a larger single-cell population.
505000	507000	At least 1,000 single-cells.
507000	513000	Then we can have a reliable statistical power
513000	515000	to make our assay conclusion.
515000	518000	So, we think
518000	521000	to achieve this throughput,
521000	524000	microfluidics is an ideal technology
524000	527000	to make this assay.
527000	531000	So, this is our chip schematics.
531000	533000	We want to develop a chip
533000	536000	with more than 1,000 single-cells.
536000	539000	Because we have a very large throughput,
539000	542000	we also need an automatic image analysis.
542000	545000	Otherwise, we have to read it manually.
545000	548000	It is a very difficult process.
548000	549000	Only in this way,
549000	552000	can we make the whole experiment
552000	556000	smoothly improve on hardware and software.
556000	560000	So, this is our motivation.
560000	562000	I don't know if there is anything I didn't explain clearly.
562000	564000	Or you can go on.
566000	568000	Ok, let's continue.
571000	572000	I want to ask,
572000	578000	why CSC can survive in suspension culture environment?
578000	580000	This is a question.
580000	581000	Did you hear it?
581000	582000	Yes.
582000	584000	The question is,
584000	588000	why CSC can survive in suspension culture environment?
588000	590000	This is a very interesting question.
590000	594000	I will answer it in two ways.
594000	595000	First,
595000	598000	the definition of CSC is
598000	601000	we only inject 10 cells into the mouse.
605000	607000	Can these 10 cells
607000	610000	generate a new tumor on the mouse?
610000	611000	If yes,
611000	612000	we define it as CSC.
612000	615000	The predecessors defined CSC in this way.
615000	618000	Then, they used this traditional conventional assay
618000	619000	to find out
619000	624000	the cell population of tumors
624000	629000	can survive in suspension culture environment.
629000	632000	This is the first way to find it out.
632000	633000	Why?
633000	635000	Our idea is
635000	639000	CSC can survive in suspension culture environment
639000	644000	by moving through the local environment
644000	646000	to the blood vessel.
646000	649000	The blood vessel is a suspension environment.
649000	651000	If these cells
651000	654000	die in the suspension environment,
654000	657000	they can't move to other places.
657000	659000	So, we believe
659000	667000	CSC can survive in the blood vessel
667000	670000	and grow into a tumor in a new local environment.
670000	675000	We simulate this in vivo environment.
676000	678000	This is the first way to find out CSC.
678000	680000	This is the first way to find out CSC.
680000	683000	The first way is to verify CSC
683000	688000	and to find out the correlation between CSC and in-vitro experiment.
688000	691000	The second way is to explain the correlation.
691000	694000	We think CSC can mimic in-vivo environment
694000	696000	and survive in suspension culture environment
696000	702000	and grow into a new tumor sphere.
702000	704000	Does this answer your question?
705000	706000	Okay.
706000	708000	I have a related question.
708000	711000	When CSC is transferred in the blood vessel,
711000	713000	is it in the form of a single cell
713000	716000	or a sphere?
716000	719000	This is a very good question.
719000	723000	Most of the cells
723000	725000	are transferred in the form of a single cell.
725000	727000	But in recent years,
727000	729000	the research of circulating tumor cells
729000	730000	found that
730000	733000	there are more ways to transfer tumor cells
733000	738000	in the form of clusters.
738000	741000	A cluster is not a single cell
741000	743000	that grows into a sphere
743000	745000	and is transferred to another place.
745000	747000	Most people believe that
747000	749000	a small number of tumor cells
749000	752000	fall from the original tumor
752000	755000	and can be circulated.
756000	758000	You can imagine that
758000	760000	in a vast ocean,
760000	762000	is it a warship
762000	764000	or an aircraft carrier?
764000	766000	They think that
766000	768000	a cluster is like an aircraft carrier.
768000	770000	It is very powerful
770000	774000	and has a stronger metathesis ability.
774000	776000	But people think that
776000	778000	a cluster fell from the original tumor
778000	780000	and not a single cell
780000	782000	that grows into a sphere
783000	785000	and is transferred.
785000	787000	Do you have an answer?
787000	789000	Yes.
789000	791000	OK.
791000	795000	Are there any other questions?
795000	797000	I don't think so.
797000	799000	You can continue.
799000	801000	I have a question about operation.
801000	803000	If a worker
803000	805000	is holding a pipe and dripping,
805000	809000	can he catch a single cell?
809000	811000	The best theoretical limit
811000	813000	is 20-30%.
813000	815000	You can think of it as
815000	817000	a cell suspension solution.
817000	819000	Let's say that
819000	821000	I know that
821000	823000	there are 10k cells
823000	825000	in this tube.
825000	827000	On average,
827000	829000	there will be
829000	831000	a single cell
831000	833000	in 100mL or 10mL.
833000	835000	How many cells
835000	837000	are there?
837000	839000	There will be a single cell
839000	841000	in 100mL or 10mL.
841000	843000	There will be a single cell
843000	845000	in 100mL or 10mL.
845000	847000	The best theoretical limit
847000	849000	is 20-30%.
849000	851000	In fact,
851000	853000	the control of cell density
853000	855000	is not ideal
855000	857000	when operating.
857000	859000	So it will be worse than 20-30%.
859000	861000	It is the operating limit.
861000	863000	It will be worse.
863000	865000	But it is almost the same, right?
865000	867000	For example,
867000	869000	is it 10% less
869000	871000	or less than 5%?
873000	875000	If you have good skills,
875000	877000	it can be less than 5%.
877000	879000	If you don't have good skills,
879000	881000	it can be 5% or less.
881000	883000	It is difficult to experiment.
883000	885000	So it's about 15%?
885000	887000	Yes.
889000	891000	So if you have
891000	893000	a 96-well plate,
893000	895000	if you have a 96-well plate,
895000	897000	and you have Taipei
897000	899000	almost 100 times,
899000	901000	and there are only 15 cells,
901000	903000	and you only have 1-5% single cell
903000	905000	that can grow into a sphere,
905000	907000	it's really hard to do.
907000	909000	Yes.
909000	911000	Any other questions?
911000	913000	No.
913000	915000	You can continue.
915000	917000	OK.
917000	919000	I will continue to present.
919000	921000	So the first thing I want to discuss
921000	923000	is how we achieve single cell capture
923000	925000	in a high-throughput manner.
925000	927000	The way we implement
927000	929000	is by microfluidics.
929000	931000	The principle is quite simple.
931000	933000	We capture single cells
933000	935000	by channel blocking.
935000	937000	So you can imagine
937000	939000	this is a
939000	941000	microfluidics microwell
941000	943000	or microchamber.
943000	945000	This is a capture site.
945000	947000	The blue part is the channel.
947000	949000	This is where the water flows.
949000	951000	These are the flowing cells.
951000	953000	When the cells come in,
953000	955000	they block this place.
955000	957000	So the flow basically
957000	959000	stops.
959000	961000	The next cell will go to the next place.
961000	963000	So each well has only one cell.
967000	969000	If we only have
969000	971000	10-20 chambers,
971000	973000	a simple design would be fine.
973000	975000	But in this workbook,
975000	977000	we have to scale a chip
977000	979000	up to tens of thousands.
979000	981000	At this time,
981000	983000	this simple duplication
983000	985000	will cause a significant flow imbalance.
985000	987000	In other words,
987000	989000	if the entire
989000	991000	flow cell
991000	993000	comes in,
993000	995000	it will mostly be upstream or downstream.
995000	997000	The capture rate will be very, very low.
997000	999000	How do I
999000	1001000	make the cell
1001000	1003000	uniformly distributed
1003000	1005000	on this
1005000	1007000	array?
1007000	1009000	The method I use is
1009000	1011000	circuit modeling.
1011000	1013000	In fact,
1013000	1015000	microfluidics is like
1015000	1017000	a flow circuit.
1017000	1019000	Each channel
1019000	1021000	has a flow group.
1021000	1023000	This flow group is mainly
1023000	1025000	dominated by the capture site.
1025000	1027000	Because the flow group is the largest,
1027000	1029000	and the size is the smallest.
1029000	1031000	The entrance channel and the exit channel
1031000	1033000	are relatively small.
1033000	1035000	But because it is very long,
1035000	1037000	the build-up resistance is also very large.
1037000	1039000	You can see that the resistance of the entrance channel
1039000	1041000	accumulates from 1 to 200.
1041000	1043000	This is a circuit like this.
1043000	1045000	Why didn't
1045000	1047000	the simple duplication work?
1047000	1049000	Because if we want
1049000	1051000	a good distribution,
1051000	1053000	each branch of the
1053000	1055000	current is the same.
1055000	1057000	We know that
1057000	1059000	if the upper short
1059000	1061000	here is very small,
1061000	1063000	the lower short here is also very small,
1063000	1065000	then this thing can happen.
1065000	1067000	But today,
1067000	1069000	we put 200
1069000	1071000	negligible short here.
1071000	1073000	At this time,
1073000	1075000	the performance of the current
1075000	1077000	will be much worse than what we want.
1077000	1079000	How do we balance the current?
1079000	1081000	Flow resistance
1081000	1083000	is actually a function
1083000	1085000	of channel geometry.
1085000	1087000	You can see that
1087000	1089000	circular and rectangular
1089000	1091000	have different functions.
1091000	1093000	In short, the longer the channel,
1093000	1095000	the higher the flow resistance.
1095000	1097000	The wider the width,
1097000	1099000	the smaller the flow resistance.
1099000	1101000	So we use
1101000	1103000	microfabrication
1103000	1105000	to make
1105000	1107000	this very small
1107000	1109000	geometry.
1111000	1113000	First, this can achieve
1113000	1115000	high flow resistance.
1115000	1117000	Second, 10x10
1117000	1119000	can block our cancer cell.
1119000	1121000	Because we generally believe that
1121000	1123000	the size of the cancer cell
1123000	1125000	is greater than 10 microns.
1125000	1127000	I will have related data
1127000	1129000	to explain this later.
1129000	1131000	We have overcome
1131000	1133000	the microwave
1133000	1135000	flow resistance
1135000	1137000	we have defined here.
1137000	1139000	What about the entrance channel and the NC channel?
1139000	1141000	I use this
1141000	1143000	microfabrication
1143000	1145000	to make 100 microns
1145000	1147000	wider and 100 microns higher
1147000	1149000	geometry.
1149000	1151000	So I can make the
1151000	1153000	entrance channel and the NC channel
1153000	1155000	flow resistance
1155000	1157000	smaller than these cancer cells.
1157000	1159000	In short,
1159000	1161000	we use this microfabrication
1161000	1163000	to control our flow resistance.
1163000	1165000	So we have a
1165000	1167000	very good flow circuit
1167000	1169000	to achieve single cell capture.
1171000	1173000	This shows that
1173000	1175000	we use three
1175000	1177000	different sizes of chips
1177000	1179000	to scale.
1179000	1181000	From 800 to
1181000	1183000	12800
1183000	1185000	chamber chips.
1185000	1187000	The size is probably on a slice.
1187000	1189000	You can see
1189000	1191000	that this is a device
1191000	1193000	and every
1193000	1195000	chamber we can capture
1195000	1197000	a single cell.
1197000	1199000	This is a microscope image.
1199000	1201000	Our cancer cell is labeled here
1201000	1203000	as a green fluorescent dye.
1203000	1205000	You can see that this array
1205000	1207000	has a very good single cell capture.
1209000	1211000	Now we have
1211000	1213000	achieved high-throughput single cell capture.
1213000	1215000	How do we
1215000	1217000	analyze it?
1217000	1219000	This is a comic.
1223000	1225000	So
1225000	1227000	based on many habits,
1227000	1229000	we need to
1229000	1231000	automate the readout process.
1231000	1233000	So how do we do it?
1233000	1235000	Sorry,
1235000	1237000	I have a question.
1239000	1241000	You can see
1241000	1243000	that almost every
1243000	1245000	size has a single cell capture.
1245000	1247000	But my question is
1247000	1249000	if you drop a sample
1249000	1251000	from beginning to end,
1251000	1253000	does every size
1253000	1255000	have a cell?
1255000	1257000	Or if you drop a sample,
1257000	1259000	does every size have a
1259000	1261000	10% size capture?
1261000	1263000	And you have to fill it up again and again.
1263000	1265000	That's a very good question.
1265000	1267000	So the beauty of MicroFluidics
1267000	1269000	is that we put
1269000	1271000	cell suspension into the sample.
1271000	1273000	We don't need any other
1273000	1275000	equipment. We use gravity flow.
1275000	1277000	The cell solution
1277000	1279000	will gradually flow in.
1279000	1281000	So the whole operation is done by a single arrangement.
1281000	1283000	It's not the first time, the second time, the third time.
1283000	1285000	It's done in one go.
1285000	1287000	It's like this.
1287000	1289000	Tens of thousands of single cell capture.
1295000	1297000	Is that reasonable?
1297000	1299000	It's reasonable.
1299000	1301000	I'm just curious.
1301000	1303000	For example,
1303000	1305000	how much is the reduction
1305000	1307000	of human power?
1307000	1309000	I see.
1309000	1311000	It becomes only one arrangement.
1311000	1313000	It's all captured.
1313000	1315000	That's the reduction we achieved.
1315000	1317000	So how much is the
1317000	1319000	filling ratio of this chip?
1319000	1321000	Is it more than 95%?
1323000	1325000	Do you mean that several chambers
1325000	1327000	can really capture a single cell?
1327000	1329000	Is that the question you wanted to ask?
1329000	1331000	Because this question
1331000	1333000	is related to how much time
1333000	1335000	you need to spend.
1335000	1337000	So if it's one time,
1337000	1339000	you can change it to this.
1339000	1341000	For example, you drop it once.
1341000	1343000	How much is it?
1343000	1345000	It looks like it's 100%.
1345000	1347000	At least it's 100% in my eyes.
1347000	1349000	This publication is the most beautiful.
1349000	1351000	OK, this capture rate
1351000	1353000	is 75%
1353000	1355000	in our routine.
1355000	1357000	It can be optimized online.
1357000	1359000	But we consider
1359000	1361000	other things.
1361000	1363000	So we think 75% is a better number.
1363000	1365000	I'll explain it later.
1365000	1367000	OK.
1367000	1369000	And 12,875.
1369000	1371000	That's a lot.
1371000	1373000	After a cell
1373000	1375000	is captured,
1377000	1379000	this chamber will be
1379000	1381000	interrupted and nothing will come in.
1381000	1383000	That's right.
1383000	1385000	It's a very simple principle.
1387000	1389000	Do you plan to
1389000	1391000	compress it
1391000	1393000	directly
1393000	1395000	or
1395000	1397000	do some pre-processing?
1397000	1399000	For example,
1399000	1401000	how do you differentiate
1401000	1403000	different cells?
1403000	1405000	That's a very good question.
1405000	1407000	The project we want to commercialize
1407000	1409000	is
1409000	1411000	molecular analysis
1411000	1413000	or phenotypic analysis.
1413000	1415000	In my other project,
1415000	1417000	we do sample preparation.
1417000	1419000	We want to
1419000	1421000	extract
1421000	1423000	the mRNA transcript
1423000	1425000	from single cell
1425000	1427000	and barcode it.
1427000	1429000	We can use Illumina
1429000	1431000	to do whole transcript from sequence.
1431000	1433000	We can't do
1433000	1435000	sample preparation
1435000	1437000	directly from the protocol.
1437000	1439000	We need to go through
1439000	1441000	upstream cell enrichment.
1441000	1443000	This is
1443000	1445000	very competitive.
1447000	1449000	There are many vendors
1449000	1451000	in the commercial space
1451000	1453000	like startups.
1453000	1455000	They can provide
1455000	1457000	downstream information
1457000	1459000	enhancement.
1459000	1461000	These startups
1461000	1463000	can take the blood
1463000	1465000	and put it in the instrument.
1465000	1467000	The result is
1467000	1469000	a tumor sample
1469000	1471000	after purification.
1471000	1473000	These tumor samples
1473000	1475000	have very limited meaning.
1475000	1477000	If you want to have clinical meaning,
1477000	1479000	you need to know
1479000	1481000	the gene expression
1481000	1483000	and gene mutation.
1483000	1485000	We want to finish the last mile.
1485000	1487000	The commercially available
1487000	1489000	technology is
1489000	1491000	upstream
1491000	1493000	GTC purification.
1493000	1495000	We can do sample preparation
1495000	1497000	after purification
1497000	1499000	to the sequencer
1499000	1501000	or next generation sequencing.
1503000	1505000	Thank you.
1507000	1509000	The answer is a bit long.
1511000	1513000	Any other questions?
1515000	1517000	No, I can continue.
1517000	1519000	Okay,
1519000	1521000	I will continue.
1521000	1523000	I don't want to
1523000	1525000	analyze so many chambers.
1525000	1527000	I want to automate
1527000	1529000	the process.
1529000	1531000	I use a biocompatible
1531000	1533000	cell
1533000	1535000	with green fluorescence.
1535000	1537000	We can use
1537000	1539000	fluorescence
1539000	1541000	to read out the cell.
1541000	1543000	We thought it would be easy
1543000	1545000	to read out the cell.
1545000	1547000	However,
1547000	1549000	after scanning the image,
1549000	1551000	we found that
1551000	1553000	the cell expression is different.
1553000	1555000	They take the blood
1555000	1557000	with different efficiency.
1557000	1559000	You can see the picture
1559000	1561000	with 5 cells and 6 cells.
1561000	1563000	Some cells are bright and some are dark.
1563000	1565000	If we use a simple
1565000	1567000	search holding,
1567000	1569000	many cells are ignored.
1569000	1571000	What should we do?
1571000	1573000	We need to
1573000	1575000	use algorithms
1575000	1577000	to make
1577000	1579000	the readout more reliable.
1579000	1581000	There are four steps.
1581000	1583000	First, we do a contrast
1583000	1585000	enhancement.
1585000	1587000	We use a
1587000	1589000	contrast enhancement
1589000	1591000	for this part.
1591000	1593000	I will explain why later.
1593000	1595000	Next, we use K-means clustering
1595000	1597000	to find the peak
1597000	1599000	of the intensity.
1599000	1601000	Finally,
1601000	1603000	we can extract local maxima
1603000	1605000	to find the center
1605000	1607000	of each cell.
1607000	1609000	These three images
1609000	1611000	show the readout
1611000	1613000	of two or more cells.
1613000	1615000	That's it.
1617000	1619000	Contrast enhancement
1619000	1621000	has a tricky part.
1621000	1623000	The contrast enhancement
1623000	1625000	is the goal of histogram equalization.
1625000	1627000	The sample
1627000	1629000	has a dark background.
1629000	1631000	After using
1631000	1633000	the algorithm,
1633000	1635000	the whole circle is bright.
1635000	1637000	We can't use it.
1637000	1639000	We use contrast-limited
1639000	1641000	adapted histogram equalization.
1641000	1643000	We can define
1643000	1645000	each enhancement panel
1645000	1647000	to be
1647000	1649000	660 pixels
1649000	1651000	or other arbitrary
1651000	1653000	number of pixels
1653000	1655000	to do the enhancement.
1655000	1657000	Under this premise,
1657000	1659000	we know
1659000	1661000	the size of a single cell
1661000	1663000	is several pixels.
1663000	1665000	We can use this information
1665000	1667000	to locally magnify
1667000	1669000	the fluorescent signal
1669000	1671000	of the cell.
1671000	1673000	Look at the chamber.
1673000	1675000	We can effectively
1675000	1677000	suppress
1677000	1679000	the background noise
1679000	1681000	to achieve the image analysis.
1681000	1683000	These are
1683000	1685000	the results of
1685000	1687000	the algorithm.
1687000	1689000	You can see the suspension cell.
1689000	1691000	We can effectively
1691000	1693000	locate
1693000	1695000	each cell.
1695000	1697000	This is the state of
1697000	1699000	adherent culture.
1699000	1701000	We can effectively
1701000	1703000	identify one cell, two cells
1703000	1705000	or many cells
1705000	1707000	to fill the chamber.
1707000	1709000	Although
1709000	1711000	this work is
1711000	1713000	focused on
1713000	1715000	suspension culture,
1715000	1717000	the same capture
1717000	1719000	mechanism can be used
1719000	1721000	to achieve adherent cell culture.
1721000	1723000	This is an example.
1723000	1725000	The algorithm
1725000	1727000	can also do
1727000	1729000	size measurement
1729000	1731000	and sphere size measurement
1731000	1733000	to determine
1733000	1735000	the size of a sphere.
1735000	1737000	These functions
1737000	1739000	can only be
1739000	1741000	implemented
1741000	1743000	on our corpus.
1743000	1745000	With this technology
1745000	1747000	and algorithm,
1747000	1749000	we can do
1749000	1751000	the device
1751000	1753000	test.
1753000	1755000	The first test is
1755000	1757000	the capture rate
1757000	1759000	or capture characterization.
1759000	1761000	In our test,
1761000	1763000	we optimize
1763000	1765000	the capture rate
1765000	1767000	to 76.5%.
1767000	1769000	First, we limit
1769000	1771000	the cell loading time
1771000	1773000	to 15 minutes.
1773000	1775000	We don't want to
1775000	1777000	leave the cell
1777000	1779000	for more than 15 minutes.
1779000	1781000	If the cell is left for too long,
1781000	1783000	it will affect the cell's
1783000	1785000	viability or
1785000	1787000	the cell's health.
1787000	1789000	In this 15-minute loading time,
1789000	1791000	we try four different
1791000	1793000	results.
1793000	1795000	No capture,
1795000	1797000	single cell,
1797000	1799000	double cell,
1799000	1801000	or multiple cell.
1801000	1803000	In the different
1803000	1805000	cell loading concentration,
1805000	1807000	the lower the cell
1807000	1809000	concentration,
1809000	1811000	the less cells are left.
1811000	1813000	If we increase
1813000	1815000	the loading concentration,
1815000	1817000	the more chambers
1817000	1819000	are double cell or multiple cell.
1819000	1821000	In the cell concentration
1821000	1823000	trade-off,
1823000	1825000	50k per mL
1825000	1827000	in single cell
1827000	1829000	is 76.5%.
1829000	1831000	In fact,
1831000	1833000	if we want to push
1833000	1835000	the capture rate,
1835000	1837000	we can use
1837000	1839000	a lower cell concentration
1839000	1841000	for 30 minutes.
1841000	1843000	I think we can push
1843000	1845000	the cell capture rate
1845000	1847000	to 80 or 90.
1847000	1849000	Some friends say
1849000	1851000	there are more than 10k chambers
1851000	1853000	with 70% of the load.
1853000	1855000	This is also good.
1855000	1857000	We think so, too.
1857000	1859000	So we set the number here.
1859000	1861000	Why
1861000	1863000	is there a double cell
1863000	1865000	or multiple cell
1865000	1867000	in higher concentration?
1867000	1869000	In the chamber design,
1869000	1871000	we must
1871000	1873000	let the cell block
1873000	1875000	the cell capture site
1875000	1877000	so that the cell can't get in.
1877000	1879000	If the loading concentration
1879000	1881000	is high,
1881000	1883000	there is a possibility
1883000	1885000	that the first cell
1885000	1887000	may get in
1887000	1889000	before the first cell
1889000	1891000	blocks.
1891000	1893000	It's hard to avoid
1893000	1895000	two cells
1895000	1897000	in the same chamber.
1897000	1899000	But it doesn't matter.
1899000	1901000	Even if there is a multiple cell
1901000	1903000	or double cell,
1903000	1905000	all the data
1905000	1907000	is extracted
1907000	1909000	from single cell.
1911000	1913000	As we mentioned,
1913000	1915000	the size of the cancer cell
1915000	1917000	is very important.
1917000	1919000	We don't want
1919000	1921000	cells smaller than 10 microns
1921000	1923000	or other sizes
1923000	1925000	to get in.
1925000	1927000	It will skew
1927000	1929000	or distort
1929000	1931000	the whole experiment.
1931000	1933000	As we mentioned,
1933000	1935000	the cancer cell
1935000	1937000	is very
1937000	1939000	strange.
1939000	1941000	So we must
1941000	1943000	ensure that
1943000	1945000	all sizes can be captured.
1945000	1947000	So we take
1947000	1949000	the cell line
1949000	1951000	from the ground
1951000	1953000	and make it round
1953000	1955000	or sphere-shaped
1955000	1957000	to quantify
1957000	1959000	its size
1959000	1961000	with the
1961000	1963000	diameter.
1963000	1965000	Then we put the same cell line
1965000	1967000	or cell
1967000	1969000	in the tube
1969000	1971000	to measure its size.
1971000	1973000	The distribution
1973000	1975000	is next to it.
1975000	1977000	As you can see,
1977000	1979000	the distribution is very similar.
1979000	1981000	Here are four images
1981000	1983000	showing relatively small cells
1983000	1985000	about 11 or 12 microns
1985000	1987000	in diameter.
1987000	1989000	This is very rare.
1989000	1991000	One-thousandth cell
1991000	1993000	has a diameter of 40 microns.
1993000	1995000	We can effectively
1995000	1997000	preserve the size.
1999000	2001000	To sum up,
2001000	2003000	there are two challenges
2003000	2005000	to overcome.
2005000	2007000	The first one is how to
2007000	2009000	scale up the throughput.
2009000	2011000	The second challenge is
2011000	2013000	how to automate
2013000	2015000	the readout under
2015000	2017000	engineering innovation.
2017000	2019000	To scale up
2019000	2021000	the throughput
2021000	2023000	using a highly parallel
2023000	2025000	flow circuit,
2025000	2027000	we need
2027000	2029000	a compact
2029000	2031000	high-density array
2031000	2033000	to scale up
2033000	2035000	the image processing.
2035000	2037000	To scale up
2037000	2039000	the image processing,
2039000	2041000	we need to scan
2041000	2043000	each image
2043000	2045000	in the device area.
2045000	2047000	The higher the density,
2047000	2049000	the smaller the number
2049000	2051000	of frames needed
2053000	2055000	for image processing.
2055000	2057000	These are the two challenges
2057000	2059000	of engineering innovation
2059000	2061000	to scale up the throughput.
2061000	2063000	In terms of automation,
2063000	2065000	we developed a highly adaptive
2065000	2067000	algorithm to analyze
2067000	2069000	the different single cells.
2069000	2071000	We also used
2071000	2073000	the function
2073000	2075000	to analyze the size
2075000	2077000	of the single cell or sphere.
2079000	2081000	Is there anything
2081000	2083000	you want to discuss?
2085000	2087000	I'm a bit curious
2087000	2089000	about the fluorescent bag.
2091000	2093000	Our fluorescent bag
2093000	2095000	uses CellTracker.
2095000	2097000	CellTracker
2097000	2099000	is a live technology.
2099000	2101000	What does it do?
2103000	2105000	That's a good question.
2109000	2111000	As far as I know,
2115000	2117000	it's a bit like
2117000	2119000	a metallization product.
2119000	2121000	If the cell is alive,
2121000	2123000	it will intake
2123000	2125000	these bags
2125000	2127000	to show the color
2127000	2129000	of the cell.
2129000	2131000	You may want to know
2131000	2133000	what the chemical is.
2133000	2135000	I can send you the link.
2137000	2139000	I'm curious
2139000	2141000	how you can make sure
2141000	2143000	that all the cells
2143000	2145000	will eat the bag.
2145000	2147000	I don't know if
2147000	2149000	there is something
2149000	2151000	in the sample
2151000	2153000	that will be eaten by the cell.
2153000	2155000	Are you worried
2155000	2157000	about the negative force?
2161000	2163000	Yes.
2163000	2165000	In this chip,
2165000	2167000	the fluorescence
2167000	2169000	is very dim.
2169000	2171000	As I said,
2171000	2173000	some cells may be very weak.
2173000	2175000	It's very dim.
2175000	2177000	These two cells
2177000	2179000	seem to be weaker.
2179000	2181000	We try our best
2181000	2183000	to minimize the force
2183000	2185000	and minimize the negative force.
2185000	2187000	As we see in this experiment,
2187000	2189000	we use manual
2189000	2191000	and brightfield imaging
2191000	2193000	to verify
2193000	2195000	that the negative force
2195000	2197000	is less than 5%,
2199000	2201000	so we minimize the negative force.
2201000	2203000	The second is
2203000	2205000	that we need
2205000	2207000	commercialization projects
2207000	2209000	to do molecular analysis.
2209000	2211000	In this project,
2211000	2213000	the real cell readout
2213000	2215000	is from sequencing,
2215000	2217000	not from fluorescence reading.
2217000	2219000	So the readout method
2219000	2221000	is different
2221000	2223000	with different concerns
2223000	2225000	and different methods.
2225000	2227000	I didn't understand
2227000	2229000	what you said
2229000	2231000	about commercialization.
2231000	2233000	What is the readout?
2233000	2235000	We directly see
2235000	2237000	how much transcript recovery
2237000	2239000	is required.
2249000	2251000	I have another question.
2255000	2257000	I just calculated
2257000	2259000	the size of the chip.
2259000	2261000	For example,
2261000	2263000	a cell is about 10 microns,
2263000	2265000	and a grid is
2265000	2267000	several times the width of the cell.
2267000	2269000	If you have
2269000	2271000	about 10,000 grids,
2271000	2273000	and we think of it as a square,
2273000	2275000	so the length of the grid is about 100 grids,
2275000	2277000	then the chip
2277000	2279000	will be several centimeters
2279000	2281000	long.
2281000	2283000	Is that right?
2283000	2285000	Yes.
2285000	2287000	That's about it.
2287000	2289000	My question is
2289000	2291000	you have a several centimeters
2291000	2293000	long chip,
2293000	2295000	and you use a channel
2295000	2297000	to feed through
2297000	2299000	all the slides.
2299000	2301000	How many channels
2301000	2303000	do you use to feed through
2303000	2305000	all the slides?
2305000	2307000	If there is no clock
2307000	2309000	in the feeding line,
2309000	2311000	it will be a whole row.
2311000	2313000	All the slides
2313000	2315000	will not have feeding.
2315000	2317000	Is that right?
2317000	2319000	That's a very good question.
2319000	2321000	You said
2321000	2323000	if the channel is broken,
2323000	2325000	all the slides will be dead.
2325000	2327000	Yes.
2327000	2329000	If the channel is broken,
2329000	2331000	there will be no cells.
2331000	2333000	This is not a problem
2333000	2335000	in our experiment.
2335000	2337000	There are two reasons.
2337000	2339000	First,
2339000	2341000	each branch
2341000	2343000	has 64 or 32 chips.
2343000	2345000	So
2345000	2347000	even if one branch doesn't work,
2347000	2349000	we may lose
2349000	2351000	some of the cells.
2351000	2353000	Second,
2353000	2355000	if the channel is 100 microns long,
2355000	2357000	it's not easy
2357000	2359000	to break it or kill it.
2359000	2361000	So there is no problem.
2361000	2363000	Thank you.
2363000	2365000	How do you make the channel?
2365000	2367000	Can you tell us?
2367000	2369000	Of course.
2371000	2373000	We use
2373000	2375000	microfabrication
2375000	2377000	to make photolithography.
2377000	2379000	We use
2379000	2381000	SUA.
2381000	2383000	The feature is that
2383000	2385000	we can make a channel
2385000	2387000	with a wide range of thickness.
2387000	2389000	For example,
2389000	2391000	one micron to several microns.
2391000	2393000	We can define
2393000	2395000	the different
2395000	2397000	channel sizes.
2397000	2399000	Thank you.
2399000	2401000	Thank you.
2401000	2403000	I think
2403000	2405000	it's a good question.
2405000	2407000	I think everyone is following.
2407000	2409000	Thank you.
2409000	2411000	I have to answer
2411000	2413000	how to make
2413000	2415000	suspension culture
2415000	2417000	based on capture.
2417000	2419000	We have a
2419000	2421000	capture scheme.
2421000	2423000	The chips
2423000	2425000	are made of PDMS.
2425000	2427000	How do we make sure
2427000	2429000	that
2429000	2431000	it won't stick
2431000	2433000	to the chip?
2433000	2435000	We use
2435000	2437000	a chemical called
2437000	2439000	Peronic F108.
2439000	2441000	The feature is that
2441000	2443000	the two ends
2443000	2445000	of the chemical
2445000	2447000	have a
2447000	2449000	hydrophobic
2449000	2451000	core.
2451000	2453000	So what happens
2453000	2455000	when we load
2455000	2457000	the F108 to the chip?
2457000	2459000	The hydrophobic core
2459000	2461000	will stick to
2461000	2463000	the PDMS.
2463000	2465000	The two ends
2465000	2467000	or the pegs
2467000	2469000	will expose
2469000	2471000	the surface of the channel.
2471000	2473000	When the cell comes in,
2473000	2475000	it sees that there are many pegs.
2475000	2477000	Pegs are
2477000	2479000	a kind of
2479000	2481000	anti-biofouling material.
2481000	2483000	If we have
2483000	2485000	these pegs
2485000	2487000	on the surface,
2487000	2489000	the cells won't be able to
2489000	2491000	stick to the PDMS.
2491000	2493000	So we can make
2493000	2495000	suspension cell culture.
2495000	2497000	In this work,
2497000	2499000	we show four different
2499000	2501000	breast cancer cell lines.
2501000	2503000	You can see
2503000	2505000	the sphere-forming cell
2505000	2507000	at the top,
2507000	2509000	and the anoikis cell at the bottom.
2509000	2511000	You can see the single cell
2511000	2513000	at day 7 and 14
2513000	2515000	started to form
2515000	2517000	a humerous sphere.
2517000	2519000	The width of the chamber
2519000	2521000	is about 100 microns.
2521000	2523000	So you can see
2523000	2525000	the humerous sphere is relatively small.
2525000	2527000	The anoikis cell
2527000	2529000	has
2529000	2531000	a debris
2531000	2533000	or cell
2533000	2535000	inside the chip.
2535000	2537000	You can see
2537000	2539000	that different cell lines
2539000	2541000	look different.
2541000	2543000	Some look like balls.
2543000	2545000	Some look like grapes.
2545000	2547000	The morphology is slightly different.
2551000	2553000	Can you go back to the first page?
2553000	2555000	Sure.
2555000	2557000	When you make cell culture,
2557000	2559000	you should release the cell first.
2559000	2561000	At least don't let it
2561000	2563000	get stuck in the channel.
2563000	2565000	Right?
2565000	2567000	OK.
2567000	2569000	After completing cell loading,
2569000	2571000	we will wash the cell
2571000	2573000	to make sure
2573000	2575000	there is no cell on the entrance channel.
2575000	2577000	Then we will flip the chip over.
2577000	2579000	This is a more detailed
2579000	2581000	experiment process.
2581000	2583000	So we flip the chip over
2583000	2585000	and the cell will fall into the microwave.
2585000	2587000	You can see
2587000	2589000	from this image
2589000	2591000	that this is the capture site.
2591000	2593000	You flip it over
2593000	2595000	and it falls to the bottom.
2595000	2597000	Because of the gravity,
2597000	2599000	it falls to the bottom.
2599000	2601000	Then it
2601000	2603000	grows into a sphere.
2603000	2605000	Or it may die.
2605000	2607000	OK.
2607000	2609000	After flipping the chip over,
2609000	2611000	you need to provide nutrients,
2611000	2613000	right?
2613000	2615000	You need to use the same channel chip
2615000	2617000	to do this.
2617000	2619000	That's right.
2619000	2621000	It's easy to do.
2621000	2623000	We just take
2623000	2625000	the in-and-out chips
2625000	2627000	and put them into CultureMedia.
2627000	2629000	CultureMedia has more chips.
2629000	2631000	So it will gradually flow
2631000	2633000	to the outlet.
2633000	2635000	We provide nutrients
2635000	2637000	in stages.
2637000	2639000	We change
2639000	2641000	the frequency of Media
2641000	2643000	once a day.
2643000	2645000	It's our protocol.
2645000	2647000	I see.
2647000	2649000	Thank you.
2649000	2651000	Thank you.
2655000	2657000	We use
2657000	2659000	this technology
2659000	2661000	to put the cell in.
2661000	2663000	You can see the sphere size distribution
2663000	2665000	and the sphere formation rate.
2665000	2667000	You can see the different cell lines.
2667000	2669000	It's quite obvious.
2669000	2671000	It's easy to grow into a sphere.
2671000	2673000	First, the sphere formation rate
2673000	2675000	is high.
2675000	2677000	At the same time,
2677000	2679000	the size is large.
2679000	2681000	It's smaller than other cell lines.
2681000	2683000	The result is
2683000	2685000	quite consistent.
2685000	2687000	It proves
2687000	2689000	the capability
2689000	2691000	of our technology.
2691000	2693000	What else
2693000	2695000	can we do
2695000	2697000	with this technology?
2697000	2699000	We can
2699000	2701000	get the
2701000	2703000	sphere formation rate
2703000	2705000	with this technology.
2705000	2707000	We can see more details
2707000	2709000	and information.
2709000	2711000	First, the relationship
2711000	2713000	between stem cell and
2713000	2715000	stem cell.
2715000	2717000	It's controversial.
2717000	2719000	Some people think
2719000	2721000	the smaller cell
2721000	2723000	is related to
2723000	2725000	stem cell gene.
2725000	2727000	The lower the stem cell gene,
2727000	2729000	the smaller the cell.
2729000	2731000	However,
2731000	2733000	mitochondria
2733000	2735000	have more
2735000	2737000	and larger cell lines.
2737000	2739000	It increases the size of the cell.
2739000	2741000	At the same time,
2741000	2743000	it makes the cell look more
2743000	2745000	stem-like.
2745000	2747000	What's going on?
2747000	2749000	We can
2749000	2751000	understand stemness
2751000	2753000	from sphere formation rate.
2753000	2755000	We have a good algorithm
2755000	2757000	to analyze
2757000	2759000	the size of mitochondria.
2759000	2761000	We can study the impact of
2761000	2763000	different size groups on sphere formation rate.
2763000	2765000	You can see
2765000	2767000	cell size distribution.
2767000	2769000	We can see
2769000	2771000	the size of
2771000	2773000	the single cell
2773000	2775000	in different cell lines.
2775000	2777000	We can see
2777000	2779000	the size of
2779000	2781000	the single cell
2781000	2783000	in different cell lines.
2783000	2785000	We can compare
2785000	2787000	the size of
2787000	2789000	inter-cell line.
2789000	2791000	We can compare
2791000	2793000	the sphere formation rate
2793000	2795000	of the first 30%
2795000	2797000	of mitochondria.
2797000	2799000	The result is very interesting.
2799000	2801000	In the experiment of
2801000	2803000	SOM-159,
2803000	2805000	we can observe
2805000	2807000	that the smaller cell size
2807000	2809000	is larger than
2809000	2811000	the larger cell
2811000	2813000	in the sphere formation rate.
2813000	2815000	However,
2815000	2817000	in SOM-149 and
2817000	2819000	T47,
2819000	2821000	the fourth cell line
2821000	2823000	has no difference.
2823000	2825000	We think
2825000	2827000	in different cell lines
2827000	2829000	or different pathway regulations,
2829000	2831000	they may be different.
2831000	2833000	It also explains
2833000	2835000	why other people
2835000	2837000	get different conclusions.
2837000	2839000	We can't study the correlation
2839000	2841000	directly from size.
2841000	2843000	We have to look at
2843000	2845000	gene regulation
2845000	2847000	to determine whether it is CSE.
2847000	2849000	Size is not a reliable
2849000	2851000	CSE marker.
2851000	2853000	This is
2853000	2855000	the conclusion.
2855000	2857000	Next,
2857000	2859000	we can check the size
2859000	2861000	of the sphere in
2861000	2863000	Day 0, Day 7, and Day 14.
2863000	2865000	We can see
2865000	2867000	the growth
2867000	2869000	in each stage.
2869000	2871000	We can see
2871000	2873000	that in each cell line,
2873000	2875000	some cells
2875000	2877000	grow very fast in the first week
2877000	2879000	and not so fast in the second week.
2879000	2881000	In contrast,
2881000	2883000	some cells grow very slow
2883000	2885000	in the first week,
2885000	2887000	but in the second week,
2887000	2889000	they grow bigger.
2889000	2891000	This is
2891000	2893000	the plot
2893000	2895000	on the
2895000	2897000	scattering plot.
2897000	2899000	If we put
2899000	2901000	Day 7's sphere diameter
2901000	2903000	on X,
2903000	2905000	Day 14's on X,
2905000	2907000	we can see
2907000	2909000	that Day 7's
2909000	2911000	sphere diameter
2911000	2913000	is basically
2913000	2915000	1X.
2915000	2917000	If Day 14's
2917000	2919000	sphere diameter
2919000	2921000	is 1X,
2921000	2923000	Day 14's
2923000	2925000	sphere diameter
2925000	2927000	is 1X.
2927000	2929000	Day 14's
2929000	2931000	sphere diameter
2931000	2933000	is 1X.
2933000	2935000	Day 14's
2935000	2937000	sphere diameter
2937000	2939000	is 1X.
2939000	2941000	Day 14's
2941000	2943000	sphere diameter
2943000	2945000	is 1X.
2945000	2947000	Day 14's
2947000	2949000	sphere diameter
2949000	2951000	is 1X.
2951000	2953000	In the theory of
2953000	2955000	cancer stem cells,
2955000	2957000	oncologists believe
2957000	2959000	that there is
2959000	2961000	a tumor-stem cell hierarchy,
2961000	2963000	meaning that
2963000	2965000	it can't further differentiate
2965000	2967000	into regular cells.
2967000	2969000	We believe that
2969000	2971000	these progenitor cells
2971000	2973000	are not yet
2973000	2975000	fully compatible,
2975000	2977000	so they can also
2977000	2979000	produce a tumor sphere.
2979000	2981000	However,
2981000	2983000	it is not a stem cell,
2983000	2985000	so it can't
2985000	2987000	self-renew
2987000	2989000	after proliferating
2989000	2991000	several times.
2991000	2993000	On the other hand,
2993000	2995000	cancer stem cells
2995000	2997000	have a quiescent property,
2997000	2999000	which means
2999000	3001000	they don't like proliferation.
3001000	3003000	They may grow slowly at first,
3003000	3005000	but it doesn't mean
3005000	3007000	they don't want to.
3007000	3009000	When I showed this result
3009000	3011000	to our collaborators,
3011000	3013000	they were very interested.
3013000	3015000	In their hypothesis,
3015000	3017000	although there are
3017000	3019000	so many sphere-forming cells,
3019000	3021000	this cell line
3021000	3023000	is a special cell line
3023000	3025000	with a lot of progenitor cells
3025000	3027000	and strong sphere-forming capability.
3027000	3029000	That's why
3029000	3031000	the proliferation rate
3031000	3033000	in the second week
3033000	3035000	is so much lower.
3035000	3037000	SOM149 is more
3037000	3039000	compatible with
3039000	3041000	oncologists' cancer stem cell model.
3041000	3043000	It may be quiescent at first,
3043000	3045000	but it can continue
3045000	3047000	to proliferate.
3047000	3049000	Through this technology,
3049000	3051000	we can see
3051000	3053000	the proliferation
3053000	3055000	of single-cell
3055000	3057000	derived sphere
3057000	3059000	and
3059000	3061000	study the
3061000	3063000	cancer stem cell hierarchy.
3063000	3065000	This is the second part
3065000	3067000	of our technology presentation.
3067000	3069000	To sum up,
3069000	3071000	the high-throughput single-cell
3071000	3073000	derived sphere as a chip
3073000	3075000	can scale from
3075000	3077000	800 to
3077000	3079000	more than 10,000 wells.
3079000	3081000	The capture rate
3081000	3083000	is now
3083000	3085000	around 76%.
3085000	3087000	When capturing the cell,
3087000	3089000	the representative cell size
3089000	3091000	per population
3091000	3093000	is equal to the block.
3093000	3095000	We can make sure
3095000	3097000	that we didn't
3097000	3099000	change the cell
3099000	3101000	in the cell process.
3101000	3103000	We didn't scale the result.
3103000	3105000	We also used
3105000	3107000	genetic analysis algorithm
3107000	3109000	to help us
3109000	3111000	do cell counting
3111000	3113000	and cell sphere size measurement.
3113000	3115000	Without these functions,
3115000	3117000	it is difficult to
3117000	3119000	quantify the sphere formation rate
3119000	3121000	and observe the dynamic
3121000	3123000	of sphere formation.
3123000	3125000	At the end of the presentation,
3125000	3127000	I told you
3127000	3129000	about two different
3129000	3131000	experimental results.
3131000	3133000	The first one is
3133000	3135000	the comparison of cell size
3135000	3137000	and cell strength.
3137000	3139000	We don't think
3139000	3141000	cell size is a good CSE marker.
3141000	3143000	We think
3143000	3145000	there are more
3145000	3147000	gene regulation
3147000	3149000	that we need to study
3149000	3151000	in the cell,
3151000	3153000	not just cell size.
3153000	3155000	We also showed
3155000	3157000	the ability to track
3157000	3159000	the process of sphere formation.
3159000	3161000	This can help oncologists
3161000	3163000	to study
3163000	3165000	tumor stem
3165000	3167000	and cancer stem cell hierarchy
3167000	3169000	to help them understand
3169000	3171000	the details.
3171000	3173000	This work
3173000	3175000	was published in
3175000	3177000	Lab on a Chip last August.
3177000	3179000	If you are interested,
3179000	3181000	you can check it out.
3181000	3183000	Thank you
3183000	3185000	our lab
3185000	3187000	for being with me
3187000	3189000	for an hour.
3189000	3191000	If you have any questions,
3191000	3193000	feel free to ask.
3201000	3203000	I have a question.
3203000	3205000	Can you go back to the page
3205000	3207000	before the conclusion?
3209000	3211000	This page?
3213000	3215000	Yes.
3215000	3217000	I have a question.
3217000	3219000	How do you rule out
3219000	3221000	the size of the culture well?
3221000	3223000	It's about 100 microns.
3223000	3225000	How do you rule out
3225000	3227000	the size of the chamber?
3227000	3229000	The speed
3229000	3231000	is not limited
3231000	3233000	to the size of the space.
3233000	3235000	It's the
3235000	3237000	characteristic of the sphere.
3237000	3239000	Is the entrance small?
3239000	3241000	I'm asking
3241000	3243000	the size of the chamber
3243000	3245000	is not limited
3245000	3247000	to the size of the chamber.
3247000	3249000	The size of the chamber
3249000	3251000	is not limited
3251000	3253000	to the size of the chamber.
3253000	3255000	That's a good question.
3255000	3257000	The entrance
3257000	3259000	is set at
3259000	3261000	50 microns.
3261000	3263000	We observed
3263000	3265000	the cell population.
3265000	3267000	The cell population
3267000	3269000	is not more than 50.
3269000	3271000	If a cell
3271000	3273000	is very powerful,
3273000	3275000	it will grow fully in the first week.
3275000	3277000	How do I know
3277000	3279000	if it will grow slowly
3279000	3281000	in the first week?
3281000	3283000	That's a good question.
3283000	3285000	In fact, we set 100 microns.
3285000	3287000	From our experience,
3287000	3289000	very few cells can grow
3289000	3291000	more than 100 microns.
3291000	3293000	The reason you can see so much
3293000	3295000	is because our data is
3295000	3297000	very large.
3297000	3299000	We can observe
3299000	3301000	very few cases
3301000	3303000	in our data.
3303000	3305000	If you are really interested,
3305000	3307000	it's not difficult
3307000	3309000	to solve this problem.
3309000	3311000	We can change the chamber size
3311000	3313000	to 150 microns
3313000	3315000	to solve the problem.
3315000	3317000	However,
3317000	3319000	in the context of work,
3319000	3321000	the chamber size is a minority.
3321000	3323000	It's not the focus of our research.
3323000	3325000	Our focus is to demonstrate
3325000	3327000	the capability.
3327000	3329000	So we set 100 microns
3329000	3331000	as the chamber size.
3339000	3341000	I have a question.
3341000	3343000	How do you
3343000	3345000	quantify
3345000	3347000	the gene performance
3347000	3349000	of a single cell?
3351000	3353000	This is my
3353000	3355000	other work.
3355000	3357000	If you are interested
3357000	3359000	in the gene performance
3359000	3361000	of a single cell,
3361000	3363000	you can read
3363000	3365000	a paper published
3365000	3367000	in Cell.
3367000	3369000	It basically
3369000	3371000	barcodes
3371000	3373000	each cell
3373000	3375000	and transcript.
3375000	3377000	From next-generation sequencing,
3377000	3379000	we can infer
3379000	3381000	which cell
3381000	3383000	this transcript
3383000	3385000	comes from.
3385000	3387000	We can quantify
3389000	3391000	the strength of gene performance
3391000	3393000	by this way.
3393000	3395000	The way it captures
3395000	3397000	messenger RNA is
3397000	3399000	to put a
3399000	3401000	poly-T-tail to capture
3401000	3403000	a poly-A-tail.
3403000	3405000	So they can hybridize
3405000	3407000	and barcode.
3409000	3411000	I have already captured
3411000	3413000	these cells.
3413000	3415000	How do you transfer them
3415000	3417000	to a single-cell RNA-seq
3417000	3419000	device?
3421000	3423000	In molecular
3423000	3425000	analysis,
3425000	3427000	we use
3427000	3429000	a bead
3429000	3431000	as our
3431000	3433000	mRNA-captured carrier.
3433000	3435000	This technology
3435000	3437000	is introduced
3437000	3439000	by Dropseq.
3439000	3441000	They introduce
3441000	3443000	this technology
3443000	3445000	and license it
3445000	3447000	to a company.
3447000	3449000	We buy the product
3449000	3451000	from the company
3451000	3453000	and put the bead
3453000	3455000	into our chip
3455000	3457000	to capture mRNA.
3457000	3459000	We take the bead
3459000	3461000	and do downstream amplification
3461000	3463000	for gene sequencing.
3469000	3471000	It sounds like
3471000	3473000	we will succeed.
3473000	3475000	We still have a long way to go.
3475000	3477000	Yes.
3487000	3489000	We don't have any more questions.
3489000	3491000	Thank you again
3491000	3493000	for the wonderful lecture.
3495000	3497000	Thank you for inviting me.
3499000	3501000	Thank you.
