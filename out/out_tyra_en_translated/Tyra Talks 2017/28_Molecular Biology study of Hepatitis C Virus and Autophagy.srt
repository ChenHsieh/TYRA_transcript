00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi, everyone. I'm the host for today. I'm Zhang Yanyong.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're going to have our 23rd Tara Talk this year.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're honored to have Dr. Wang Lingya as our speaker today.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
She's my senior at NTU.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Wait a minute.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Lingya studied medicine at NTU.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
After graduating from the PhD program at NTU,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
she came to Nanyang University.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
She's actually our neighbor.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We've met quite a few times.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
After doing her PhD, Lingya majored in virology.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's the topic she's going to talk about today.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today's topic is Molecular Biology Study of Hepatitis C Virus and Autophagy.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is that how you pronounce it?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know. If I pronounce it wrong, Lingya will correct me.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Without further ado, let's welcome Lingya.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, right. Autophagy.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There are two things I want to remind you of.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
First, if you don't want to speak,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
turn off your microphone so that you won't have noise.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Second, when you clap, remember to turn on your microphone so that you can hear.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's welcome our speaker.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Lingya.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As the host just said,

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm doing my PhD in Nanyang University.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm majoring in virology.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
When you watch a movie,

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
you'd think that you're walking around in a white gown in a lab.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But in fact, the most commonly used technology in our department is molecular biology.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So today, I'm going to talk about some methods of molecular biology

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and how it's used to study viruses.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll talk about autophagy later.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Molecular biology.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As you can imagine,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
biology is a big topic.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But molecular biology is about small molecules.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We learned in middle school that

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
DNA converts into RNA and converts into protein.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So the so-called genes are all on DNA.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
After a series of synthesis,

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
it becomes protein.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When we study viruses,

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we study almost everything.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's either DNA, RNA, or protein.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
These things are very small,

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
so you can't see them with the naked eye.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So our experiments are often done on

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
very small transparent objects.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
For example,

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
a 100-microliter or even a 1-microliter object.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Basically, you can't see it with your eyes.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So if you go on a trip,

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you might not know which one you're holding.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They all look the same,

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
so you don't know.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is mainly about molecular biology.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's about looking at the performance of DNA, RNA, or protein.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I just mentioned cells.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We also taught this in middle school.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Cells look like this.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's a cell box, a cell paper, a cell film,

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and there's a lot of air in it.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But the textbook will draw it cuter.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's more like a starfish.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But in fact, the cells under the wire

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
are filled very slowly.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You can see this is the cell box,

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and then the cell film,

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and in the middle is the cell paper.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There's a lot of air in the cell paper.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All the so-called air

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
is actually made up of a lot of film,

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
all kinds of bubbles.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is a little bit bigger.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can see there's a lot of film,

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
a lot of bubbles.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
These films and bubbles are actually all fat.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They're all made up of lipids.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Different bubbles have different functions.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Some are producing energy.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Some are making protein.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Some are making cyanide.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They're helping our cells maintain a good operation.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We need these cells.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Out of all these cells,

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the autophagy we're going to talk about today

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
is actually a cyanide job.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
To put it simply,

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
when our cells have

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
old bacteria,

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
or broken proteins,

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
or even when there's a virus infection,

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
or something from the outside,

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
it's all based on this cyanide

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to get rid of these bad or old things.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Since it's a function of cyanide,

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
it will naturally follow the death of cells,

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
or cancer,

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
or like our immune response.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Because of the immune response,

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the immune response needs to get rid of

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
some bad things from the virus or bacteria.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
For example, neurodegenerative diseases

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
are all related to the function of this cyanide autophagy.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What we're going to focus on today

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
is infectious diseases.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Viruses are infectious diseases.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The function of autophagy

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
is mainly...

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is a cell membrane.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This brown one is a cell membrane.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We can see that

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
there are a lot of membranes in our cells.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It is a small membrane

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
made up of some fat

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
in a circle.

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It will slowly get longer

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and become a bubble.

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Inside this bubble,

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
it will contain the bad things

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
that it will destroy later.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This bubble is called autophagosome.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know how to say it in Chinese,

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
so please remember it.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's called autophagosome.

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It has a lot of enzymes

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
in this bubble.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
These enzymes are used to

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
break down proteins.

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
When these two membranes are combined,

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the substances in their cells

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
will be different.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This enzyme will

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
break down the proteins.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let me talk a little bit about

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the later process.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Every department has its own

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
application science or basic science.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The virus science I do

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
is very basic science.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It is purely studying

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
what protein, what gas

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
will react with the virus

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
in the cells.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When people ask me

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
if I'm doing medicine,

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
if I'm doing vaccines,

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
if I'm treating cancer,

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
it has nothing to do with clinical trials.

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So when we talk about

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
basic virus science,

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
a lot of people think it's boring.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Today, I hope everyone

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
can understand this field.

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How does autophagosome work?

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
From a simple membrane

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
to a circle,

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it's easy to break down proteins.

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
As you can see in this picture,

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
this is a small membrane,

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
phagophore.

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It will slowly become

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
a complete circle, autophagosome.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
At the end, it's a fusion membrane.

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The lysosome that breaks down proteins

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
is called autolysosome.

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There are a lot of other proteins

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that control the whole process.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Because the membrane doesn't

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
automatically merge together.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There must be a protein controlling it.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We can see that when phagophore

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
is still a fragment,

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
there is a protein called ATG5.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It will be specifically

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
combined on this membrane.

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So when we monitor

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the number of membranes in our cells,

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
when we specifically monitor

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the membrane of this fragment,

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
we will look at the performance

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
of the protein ATG5.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If ATG5 performs well,

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
it means the membrane performs well.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So we call it a marker.

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's specifically for marking.

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The marker on autophagosome

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
is LC3.

190
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So in the experiment later,

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
if we talk about ATG5,

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
it's marking the membrane.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If we talk about LC3,

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
it's marking the autophagosome bubble.

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How do we know

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
if the protein has been

197
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
broken down?

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There is a protein called P62.

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Every time it's in the autophagosome,

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
it will be wrapped inside.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So if it's broken down in the end,

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we can see that

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the performance of P62 will drop.

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So these three things

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
are what we mainly do

206
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
when we do autophagosome,

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to monitor how far it has come.

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why do we need to study

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
viruses and autophagosome?

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We just mentioned that

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
autophagosome has the function

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
of cleaning the skin.

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It can remove the protein

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
from the virus.

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
In theory,

216
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
autophagosome should be useful

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to fight against viruses.

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But many studies have found

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that some viruses will

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
use autophagosome

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
to reproduce the virus

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to fight against the virus.

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is a typical example

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
of how the virus

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
kidnaps the mechanism

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
inside the cell

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to reproduce itself.

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The virus is actually

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
something between

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
living and non-living.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why is it non-living?

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because our cells

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
are made up of cell nucleus.

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There are a lot of cells

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that can produce energy

236
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
but not the virus.

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The virus has some

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
scattered DNA and RNA

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and a shell

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
made up of protein.

241
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's it.

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The virus itself

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
has no biological ability.

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But because it contains

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
DNA and RNA,

246
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it is considered

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
a living organism.

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So it is between

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
living and non-living.

250
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The virus itself

251
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
has no biological ability.

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It has to infect the cell.

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So when we

254
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
are outside,

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
we don't see

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the virus floating around.

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It will die if it is outside.

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It has to infect the cell.

259
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The reproduction rate

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
of bacteria or cells

261
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
is 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8.

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If we look at

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the reproduction rate,

264
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
we will find that it is a log curve.

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
When it reaches a certain level

266
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
of oxygen or space,

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
it will start to die.

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is the growth curve

269
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that a normal cell should have.

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But the virus is very different.

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It is made up of

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
a lot of DNA and RNA

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
in our cells.

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There are also a lot of

275
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
shell proteins.

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It is a bit like a factory

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that produces parts.

278
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
When it is ready to ship,

279
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
it will assemble everything.

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So if we look at

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
the virus in the patient's blood,

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
we will find that

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the virus in the patient's blood

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
will decrease at first

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
because the virus is all in the cell.

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So we can't detect it.

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
In the second stage,

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
when the virus is in the cell

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and it is producing these parts,

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
we will feel like

291
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the virus is all in the cell.

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
When it is ready to ship,

293
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
it will release it all at once.

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So it is like an explosion.

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is why patients

296
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
who are infected with the virus

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
sometimes feel like

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
they are fine and

299
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
there are no symptoms.

300
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But suddenly,

301
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
they are very weak

302
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
because the virus

303
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
is all out.

304
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is the difference

305
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
between A, B, C, D, E, and G.

306
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There are many kinds of

307
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
hepatitis B virus.

308
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
In fact,

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
most people are studying A to E.

310
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
A and E

311
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
are eating something

312
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that is not clean.

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They are eating something

314
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that is contaminated by the virus.

315
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
A and E are all sick.

316
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They will be fine after a few weeks.

317
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But B, C, D,

318
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
they will all

319
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
be infected.

320
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
As you can see,

321
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
when the virus is still

322
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
hiding in our cells,

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
this is called the incubation period.

324
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
At this stage,

325
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
our cells

326
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
do not detect

327
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
any foreign matter inside.

328
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Then it can escape our immune system.

329
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This is why some

330
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
virus infections

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
eventually lead to hepatitis B.

332
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It is hiding in our cells.

333
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hepatitis C virus

334
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
has an incubation period,

335
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but it can also become hepatitis B.

336
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hepatitis B can eventually

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
turn into liver cancer.

338
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Not every virus

339
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
can turn into liver cancer.

340
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So,

341
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the current

342
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
hepatitis C virus

343
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
is still very common

344
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
in the world.

345
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Many researchers

346
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
are still studying it.

347
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Hepatitis C is an RNA virus.

348
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Simply put,

349
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
when it infects cells,

350
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
it will decompose.

351
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Then the RNA

352
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
will come out.

353
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The first thing it does

354
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
is to rob

355
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the protein

356
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
in our cells.

357
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It is called the intracranial network.

358
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
After it robs the protein,

359
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
it is like saying,

360
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
don't make cell proteins anymore,

361
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
virus proteins

362
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
are made in large quantities.

363
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Large amounts of virus proteins

364
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
will help it make more virus RNA.

365
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
More virus RNA

366
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
will make more virus proteins.

367
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is how

368
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
a lot of RNA and protein

369
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
are made in our cells.

370
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Finally, it is assembled

371
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and released in one breath.

372
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Many studies have found that

373
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
HCV's RNA

374
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
copies are on the membrane.

375
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There are many kinds of RNA in our cells.

376
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Sorry, I have a question.

377
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Can I interrupt you?

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Or do you want to

379
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
ask one question at a time?

380
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You can interrupt me,

381
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
but there will be lag.

382
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
My question is

383
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
this.

384
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
My question is

385
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
this.

386
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I see.

387
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
My question is

388
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you said that

389
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
this thing will go in

390
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and remove this

391
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and do this.

392
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It sounds very smooth

393
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and like an animation.

394
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I am curious

395
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
about this.

396
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Is it from some data

397
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
or can it be

398
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
visualized?

399
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Actually, there are many steps.

400
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Visualizing is one of them.

401
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
For example, someone

402
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
can see that

403
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
the virus particles

404
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
are on the surface of our cells.

405
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
They can also see that

406
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
the cell membrane goes in

407
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and the virus is eaten.

408
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is visualized.

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
However, in the research of

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
molecular biology,

411
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
we can't just see it.

412
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It may be an accident.

413
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We can see that

414
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the surface of our cells

415
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
also contains some proteins.

416
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The virus uses

417
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
its own protein to interact

418
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
with the protein on the surface of our cells.

419
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It is like a door

420
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
that opens a key.

421
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It goes in.

422
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
This is an interesting point.

423
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why does the surface of our cells

424
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
have proteins to let the virus

425
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
combine?

426
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It is similar to rice.

427
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
After many years of evolution,

428
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
it has found a way

429
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to enter our cells.

430
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The protein on the surface of the cell

431
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is not specifically for the virus.

432
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It also has its own function.

433
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The virus

434
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
uses the protein function

435
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
to let it enter the cell.

436
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Of course,

437
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
the whole process

438
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
also has a lot of proteins

439
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
in it.

440
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If all of them are drawn,

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
there will be a lot of proteins in it.

442
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is the result of evolution.

443
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The control proteins

444
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
are not drawn in the soil.

445
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Does this answer your question?

446
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I have a question.

447
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Please ask.

448
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, thank you.

449
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You said that

450
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
RNA

451
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
allows cells

452
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to produce protein.

453
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Does it also produce

454
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
more RNA?

455
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I forgot

456
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the name.

457
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Can it produce

458
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
protein and RNA at the same time?

459
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It is like this.

460
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is called

461
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
an intracranial network.

462
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This function is specifically for protein.

463
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
After the protein of the virus

464
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
is produced,

465
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
the RNA of the virus

466
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is produced on the other membrane.

467
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What is the other membrane?

468
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is what everyone is studying.

469
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Our lab found that

470
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it is made on the

471
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
autophagy membrane.

472
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Some membranes are responsible for protein.

473
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Some membranes are responsible for RNA.

474
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
After making a lot of them,

475
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
we put them together

476
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and throw them out of the cell.

477
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The process of throwing them out of the cell

478
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
is like HCV.

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It is actually

480
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
a virus that

481
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
has not broken the cell.

482
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Some viruses

483
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
will break the cell.

484
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It means that

485
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
when it goes out,

486
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it will kill the cell.

487
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This will kill the cell

488
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and make our body weaker.

489
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It is like your body's cells

490
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
keep dying.

491
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Killing cells is not very powerful.

492
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It means that once it kills

493
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
your host,

494
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
it will die.

495
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It is like Ebola.

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It will kill people.

497
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
As long as you isolate

498
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
those people,

499
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
they will be fine.

500
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
HCV or HIV

501
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
will cause AIDS.

502
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It will lurk

503
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and not kill you.

504
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It can exist in the natural world

505
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
for a long time.

506
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Does this answer your question?

507
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Thank you.

508
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I have a question

509
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
about that page.

510
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This one?

511
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes.

512
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This page is...

513
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I thought

514
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the growth of cells

515
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
is exponential.

516
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So it starts with

517
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
log and then becomes exponential.

518
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It starts with lag phase

519
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and then log phase.

520
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Of course,

521
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
our cells cannot

522
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
keep growing

523
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
because of space and nutrients.

524
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So when it reaches a critical point,

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it will enter

526
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the death phase.

527
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is how

528
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
the life cycle of cells

529
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
looks like.

530
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If it doesn't die,

531
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
it will become cancer.

532
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I see.

533
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So the virus has

534
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
a mathematical

535
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
growth

536
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
or something else?

537
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Actually, every virus

538
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
is different.

539
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
For example,

540
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
let's take a look at

541
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the flu virus.

542
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
We have heard about

543
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
H5N1 before.

544
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's because

545
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
it has

546
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
9 RNAs.

547
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Each RNA

548
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
will produce

549
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
different RNAs.

550
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So it will produce

551
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
9 different RNAs.

552
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
For example,

553
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
the 9 RNAs must be

554
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
mass-produced.

555
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
When it is packed,

556
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
the 9 RNAs must be packed.

557
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So it may catch the wrong 9 RNAs.

558
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
For example,

559
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the number of RNAs

560
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

561
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Then the virus will die.

562
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The number of RNAs produced

563
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and the number of RNAs packed

564
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
are different.

565
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So

566
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
we can't

567
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
calculate

568
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
the number of RNAs

569
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
in a mathematical way.

570
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There are many accidents

571
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
such as mutation

572
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
or wrong packing.

573
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But we can't

574
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
figure out the exact number.

575
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We can only use the approximate number.

576
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's hard to explain.

577
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The reason why we do

578
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
HCV and autophagy

579
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
is that

580
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
we have a cell

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that is infected.

582
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is a cell

583
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
infected with HCV.

584
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We found that the green bubbles

585
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
are the autophagy bubbles.

586
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Why do we know

587
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
these green bubbles?

588
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because we mentioned that

589
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the marker of autophagosome

590
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
is LC3.

591
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So we can detect

592
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
the LC3 of the cell.

593
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
When you see LC3,

594
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
it means it is autophagosome.

595
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So if we can see

596
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
the LC3 in the cell with HCV,

597
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
it means the cell is doing autophagy.

598
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This is the process

599
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
of infection.

600
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I mainly want to show the below one.

601
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The darker the color is,

602
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
it means more and more.

603
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It means under the infection of HCV,

604
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
the LC3

605
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
will be more and more.

606
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It means

607
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the autophagosome

608
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
bubbles are more and more.

609
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
PCC2, as we mentioned before,

610
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
will be separated at this stage.

611
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So we can see

612
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
it will be separated at the end.

613
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It means the autophagosome

614
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
will be completed

615
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
in the cell of HCV infection.

616
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Let me

617
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
introduce the meaning of these two methods.

618
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
In the cell dye,

619
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
we can design

620
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
what we often hear,

621
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
gene engineering.

622
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It is the DNA outside the body

623
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that we can design at will.

624
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
For example,

625
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
we want the gene series

626
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
to be put in.

627
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The DNA series will be put in.

628
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then we put the protein gene

629
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
that we want to show.

630
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
After the DNA RNA makes the protein,

631
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
the protein will be green.

632
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
How to make it green?

633
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We send the DNA

634
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
from outside the cell

635
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
to the cell.

636
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
The DNA makes RNA and becomes protein.

637
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Then we can see

638
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
the green protein in the cell.

639
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So

640
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
like this picture,

641
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
because of this protein,

642
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
we let it receive

643
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
a green protein

644
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
behind it or in front of it.

645
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So it will be bright.

646
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Otherwise, the cell itself will not be bright.

647
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What if

648
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the protein is not bright?

649
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Because

650
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
not every protein we want to send

651
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
from outside the cell.

652
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
After all, sending from outside the cell

653
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
is an artificial method.

654
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We can assume that

655
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
this is a wave.

656
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The cells on the wave

657
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
have the protein we want.

658
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Then we can use the antibody to recognize it.

659
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is the first antibody.

660
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Every antibody

661
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
will only recognize one target.

662
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
This is a very transferable thing.

663
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So if you have an A protein now,

664
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
you have to use the A antibody to recognize it.

665
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
This Y-shaped thing

666
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
is the antibody.

667
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Its head is the target

668
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
we want to recognize.

669
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's very transferable.

670
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But its tail

671
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
is almost the same

672
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
as everyone else's.

673
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So we can use the second antibody

674
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
to recognize this butt.

675
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Then the second antibody's butt

676
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
will receive a bright thing.

677
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We use this method to detect

678
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
some non-bright proteins.

679
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Then you might ask,

680
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
why don't you just take the first antibody's butt

681
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and receive a bright thing?

682
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We have tens of millions

683
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
of proteins.

684
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If you have to design

685
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
an antibody for every protein,

686
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and its tail has to emit green light,

687
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
red light, or blue light,

688
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
then you have to make a protein

689
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
every time.

690
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's a waste of money.

691
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So you can imagine

692
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
that the second antibody

693
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
is a transferable tool.

694
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It can recognize

695
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
all the

696
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
second antibody's butt.

697
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So if you want to study other proteins,

698
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
you only need to change the first antibody.

699
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You can use the same second antibody

700
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
to make it glow.

701
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The so-called glow

702
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
is like the cell dye we just saw.

703
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If we want to see

704
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
how bright the protein is,

705
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
if we look at the cell dye,

706
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
we can adjust the light

707
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
to make the color

708
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
look bright or dark.

709
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
This is not

710
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
credible.

711
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's just to see

712
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
where the cell is,

713
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
but it's more or less.

714
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We still have to do it in other ways.

715
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
This method

716
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
is to briefly introduce

717
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
that the middle piece is a cabbage corner.

718
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If you haven't eaten cabbage when you were a kid,

719
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
it's probably like that.

720
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That thing

721
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
looks like a solid to us,

722
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
but for a small molecule,

723
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
the holes in it

724
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
are very large.

725
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Each protein has electricity.

726
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So after charging,

727
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
the protein we take out of the cell

728
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
is the protein of all cells.

729
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We want to separate it.

730
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
After running the electric current,

731
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
the smaller protein

732
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
will run farther.

733
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
For example, if we add protein from here,

734
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
it will run to the back

735
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
after passing the electric current.

736
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
The larger protein will be stuck on top.

737
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So using this method

738
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
can separate a lot of proteins

739
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
from large to small.

740
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Because the cabbage corner

741
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
can't do more experiments,

742
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
so we have to run it again

743
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and lay it down.

744
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The cabbage corner was made of paper.

745
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Then lay it down

746
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and run the electric current

747
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
to print it on the membrane below.

748
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It can be imagined that it is a piece of paper.

749
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Although its material is not paper.

750
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
On this piece of paper,

751
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
there will be

752
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
proteins arranged from large to small.

753
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
If you want to measure

754
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
the protein position here,

755
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
add it to the antigen

756
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and add another antigen

757
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
to make it glow.

758
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Then we can detect the signal.

759
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The so-called detection signal

760
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
is a traditional method of using a film.

761
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It is the kind of film that everyone knows.

762
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
We know that when there is light,

763
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the film will turn black.

764
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This means that the more protein,

765
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the more light it receives.

766
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
The more antibodies it receives,

767
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the brighter it glows,

768
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
the darker it gets.

769
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So if we go back to this,

770
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
this means

771
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
that there is very little protein.

772
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Then the one on the right

773
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
means that it has a lot of protein.

774
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So we can use this method

775
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
to separate the various proteins

776
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
in the cell

777
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
from large to small

778
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and then use antibodies to detect

779
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
how much it performs.

780
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Back to HCV and autophagy.

781
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
There has been research

782
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
that HCV's RNA

783
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
copies will be on the membrane.

784
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
There are so many membranes

785
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
in our cells.

786
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What membrane does it use?

787
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Our lab found that

788
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
it uses the autophagy membrane.

789
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Where does the autophagy

790
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
make so many steps and so many membranes?

791
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
First of all,

792
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
this is also an electromagnetic map.

793
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You can see the curved

794
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
phagophore in the cell.

795
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It looks like this.

796
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Then it will be assembled

797
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
into a circle,

798
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
which is autophagosome.

799
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I just said

800
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
that it may not be true when the eyes see it.

801
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It may just happen to be

802
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
put together.

803
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So we really have to prove that it will be

804
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
integrated together.

805
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
As mentioned earlier,

806
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
we put the ATG5,

807
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
which is specialized

808
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
to label the

809
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
phagophore

810
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
marker.

811
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
ATG5

812
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
means phagophore.

813
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We send the DNA

814
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
with green light

815
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
to the cell.

816
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It will show the ATG5

817
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
with green light.

818
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The ATG5 will run to the membrane.

819
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Simply put,

820
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
the phagophore in this cell

821
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
will be green.

822
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
We use red light for the other cell.

823
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The phagophore in this cell

824
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
will be red.

825
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
If these two membranes

826
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
are combined,

827
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
it will turn yellow light.

828
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
If not, you will see

829
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
red or green.

830
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So we use this method

831
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to see if these two membranes

832
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
will assemble

833
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and turn yellow light.

834
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
This picture

835
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
may be a little small.

836
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't know if you can see it.

837
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
When our cell

838
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
is under pressure,

839
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
for example, starvation,

840
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
it will make the cell

841
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
starved or

842
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
infected by the virus.

843
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The autophagy will start to occur.

844
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Then we can see

845
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
the ATG5

846
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
phagophore formation.

847
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We can see

848
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the yellow dots

849
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
on the membrane.

850
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
These are yellow dots.

851
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
These are all yellow dots.

852
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
This means that

853
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
in the HCV-infected cell,

854
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
the membrane will

855
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
be

856
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
fused together

857
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
into a

858
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
circle bubble.

859
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It won't be fused

860
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
with the membrane.

861
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It will be controlled by the protein.

862
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
This is just an example of

863
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
how the protein controls the

864
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
fusion of the membrane.

865
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Some proteins will

866
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
run to the A membrane.

867
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The B membrane

868
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
may also have another protein.

869
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
These proteins

870
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
interact

871
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
to pull the two membranes

872
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
together

873
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and cause them to fuse.

874
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It depends on the protein

875
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to fuse them together.

876
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We found that

877
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
there is a protein called

878
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
syntax-insider.

879
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It will

880
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
fuse the membrane

881
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
together.

882
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
In order to prove

883
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
the function of a protein,

884
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
the simplest way is to

885
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
show it or not.

886
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
For example,

887
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
you suspect a protein

888
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
to do something.

889
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
In order to prove

890
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
the function of the protein,

891
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the simplest way is to

892
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
remove the protein.

893
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
If the protein is removed,

894
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
the function of the protein

895
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
will not occur.

896
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
How can we

897
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
prevent the protein from

898
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
functioning?

899
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
We designed some RNAs

900
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and sent them

901
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
to the cell.

902
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The point is

903
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
that the RNA

904
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
we designed

905
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
will target the

906
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
RNA we don't want it to show.

907
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Then it will

908
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
cut off the RNA.

909
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
We just said that

910
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
DNA makes RNA,

911
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
RNA makes protein.

912
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
If we let a gene's RNA

913
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
be cut off,

914
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
it can't make protein.

915
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
This is just a technique.

916
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
This technique is to

917
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
prevent the protein we want

918
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
from being made.

919
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We can see that

920
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
ATG5

921
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
is the marker

922
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
on the membrane.

923
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We can also see that

924
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Syntaxin7

925
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
is the protein that

926
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
will merge the membrane.

927
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The green one is the membrane,

928
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and the red one is the protein

929
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
that will merge the membrane.

930
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
We can see that

931
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Syntaxin7

932
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
is really

933
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
on the membrane.

934
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Next,

935
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
we use

936
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
the method of

937
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
red and green membrane.

938
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
In the cell of

939
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
HCV,

940
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
the red and green membrane

941
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
will be merged.

942
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We can see the yellow dots.

943
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
But when we show

944
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
the protein,

945
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
there are no yellow dots.

946
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This means that

947
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
the existence of this protein

948
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
is important for

949
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
the green and red membrane

950
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
to be merged.

951
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Without it, the membrane won't be merged.

952
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Next,

953
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
if the membrane is not merged,

954
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
it is useless.

955
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
This method is called

956
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
membrane flotation.

957
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This means that

958
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
we take out all the protein

959
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
in the cell,

960
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and use a different concentration of sugar.

961
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
At the bottom is 80% of sugar water.

962
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It is almost a piece of water.

963
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The higher it is,

964
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
the thinner the sugar.

965
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
After going through a super high speed reaction,

966
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the lighter protein will float to the top.

967
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
We just said that the membrane is

968
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
some fat.

969
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It is very light.

970
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It will float to the top.

971
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
We want to

972
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
separate the structure

973
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
of the membrane.

974
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We don't want to mix with others.

975
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
We just want to take this membrane.

976
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
We found that

977
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
this is too complicated.

978
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
In short,

979
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
after we separate

980
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the structure of the membrane,

981
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
we found that

982
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
the independent membrane

983
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
is broken.

984
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Even if it is not

985
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
synthesized into a circle,

986
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
it has a way to

987
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
reproduce the HCV RNA.

988
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This may be easier to understand

989
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
later.

990
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
In other words,

991
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
the structure of

992
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
ATG5

993
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
is enough to support

994
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
the reproduction of HCV RNA.

995
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We can also see

996
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
from another result

997
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
that LC3,

998
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
B and C

999
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
are virus proteins.

1000
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We can see that

1001
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
the virus protein

1002
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
is on LC3.

1003
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
This means that

1004
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
we let LC3 glow,

1005
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
we let the virus protein glow,

1006
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
and then we put the image

1007
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
together.

1008
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We found that

1009
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the signal is at the same point.

1010
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It means that it is there.

1011
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
This is the structure of

1012
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
the virus RNA.

1013
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It is also on LC3.

1014
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
There are virus proteins

1015
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and virus RNA on LC3.

1016
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We also found that

1017
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
HCV not only uses

1018
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
the membrane

1019
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
to reproduce,

1020
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
it also uses the entire membrane

1021
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
to reproduce.

1022
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
To make a simple diagram,

1023
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
when the phagophore

1024
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
is made,

1025
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
it needs to rely on

1026
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
SYN7 to

1027
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
combine them together

1028
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
to form a circle.

1029
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We found that

1030
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
HCV can reproduce

1031
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
on these three membranes.

1032
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But

1033
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
ATG5 will

1034
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
decompose the protein

1035
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
at the end.

1036
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
What happens at the end?

1037
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
If it starts to decompose the protein,

1038
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
it is not good for the virus

1039
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and the virus will

1040
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
try to stop

1041
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the process.

1042
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
How does it stop?

1043
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
We use another

1044
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
LC3

1045
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
that emits red light and green light.

1046
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
When it is at the phagophore stage,

1047
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
because it emits red light and green light,

1048
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
we see that it is yellow.

1049
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
When it is

1050
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
merged with the last step

1051
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
to become autolysosome,

1052
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
the green light will be decomposed

1053
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
but the red light will remain.

1054
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
This is actually a cell observation method.

1055
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
When you see yellow,

1056
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
it means that it is still in autolysosome.

1057
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
When you see red,

1058
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
it means that it has entered the last stage.

1059
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Look at this diagram.

1060
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
When it is still at this stage,

1061
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
it will be yellow.

1062
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
If it enters the last step

1063
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
to decompose the protein,

1064
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
it will turn red.

1065
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
In the case of virus infection,

1066
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
from 6 hours to 12 hours,

1067
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
one day to two days,

1068
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
we can see that

1069
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it is always yellow.

1070
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Until the 24th hour, it is still yellow.

1071
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It means that it is still at this stage

1072
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
until the 24th hour.

1073
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It is always very late.

1074
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It becomes red after two days

1075
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and enters the last stage.

1076
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
What mechanism keeps it

1077
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
at this stage,

1078
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the autolysosome stage,

1079
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
instead of entering the last stage?

1080
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
There are two proteins.

1081
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
One is Rubicon.

1082
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Rubicon's performance rises first.

1083
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
UV-REG's performance

1084
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
rises later.

1085
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What are these two proteins doing?

1086
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It is easier to explain with a diagram.

1087
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
In general,

1088
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the function of UV-REG

1089
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
is to let these two moles

1090
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
merge,

1091
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
that is, the autolysosome and the lysosome

1092
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
merge to enter the last stage.

1093
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But at the beginning of the virus infection,

1094
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
it will let Rubicon

1095
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
perform a lot.

1096
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It will squeeze out UV-REG.

1097
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
This protein is

1098
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
specifically for this fusion

1099
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
not to happen.

1100
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
If it doesn't happen,

1101
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
a lot of autolysosome moles

1102
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
will accumulate.

1103
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The more moles,

1104
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
the happier the virus will be.

1105
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Because it can reproduce with these moles.

1106
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It wants these moles.

1107
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It doesn't want them to merge

1108
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But at the late stage

1109
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
of the infection,

1110
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
it may not be able to stop it.

1111
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
UV-REG will come back.

1112
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It will squeeze out Rubicon again.

1113
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It will let this fusion

1114
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
continue.

1115
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
At the end,

1116
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
because it can no longer stop

1117
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
the fusion of these moles,

1118
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
it will use other moles.

1119
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
This is the experiment of others.

1120
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It has nothing to do with our lab.

1121
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Our lab has reached this stage.

1122
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
When HCV is infected,

1123
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it will trigger

1124
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
the occurrence of autolysosome.

1125
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It will produce

1126
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
this membrane.

1127
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Cytosine 7 will let

1128
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
these moles merge

1129
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
into a complete circle.

1130
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It can reproduce on this membrane.

1131
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It doesn't want this membrane

1132
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
to merge

1133
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
at the last stage.

1134
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So that it can have

1135
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
endless moles to attack

1136
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and reproduce.

1137
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That's about it.

1138
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
This is the research

1139
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I did in our lab.

1140
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
This is a very basic

1141
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
research on molecular biology.

1142
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Basically,

1143
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
we haven't done

1144
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
any clinical trials

1145
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
on how to treat this virus.

1146
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Our job is

1147
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
to see

1148
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
what happens

1149
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
after the virus infects the cell.

1150
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Then we control the protein

1151
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
so that it can reproduce.

1152
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Okay.

1153
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm done.

1154
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I have a question.

1155
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Before we start

1156
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the Q&A,

1157
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
let's thank Linya for her speech.

1158
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Thank you.

1159
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
My question is

1160
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the protein...

1161
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Sorry.

1162
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm lagging.

1163
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You can continue.

1164
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The host is lagging.

1165
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The protein

1166
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
will make the membrane

1167
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
into a circle.

1168
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
How does it...

1169
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The protein

1170
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
is like a signal

1171
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
to make the membrane

1172
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
into a circle.

1173
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Or is it induced?

1174
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It can change the curvature

1175
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
of the membrane.

1176
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Let me find a picture.

1177
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I don't know if you can see it.

1178
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
On this membrane,

1179
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
there are some proteins.

1180
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
On the other membrane,

1181
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
there are some proteins.

1182
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
These two proteins

1183
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
cooperate

1184
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and mix together

1185
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to make the two membranes

1186
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
merge.

1187
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
As I mentioned,

1188
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
the protein

1189
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
of Synthase C7

1190
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
has a function

1191
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
that

1192
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
on the membrane,

1193
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
this and that

1194
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
mix together

1195
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to make the membrane

1196
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
merge with each other.

1197
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
This is what the protein

1198
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
is doing.

1199
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
The membrane that it will merge

1200
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
is not only the membrane we just mentioned.

1201
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It will also merge many other membranes.

1202
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
This series of

1203
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Synthase C7

1204
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
has 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8...

1205
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The whole series of proteins

1206
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
are all doing the

1207
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
membrane merging.

1208
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
There are many different types of membrane in the cell.

1209
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So different members

1210
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
are responsible for different membranes

1211
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
to merge together.

1212
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Does this answer your question?

1213
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yes, thank you.

1214
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So the protein is very large, right?

1215
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
If it wants to

1216
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
stir this...

1217
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Actually, they are all very small.

1218
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
The protein itself is actually quite small.

1219
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Mainly because

1220
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
the protein has a

1221
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
3D structure.

1222
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You can imagine your hand

1223
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
can be flat,

1224
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
but you can also bend it.

1225
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And you still have fingers.

1226
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You can interlock your fingers with others.

1227
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
If you hold it together, it will become a very small group.

1228
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The same goes for the protein.

1229
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
When it is doing what it should do,

1230
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
it may become a very small group

1231
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
when it is interlocked with others.

1232
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Because it merges closely together.

1233
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I understand. Thank you.

1234
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
There should be no more questions.

1235
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Am I talking too fast?

1236
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I have a question.

1237
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Did you hear that?

1238
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Yes, I did.

1239
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
My question is

1240
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
to confirm

1241
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
if I understand.

1242
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You said

1243
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
when you are infected

1244
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
by HCV,

1245
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I forgot the name.

1246
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
A purple and a blue protein.

1247
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The light blue one

1248
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
will be inhibited.

1249
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The purple one will come in.

1250
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So it can't be interlocked.

1251
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
From a pharmaceutical point of view,

1252
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
is it possible that

1253
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
in the middle stage,

1254
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I can make a lot of

1255
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
UV rays in the cell,

1256
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and it won't happen?

1257
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
This is the protein in the cell.

1258
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This is not the protein of the virus.

1259
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The protein in the cell

1260
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
has what it should do.

1261
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So if we

1262
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
target any protein

1263
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
in the cell

1264
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
to affect its performance,

1265
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
it may harm your cell.

1266
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So the virus is

1267
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
a bit like

1268
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
hijacking.

1269
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It hijacks

1270
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
the cell

1271
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
to do what it wants to do.

1272
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But if you say

1273
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
it will hijack the protein

1274
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
to do what it wants to do,

1275
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
we will eliminate the protein.

1276
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Then the virus can't be reproduced.

1277
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
This is because the virus

1278
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
has its own function in the cell.

1279
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
If you eliminate it,

1280
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
our cells may die first.

1281
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Hello? Can you hear me?

1282
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, I see.

1283
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
This is much more complicated than I thought.

1284
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yes, so in fact,

1285
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
from a pharmaceutical point of view,

1286
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
we have done a lot of

1287
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
protein things.

1288
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Do you have any questions?

1289
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I have a lag with you.

1290
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I have a lag with you.

1291
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I just heard it,

1292
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
so you can finish it.

1293
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
No, that's it.

1294
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Anyway, it is quite difficult

1295
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
to make medicine

1296
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
for protein.

1297
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You have to find a protein

1298
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
that only affects

1299
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
the virus

1300
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
but not the person.

1301
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But this is rare.

1302
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Protein is useless

1303
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
in our human body,

1304
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
but in terms of natural evolution,

1305
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
very few proteins are useless

1306
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
in our body.

1307
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Okay, any more questions?

1308
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I know I'm lagging,

1309
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
so when I heard that

1310
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
everyone had no questions,

1311
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it should have been a while.

1312
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
No, I don't think so.

1313
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Thank you.

1314
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Thank you.

1315
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Okay, we are done.

1316
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Thank you again, Linya.

1317
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Thank you.

1318
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That's all for

1319
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
our talk today.

1320
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Bye-bye.
