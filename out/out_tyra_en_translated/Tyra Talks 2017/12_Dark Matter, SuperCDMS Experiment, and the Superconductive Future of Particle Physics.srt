1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
F

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, I forgot

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Share

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Share screen

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Wow

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dark Matter Super CDMS

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
which is what I'm doing right now

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and the Super Conductive Future

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
of Particle Physics

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which is

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
what I'm doing right now

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, next page

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The topic I'm going to talk about today

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
will be divided into two parts

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The first part is

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the physical part

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to talk about Dark Matter

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which is mainly

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
focused on

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the direct detection

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
part of the experiment

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What is its physics?

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is the current

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
state of the field?

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is everyone's goal? What are the difficulties?

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How to do this experiment? How to measure this thing?

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It should be more reliable

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and more interesting

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The second part will be my own work

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which is quite R&D

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
People who are interested in

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
technology may be more interested

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But it should be very related

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My screen is a bit laggy

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
First of all, because we have already

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
introduced it before

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What is

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the basic example

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of a

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
model and a theoretical basis

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So I'm going to talk about it very quickly

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So basically

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Can you see my mouse?

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can you see my mouse?

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can you see it?

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There are many basic examples

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We think these basic examples

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
are the basic materials

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we know

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in the universe

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because of some reasons

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
we think there are still things in the universe

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that we don't know

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We can't use this model to explain

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But anyway, this is called Standard Model

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It is the best description

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you are

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
interested in this

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can look it up on Wikipedia

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are six quarks

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
three leptons

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
neutrinos

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and X

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The point I want to talk about today

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
will focus on

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the ones you can see on the screen

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The red one is a mole

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The blue one is a neutrino

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Basically, this is

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the most important example for us

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Because honestly, in life

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the most important thing is

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the things you are interested in

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the things you breathe

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and the things that make up you

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
These are the only two

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sorry, there are electrons

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
These are the three

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There is another important one

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The white ghost

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It is called light

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It sounds very mysterious

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
like a laser gun

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
these things

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
exchange light like baseball

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and they will

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
reach the energy balance

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Basically, the heat balance

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
After reaching the heat balance

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
everything will have a black hole

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is very important

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because my family often ask me

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is dark matter a black hole?

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Actually, it is not

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You will know why

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It is very vague

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is the universe we usually see

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
When we look at it

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the whole universe is black

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then you will say

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why do we think

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
everything is the matter we know

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and it will exchange light

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
like a baseball

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is actually

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the universe we see

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
with a good instrument

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Like this

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The whole universe is basically bright

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The different colors

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
are basically the same as the black hole

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It corresponds to different temperatures

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You see the brightest one in the middle

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It is the galactic plane

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There are many planets

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and a lot of energy

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So there will be a lot of energy

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My mouse

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay, you see the back

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This part is very red

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The energy here is very low

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It only has a foreground

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It only has a background

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The background is the whole background of the universe

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It is very cold

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It is only 3 degrees K

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But basically it has a temperature

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we can still see it

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This picture is basically

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
filled with colors

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How can we say there is any dark matter

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
that we don't know

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let me see the next page

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because there was a very wise man

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He said

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Vader was seduced by

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The dark side of the force

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The dark side of the force

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The force is what gives Jedi his power

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's an energy field

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
created by all living things

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It surrounds us

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It permits us

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It binds the galaxy together

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It sounds very confusing

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know what he is talking about

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I will focus on it

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The dark side of the force

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Behind the galaxy together

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This sentence is probably

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
from 1976

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So you can imagine

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
this is the era when we started to

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
be interested in dark matter

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This statement is correct

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We started to be interested in dark matter

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Actually

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What did Obeah Kenobi mean by this?

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This means

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's a picture here

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The brightest place is

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the center of our galaxy

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then the horizontal axis

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is the distance from the center of the galaxy to the outside

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The vertical axis is

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the particle

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
in that position

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The speed of rotation around the center of the galaxy

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then you can see

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the yellow data

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The yellow data is

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the stars over there

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, like the sun

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So we can see those stars

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
are moving

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then we can see

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the center of the yellow data

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
is the galaxy

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That is

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the size of the galaxy

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
300 years ago

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Then we found

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
we can keep looking out

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
according to the

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
dark radiation

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We can see the infrared

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then we can see

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the blue hyperfine structure

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The blue dot

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
is the light source

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
of the moon

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can keep pushing

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to the outside

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
the position of 50,000 light years

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It can be connected

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is what we know

214
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the size of a galaxy

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then we can see

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the speed of

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the particles

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
we see

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We can

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There is a point

222
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
According to the theory of relativity

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It is basically Newton's law

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
According to

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the traditional law we know

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can guess

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We just see the speed

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We can guess

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
the speed of rotation

230
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
around the orbit

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So we get

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
the following line

233
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But actually

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
we observe

236
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the speed of rotation is the line above

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
you will find

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
the speed of rotation

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
is the speed of the line above

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The actual weight of the orbit

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is much more than

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
what we can see

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay

246
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So we really can't see it

247
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In the 1980s

248
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's because

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
our instrumentation is not good enough

250
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We can't see anything

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay

252
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So there were some

253
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
disputes about dark matter

254
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then

255
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
in the 1980s and 1990s

256
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
we started to know

257
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that everything we can see is almost right

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So we started to think

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
whether the particles we know

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
can meet this nature

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The answer is yes

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There are three kinds of particles

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
called neutrons

264
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There are three kinds of particles

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
called neutrons

266
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
They do have this nature

267
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But the neutrons we know

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is the point

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Some people think we don't know neutrons

270
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The neutrons we already know

271
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
basically

272
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
have something to do

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
with the particles

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
we already know

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because particles and neutrons

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
have something to do with the ratio

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When they change,

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
they will use it

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So according to all the stars we observed

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Those stars are all neutrons

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We can infer

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
how many neutrons there are

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Can it

284
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
cover

285
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
our missing mass budget

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The answer is that it can't exceed 6%

287
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It can't exceed 6%

288
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay

289
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So basically we think

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
it might be new physics

291
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The answer is that it shouldn't, right?

292
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because the quality you see

293
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is a virtual line

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So if I have more

295
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
missing mass

296
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think it will fit the original data

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So when you plot the upper line

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How do you know

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
when you have more missing mass?

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let me write a book

301
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Is it easier to plot like this?

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's say the middle part is symmetric

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We can think of it as the middle part

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh

306
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's the

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
transverse speed

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes

309
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh no

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's the speed of rotation

311
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So you can see

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The real speed

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
is a few hundred

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
kilometers per second

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So it's really slow

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So basically

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
it's a neutron

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It doesn't have to be close to the speed of light

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This number is a bit important

321
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Actually Darkmatter

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
has a lot of clues

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I won't say it's evidence

324
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So there are a lot of clues

325
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This clue is actually

326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the most suspicious

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It has a lot of reasons not to think like this

328
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But Darkmatter has a lot of other

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
clues

330
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If you are interested, you can ask

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But basically this is the most important to us

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay

333
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Anyway

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We need to have additional

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
quality to generate additional benefits

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Or somehow

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
your theory needs to generate additional benefits

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
to explain this question

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you have any questions for Darkmatter?

340
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Then I'll jump straight to

342
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is an interesting article

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've seen recently

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And I think

345
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you should know better than me

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You should know who this is

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah

350
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This is the latest

351
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
CERN Courier

352
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
article

353
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I magnified the point

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I still have a citation

356
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So I magnified the citation

357
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It says

358
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Let's see where to start

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay

360
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's see

361
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It

362
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's see

363
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It should be here

364
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It says

365
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
EPR pair

366
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
referred to

367
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
EPR pair

368
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
referred to ER Einstein Rosenbridge

369
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and one part that connects the two parts of

370
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the black hole geometry

371
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This idea is

372
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
brought by many theorists

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
in particular

374
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
in the context of ADS-CFT

375
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
correspondence

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's look back

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The point is

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The problem with this theory is

380
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think it's motivated by

381
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
what I just said

382
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So it can work

383
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
in galaxy scale

384
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But the problem is

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
it can't

386
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
or it's not good enough

387
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
in phenomenology

388
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to work

389
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to estimate

390
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
larger scale

391
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
For example,

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
what I just said is a galaxy

393
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and it will have

394
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
a modified gravity effect

395
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But the problem is

396
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
we have another observation

397
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
that if there are two galaxies

398
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and these two galaxies

399
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
all have a

400
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
dark matter

401
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and they contrast

402
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
we can see the interaction

403
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
of two matter-like things

404
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
dark matter and non-dark matter

405
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This kind of local

406
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and dynamic behavior

407
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
is not a good way to explain

408
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What it's doing now is

409
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
if it's a whole universe

410
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
in the early universe

411
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
it will have a modified CMB

412
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
which is cosmic background radiation

413
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Can it work?

414
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay

415
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I actually made up another part

416
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How would

417
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
emergent gravity affect

418
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the physics?

419
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Someone asked me

420
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There are many different explanations

421
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
such as extra dimension

422
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
EREPR

423
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
or modified gravity

424
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Modified Newtonian Dynamics

425
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's a standard name

426
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But why do we want to do dark matter?

427
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think the reason is simple

428
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
because dark matter can be done

429
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Even if you

430
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
don't think it's a good

431
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
theory

432
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But it's important

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
to prove it

434
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's why we're doing this

435
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I would say it's hard to do

436
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But someone is thinking

437
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
For example, microgravity

438
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
or some light experiments

439
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Well

440
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Jingjie

441
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think you know better than me

442
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So I don't know much

443
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Can there be special

444
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
kind of

445
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's what he meant

446
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Right?

447
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So I just imagined

448
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If there is an extra dimension

449
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Contact

450
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Then your

451
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
3 plus 1

452
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
will be equal to

453
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the size of

454
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
the contact white space

455
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So if you

456
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
make it bigger or smaller

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
it's more likely to be

458
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
stronger than outside

459
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But it's related to

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the size of

461
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the compactified dimension

462
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Right?

463
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If the size is not

464
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
a constant

465
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
or here is this big

466
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
or here is this big

467
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Then it means that in different places

468
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the size will be different

469
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think it's possible

470
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Jingjie, I don't know

471
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
how they do it

472
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But the point is

473
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's what he said

474
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Then

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I think I'll just jump back

476
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
from here

477
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Where did I talk about?

478
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
OK

479
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Actually, the more interesting thing is

480
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that

481
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
if anyone is interested in

482
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
other kinds of

483
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
prediction

484
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Right?

485
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There are all kinds of observations

486
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So

487
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
we just talked about

488
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the missing mass

489
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So

490
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
what you see now

491
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is our Milky Way

492
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This is what we think is the Milky Way

493
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The Milky Way we see

494
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Then next to it, I help you zoom in

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's our solar system

496
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Then we go around the sun

497
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So the Earth is in the third one

498
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
OK

499
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Why is this important?

500
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Because we do experiments on the Earth

501
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So you know why it's important

502
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The picture in the upper left corner

503
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
is to say that this is not a special phenomenon

504
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That is to say

505
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
only our Milky Way Galaxy has

506
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because a lot of people thought

507
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
you would observe this

508
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Is it because we are in the Milky Way?

509
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So we are in the Milky Way

510
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The Milky Way is not in the center

511
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's on the side

512
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And then you have to correct it

513
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's like you've been going around

514
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
A constant change

515
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
OK

516
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Is there a problem with this experiment?

517
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But this thing

518
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
is basically a

519
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A whole observation

520
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
in the 1970s

521
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
completely broken

522
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Vera Rubin

523
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This person later won the Presidential Prize

524
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He observed a lot of galaxies

525
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There are such phenomena

526
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So what you see in the upper left corner

527
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
is what I said

528
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The speed of the rotation

529
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's really flat

530
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But if you

531
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
r² gm² is equal to r²mv²

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In fact, it should be

533
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Is it the opposite of once r?

534
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It will keep going down

535
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Equals once

536
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
v² will be the opposite of r

537
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
v² will be the opposite of r

538
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So we really think

539
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What should the universe look like?

540
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It should look like this

541
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a little bit laggy

542
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There is a halo

543
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Something like a light cloud

544
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
OK, so this thing is called Dark Matter Halo

545
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And then we're in that

546
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So we've been constantly

547
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
in Dark Matter Halo

548
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Movement is being soaked in

549
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It feels like you're being soaked in

550
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I have a question

551
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That is to say

552
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How big is the curve?

553
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
How big is the scale?

554
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The effect will come out slowly

555
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because you're looking at a galaxy scale

556
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
For example, the scale of the solar system

557
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Or the scale of the galaxy

558
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It will have a similar curve

559
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
When you draw it out

560
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is it the same?

561
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I forgot to put that thing

562
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This is very interesting

563
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You can ask a question

564
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How long does it take for us to go around the sun?

565
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
One year, right?

566
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How long does it take for us to go around the galaxy?

567
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
How long does it take for us to go around the galaxy?

568
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
OK, basically

569
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's no life

570
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Can feel the difference

571
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So you can imagine

572
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We are in a

573
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
In the center of the galaxy

574
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The origin of the coordinate

575
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Around the sun

576
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Local rotation

577
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Can you?

578
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So basically in this Dark Matter Halo

579
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We are actually in a fixed position

580
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
In that very local place

581
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Keep turning

582
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So what do you get in the end?

583
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You will get

584
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If you measure the local

585
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The speed of the Halo

586
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I mean

587
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Dark Matter

588
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Wait a minute

589
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You just asked about the speed of the planet

590
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
OK

591
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Let me tell you

592
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The earth itself

593
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The speed of rotation around the sun

594
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This measurement

595
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
OK

596
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So actually someone found something very interesting

597
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It should be proposed

598
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
A very interesting concept

599
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Because we are

600
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Compared to our life

601
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And the time scale we use

602
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We are in the Dark Matter Halo

603
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The solar system is basically fixed in the Dark Matter Halo

604
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You see that point is not moving

605
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Your whole life will not change

606
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A pixel on the earth

607
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But the earth has been around

608
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So it means

609
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Our solar system is sitting in a

610
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Constant Dark Matter Week

611
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
A Dark Matter Wind

612
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Keep moving in the same direction

613
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Then we have half a year

614
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's clockwise

615
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Half a year is counterclockwise

616
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Half a year is counterclockwise

617
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
This is called Dark Matter Annual Modulation

618
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It can be a

619
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Probing Dark Matter

620
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
As a particle

621
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
A very important phenomenon

622
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
About ten years ago

623
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Someone planned to test it

624
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And then there was no way

625
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
To reproduce the experiment

626
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Do you know this?

627
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
In addition to

628
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The scale of the solar system

629
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's a little bit bigger

630
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But smaller than the galaxy

631
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But smaller than the galaxy

632
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
See

633
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Because there are a lot of stars in the galaxy

634
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Is a lot of

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Constellations

636
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't know

637
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know

638
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Because usually we

639
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We are

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Anyway, everyone is talking about

641
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What clues are there in Dark Matter

642
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Just use a few scales

643
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Galaxy

644
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's a bunch of galaxies

645
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's called Megastructure

646
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And then there's the whole universe

647
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
There are about four

648
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Will there be a star group in the middle?

649
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't know

650
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't know

651
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't know

652
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know

653
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Next one

654
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But

655
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I have the doll above

656
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That is

657
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So

658
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Then we think it's weird

659
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Since we are sitting on the whole earth

660
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Including ourselves

661
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Do you feel like you're being blown by the wind?

662
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Have you been hit all the time?

663
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Is there a ghost behind you?

664
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No

665
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So a very popular theory

666
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Is

667
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We are all surrounded by

668
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Dark Matter

669
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
OK

670
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's like we're all surrounded by air

671
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But they basically don't

672
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Pass their momentum to us

673
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It won't interact with us

674
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
OK

675
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This is smaller than air

676
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Because air is actually

677
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't feel the interaction

678
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Dark Matter's basic theory is that

679
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The next two are the substances we already know

680
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And then they interact with each other

681
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
In the form of throwing balls

682
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So they can pass

683
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Momentum energy

684
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That's what we know

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And then it's all dark matter

686
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But Dark Matter has no way to catch the ball

687
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Just stand there and watch

688
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Of course

689
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But it has gravity

690
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Right

691
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So we put one over there

692
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
A gravity pole

693
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's the only thing that can interact with us

694
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's pulling us

695
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So we can

696
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Basically, this is the only thing we can

697
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
See the reason for the rotational curve

698
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
OK

699
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Right, because it has a gravitational interaction with us

700
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Can this be

701
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Localized?

702
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's say we have a

703
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Dark Matter density

704
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Let's say it's 0.5

705
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Will it enhance

706
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The gravitational interaction between the substances?

707
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
How do we interact with each other?

708
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, yeah, that's what I just said

709
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Microgravity

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
This thing is very interesting

711
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You either measure a very large scale

712
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Why?

713
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because you can have a very large group of Dark Matter

714
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You can measure a lot of pull

715
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
This approach will become

716
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
There is a kind of

717
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What is it called?

718
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Lensing

719
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
In fact, we can use

720
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Baryonic Matter to do

721
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But a lot of people are doing

722
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
There is a galaxy far away

723
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Then

724
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He also has a Dark Matter Halo

725
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And then there's something behind him

726
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So we can see what's behind him

727
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Then we can see

728
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The effect of this galaxy's lensing

729
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Can we go

730
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So this lens

731
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
How heavy is it?

732
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Then we can see how bright this lens is

733
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So we can guess

734
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
How heavy it is

735
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't know why I'm doing astronomy

736
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I don't know how to talk about Baryonic Matter

737
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Standard Model of Matter

738
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
How heavy it is

739
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
This is a way

740
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
There are a lot of these measurements

741
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Measurement and

742
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Is it in line with the SNOKER?

743
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In line with

744
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But it's a mass

745
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Because if you measure it like this, it's a mass, right?

746
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Because you're looking at a very far

747
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
A very far galaxy as a mirror

748
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And then there's another group of people

749
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What they're doing now is

750
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's what you said

751
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Can I do it on Earth?

752
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
For example, I'm on the table

753
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I know how heavy this apple is

754
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
How heavy that banana is

755
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But if there's Dark Matter in the middle

756
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
How much should he change

757
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The problem with this is that you can put

758
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
All experiments are controlled very accurately

759
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But their signal is very small

760
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because things are very light

761
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So it's hard to do

762
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If you do this

763
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Will be a completely different

764
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
For Theory

765
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But this is

766
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This is more like what you're talking about

767
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We know this

768
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Oh yeah

769
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So

770
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The problem here is

771
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
How big is your sensitivity

772
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You have to compare

773
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because if we measure big G now

774
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It should all be observed from the sky

775
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Just look at the big

776
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't know

777
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I don't know

778
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
What are they doing now

779
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But someone is doing it

780
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
This is actually a very interesting experiment for me

781
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But I think it's been five or ten years

782
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Should be very

783
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Test performance

784
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
There will be no

785
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I have a question

786
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh, this is a

787
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
A completely different idea

788
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
There is that you want to talk about

789
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Just talk about manufacturing

790
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That LHC wants to do this

791
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'll talk about it later

792
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Theoretically, right?

793
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's just a

794
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
If it's a pile of matter and then there's mass

795
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yes, it can be theoretically

796
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But I don't think it's measured

797
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Because your weight is very small

798
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So it's hard to measure

799
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So now the big difference is

800
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Of course, there's more mass

801
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But I'm not sure

802
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
No one knows what it is

803
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But

804
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What you can imagine is that you can modify

805
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You originally used to do the assumption

806
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That is, if Newton's law is right

807
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That is, there is less matter

808
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Or Newton's law

809
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Or relativism is not so right

810
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Then you have to modify that

811
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Anyway, either case

812
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You have to think of a theory

813
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What we're doing is to treat it as

814
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Particle

815
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yes, it's a particle

816
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And then the only thing it does is

817
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Okay, this is what I'm talking about

818
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So he's standing there

819
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And then he doesn't do anything, does he?

820
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So our assumption now is that

821
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Dark matter doesn't interact

822
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
This sentence is right

823
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
If you talk to astronomers

824
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In all of our roles

825
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Dark matter will never work with you

826
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What are you doing?

827
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
OK

828
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But what is our hope?

829
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Our hope is

830
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Next page

831
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Next page

832
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It's a very, very, very

833
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Small chance

834
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's actually going to be with us

835
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This red

836
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I don't know if it's straight or neutral

837
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Anyway, it's with our normal matter

838
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Interaction

839
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But what are its conditions?

840
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Its condition is to be small

841
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So rare that it's seen as

842
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Consistent with non-interacting

843
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
In all previous experiments

844
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That is to say

845
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You want this opportunity to be small

846
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Um

847
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In all previous experiments

848
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It looks like it doesn't work

849
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But you'll think

850
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's already so small

851
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Why do you have to assume it

852
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
There are other reasons

853
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Because we are

854
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Directly start

855
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Directly

856
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Um

857
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We have a lot of other examples

858
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The theory of physics

859
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
He predicted that there would be new examples

860
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
OK

861
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's not just what we know now

862
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Then these new examples

863
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
With

864
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Even their bigger and more complete

865
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
In theory, we know that part

866
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The interaction is very weak

867
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Um

868
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Weak to all the other

869
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It looks like it's

870
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
No interaction

871
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But it's not completely non-interactive

872
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This is the point

873
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And then it's more important

874
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That value

875
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Is what we should be able to measure

876
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
As long as we design a

877
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Dedicated experiment

878
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Um

879
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Because

880
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
In fact, we can't measure it

881
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's not that it doesn't interact

882
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But we don't have a very sensitive way to measure it

883
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So we always thought it was completely non-interactive

884
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But in fact it is not

885
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Then if we measure it today

886
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
In what we think it should interact with us

887
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
This sensitive detector

888
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
There is still no interaction

889
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Then we can rule out the old theory

890
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Which we did many times

891
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'll talk about it later

892
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
What is the current situation

893
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
The current situation is

894
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The earth is over there

895
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Red is our experiment

896
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
We cover it on the earth

897
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then we are in the dark matter

898
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So as the center of the coordinate

899
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Dark matter has been hitting us

900
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Then we hope that many

901
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
One will hit our detector

902
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And then hit the detector

903
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The situation is actually quite serious

904
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's like you hit the ball

905
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Come in and out

906
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Then he put a little bit

907
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The kinetic energy is passed to the detector

908
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Then we have to measure this little kinetic energy

909
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Ok

910
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This is what we have to do

911
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
How do we actually do it

912
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Ok, let's start slowly

913
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That is to say our project

914
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This is not our project

915
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But I want to talk about it first

916
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The two most popular methods on the earth

917
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Then I want to

918
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
In our work

919
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Why do we think this is better

920
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
This is the first method

921
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's called Time Projection Chamber

922
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The red line is dark matter

923
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Dark matter comes in many times

924
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There was one time he hit the bucket

925
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Detector material in the basket

926
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Then like hitting the ball

927
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Then go out

928
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Then he passed the energy to the line like a caterpillar

929
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
What is that line

930
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Inside the bucket

931
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Is our so-called

932
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Target Matter

933
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Usually I don't know what matter is

934
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Anyway, it's Target Matter

935
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Then he passed a little energy

936
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
This kind of material

937
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The atomic box of this element

938
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Then the atomic box

939
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
After recoiling some energy

940
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Pass this energy to him

941
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The electrons on the track

942
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The electrons will move

943
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Then it will drop

944
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Then it's the yellow line of the caterpillar

945
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
OK

946
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Then this flash of light

947
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Will spread out

948
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Will be above and below

949
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
PMT

950
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
PMT is called Photon Multiplier Tube

951
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Basically it is very sensitive

952
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Light sensor

953
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You can measure that light

954
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then I just said

955
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
He hit it

956
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Then pass the absorbed energy to the electrons and drop it

957
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Then you know that the moon

958
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The light coming out is a fixed color

959
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Is a fixed energy

960
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So you look at the energy of this color

961
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
How strong it means

962
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
How many electrons are there

963
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Then you can reverse

964
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
How much energy did he eat

965
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
OK

966
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
This is

967
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The first signal

968
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Then the second signal is what I just said

969
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He will have an electron moon

970
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Then the moon of the electron

971
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
In addition to this kind of falling

972
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It will have a certain ratio

973
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
OK

974
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What about these electrons

975
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
He is in this vertical direction

976
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Put a very, very strong power plant

977
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Is that I wrote there

978
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's probably thousands of volts per centimeter

979
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So one you look at the following picture

980
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
One person is so big

981
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The vertical direction of the barrel is probably tens of thousands of volts

982
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
He used this very strong power plant

983
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The electron is pulled all the way to the bottom

984
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Just drag it all the way

985
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Drag it all the way to the top

986
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
There is a virtual caterpillar above

987
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
OK, that virtual caterpillar hit the detector

988
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
He has a secondary signal

989
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So there is such a method

990
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Can you

991
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Then because he was pulled up

992
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Speed ​​is a fixed speed

993
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's probably a fixed speed

994
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Is the electron in

995
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Drifting speed

996
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So you count that

997
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Flash, flash is basically a moment

998
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Just a flash and you'll see

999
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
To the speed of the electron

1000
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The time difference in the middle

1001
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Can you reverse the distance

1002
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
OK, you know what I mean

1003
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Then if you have a row of electrons being drifted

1004
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Then the distance to each one is different

1005
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You reverse the whole thing and you get a track

1006
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Then through this track

1007
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You can vary

1008
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Roughly

1009
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Different

1010
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Hit your example

1011
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Distinguish whether we already know

1012
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The particle hit us

1013
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Or his behavior is consistent

1014
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
We should have expectations for us

1015
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This is called Time Projection Chamber

1016
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What about his question

1017
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
OK, let's talk about his advantages

1018
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
His advantage is

1019
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That material is usually

1020
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Liquified

1021
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What

1022
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That

1023
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Xenon

1024
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Or

1025
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Where is it

1026
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Argon

1027
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's these two kinds of gas

1028
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So it's actually a very heavy element

1029
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Then we

1030
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
What about the elements that we know are heavy

1031
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's a bit like

1032
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
If you hit a heavy thing today

1033
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Hit the air molecules with you

1034
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Then the air molecules will get more

1035
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Energy or heavy things

1036
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It should be heavy

1037
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So if you hit it today

1038
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Hit a heavier atomic box

1039
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Then you can leave more energy

1040
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Then we know that the energy is equal to the square of M

1041
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
The square of the atomic box

1042
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So their signal is very big

1043
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And they are actually easy to scale up

1044
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Why scale up is important

1045
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Because basically there is

1046
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
How many Doppler Meters pass through your detector

1047
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
How big is it with your detector

1048
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
How many atomic boxes are there

1049
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So if you have a two-time detector

1050
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Basically you

1051
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The rate of the expected signal should be twice

1052
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
They are easy to put a lot of

1053
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Super high voltage

1054
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It sounds crazy

1055
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But it's actually easy

1056
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Basically

1057
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
To summarize

1058
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
State-of-the-art optimization

1059
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Of a widely used

1060
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Iron geophysics technology

1061
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Invented in the 70s

1062
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
OK

1063
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
State-of-the-art optimization

1064
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
This very widely used

1065
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What are the benefits

1066
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They can scale up very quickly

1067
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
They know what problems they will encounter

1068
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So currently their approach is

1069
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The most sensitive

1070
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
In terms of event rate

1071
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
OK

1072
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The second one

1073
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Another one is Solid State Detector

1074
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Why is this thing

1075
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Let me talk about it

1076
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What you see on the picture now

1077
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The part I enlarged

1078
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That little metal box

1079
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Inside the metal box

1080
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's the carton next to it

1081
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
The blue thing

1082
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Is a solid state detector

1083
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Its principle is actually the same as

1084
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The etheric detector

1085
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You go in and hit it

1086
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Then give it energy

1087
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Energy makes it flash

1088
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
OK, and then the flash

1089
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
What about the light

1090
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Can it pop out

1091
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And then the top and bottom of this picture

1092
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
That label

1093
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's called TES

1094
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
TES is

1095
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
We know the most sensitive detector on Earth

1096
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
What is it

1097
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's called Transition Edge Sensor

1098
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll talk about it later

1099
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
OK

1100
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's very sensitive

1101
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And then

1102
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
In addition to this signal

1103
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You can also get another signal

1104
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's a deposit

1105
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's basically heat

1106
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's heat in the crystal

1107
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
If you think about it

1108
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Then the heat will be passed out

1109
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But he put the whole box

1110
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's empty

1111
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Nothing

1112
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So heat can't be passed out

1113
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Heat stays inside

1114
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
OK

1115
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The only track that can be passed out

1116
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's the top and bottom

1117
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It has two caterpillar wires

1118
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It will pass to heat bath

1119
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So you can eat all these heat

1120
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Then measure the heat

1121
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Then you

1122
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Correlate these two signals

1123
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You can identify

1124
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What hit us

1125
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Is it a particle we know

1126
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Or a particle we don't know

1127
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
OK

1128
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
What's the benefit

1129
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This kind of solid state detector

1130
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Can be operated under cryogenic temperature

1131
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
For exquisite energy resolution

1132
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
With ultra-low noise

1133
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But

1134
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
What does it mean

1135
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
OK

1136
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It can have a lot of

1137
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Very special phenomena

1138
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Our collaborators

1139
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
In Berkeley

1140
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
In different laboratories

1141
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That is to say

1142
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
This kind of thing can play a lot of magic

1143
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Recoil threshold depends on material property

1144
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You can invent

1145
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Very exotic material

1146
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Then let them eat

1147
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
This

1148
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
After hitting the ball

1149
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Then how to give it to you

1150
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Then you measure

1151
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
OK

1152
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I know that Chicago University is now leading

1153
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
They are doing CCD

1154
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
To put it bluntly

1155
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The CCD chip in your camera

1156
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Take it to Dark Matter

1157
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
After hitting it, it will leave the electrode

1158
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Then walk a small line

1159
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Different particles walk that line

1160
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The behavior will be different

1161
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So you can be very, very

1162
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Accurate judgment

1163
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What kind of material

1164
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What kind of particle

1165
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Then there is the superconductor

1166
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I will talk a lot about this later

1167
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Because we are doing superconductor

1168
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It is also a very sensitive material

1169
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
What is graphene

1170
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
What is special about graphene

1171
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Its conductivity

1172
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Is

1173
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Not all the same

1174
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's the same in every direction

1175
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Like your

1176
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Your guide is basically like this

1177
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Graphene

1178
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It is on the same plane

1179
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
The conductivity of six directions is zero

1180
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Then

1181
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's not zero in the other six directions

1182
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Or it is

1183
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Six-fold symmetry

1184
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's very interesting

1185
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
When your particle comes in

1186
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
If it runs in the direction of that no electrode

1187
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Run

1188
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It can be as small as possible

1189
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I can pull it

1190
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I should just say

1191
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But there is a place

1192
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's even weirder

1193
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's superfluid

1194
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's very sensitive

1195
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Then there is

1196
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It's Fermi arc

1197
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
This is what we did in Caltech

1198
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This thing

1199
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's basically in a certain direction

1200
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That

1201
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's also zero

1202
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You can imagine these things

1203
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
They are all very super

1204
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But the problem is

1205
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You are the subject of research

1206
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Instead of using it to study other people

1207
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So every moment

1208
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's very, very expensive

1209
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
OK

1210
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But why is this thing interesting

1211
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'll tell you later

1212
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Its dilemma is

1213
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Harder to scale up without meeting new challenges

1214
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
While maintaining your budget and sensitivity

1215
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
This is very

1216
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You know the biggest experimental background

1217
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Is sensitivity

1218
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
No, it's your budget

1219
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
OK

1220
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So I just finished

1221
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Time Projection Chamber

1222
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And Solid State Detector

1223
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This is a monoplot

1224
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's the whole field

1225
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The current state

1226
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The arc

1227
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Is your assumption

1228
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The quality of dark matter

1229
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Why do I say assumption

1230
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Because no one measured it

1231
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
If you measure it, you know where it can be drawn

1232
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You assume

1233
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
How heavy is the dark matter that can't be measured

1234
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
OK

1235
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Then you know

1236
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
How heavy is your dark matter particle

1237
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Then you know your dark matter halo

1238
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
We stand in that halo

1239
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
How heavy is the dark matter total

1240
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So you know

1241
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
How many

1242
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Particle in terms of number

1243
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The flux has been flowing through you

1244
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Then you can't measure it again

1245
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Then you can know that the chance of interaction with me

1246
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Can't be greater than how much

1247
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So the arc is the chance of interaction

1248
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Then every line you see

1249
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Is the upper limit of that opportunity

1250
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
That is

1251
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The interaction between dark matter and detector

1252
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
The chance must be less than that line

1253
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
If it's higher than that line

1254
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We should measure it

1255
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
This is the logic of the picture

1256
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So it actually has two directions

1257
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
One direction is you

1258
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
We're going to make the detector bigger and bigger

1259
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Like the Time Projection Chamber

1260
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Then you can expect more events

1261
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
If it's going to be measured

1262
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So if you can't measure it, you can keep the line down

1263
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It means that the higher the sensitivity

1264
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You still can't measure

1265
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Then the other one is you

1266
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You can measure the smaller and smaller

1267
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Energy

1268
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Then can you know that

1269
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Because very light particles hit you

1270
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The energy left is very small

1271
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Then can you go to the left of this picture

1272
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
To draw that line

1273
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Because you know

1274
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You can measure this kind of energy

1275
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But you didn't measure it

1276
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Then you can put it there

1277
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That limit

1278
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
This part is the solid state

1279
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's right there

1280
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
This is the main direction of this field

1281
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Everyone wants to push down

1282
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
To make the detector bigger

1283
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But if you want to go to the right

1284
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
If you push left

1285
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You need a better detector

1286
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
That's right

1287
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What if you go to the right

1288
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Ok

1289
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
To the right is like this

1290
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Why do we want to do a dedicated experiment

1291
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
To measure dark matter

1292
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Because we actually have a very very

1293
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Strong machine

1294
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
We have been using

1295
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's a big magnet

1296
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
When they built it

1297
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
In addition to looking for the exposure

1298
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
They actually want to find

1299
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The most important thing I think

1300
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I think it's fair to say

1301
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The example of superposition theory

1302
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The example of superposition theory

1303
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It used to be the best for dark matter

1304
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The most anticipated thing to happen

1305
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Their goal

1306
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Basically around TEV

1307
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Or sub-TEV

1308
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So that's where I put the picture

1309
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Then you will ask

1310
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Do we want to measure them now

1311
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
The answer is that LHC has not been able to measure

1312
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And it has exceeded

1313
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The earliest version

1314
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The original superposition theory

1315
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That is to say, we have basically

1316
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The original superposition theory

1317
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So there are a lot of superposition theories now

1318
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's just looking at its original superposition theory

1319
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
According to our continuous measurement

1320
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They think it's a

1321
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Superposition theory should have

1322
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
What new phenomenon

1323
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Look at this thing

1324
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So basically

1325
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You keep going down

1326
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
To measure

1327
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Superposition theory

1328
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Is it wrong?

1329
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But he can't measure

1330
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It's already weird

1331
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
If you are interested

1332
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You can ask me

1333
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So now Susie's

1334
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The expectations are probably all on this map

1335
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You will be surprised

1336
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Because almost all of them are in the places we have entered

1337
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So now a lot of new theories

1338
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Come out

1339
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If it's not a superposition theory

1340
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's another one we've never thought of

1341
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The dark side

1342
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's like you know

1343
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The dark side

1344
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
We can't see it

1345
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But it's very, very weak

1346
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It interacts with the world we see

1347
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But it's a completely stand-alone

1348
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Dark world

1349
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It can have very light particles

1350
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Then we have to have

1351
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Very new technology

1352
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Go to the left of this picture

1353
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So this is our goal

1354
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Then you can see above

1355
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
In the SSD frame

1356
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The four lines on the left

1357
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That's basically what we experimented with

1358
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Four different operations

1359
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So we are the most leading in this place

1360
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Then we are going to propose the next technology

1361
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Push us down again

1362
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
No, push it to the left

1363
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Sorry

1364
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So this should be

1365
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
OK, this is the last page

1366
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So the first part everyone has

1367
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Any questions?

1368
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I know

1369
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Dark Matter

1370
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It has its own interaction

1371
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
This is

1372
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Ok

1373
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
This is our most popular theory now

1374
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Called

1375
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Let's talk about popular

1376
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
This is a piece of cake

1377
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Anyway, everyone is the most

1378
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
The theory that people are pursuing in the experiment is

1379
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It's weakly interacting

1380
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Massive particle

1381
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Weakly is not in terms of

1382
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Interact with us

1383
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Interact with anything

1384
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Including themselves

1385
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So WIMP is very weak

1386
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But in fact

1387
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It should be said that Dark Matter does not have to be very weak

1388
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Like that

1389
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
The latest paper published by He Shu-yu is SIMP

1390
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
What is SIMP

1391
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Strongly

1392
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
He can strongly interact with himself

1393
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What is the problem with strongly interacting with yourself?

1394
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
If he can

1395
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Strongly interact with himself

1396
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It's true

1397
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
They may have something

1398
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
They have their own

1399
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Or whatever

1400
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
They can condense into very small objects

1401
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
This very small object

1402
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It will

1403
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Run this

1404
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
What is this called

1405
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
This kind of super super

1406
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
This kind of simulation

1407
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
They run this

1408
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Galaxy Evolution

1409
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
If you let Dark Matter and Dark Matter

1410
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Strongly interact

1411
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
They will condense into very small objects

1412
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Very fast

1413
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It can't form here

1414
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Then

1415
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Become our Dark Matter

1416
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It will become

1417
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Dark Matter Planet

1418
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Something like that

1419
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I thought it would turn into a planet

1420
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
As long as there is gravitational force

1421
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Because this is related to the time of Evolution

1422
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Because your

1423
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You know how strong the gravitational force is

1424
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It can condense

1425
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
There is a process

1426
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But it can condense very quickly

1427
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I think I missed one thing

1428
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Astronomers now

1429
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Their perception

1430
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Is like this

1431
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
At the beginning of the universe

1432
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Things are very

1433
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Average distribution in the universe

1434
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Some places

1435
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
A little bit more

1436
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Then

1437
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Dark Matter is a little bit more over there

1438
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
They all come together

1439
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Then it's Dark Matter Halo

1440
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Then this Halo

1441
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
To produce a local gravity

1442
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
We already know

1443
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Drag it over

1444
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Become a current structure

1445
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So if this process

1446
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Time speed

1447
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
If there is a change

1448
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
For example, it condenses very quickly

1449
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
A very small one

1450
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Then it will not be able to form

1451
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
What we already know

1452
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Or the density of the galaxy

1453
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
In the universe

1454
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So I really want to ask the question is

1455
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Will Dark Matter be used in the future?

1456
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Oh, there is such a theory

1457
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and so

1458
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Black hole is not a big concept

1459
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Because the black hole is just based on gravity

1460
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So

1461
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Black hole is still very strong

1462
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You will find

1463
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You can't see

1464
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Matter

1465
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
This is being done

1466
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
but I

1467
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I have no idea

1468
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It sounds reasonable

1469
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
But in fact, someone is doing this

1470
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Someone is doing one thing

1471
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
He can let

1472
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Dark Matter is over there

1473
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Then he said

1474
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Dark Matter and Dark Matter

1475
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Even if it doesn't work with us

1476
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
You will be with yourself

1477
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Let's say he will

1478
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
This is the theory

1479
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
After he annihilated

1480
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
He can

1481
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It becomes a pair production

1482
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
What else

1483
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
But because there are many

1484
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And very tight

1485
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So even Dark Matter coupled to Standard Model

1486
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The chance is small

1487
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It will still have

1488
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Very high

1489
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Event rate

1490
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
For example, Gamma Gamma

1491
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So they are looking at that kind of

1492
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
A lot of quality

1493
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
For example, we think our

1494
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Our own

1495
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
The center of the Milky Way is a super-heavy black hole

1496
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That

1497
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
That's a hot spot

1498
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's a lot of time looking over there

1499
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And then look over there

1500
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Gamma Ray

1501
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Whether it's Spectrum or Ray

1502
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Is there any

1503
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Beyond us

1504
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Normal Matter

1505
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Then you can say over there

1506
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Effectively there is a Dark Matter

1507
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Black hole

1508
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But this kind of experiment is also difficult to do

1509
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Because you know that the black hole itself is a very

1510
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Violent environment

1511
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So it's equal to

1512
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Even if you see a lot of Gamma Ray

1513
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You can blame it all on your model

1514
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Why didn't you run well

1515
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So they have a lot of uncertainty

1516
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But there are always people

1517
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Because they are so old

1518
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
You can say it's a pile of Dark Matter

1519
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Black hole

1520
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And then there's Parallelization

1521
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Then it becomes Gamma Gamma

1522
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Then

1523
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
But there is one

1524
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
In Dark Matter

1525
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Self-interaction has a

1526
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Upper bound and lower bound

1527
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
There are several upper bound and lower bound

1528
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
If it's too weakly interact

1529
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It won't form a black hole

1530
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Then you have no way

1531
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Either

1532
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Is to become

1533
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
A galaxy where the black hole forms

1534
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Or

1535
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
If it's too strong

1536
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It will quickly become Dark Planet

1537
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Dark Planet

1538
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
You can expect

1539
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
If there is a Dark Planet in a certain place

1540
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
There will be a Dark Galaxy

1541
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
This thing is done by someone

1542
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But it can't be done

1543
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Like an experiment called AMS

1544
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The earliest

1545
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
The purpose is to find

1546
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Dark World

1547
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Can't find it

1548
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So it has a bound

1549
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So they are now

1550
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You can still tune

1551
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But

1552
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
There is a boundary

1553
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I think

1554
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Dark Matter strongly interacting

1555
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Principle will cause

1556
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
If there is a black hole

1557
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
The black hole will be colored by various modes

1558
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
If

1559
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Dark Matter strongly interacting

1560
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I think only half of the people

1561
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
There should be Dark Matter

1562
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Then you will find

1563
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
If there is no way to measure

1564
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Anyway

1565
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Can you find

1566
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yes

1567
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This can be done

1568
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You said this black radiation

1569
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I know what you mean

1570
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So what you are talking about now

1571
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Black radiation is talking about

1572
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Object black radiation

1573
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Instead of the whole universe

1574
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I don't know

1575
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I don't know

1576
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I don't know if it can be done

1577
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
But it sounds like it can be done

1578
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Because I don't know

1579
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
How to observe

1580
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Things in the sky

1581
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Yes

1582
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
That's it

1583
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Any questions

1584
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Next

1585
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Technical

1586
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Then

1587
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
4 minutes

1588
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
OK

1589
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
So what are we doing

1590
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Didn't I just say we do Solid State Detector

1591
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So what you see now is a crystal

1592
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
OK

1593
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
This is a crystal we know

1594
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Then

1595
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
What about the two folding lines

1596
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Is Incoming Particle

1597
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Then knock and run out

1598
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Then the small one on the track

1599
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
That's the electron

1600
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We know that Dark Matter will not have

1601
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Electric charge

1602
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Electric charge

1603
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
But not electric charge

1604
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Because if it has electric charge

1605
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It will work with light

1606
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So you see that knock

1607
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
The electron on the side

1608
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
That must be the particle we know

1609
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And it's a charged particle

1610
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So we look forward to Dark Matter

1611
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
What should happen

1612
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
You can knock the electron in the middle

1613
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Oh, yeah, but you look at the size

1614
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It's easier to know

1615
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So this is a two-scale picture

1616
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You know, one is super-invincible

1617
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Basically there is no electron

1618
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So we basically assume

1619
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
As long as it knocks the electron

1620
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It must not be Dark Matter

1621
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So we put a piece of crystal

1622
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Over there and let it knock

1623
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And then we're going to measure this

1624
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
This

1625
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
This energy

1626
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
What do we know

1627
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
What kind of crystal do humans grow the most

1628
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Do you know

1629
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Julia

1630
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Julia

1631
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
acid

1632
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Of course not

1633
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
That's what you grow the most

1634
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It's not what humans grow the most

1635
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
The answer is that the crystal that humans grow the most

1636
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's called a fine crystal

1637
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
How can Taiwanese make a mistake?

1638
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It's weird.

1639
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And the cost is very low

1640
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
How to grow very clean

1641
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So our approach is to grow

1642
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
We are

1643
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I don't know how to say

1644
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Fine crystal

1645
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And Germanium

1646
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's the next one

1647
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
These two are actually very good at growing, so the cost is very low

1648
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
We can grow very big and very clean

1649
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And then after knocking it

1650
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Did I just say

1651
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
The first one I just did as an example

1652
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It will leave

1653
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
This

1654
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Ionization will produce light, right?

1655
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But the light of ionization

1656
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
How much is the energy of ionization?

1657
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Do you know

1658
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It's EV

1659
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Right?

1660
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
If you have a concept of electronics

1661
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
For example, hydrogen is 13.6 EV

1662
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
If it's a heavier atom

1663
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Because the electrons are placed further

1664
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So the pull will be smaller

1665
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So it's less than 10

1666
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Less than 10 EV

1667
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
If it

1668
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The energy left is really small

1669
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
If it's less than 10 EV

1670
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Can we measure it?

1671
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It won't stay

1672
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Because it can't even eat the energy of the most basic unit

1673
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
What will it do

1674
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
It will become one that keeps shaking

1675
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It won't knock things away

1676
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It will keep vibrating over there

1677
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
When it vibrates, it becomes a kind of vacuum

1678
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
We know that vacuum

1679
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It can actually be translated into a very fancy word

1680
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It's called Fona, which is actually hot vacuum

1681
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
We can measure this hot vacuum

1682
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Our goal is to measure this hot vacuum

1683
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
So measuring this hot vacuum

1684
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Immediately put our threshold

1685
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
From EV-ish

1686
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Down to mini-EV

1687
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Because the basic mode of a vacuum

1688
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Is its frequency

1689
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Multiplied by Brownian frequency

1690
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Is its unit, its energy

1691
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's very small, it's mini-EV

1692
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So we immediately

1693
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
From our detection threshold

1694
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
From the crystal itself

1695
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
EV becomes

1696
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Our

1697
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Can be used to measure

1698
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The threshold of this Fona detector

1699
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
This thing has become

1700
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It's not a limit at all

1701
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Then we will do another thing

1702
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
When it has

1703
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
We give it a very, very strong electric field

1704
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Across this crystal

1705
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So it has a little bit of

1706
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Electrode-eating energy

1707
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It will be pulled away violently

1708
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Then pulled all the way to the top

1709
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Just like the TPC you just saw

1710
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So basically we are doing TPC in the crystal

1711
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
But we are not liquid

1712
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
We are not solid

1713
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So this electron is being pulled all the way

1714
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It's not a fluid process

1715
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It's crazy to hit people all the way

1716
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So it's crazy to hit people

1717
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It will produce a bigger signal

1718
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
More Fona

1719
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So it's a bit like an Amplifier process

1720
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So we use this method

1721
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Can put

1722
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Very small amount of signal becomes very large

1723
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Now the question is

1724
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
How do we measure it?

1725
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
What is this for?

1726
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
We know that the ultraviolet

1727
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It has a change in temperature

1728
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Above this temperature, it is normal

1729
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Under this temperature, it is ultraviolet

1730
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
It's basically like a leap

1731
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The same process

1732
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
OK

1733
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
This is a very simple concept

1734
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
The picture you see now

1735
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Is a very carefully engineered

1736
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Material for ultraviolet

1737
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So you can see the slope

1738
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Otherwise, it looks like a hammer line

1739
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
If you put your ultraviolet

1740
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Just control the temperature

1741
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The detector is in that place

1742
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It becomes normal as soon as it eats energy

1743
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Then the energy is dissipated by the heat

1744
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Fall off immediately

1745
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Basically it is very sensitive

1746
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
This is what we are using now

1747
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
This technology

1748
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
What is its problem?

1749
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Its problem is

1750
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
If you want to put a lot of

1751
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Detectors today

1752
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
On the surface of your big crystal

1753
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You can't

1754
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
The surface of the detector

1755
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
There will be no temperature gradient

1756
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Right?

1757
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
You probably have half

1758
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It continues to be too hot

1759
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Half of it is normal

1760
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Then the other half is too cold

1761
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It doesn't have any sensitivity

1762
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Because it falls in this

1763
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It falls in this

1764
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
This area

1765
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It won't produce this signal

1766
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
For you to measure

1767
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But this is really a

1768
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I can only say now

1769
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Available technology state of art

1770
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
So we spent a lot of

1771
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
A lot of energy to use it

1772
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Then adjust it to be usable

1773
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This principle is like this

1774
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
it is good

1775
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Actually

1776
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
What will it look like?

1777
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
You see the picture in the upper right corner

1778
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
That big piece is ours

1779
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Our

1780
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
That

1781
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Wafer, you can say it is a wafer

1782
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Actually it is a crystal

1783
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
It is not a semiconductor

1784
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
We operate it at 30 mK

1785
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So it is electricity

1786
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It is a source

1787
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It is not a semiconductor

1788
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Then its thickness

1789
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's not our super thin

1790
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
But it has to be 20 inches

1791
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We are 3 inches

1792
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
But it grew a big piece

1793
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
The thickness is 3 cm

1794
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Then we are above

1795
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
In the way of light

1796
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Put this TES

1797
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
That's a lot of little ones

1798
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Then enlarge it

1799
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
This one next to it

1800
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
You can see it

1801
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
It has one, two, three, four

1802
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Then there are eight

1803
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Like a fan

1804
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Then the black at the end of the fan

1805
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It is TES itself

1806
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But why TES is so small

1807
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Because the problem is

1808
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
TES does not want

1809
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It has a large

1810
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Temperature gradient

1811
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
So you have to

1812
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
TES itself is very small

1813
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Then you have to make another

1814
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
A big piece

1815
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Phonon absorber

1816
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Put the heat in

1817
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Then send it all to a very

1818
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Small TES

1819
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It is very

1820
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So from the side

1821
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Pink

1822
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
The pink part is our crystal

1823
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Our wafer

1824
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
After sucking up

1825
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
TES

1826
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This process is actually very complicated

1827
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And the cost is very high

1828
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But this is not the most complicated part

1829
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
The most complicated part is that its signal is still super small

1830
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It's so small that we can't

1831
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Just measure DC

1832
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Isn't there a bias?

1833
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
The answer is no, we can't measure

1834
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So we have to use another one

1835
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
It's also a very high-tech thing

1836
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
High-tech

1837
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It's expensive, it's called Squid

1838
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Squid here

1839
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Then Squid

1840
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
The principle of this thing is that it can be measured to a very, very

1841
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Small magnetic field

1842
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
But the magnetic field is only in

1843
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Oscillating field

1844
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
So you become

1845
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
We want to put our TES

1846
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I circle it up and then connect an AC

1847
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Current

1848
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Then cross a

1849
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Magnetic field

1850
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Then the magnetic field will produce a magnetic field

1851
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
For Squid

1852
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
But we want to say

1853
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Our TES is not heated

1854
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Then it becomes useless

1855
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We want it to be pulled back to its original temperature

1856
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So

1857
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
There is one next to it

1858
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
This

1859
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
The circuit

1860
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
If today's TES is bigger

1861
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
The current flowing through it

1862
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Will become smaller because the current flowing through the next door

1863
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Will become bigger

1864
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So its self-current heating will become smaller

1865
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But you continue to put it in a

1866
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Cooling power

1867
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Inside the refrigerator

1868
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Its temperature will be pulled down

1869
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So this is very complicated

1870
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Then couple to Squid

1871
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Then go up and use Amplifier to magnify it

1872
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So our TES

1873
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Looks like this

1874
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
What you see

1875
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The one next to it is the size of a person

1876
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You can understand

1877
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Middle

1878
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
This little one by one

1879
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Each one is the picture on the right

1880
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
The lower half of the picture on the right

1881
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Six boxes

1882
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Is the box you just saw

1883
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Then there are 31

1884
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So there are 31 times 6, 186 pieces

1885
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
This crystal

1886
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Is in such a big experiment

1887
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Then

1888
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
We call it Tower

1889
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It's full of complicated and expensive

1890
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Circuit

1891
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Then we put it in Canada's

1892
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Snow Lab, 2 kilometers underground

1893
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
If you are interested, you can ask me why

1894
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Underground

1895
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Then Future

1896
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
This is a summary

1897
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Focus on low mass

1898
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Then we

1899
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
We hope it is very low threshold

1900
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
There is no way to make single

1901
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
A small elliptical TES becomes very sensitive

1902
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
So we want to put that

1903
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
A lot of puzzles

1904
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Connect it into a big piece

1905
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Then use a single readout

1906
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Let it become a

1907
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Pixel, so a pixel is so big

1908
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Actually, we only have 12 pixels

1909
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It means that the fluctuation is averaged

1910
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
it is good

1911
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
What is his problem? His problem is

1912
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Obviously our Reconstruct

1913
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
The location of the collision

1914
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The location resolution is very bad

1915
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Right?

1916
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So I want to speed up

1917
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Speed up

1918
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Then my projection does not speed up

1919
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Then this is

1920
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Different electronics need to be frozen at different temperatures

1921
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So we still have a super super expensive refrigerator

1922
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
To control this temperature, then it is very wasteful

1923
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
it is good

1924
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
So what are we going to do?

1925
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
What you see now is a prototype detector

1926
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I will talk about it quickly because it is basically

1927
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Can't

1928
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I don't want to talk about it

1929
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You see every dot

1930
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
It's all a single pixel

1931
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
OK

1932
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
What about this pixel?

1933
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
You can see a line here

1934
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
This line goes up like this

1935
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Then down

1936
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Then go up again

1937
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Then come down again

1938
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Read out all the signals of each dot

1939
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
it is good

1940
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Then it is all single pixel

1941
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It is not connected into a pixel

1942
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And

1943
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It doesn't need cryogenic electronics at all

1944
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Its signal can be measured directly

1945
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
What is the reason?

1946
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
The reason is that we use superconductors

1947
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Superconductors have no resistance

1948
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But the superconductor has a resistance

1949
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Why?

1950
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Because we know our

1951
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Charge carrier

1952
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It is masked

1953
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You are in normal electricity

1954
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
What is it?

1955
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Inside the conductor

1956
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It is an effective mask

1957
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Because it is in a

1958
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Electrode inside the lattice

1959
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It is a cooper pair inside the superconductor

1960
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It is the same

1961
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
There is a mask

1962
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Then there will be a circuit

1963
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
So let's measure this circuit

1964
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
What is the best way to measure the circuit?

1965
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You say that good

1966
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Then I will scan the whole frequency

1967
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Then let's see the speed of its drop

1968
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I know its slope

1969
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I know how big the circuit is

1970
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
The smartest way

1971
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Is to make an oscillator

1972
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
You help it with a capacitor

1973
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Then it becomes like this

1974
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
OK

1975
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So you have a circuit

1976
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Then you can use the incoming energy

1977
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
The example here is light

1978
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
But we are copper to phonon

1979
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Then break it

1980
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Break its cooper pair

1981
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It changed its circuit

1982
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
After changing its circuit

1983
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
The oscillating frequency of this oscillator

1984
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So its oscillating frequency

1985
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Here will move

1986
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Move away

1987
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
From the side of this move

1988
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
We know how much it has been broken

1989
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Then we know the cooper pair

1990
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So we know

1991
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
How much energy do we need

1992
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So what do you actually see?

1993
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You put it on

1994
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Network analyzer

1995
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You see a lot of peaks standing here

1996
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Like a comb

1997
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
This is not in the time domain

1998
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Then the frequency domain

1999
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
If a pixel is hit

2000
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It will move to the side

2001
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Then the real device

2002
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It's broken again

2003
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It looks like this

2004
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
A cable goes in

2005
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's a waveguide

2006
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
If you don't hit on

2007
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Those resonant frequency

2008
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It's basically a one in one out

2009
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
No problem

2010
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
But hit on resonant frequency

2011
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
There will be a very big drop

2012
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So it's a waveguide

2013
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
You can read all the pixels

2014
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So basically

2015
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
On the CDMX crystal you just saw

2016
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
12 pixels, we can make it 1000

2017
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
No problem

2018
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Summarize

2019
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
This effect

2020
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
This is our current status

2021
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It sounds easy

2022
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
We just make a number

2023
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Then we have 1000 pixels

2024
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
There is no problem

2025
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
What is the problem?

2026
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
What we do now

2027
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Looks like this

2028
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Resonance is very small

2029
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Resonance is about 2dB

2030
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Resonance

2031
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But our waveguide

2032
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It's very, very bad

2033
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
20dB drop

2034
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Continuous

2035
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
We can make the waveguide

2036
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Looks like this

2037
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
The waveguide is about minus 5dB

2038
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
But our

2039
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Resonance is only about 1dB

2040
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Anyway, it's all super bad

2041
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Ok

2042
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Then finally talk about what we want to do

2043
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
That is

2044
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
We know different superconductors

2045
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
The binding energy of the cooper pair inside

2046
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Different

2047
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Then we know again

2048
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Uh

2049
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
What is our phonon energy

2050
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
So if we choose

2051
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Cooper pair binding energy

2052
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Greater than

2053
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
That phonon energy

2054
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Phonon hits the cooper pair

2055
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
It won't absorb, it will spit it back

2056
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Because it can't break the smallest unit

2057
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
So

2058
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
If we put our waveguide

2059
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Made of that kind of material

2060
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But our detector is called KIT

2061
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Kinetic Inductance Detector

2062
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Made of material that can be broken

2063
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Our 100% energy will

2064
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Absorbed in the pixel

2065
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So our resolution

2066
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Should be very large

2067
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
High

2068
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
That's it

2069
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
A little over time

2070
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Actually, I said R&D, but I didn't say it

2071
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Someone over there is talking

2072
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm sorry

2073
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
My wife told me to go grocery shopping

2074
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Will this be recorded?

2075
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Will be recorded

2076
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It should be recorded

2077
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It doesn't matter

2078
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Let's go

2079
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Resolution

2080
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Resolution

2081
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Resolution

2082
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Resolution

2083
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Resolution

2084
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Resolution

2085
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Resolution

2086
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Resolution

2087
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
This question is actually like this

2088
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
The first one is you want to put your

2089
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Resonance Q factor

2090
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Because the larger your Q factor

2091
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
The more dots you have to scan

2092
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Otherwise you won't see it

2093
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Scan your Q factor

2094
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
How big

2095
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
What is the basis? How do you decide that?

2096
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Instinctively

2097
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Just make the Q factor super big

2098
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Because if it's super big, it means

2099
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
It doesn't have a problem with its own detection resolution

2100
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
But because you

2101
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Knocked into the crystal

2102
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Phonon

2103
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Phonon will

2104
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It's just a shockwave, right?

2105
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
It has a

2106
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
You know the shockwave divided by the size of the crystal

2107
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It's probably the time it floats to the surface

2108
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
So its wave shape

2109
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
There's probably one

2110
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
There's one

2111
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
There's one in the frequency

2112
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
There's a main band

2113
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Today you want it to be coupled

2114
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
To a certain

2115
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Resonance

2116
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Actually you have to do

2117
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Conversion

2118
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Convert to

2119
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
The width of the baseband is

2120
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Equal to your bandwidth

2121
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
So your

2122
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Resolution actually depends on

2123
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
How big your crystal is

2124
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
So we actually

2125
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Don't want it to be big

2126
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
It can't be too big

2127
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Otherwise we will miss the phonon

2128
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
That's probably

2129
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
10 to the power of 4

2130
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
10 to the power of 4

2131
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And then we see how many pixels to put

2132
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And then between each pixel

2133
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
In order to keep it out of the way

2134
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
You have to look at its spacing

2135
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
How wide

2136
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Then add this up and you can push

2137
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Your whole

2138
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Dynamic range

2139
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
You have to measure a few points

2140
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And then how fast

2141
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Of course it has something to do with DAQ

2142
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I have a question

2143
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
You said a

2144
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You said a

2145
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
What does it mean

2146
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Actually

2147
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Waveguide is a very fancy word

2148
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
But it's actually a wire

2149
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
The wire is actually waveguide

2150
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
When you appreciate this thing, you feel that the wire is super powerful

2151
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Just good

2152
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I go back to that page

2153
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
This picture

2154
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
You put the one next to it

2155
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
The Tai Chi picture is all gone

2156
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
There's a wire, isn't there

2157
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And then there's a bucket here

2158
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Each bucket is a pixel

2159
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And then that pixel

2160
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It's a

2161
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
LC circuit

2162
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
You can think of it as

2163
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It's a resonator

2164
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It's a very, very narrow band

2165
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Bandpass

2166
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And it's super bandpass

2167
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
That is to say, when your frequency

2168
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Just fall in

2169
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
That

2170
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
The frequency

2171
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Your signal will not flow from the beginning

2172
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
To the end

2173
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You will flow from the beginning to this side

2174
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And then you just turn it all the way down

2175
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
OK, so

2176
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
What about this picture

2177
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
You can think of this picture as

2178
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
The signal you take out

2179
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
The signal you put in

2180
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
So

2181
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
This line is 1.0

2182
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
That is to say, there is no hit

2183
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
When the resonator

2184
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
How much in, how much out

2185
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
What I'm talking about now is an ideal situation

2186
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
But it's not an ideal situation

2187
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
But when it goes in

2188
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
The frequency it goes in

2189
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It just happens to be from this

2190
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
It will show up all the way down

2191
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
So this will go straight

2192
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
To the bottom

2193
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Theoretically, it should be super 5DD

2194
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
So it will become a number

2195
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Basically, that's it

2196
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Is this number picture a one-shot

2197
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Or does it always have a frequency

2198
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Or is it always

2199
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
You can think of me sending a frequency

2200
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And then send a frequency

2201
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
This is a way to do it

2202
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
But another way is like this

2203
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Is that you send a signal in

2204
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And then the signal that comes out

2205
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Do a Fourier transform

2206
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So you have to send in all the frequencies at once

2207
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So the AC next to you

2208
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Is to send in all the frequencies

2209
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yes, but it will be slower

2210
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It should be said that its resolution is lower

2211
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Sorry, it's not slower, it's lower

2212
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So we usually

2213
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Take the detector

2214
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And then do this once

2215
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
See all the numbers

2216
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Where is that one by one

2217
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And then we send a lot of

2218
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Those tones

2219
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Do you know what I mean

2220
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
So we actually

2221
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Just delete a lot of

2222
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
The bottom of the flat line

2223
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So our DAQ will be much faster

2224
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
But yes, that's probably it

2225
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It has its problems

2226
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
That's it

2227
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
At least for people

2228
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It's a one-shot time for people

2229
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I can hear you

2230
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I'm Zhang Jianping

2231
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
You're Zhang Jianping

2232
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
What else

2233
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Are you sleeping

2234
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
What's the problem

2235
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
That's it

2236
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I think you've been talking about it

2237
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It seems that basically everyone is

2238
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Mostly from the hardware

2239
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
To

2240
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
To change

2241
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Have you ever thought about this

2242
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
In fact, you can

2243
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
The software part of the statistics

2244
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Can do a little help

2245
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Because I feel like you're in the front

2246
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
The chamber

2247
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It's a more continuous way

2248
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
It's a continuous one

2249
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
But it still has to knock things

2250
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But it's more continuous

2251
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But when you get to the back

2252
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
When it becomes the transition edge

2253
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
It's like

2254
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
We want to measure a person

2255
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
How perverted he is

2256
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Give him a perverted meter

2257
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Assuming continuous

2258
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
But to see if he's going to kill

2259
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
It becomes a one-off

2260
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Do you know what I'm talking about

2261
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Wait a minute

2262
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Do you know that speaking will be recorded

2263
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
It doesn't matter

2264
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I'm not talking about it today

2265
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Anyway

2266
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So your curve will become

2267
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
This should not be called long linear

2268
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But this is the

2269
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Line of logistic regression

2270
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
So in fact

2271
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's a one-off

2272
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
You spend a continuous line

2273
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
One or one straight line

2274
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
In the middle

2275
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Then I see you feed him

2276
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
It's just looking at his results

2277
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
But actually if you put it

2278
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Because your problem now is

2279
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
My feeling is

2280
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Because Dark Matter is a

2281
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
It's more of a sample study

2282
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Because your signal is rare

2283
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
If I'm not mistaken

2284
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
There are some

2285
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Processing sample

2286
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Information

2287
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Can increase sensitivity

2288
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
With the accuracy of the time

2289
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Including if you use some

2290
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Like bootstrapping

2291
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Or use some

2292
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Regularization

2293
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
To

2294
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Regularize his signal

2295
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It's actually

2296
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Bayesian method

2297
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
You can increase

2298
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Artificially increase its accuracy

2299
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Although it sounds weird

2300
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Because you actually

2301
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
It's not really seeing anything

2302
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
No, it's not weird

2303
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
You know what I want to use

2304
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
But it doesn't seem to work

2305
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Do you know

2306
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It can be used

2307
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I'm here

2308
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Because the question is a bit long

2309
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
So

2310
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I repeat it again

2311
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So the problem with the sample

2312
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
In addition to talking a lot of dirty words in the middle

2313
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Because there are not many

2314
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
His problem is like this

2315
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
That is to say, we are now doing detector

2316
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Then measured

2317
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
If you don't measure it, you don't measure it

2318
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
But can we use

2319
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Software method

2320
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Our

2321
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
General

2322
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Experimental sensitivity

2323
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Is that what you mean?

2324
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Correct

2325
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
The answer is yes

2326
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And when you have

2327
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
One or two hundred people doing an experiment

2328
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
This part will have one hundred people

2329
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Do something like this

2330
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Ok

2331
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Why are we

2332
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Now focus on this part

2333
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
There is actually a very interesting reason

2334
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
When you start doing dark matter

2335
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
You will find out

2336
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
The environment you live in

2337
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The air you breathe

2338
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
The pen you use is super invincible

2339
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Very radioactive

2340
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
OK

2341
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
So the problem is

2342
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
We can now

2343
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Measure the signal

2344
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Then use the software you just said

2345
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
To correct it

2346
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Whether it is correct

2347
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
His true location

2348
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
True energy

2349
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
But we eventually

2350
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
There will be a problem

2351
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
We want to be very clear

2352
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Confidence level is very high

2353
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
This is my detector

2354
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Radioactivity

2355
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Or the real dark matter

2356
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Then we

2357
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Now found

2358
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
The most important

2359
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
To distinguish this

2360
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
The difference is

2361
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Even if it is a neutral particle

2362
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
As long as it is

2363
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
The particle we know

2364
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
The depth of his special detector

2365
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
It must be lighter than dark matter

2366
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
why

2367
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Because his interaction must be bigger

2368
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So he was blocked earlier

2369
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
So we are very, very

2370
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
To know exactly

2371
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Where is he really hitting

2372
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Then we just

2373
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Buy a super expensive crystal

2374
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Then he is one-half outside

2375
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
The signal over there

2376
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Don't use

2377
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It's a waste of money

2378
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
So we want to be very, very good

2379
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Location resolution

2380
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Location resolution

2381
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
The most important thing we are now

2382
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
The biggest limit is

2383
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
We have six pixels on one side

2384
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
What do you want

2385
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So our limit is not

2386
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
The reconstruction of our software

2387
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Not good

2388
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Your detection is basically

2389
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
The biggest limitation

2390
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Our software

2391
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Video

2392
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Talk about this

2393
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I don't want to talk about the content

2394
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
You can see the picture

2395
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
The star next to it hasn't come out yet

2396
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
The star next to it

2397
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
The blue part

2398
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Is in one of them

2399
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Surface detector

2400
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
The red part is in another

2401
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Surface detector

2402
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I just said

2403
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
There are six pixels on one side

2404
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
So there are twelve

2405
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
The six pixels are actually arranged

2406
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
A triangle like this

2407
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Plus one in the middle

2408
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Then there are two rings on the outside

2409
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
If there are two rings on the outside

2410
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
He has measured any signal

2411
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
We think he is on the surface

2412
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
We just threw it away

2413
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
So you didn't see it here

2414
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And then in the middle

2415
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But there are a lot of triangles

2416
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
You can see

2417
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
If that size is six

2418
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
If it's three inches

2419
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
The width is actually super wide

2420
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So the resolution is super bad

2421
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
If you want to do this

2422
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
You either have to dig

2423
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
To the very edge

2424
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Let you go

2425
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
This thing is

2426
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
We know the particle

2427
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Or we have to find the particle

2428
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
The confidence level is very low

2429
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Or you have to dig a lot

2430
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Either way is not the most efficient way

2431
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
So we have to do this on the hardware

2432
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
It's the most you're right

2433
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
It's true that it's true on the software

2434
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But it's relative

2435
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Change the hardware directly

2436
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
His effectiveness

2437
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Too much difference

2438
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
But you're right

2439
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Do you have any questions?

2440
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I just turned off the microphone

2441
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
So speak slower

2442
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I'll ask you again

2443
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
You just

2444
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
The new design

2445
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Is to use

2446
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Six L and C

2447
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Then it looks like

2448
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
You can do 40 on the hardware

2449
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Then you just said that

2450
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
You can't do too high

2451
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Then you need to consider

2452
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
His loss

2453
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
That is to say, he changed to this

2454
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Super early

2455
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
It's broken

2456
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Ok

2457
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Good question

2458
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
The answer is

2459
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
This is the problem of TES

2460
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Not our problem

2461
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Why?

2462
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Because TES

2463
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
He just needs to operate near TC

2464
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So there is a little bit

2465
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Local heat accumulation

2466
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Will have a big impact on the function of the detector

2467
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
But what we want

2468
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Turn on kinetic inductance

2469
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
The more the better

2470
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
So

2471
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
TC is 1K, 2K material

2472
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
We freeze it to 20mK

2473
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
This way

2474
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Our kinetic inductance is very large

2475
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And

2476
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Thermal fluctuation

2477
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
There is no impact

2478
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So this is one of the advantages of TES

2479
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
But yes

2480
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
This is the problem of TES

2481
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Any other questions?

2482
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
If not

2483
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Thank you
