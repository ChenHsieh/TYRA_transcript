0	2000	Wow, you should be able to see the screen now.
3200	5000	I'm starting to record now.
5000	7000	I can see it now.
30000	41000	In 2011, I started, I worked on several projects before I joined Professor Citrin's lab in 2014.
41000	52000	And mainly we have been focusing on two types of optics, two types of phenomena in optics.
52000	58000	Basically, nonlinear optics and quantum optics.
59000	62000	So this is my talk is arranged.
62000	72000	I'll first introduce my outline, why we care about this study and why we want to do this research.
72000	77000	Then I'm going to move on to two other setups.
77000	81000	One is a semiconductor laser with feedback.
81000	91000	And I'm going to introduce the setup and one of the applications that we have been working on last two years.
93000	105000	The next I'm going to discuss a single photon emitters as we are now capable of generating one single photon at a time.
105000	114000	And we're going to discuss when we place a single photon emitter in front of mirror with feedback, with time delay feedback,
114000	121000	but complex or maybe complex phenomena we are hoping to observe.
126000	130000	So I'll just start with very, very basic discussions.
130000	136000	So this is a most fundamental feedback system.
136000	142000	It's very general use in maybe like mechanical engineering.
142000	151000	When people study about the control theory, when they place a signal in front of anything,
151000	164000	and then use the measurement result to feed it back into the system and see what's the phenomena they will observe.
164000	167000	Most of people want to control them.
167000	177000	And this is a big deal in control theory when they try to study this dynamical systems.
177000	184000	So here we see like very, I try to reduce the amount of equation that I have.
184000	189000	So this is the most simple equations.
189000	191000	This is equation of motions.
191000	201000	So equation of motions, instead of just the original experimental parameters,
201000	204000	there could be because we have feedback.
204000	207000	So we'll have the delay time.
207000	218000	We have the feedback strength or other things included in the study of the equation of motions.
218000	221000	So this could be applying optics.
222000	230000	On these slides, I show two different setups for optics.
230000	250000	One on the left is an integrated photonic circuit included inside this small optical electronic component.
251000	265000	So basically they generate the photon within the wave intensity to generate random numbers.
265000	269000	So I'll discuss this in more detail later.
269000	273000	But it's a well-studied system.
273000	279000	People can use it to generate entropies and or other entropy source.
279000	283000	So the one on the right is a very similar setup.
283000	292000	If you imagine the semiconductor laser, a laser diode is now replaced with a single photon emitters.
292000	300000	So if here anyone know about laser, you could imagine it's a cavity.
300000	307000	And then you have a luminant source within the cavity and generate lights.
307000	317000	And when the cavity has the same wavelength or they have the wavelength couples to this quantum dot.
317000	320000	Actually, this is a quantum dot in the system.
320000	332000	They could able to generate very high, very pure and very identical indistinguishable photons once at a time.
333000	341000	And we're now interested in placing this single photon emitter in front of a mirror.
341000	345000	And study how we can, how we are able to control it.
345000	348000	And or maybe we cannot control it.
348000	354000	And this will see very interesting dynamics.
354000	361000	So this, so I began with the semiconductor with feedback.
361000	370000	This is this system where typically we'll call this external cavity semiconductor laser.
370000	374000	The system is shown on the right.
374000	377000	We have a laser.
378000	380000	We place it in front of the mirror.
380000	391000	And we found a simple but I think quite clever way to control this feedback strength feeding back into the laser.
391000	401000	And then we can measure the intensity using just a high speed photodiode.
401000	414000	And while doing this, we're also measuring the voltage with the intensity.
414000	418000	So in here we see the external cavity length.
418000	425000	So that's another critical parameters in our study.
425000	439000	So that length, well, two times of this length divided by C is the delay time, which we'll discuss later in this slide in the presentations.
439000	450000	Okay, so this is the theory describing the external cavity semiconductor laser.
450000	457000	Basically it's, well, obviously it's called, it's developed by Len and Kobayashi, these two guys.
457000	461000	We basically describe the system with three parameters.
461000	463000	We have electric field.
463000	471000	We have optical phase when it's entering the, when the feedback light is entering semiconductors.
472000	482000	And we have the carriers or carrier numbers, which related to voltage measurement as I described in the previous slides.
482000	498000	So, in this system, there are, so we have, so basically with this model, we can, we have the three equations of motions.
499000	515000	And typically when people study nonlinear dynamics, people will study the behavior near the equilibrium point or in near, well, yes.
515000	519000	And in our case, it's called external cavity mode.
520000	540000	Basically, when you set this three equations to zero, then you're able to solve a set of solutions that it's stable, or it's just equilibrium, it's equals to zero.
541000	547000	So as I mentioned, we have the external cavity frequency.
547000	551000	This is related to the delay time.
551000	555000	And we have the relaxation oscillation frequency.
555000	561000	That's some, that's related to the current, the drive current.
563000	566000	And yes, we can move on.
570000	589000	So, in the first step, one of the most interesting thing that we are looking for is looking for a bifurcation diagram bifurcation diagram is when we change one of the parameters.
589000	595000	In the increasing or decreasing, we'll see the dynamics change according to these parameters.
595000	605000	And the two parameters, two figures below, these are showing the intensity as a function of these parameters.
605000	620000	These parameters could be the cup, the feedback strength, as I mentioned before, or you can change the external cavity length, or you can change the drive currents.
621000	629000	And we see this bifurcation, you start very well, quite simple.
629000	634000	This is we usually call this continuous wave.
634000	640000	Basically, we have the laser, but it might increase or decrease the light a little bit.
640000	642000	Then we have a jump.
643000	649000	Then we increase this to, we have this bifurcation branch.
649000	658000	So this two branch, that's showing that there's two stable solutions.
658000	664000	So in the intensity, we'll usually see periodic regions.
664000	667000	Basically, we have a sine wave.
668000	673000	Then the next we'll have, we will enter two other branch.
673000	677000	At this point, we'll usually see quasi-periodic.
677000	681000	The next, we'll see chaotic intensity.
683000	690000	Well, which is usually a big blur or very random thing.
690000	694000	And that's how we use it for random number of generations.
698000	712000	So as we discussed in the previous slides, we now have very well-studied models for a semiconductor laser.
712000	721000	But as most of you must know that a laser is just a bunch of photons.
722000	732000	Even though we can describe the model in very well in electric field and carrier numbers.
732000	743000	But when we are generating a single photon at a time, we might see different behaviors.
743000	750000	So changing from semiconductor lasers to a single photon emitters.
750000	753000	That's the second part of my research.
753000	759000	And the one I show on the right is a single photon emitters.
759000	763000	We have a few layers of mirrors.
763000	769000	They're called bright reflectors or just mirrors.
770000	777000	You have a quantum dot embedded in the center of this, of this pillar.
777000	787000	And then, so we have the photons emitting or count very confined in three directions.
790000	796000	And we can control the photon frequency a little bit, but not too much.
796000	808000	We can control and how fast we want to excite or excite the quantum dot and get a very nice photon, a single photon.
811000	819000	So I'll first start with some results I have for semiconductor lasers with feedback.
820000	826000	I'll first describe the properties and then I'm going to discuss one.
826000	832000	Only one of the applications that we have is called optoelectronic oscillators.
836000	843000	So this is basically our experimental setup with the probe on the right.
843000	854000	We can measure the voltage and the intensity at the same time, which is very, yeah, it's very interesting.
854000	860000	But somehow it hasn't been studied in the last 10, 20 years.
862000	870000	People usually focus on the intensity, not optical intensity, but not the carriers.
870000	877000	So now with this, we'll be able to get voltage and intensity at the same time.
880000	888000	So this is one of the first few bifurcation diagrams in experiments.
889000	895000	The one I showed you before is theoretical bifurcation diagrams.
896000	905000	So because we're only taking the AC signals, so there's not very change.
905000	910000	There's not that much change in the in the vertical directions.
910000	914000	Only the oscillations are being observed here.
917000	921000	So the parameters that we are changing is the feedback strength.
922000	930000	As we can see, as we increase the feedback strength, we start from a laser, basically just a CW laser.
930000	936000	And then we have a quasi-periodic regime and then we enter a periodic.
936000	942000	Then the next we have chaotic signals.
943000	951000	So we were also able to measure the optical spectra at the same time.
953000	964000	We see that in the CW regions, there's only one optical frequency, meaning just the laser is very stable.
964000	966000	You only have one frequency.
966000	979000	The next we have quasi-periodic regimes, which more than one external cavity mode are being excited.
979000	983000	Then the next we enter the periodic regimes.
983000	989000	When we see the period is separated by the relaxation oscillation frequency.
989000	995000	The relaxation oscillation frequency, I probably haven't mentioned this.
995000	1009000	It's depending on the different semiconductor laser, depending on the laser diode and current that you're applying to.
1009000	1016000	The last, when we increase the feedback strength, we enter a chaotic.
1016000	1023000	Chaotic region when all of these external modes are being excited.
1023000	1037000	Then in a later work, we'll have another slide showing other method when we characterize how chaotic it is.
1038000	1042000	So I think I have...
1050000	1054000	So I have prepared a very short...
1054000	1056000	Sorry, sorry.
1056000	1058000	Can you interrupt?
1058000	1060000	Okay.
1060000	1062000	It's okay.
1062000	1064000	Oh, it's already running.
1064000	1066000	I think it's okay.
1066000	1068000	Is it?
1068000	1070000	I think it's okay.
1070000	1072000	I think it's okay.
1072000	1074000	I think it's okay.
1074000	1076000	Is it?
1076000	1080000	It's not very continuous, but I think it's okay.
1080000	1082000	Oh.
1082000	1084000	Yeah.
1084000	1086000	Okay.
1086000	1106000	So basically, it's from what I just said, from CW to quasi-periodic to periodic, and then there are some different dynamical regimes.
1106000	1108000	Yeah.
1108000	1124000	And this, the next one is, this is chaotic time series for both intensity and the voltage.
1124000	1126000	I think we have enough for this.
1126000	1129000	Okay, so can I ask a question?
1129000	1131000	Sure.
1131000	1135000	So my question is actually for the previous, the prior slide.
1135000	1138000	So in there, the previous one.
1138000	1140000	So in there, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1140000	1145000	So you have four, not really four, but four graphs, colorful graphs here.
1145000	1149000	So the D, can you explain that a little bit?
1149000	1160000	Because other three use amplitude for the Y, but this one, this D is for frequency, right?
1160000	1162000	What does that mean?
1162000	1166000	Yes, so we have four graphs in here.
1166000	1178000	So for part, for figure A and B, this figure A is the intensity, and figure B is for the voltage.
1179000	1195000	So they have very similar behaviors, but some, because we have limited voltage resolutions, so some of the small features cannot be observed in the voltage.
1195000	1203000	The C is just a zoom in of A.
1203000	1209000	We've been from zero to 25%.
1209000	1225000	So focusing on first half or first one third of the figure A, and we have, we also have the optical spectrum of the intensity at the same time.
1225000	1234000	And yes, the four figures in the bottom are representing the optical frequency.
1234000	1249000	So they are the optical frequency offset by the optical frequency of the laser.
1249000	1251000	Is that okay?
1251000	1253000	Yeah, yeah, thanks.
1253000	1255000	Sorry about that.
1255000	1262000	So we have two amplitudes representing the intensity and the voltage.
1262000	1273000	In C and D, we focus on the first half of the intensity and compare that to the optical frequency at the same time.
1273000	1292000	So we have intensity changing, and also at the same time we can measure the optical frequency that's higher or below the, we usually call this CW frequency, but yeah.
1292000	1310000	So, and also we see that this, there's a bright stripes that they are separate by the frequency of the relaxation oscillations, relaxation oscillation frequencies.
1310000	1311000	Hello.
1311000	1313000	Hello.
1313000	1318000	Uh, I can, I can ask a question.
1318000	1326000	Is this picture, is this the picture of the bifurcation when we solve the ODE?
1326000	1331000	Yes, yes, this is the bifurcation obtained in the experiment.
1331000	1336000	Bifurcation, I remember because I learned it a long time ago.
1336000	1345000	But I remember that there's a parameter that changes a little bit and then there's a completely different result. Is that the thing?
1345000	1350000	Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's right. So what we've changed now is...
1350000	1354000	So what's changed in here?
1354000	1362000	What's changed is the feedback strength, which is how much you get back when you just shoot it out.
1362000	1365000	Oh, oh.
1365000	1370000	So it's, let me think about it, let me see if there's this, okay.
1370000	1375000	Can you see this electric field, this one?
1375000	1378000	Uh, 10?
1378000	1385000	There's a Kappa behind the electric field in the Opal Archimedes model.
1385000	1386000	Uh-huh.
1386000	1389000	That's what we can actually change in practice.
1389000	1391000	Oh.
1391000	1395000	We've changed a lot of things later on, but nothing else.
1395000	1403000	This is the simplest and I think the most controllable.
1403000	1411000	Okay, okay, thank you.
1411000	1415000	So basically, we control feedback strength.
1415000	1422000	And we can see that the bifurcation diagram looks like this.
1422000	1428000	This diagram is...
1428000	1433000	This diagram took me a long time to make, and I'm really bad at it.
1433000	1434000	It took me a long time to make it.
1434000	1437000	Anyway, okay.
1437000	1438000	So next.
1438000	1446000	So in this slide, I'm going to discuss only one of the applications of this system.
1446000	1450000	So this is called an optical electronic oscillator.
1450000	1456000	This is typical use when we need to generate very high frequencies, but...
1456000	1459000	Sorry.
1459000	1463000	High frequency of RF signals.
1463000	1468000	It's very difficult for us to use a quartz oscillator,
1468000	1477000	and use other multipliers to generate the same periodic frequencies.
1477000	1484000	So on the top, this is for generating a periodic voltage signal,
1484000	1489000	because we have direct access to the voltage now.
1489000	1491000	We have very high...
1491000	1495000	Well, we have pretty high quality factors,
1495000	1507000	and then we can get the phase jitter less than, I think, 10 to the minus 4 microseconds.
1507000	1518000	So the frequency now we're generating at this, it's almost 10 gigahertz.
1518000	1528000	Okay, so the ones below, these are to generate chaotic signals.
1528000	1533000	People usually ask, we usually want an RF signal, a periodic signal.
1533000	1539000	Why we care about chaotic waveform or chaotic signals?
1539000	1543000	So the answer is quite simple, actually.
1543000	1546000	So people are trying to use...
1546000	1557000	In all the cryptographies, people use random number generations.
1557000	1567000	But usually when we have the random number generations in electronic systems,
1567000	1573000	it's typically not a real random.
1573000	1577000	There are still some type of trace that we can find,
1577000	1581000	and usually they are much slower.
1581000	1585000	So in here, we generate the chaotic signal,
1585000	1592000	and then we can use it as a type of random number generations.
1592000	1599000	There are other characterization methods for how randomness,
1599000	1607000	what's the randomness or how chaotic we are for the signal.
1607000	1610000	This is one of the results.
1610000	1616000	So this is called largest Lyapunov exponent.
1616000	1620000	As someone mentioned, sorry, I didn't catch your name.
1620000	1628000	As someone mentioned before, this is the separation when two signals at time equals zero
1628000	1632000	and time equals sometimes.
1632000	1640000	And then the separation of these two signals in its state space,
1640000	1647000	if this signal, the space or the distance they are separating
1647000	1652000	is proportional to time,
1652000	1655000	there is a very exponent and you take the log,
1655000	1659000	and then you can see if this is chaotic,
1659000	1666000	you will have a positive largest Lyapunov exponent.
1666000	1673000	This is a very, one of the simple way,
1673000	1681000	well studied way to study how chaotic a signal is.
1681000	1691000	So next I'm going to discuss what happens if we place a single photon emitters with feedback.
1691000	1694000	I think maybe Leo is here.
1694000	1702000	He also have few publications on feedback for waveguides.
1702000	1708000	So for me, I'm just going to discuss feedbacks,
1708000	1713000	a single photon feedback in optical regimes.
1713000	1720000	I'll first discuss why feedback loop is important in quantum limits.
1720000	1729000	As I showed before, this is basically how a feedback system looks like.
1729000	1734000	There are two methods of feedback loops,
1734000	1738000	where we try to prepare quantum states.
1738000	1745000	So the one in figure A, this is a measurement-based feedback loop.
1745000	1749000	So you measure something, you want to prepare either zero or one,
1749000	1752000	and then you measure it.
1752000	1757000	If it's not a target state,
1757000	1764000	you just apply a Z gate or minus something times Z gate
1764000	1773000	to feed it back into the quantum system and prepare the state as you wish.
1773000	1779000	It has been done experimentally, shown in figure C.
1779000	1789000	So this is just a feedback for, I think, single ions, I believe.
1789000	1796000	So it's easy to prepare an ion within a cavity.
1796000	1801000	So the other method, which I'm more interested,
1801000	1805000	or most people are more interested in,
1805000	1809000	is called coherent feedback.
1809000	1812000	Without making the measurement,
1812000	1816000	if we put a mirror in front of this photon source,
1816000	1824000	we can actually prepare the quantum dot in one of the target states.
1824000	1827000	So the important of this is,
1827000	1832000	or the major difference is, with coherent feedback,
1832000	1840000	we can actually prepare the dot in the superposition states.
1840000	1842000	Unlike the measurement-based feedback,
1842000	1847000	we can usually target in zero or one.
1847000	1850000	I think not many people are.
1850000	1860000	Anyway, so again, we have
1860000	1864000	the equation of motions.
1864000	1868000	Feedback schemes are control schemes using time delay.
1868000	1872000	So they are period guess, type feed control,
1872000	1879000	rhythmic control, and extended time delay feedback.
1879000	1888000	So here, the coherent feedback can be used as period guess type control
1888000	1895000	to eliminate the unstable orbit.
1895000	1897000	Okay.
1897000	1903000	So the advantage of period guess type feedback is to provide,
1903000	1908000	of course, feedback instantly.
1908000	1914000	It can be applied in every regime to stabilize a system.
1914000	1916000	It's non-invasive.
1916000	1920000	And one of the best thing is if the delay time,
1920000	1924000	which should be a controllable parameter,
1924000	1928000	the delay time, if it's matching the intrinsic orbital period,
1928000	1932000	it actually has a stabilizing effect.
1932000	1938000	And the last is it's preserving the coherent state
1938000	1940000	without making the measurement.
1940000	1948000	This is probably one of the most important for quantum systems.
1948000	1952000	So before we start on the study of feedback,
1952000	1955000	I'm going to discuss a little bit,
1955000	1960000	just introduce how a single emitter looks like.
1960000	1966000	So this, the figure on the right, bottom right,
1966000	1972000	this is a single photon emitters that our collaborating,
1972000	1977000	that our collaborator are manufacturing in the laboratory.
1977000	1982000	Basically, it's three, five semiconductor materials
1982000	1988000	with embedded quantum dot inside in the center.
1988000	1994000	They have very clever way to etch out the parts
1994000	1997000	that's outside of the regions.
1997000	2003000	So all they left is very well-defined micro pillars.
2003000	2009000	And they have the optical frequency matched to this frequency,
2009000	2016000	to the transition frequency of the quantum dots.
2016000	2020000	And we have two other parameters,
2020000	2030000	that's the coupling strength and the decay rate of the quantum dot.
2030000	2035000	Basically, if the decay rate is too high,
2035000	2038000	we call this a weak coupling regions
2038000	2046000	that the photon emits,
2046000	2057000	they emit the photon outside of the desired optical frequencies.
2057000	2058000	So, okay.
2058000	2063000	So for one single photon with feedback,
2063000	2072000	we will have studied the behavior of a single photon feedback.
2072000	2077000	So, on the right, we have three figures.
2077000	2083000	The first is without the external cavity, without feedback.
2083000	2086000	So that's emitting a single photons.
2086000	2094000	The next when we have certain condition match
2094000	2099000	for the external cavity length or the delay time
2099000	2104000	with the transition time or the rapid frequency
2104000	2109000	in the quantum dot,
2109000	2112000	we can drive the system,
2112000	2117000	even though it's in a weak coupling regions,
2117000	2126000	we can drive them in a very periodic way.
2126000	2129000	So the one that I produce in the bottom is,
2129000	2135000	I use the same method to generate the same result.
2135000	2139000	So I can compare with their result in the future.
2139000	2148000	So we can generate very long periodic signals with feedback.
2148000	2153000	As I mentioned before, the way that,
2153000	2158000	so the figure on the left, this is classical.
2158000	2162000	When we have the delay time,
2163000	2174000	that is a multiple of the period,
2174000	2177000	intrinsic period of a system.
2177000	2183000	When this system match to the frequency of the delay time,
2183000	2187000	they will have very high repetitions.
2187000	2194000	Basically, the orbit is more or less stabilizing itself.
2194000	2199000	So they have level one, two, three, four, five, something.
2199000	2210000	That's the multiple of these two matching.
2210000	2212000	The one on the right,
2213000	2218000	I use it for a quantum.
2218000	2222000	This is the same feedback in quantum regions.
2222000	2226000	Basically, we have the similar process,
2226000	2235000	but the decay or the repetition of two signals are decreasing much faster
2235000	2242000	than periodic feedback.
2242000	2247000	These are just a demonstration of how it looks like.
2247000	2263000	We have the delay time at three different colors
2263000	2264000	in the color figures.
2264000	2266000	I don't know how to say this.
2266000	2268000	The top in figure C,
2268000	2273000	we see that if the delay time is not multiple of this,
2273000	2281000	the orbit is not very repetitive.
2281000	2283000	As we increase the delay time,
2283000	2291000	we see the orbit is trying to match to the intrinsic orbit.
2292000	2303000	It's very repetitive as we change the delay time.
2303000	2311000	Next, I'm going to discuss stability analysis.
2312000	2321000	This is a very common study to study any dynamical system,
2321000	2324000	especially with feedback.
2324000	2326000	When we have the feedback,
2326000	2336000	we'll try to calculate if a system is stable or it's a repeller,
2336000	2340000	it's stable, or it's a saddle point.
2340000	2350000	The criteria or the typical method is first to find the stationary state
2350000	2356000	or equilibrium states where all the equation of motions are being zero.
2356000	2362000	The next is to find the Jacobian.
2362000	2367000	Then to study the stability,
2367000	2370000	we find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian.
2370000	2379000	For a stable system,
2379000	2383000	the eigenvalue of the Jacobian will be the negative,
2383000	2387000	or the real part of is negative.
2387000	2392000	Repeller, we have a positive real part.
2393000	2399000	The saddle point will have some of the eigenvalues being positive
2399000	2403000	and some of them being negative.
2403000	2411000	Okay, so how do we study such system in a quantum system?
2411000	2415000	How do we study such dynamical behavior
2415000	2420000	that we describe usually in a classical system,
2420000	2422000	in a quantum system?
2422000	2431000	First, it's simple because we already have the equation of motions.
2431000	2434000	The one we have here,
2434000	2439000	the phi is a superposition of three states.
2440000	2446000	We have excited quantum dots being CE,
2446000	2455000	and we have micro cavity photons being CG,
2455000	2460000	or I think I labeled CC here, sorry.
2460000	2467000	We have a photon in the external cavity being CGK.
2468000	2473000	So we can, it's not that hard to,
2473000	2479000	and then we have the Hamiltonian that describe these interactions.
2479000	2487000	So we can just apply this wave function to the Hamiltonian,
2487000	2491000	and then we can get, well, in Schrodinger's picture,
2491000	2497000	and then we can get the equation three, well, equation of motions.
2497000	2507000	Interestingly, because this G of KT is describing the coupling element
2507000	2512000	between each mode,
2512000	2515000	the population in, sorry,
2515000	2524000	the population in the external cavity is the superposition of infinite mode, right?
2524000	2531000	So this G of KT spans from negative infinity to positive infinity,
2531000	2537000	basically describe the coupling between the micro-pillar cavity
2537000	2542000	and the external cavity modes.
2543000	2549000	So we think that we have only three equation of motions,
2549000	2557000	but actually the third one is actually,
2557000	2564000	it's like infinite dimension of equation of, sorry,
2564000	2572000	of the modes that have very high dimensions.
2572000	2578000	So we see this in the denominators here,
2578000	2590000	C of CK and the summation of that going back into the micro-cavity.
2590000	2595000	As I mentioned before, what's the first, what's the steps that we have?
2595000	2600000	So first we find the equilibrium point.
2600000	2607000	So because we, so that's our showing here.
2607000	2613000	If C of C, if the, oh, shit, sorry.
2613000	2623000	If we design the initial conditions of CE, CG and CK in this very specific ways,
2623000	2628000	we'll have them all being stationary.
2628000	2636000	It's actually a stationary state and they have its own oscillating frequencies,
2636000	2639000	minus GT, minus GT.
2639000	2645000	And for this, for the state in the external cavity,
2645000	2654000	each of them, they rotate along this K axis at different rate.
2654000	2663000	But this is actually very easy to imagine if it's, so, okay, sorry.
2663000	2670000	So if you see the expression for C of CK for the stationary states,
2670000	2672000	this is a sinc function.
2672000	2681000	A sinc function is actually a Fourier transform of a square function.
2681000	2689000	So this is just a square, a steady state in the external cavity length.
2689000	2697000	It's have the same optical intensity if you imagine in this way.
2697000	2703000	So the next step is obviously try to find the Jacobian.
2703000	2709000	For that, we apply small signal models.
2709000	2716000	Again, this is a Jacobian of infinite dimensions.
2716000	2718000	It's almost infinite dimensions.
2718000	2725000	Of course, in simulations, I'll be able to only trace down a few of them.
2725000	2728000	Well, many of them actually.
2728000	2733000	So by applying small signal models, we can find the Jacobians.
2733000	2739000	With the Jacobians, we'll be able to calculate the eigenvalues.
2739000	2744000	Well, here we have make a small replacement
2744000	2752000	by just letting us to calculate the eigenvalues more easily.
2752000	2760000	The next step is actually to calculate the eigenvalues itself.
2760000	2765000	So from the result that we have,
2765000	2771000	we can write out the function of determinant of this Jacobian.
2771000	2777000	Next, we can able to calculate the eigenvalues on the top.
2777000	2779000	So there are three different case.
2779000	2789000	The first case is we have the optical frequency of our photons, right?
2789000	2799000	So if the external cavity length match to multiples of the wavelength of the photons,
2799000	2809000	we'll have the Jacobian as a function of r, which I forgot to write here.
2809000	2814000	r is you can imagine as a feedback rate.
2814000	2825000	But r is actually the rate of decay rate over the coupling strength.
2825000	2829000	So it's actually 4 gamma over g.
2829000	2835000	Let me remind you and remind myself what gamma and g is.
2835000	2839000	So it's 4, OK, sorry, 4 gamma over g.
2839000	2847000	That's how we characterize a good or a bad cavity.
2847000	2855000	So with that, we can plot all these eigenvalues.
2855000	2864000	So the one on the in case one, we have these conditions.
2864000	2868000	We have, well, so they look very similar.
2868000	2873000	But if you plot them in the same graph, they are different.
2873000	2887000	So we can have, and this is the imaginary part of this Jacobian of the J tilde,
2887000	2903000	which is, we care about this because the eigenvalues of J tilde times C over L times the I, imaginary part,
2903000	2911000	will have the real eigenvalues of the J delta.
2911000	2927000	So OK, so basically what I'm trying to say is if we have eigenvalues for imaginary tilde or pi,
2927000	2937000	this value being positive will have a stable system and vice versa, of course.
2937000	2952000	The one on the bottom, this is the real part of the eigenvalues and the imaginary part of the eigenvalues,
2952000	2962000	but plotted as different value of R, different value of this R values.
2962000	2981000	Again, when we have eigenvalues in the upper half, we have a stable and the ones in the bottom is unstable.
2981000	2985000	What I'm trying to do here is to see if this is stable.
2985000	2993000	Then we're trying to see if this can work as a stabilizer.
2993000	3001000	So if this has stabilizing effect for a state that's in superpositions,
3002000	3006000	I think I should mention here.
3006000	3013000	As I briefly discussed in previous slides,
3013000	3022000	the coherent feedback are able to prepare the quantum states in superposition states,
3022000	3027000	which is not accessible for measurement-based feedback loop.
3028000	3039000	OK, so this is typically how we draw, we call this black sphere,
3039000	3045000	but typically this is characterized how, what's the superposition of two states.
3045000	3058000	If it's here on the black sphere, it's well superposition states.
3058000	3063000	So we chose different initial conditions,
3063000	3068000	and we see that they are trying to stabilizing itself.
3069000	3078000	Well, the red curve is help you, just to help to guide the eyes.
3078000	3089000	We see that this stabilizing or the rate that this probability is decaying
3089000	3096000	match to the positive parts of the eigenvalues.
3096000	3103000	So these values actually match perfectly with this decay rate.
3103000	3110000	So we see that this, and we see this, we call this bit error.
3110000	3120000	This is, usually we want half probability of a state,
3120000	3124000	half probability for one state and half for the other.
3124000	3129000	But most of the time, when we cannot prepare them perfectly,
3129000	3132000	we have this bit error.
3132000	3140000	In this study, I'm showing you that this bit error can be stabilized as time goes.
3140000	3145000	This bit error could be stabilized.
3146000	3154000	And the next is to study the non-linearity of the excitation state or Fock state.
3154000	3157000	Okay, anyway, it's called Fock state.
3157000	3165000	Basically study how many photons are there in a quantum system.
3165000	3170000	Because in here, I only study only one excited states.
3171000	3177000	And the next step is obvious to study the different number of states.
3177000	3186000	So at this point, I only have one single excitation and two excitation states.
3186000	3191000	But good thing is we have the same Hamiltonians.
3191000	3201000	So it is possible to write out the equation of motions as we did before,
3201000	3205000	and to study the stability from there.
3205000	3208000	But that hasn't been done.
3208000	3212000	That's one of my future works.
3212000	3217000	The other thing is if this stabilize the phase error,
3217000	3225000	the phase error is demonstrated when all these initial states are aligned on the chidal.
3225000	3228000	And then we see if they are fake.
3228000	3240000	So on the figure A, this is showing they start in equal probability,
3240000	3244000	but they have different phase.
3244000	3251000	What's the dynamics of this initial states?
3251000	3255000	We see that it doesn't look like it's stabilizing,
3255000	3264000	or it might have very slow stabilizing rate that's not shown here.
3264000	3269000	Yes, so we reached the conclusions.
3269000	3275000	I show two different types of optical feedbacks.
3275000	3282000	First, I study the external cavity semiconductor lasers.
3282000	3289000	And we show the voltage and intensity bifurcations diagrams.
3289000	3294000	We are able to demonstrate one of the applications.
3294000	3302000	It's called optical electronic oscillators for generating periodic and chaotic waveform.
3302000	3308000	And then we can plot the phase portrait as we change the feedback strength,
3308000	3311000	which also haven't been done before.
3311000	3317000	Then, yeah, I forgot to show the other slides.
3317000	3324000	And then we move on to optical feedback in single photon regimes.
3324000	3331000	So we have very good results that match with other people's work.
3331000	3341000	We are able to show coherent feedback of single photon emitters.
3341000	3355000	We study the effect of external cavity length, or the delay time as
3355000	3359000	of the effect of the stabilizations.
3359000	3366000	Next, we have studied nonlinearities for single photon emitters,
3366000	3371000	where we have maybe one or two photons at the same time.
3371000	3380000	The next I show also show the stabilizing stability analysis for single excitation states.
3381000	3386000	We can improve the theoretical models that we have,
3386000	3389000	mostly in the two excitation states,
3389000	3396000	and see how we can get equilibrium states in that case.
3396000	3406000	And we're looking to study the stability analysis for two excitation states.
3406000	3411000	And we want to see, possibly, well, we are hoping to see,
3411000	3416000	in two or more higher excitation numbers,
3416000	3422000	are we going to transition to quantum chaos,
3422000	3427000	or maybe it's always stable.
3427000	3429000	Okay, thank you.
3429000	3430000	Yes, that's all.
3430000	3434000	That's an hour and more.
3434000	3436000	Hi, everyone.
3440000	3442000	Thank you, Jianyuan.
3442000	3444000	Let me ask a question first.
3444000	3445000	Sorry, everyone.
3445000	3446000	Let me ask a question first.
3446000	3447000	This question might be a little...
3447000	3450000	Can you talk about the application of this?
3450000	3453000	Because I think when you're talking,
3453000	3455000	you've been...
3455000	3457000	I might have missed it.
3457000	3460000	You've been talking about how to stabilize it.
3460000	3465000	But what does it do?
3465000	3468000	Do you know what I mean?
3468000	3470000	Yes, I do.
3470000	3472000	What you're probably trying to ask is,
3472000	3476000	in quantum mechanics,
3476000	3480000	what are the benefits of being able to stabilize?
3480000	3483000	Yes.
3483000	3485000	What are the benefits of quantum mechanics?
3485000	3487000	The first one is,
3487000	3492000	the method that most people want to use to stabilize
3492000	3494000	is this one.
3494000	3496000	The one in the upper right corner,
3496000	3498000	the C graph.
3498000	3501000	You can stabilize it,
3501000	3503000	but you might...
3503000	3508000	I'm not sure if you guys know much about quantum mechanics.
3508000	3510000	If you want to stabilize...
3510000	3512000	I don't know.
3512000	3514000	I don't know.
3514000	3519000	You can only stabilize it in 0 or 1 state.
3522000	3525000	Hello?
3525000	3528000	Hello, I'm listening.
3528000	3534000	Usually, the state we need is called K-state.
3534000	3537000	Or what is it called?
3537000	3539000	GHZ state.
3539000	3545000	Anyway, it wants to be in a superposition state.
3551000	3553000	In quantum mechanics,
3553000	3559000	a lot of things want to be in 0 or 1 superposition state.
3559000	3561000	But if you use measurement-based,
3561000	3563000	you can't stabilize it.
3563000	3565000	But now people say,
3565000	3567000	let's use coherent feedback.
3567000	3571000	But we don't know why coherent feedback can stabilize it.
3571000	3575000	Or what kind of parameters does coherent feedback need
3575000	3579000	for it to be stabilized.
3579000	3582000	Oh, I understand.
3582000	3588000	Our goal is to make it in 0 or 1 superposition state.
3588000	3591000	This is 0 or 1 superposition state.
3591000	3593000	Yes.
3593000	3597000	Okay, I understand.
3597000	3600000	Does anyone have any questions?
3600000	3604000	I also want to ask a low-level question.
3604000	3608000	I don't have a low-level question.
3608000	3610000	We need to stabilize it.
3610000	3612000	But if I remember correctly...
3612000	3614000	I haven't taught for a long time,
3614000	3616000	so I don't remember.
3616000	3618000	But if you use feedback,
3618000	3620000	control theory should use feedback.
3621000	3624000	Hello, I'm still online.
3626000	3628000	Hello, can you hear me?
3628000	3630000	Use feedback to control theory.
3630000	3632000	Yes, yes, yes.
3632000	3636000	Feedback, then control theory to correct.
3636000	3638000	Then get feedback to correct.
3638000	3640000	But in quantum mechanics,
3640000	3644000	the so-called state should be called...
3644000	3646000	You can get that state right away.
3647000	3650000	Is there a way to keep correcting
3650000	3654000	to get the final state we want?
3654000	3656000	Because in quantum mechanics,
3656000	3658000	when we want something to be in a certain state,
3658000	3661000	shouldn't we want to get it right away?
3665000	3667000	I know...
3667000	3670000	I know a little about control theory.
3670000	3672000	But I know in control theory,
3673000	3677000	it uses passive and active control.
3677000	3679000	I remember in passive control...
3679000	3681000	In fact, this should be considered
3681000	3683000	a kind of passive control.
3683000	3685000	But because it's not...
3685000	3687000	Because the point is, like I said,
3687000	3689000	this coherent feedback,
3689000	3691000	its advantage is...
3696000	3698000	Suppose this is active feedback,
3698000	3700000	how much does it measure?
3701000	3703000	Maybe use a PID loop
3703000	3707000	to add or subtract how much
3707000	3712000	to make it into the state you want.
3712000	3714000	But in quantum mechanics,
3714000	3716000	basically,
3716000	3720000	what it can use is limited.
3720000	3722000	So in fact,
3722000	3724000	the coherent feedback here
3724000	3727000	is more of a passive feedback.
3727000	3729000	As long as you don't...
3729000	3731000	As long as you don't...
3731000	3733000	You don't have this measurement process.
3733000	3735000	You can't say you're measuring
3735000	3737000	positive 0.1 or negative 0.1,
3737000	3739000	and then you feedback a negative 0.1 back.
3739000	3741000	Because the point is,
3741000	3743000	if you do this measurement,
3743000	3745000	it will affect the time
3745000	3747000	in its superposition.
3747000	3749000	I think everyone
3749000	3751000	should have heard of something like this.
3751000	3753000	If you do the measurement,
3753000	3755000	it will affect the state
3755000	3757000	of the superposition.
3757000	3759000	I see.
3759000	3761000	So it's not measuring,
3761000	3763000	but there's feedback,
3763000	3765000	and you want to reach
3765000	3767000	a stabilized state.
3767000	3769000	This is what I've been discussing
3769000	3771000	in the second half.
3771000	3773000	I see.
3773000	3775000	Thank you.
3777000	3779000	Let me ask another question.
3779000	3781000	If...
3781000	3783000	If...
3783000	3785000	If you can now
3785000	3787000	increase its
3787000	3789000	stability,
3789000	3791000	theoretically,
3791000	3793000	can you calculate
3793000	3795000	the same...
3797000	3799000	the same...
3799000	3801000	I can hear you.
3801000	3803000	If...
3803000	3805000	If you can now increase
3805000	3807000	its stability,
3807000	3809000	theoretically,
3809000	3811000	you can now
3811000	3813000	calculate the same time
3813000	3815000	or whatever unit,
3815000	3817000	can you increase
3817000	3819000	its certainty?
3819000	3821000	I don't know much about
3821000	3823000	content information.
3823000	3825000	Sorry, I didn't hear you.
3825000	3827000	Increase its certainty.
3827000	3829000	Because now
3829000	3831000	it's between 0 and 1,
3831000	3833000	it's not uncertain, right?
3833000	3835000	In the past,
3835000	3837000	you've stabilized it between 0 and 1,
3837000	3839000	so it's uncertain.
3839000	3841000	Am I right?
3841000	3843000	No, you're not.
3843000	3845000	But here,
3845000	3847000	its...
3847000	3849000	What?
3851000	3853000	Let me think.
3853000	3855000	What's your question?
3855000	3857000	Right.
3857000	3859000	But...
3859000	3861000	Can you
3861000	3863000	repeat your question?
3863000	3865000	I'm sorry.
3865000	3867000	Maybe I didn't understand it
3867000	3869000	correctly, but I heard
3869000	3871000	someone say
3871000	3873000	content information
3873000	3875000	has a quality
3875000	3877000	that you can't
3877000	3879000	calculate
3879000	3881000	accurately.
3881000	3883000	But you can get to a certain
3883000	3885000	probability, you know what I mean?
3885000	3887000	It has intrinsic
3887000	3889000	uncertainty or something like that.
3889000	3891000	Right.
3891000	3893000	This thing...
3893000	3895000	If I understand
3895000	3897000	what you said
3897000	3899000	correctly,
3899000	3901000	this thing...
3901000	3903000	They're talking about
3903000	3905000	how to measure the final result.
3905000	3907000	To measure the final result,
3907000	3909000	because you
3909000	3911000	measured it 10 times,
3911000	3913000	and there were 7 times...
3913000	3915000	Let's say there were 7 times.
3915000	3917000	If 7 times is 1,
3917000	3919000	you'd think
3919000	3921000	you'd write it as
3921000	3923000	density matrix, right?
3923000	3925000	You'd think it's 0.7.
3925000	3927000	But it's actually wrong.
3927000	3929000	Because this thing
3929000	3931000	called quantum tomography...
3931000	3933000	It's too detailed.
3933000	3935000	I don't know how to explain it.
3935000	3937000	Quantum tomography
3937000	3939000	uses the maximum likelihood
3939000	3941000	method.
3941000	3943000	In fact, it's not
3943000	3945000	0.7.
3945000	3947000	In quantum system,
3947000	3949000	in quantum computation,
3949000	3951000	it's a very difficult
3951000	3953000	problem to measure.
3953000	3955000	But
3955000	3957000	it's different
3957000	3959000	from what you asked.
3959000	3961000	You have to ask
3961000	3963000	if the stabilization
3963000	3965000	can be reversed.
3965000	3967000	I think it can.
3967000	3969000	It's actually very easy.
3969000	3971000	If you really
3971000	3973000	implement this system,
3973000	3975000	you can...
3975000	3977000	Let me think
3977000	3979000	which picture is better.
3979000	3981000	This one.
3981000	3983000	You can prepare
3983000	3985000	a type,
3985000	3987000	and measure how long it takes.
3987000	3989000	In fact,
3989000	3991000	you just do a bunch of measurements
3991000	3993000	to see if it matches the service.
3993000	3995000	I think it can
3995000	3997000	reverse the type.
3997000	3999000	In fact,
3999000	4001000	it can verify
4001000	4003000	if what I do
4003000	4005000	is correct.
4005000	4007000	I hope it's correct.
4007000	4009000	But
4009000	4011000	it depends on
4011000	4013000	whether someone can do it.
4013000	4015000	I think it can.
4015000	4017000	Okay, thank you.
4017000	4019000	Hello.
4019000	4021000	Is this Yan Yong?
4023000	4025000	Who? Zhang Yong?
4025000	4027000	Zhang Yong is not here.
4027000	4029000	Is Zhang Yong here?
4029000	4031000	Okay.
4031000	4033000	Zhang Yong
4033000	4035000	just joined
4035000	4037000	and then disappeared.
4037000	4039000	I don't know what happened to him.
4039000	4041000	Okay, ignore him.
4041000	4043000	California hasn't
4043000	4045000	woken up yet.
4045000	4047000	I tried to
4047000	4049000	see if California woke up.
4049000	4051000	California didn't seem to wake up.
4051000	4053000	It's Taiwanese anyway.
4053000	4055000	Thank you.
4055000	4057000	Who is in Taiwan?
4057000	4059000	Actually, I just arrived in Taiwan
4059000	4061000	so I'm still awake.
4061000	4063000	I just returned to Taiwan today.
4063000	4065000	What's your name?
4065000	4067000	Zhang Ying.
4067000	4069000	My name is Zhang Biyue.
4069000	4071000	Biyue.
4073000	4075000	Okay.
4075000	4077000	Where are you studying?
4077000	4079000	I'm in DC, George Washington.
4079000	4081000	George Washington University.
4081000	4083000	Which one?
4083000	4085000	George Washington.
4085000	4087000	George Washington.
4087000	4089000	Okay.
4089000	4091000	I happened to be there for a while.
4091000	4093000	Yeah.
4093000	4095000	What are you studying?
4095000	4097000	Mechanics.
4097000	4099000	Oh.
4099000	4101000	I've been watching a lot of
4101000	4103000	mechanical stuff lately.
4103000	4105000	I watched Control Theory.
4105000	4107000	It's going crazy.
4107000	4109000	Because
4109000	4111000	Control Theory is a very important...
4111000	4113000	Yeah.
4113000	4115000	Before that,
4115000	4117000	I was calculating
4117000	4119000	controllability.
4119000	4121000	Then
4121000	4123000	I went to study those things.
4123000	4125000	I think Control Theory is really interesting.
4125000	4127000	Yeah.
4127000	4129000	I'm not doing Control Theory.
4129000	4131000	I'm doing fluid mechanics.
4131000	4133000	So I did Control Theory
4133000	4135000	about 10 years ago.
4135000	4137000	I know.
4137000	4139000	I think you should...
4139000	4141000	Yeah.
4141000	4143000	I just found out
4143000	4145000	that Control Theory
4145000	4147000	has such a difficult problem.
4147000	4149000	It's really interesting in math.
4149000	4151000	Yeah.
4151000	4153000	But
4153000	4155000	I just heard
4155000	4157000	that I was on
4157000	4159000	Quantum Computing a while ago.
4159000	4161000	I remember he said
4161000	4163000	in Quantum,
4163000	4165000	now computers are 1 and 0.
4165000	4167000	In Quantum Computing,
4167000	4169000	for example, 70% is 0
4169000	4171000	and 30% is 1.
4171000	4173000	It's a superposition.
4173000	4175000	That's right.
4175000	4177000	Is it like
4177000	4179000	Quantum Computing at Kyo University in Japan?
4179000	4181000	I'm just asking.
4181000	4183000	I don't think so.
4183000	4185000	I think it's from the U.S.
4185000	4187000	I'm sure it's a professor
4187000	4189000	from a university in the U.S.
4189000	4191000	So you want to stabilize
4191000	4193000	that I want to produce
4193000	4195000	a group of states
4195000	4197000	that are 70% 0 and 30% 1.
4197000	4199000	So you want to stabilize
4199000	4201000	that I want to produce
4201000	4203000	a group of states that are 70% 0 and 30% 1.
4203000	4205000	Is that what you mean?
4205000	4207000	That's right.
4207000	4209000	You're right.
4209000	4211000	It's a superposition.
4211000	4213000	It's a superposition.
4213000	4215000	The first thing
4215000	4217000	in the feedback loop
4217000	4219000	is that if it's just 0 and 1,
4219000	4221000	we call it pure state,
4221000	4223000	it's easy to do.
4223000	4225000	It's easy to do it with the feedback loop.
4225000	4227000	But if you make it 50%
4227000	4229000	0 and 50% 1,
4229000	4231000	But if you make it 50% 0 and 50% 1,
4231000	4233000	you can't do it.
4233000	4235000	You can't do it.
4235000	4237000	You can't do it.
4237000	4239000	You can't do it.
4239000	4241000	You can't do it.
4241000	4243000	So superposition
4243000	4245000	is a new way
4245000	4247000	to stabilize.
4247000	4249000	is a new way to stabilize.
4249000	4251000	In fact,
4251000	4253000	in quantum computing,
4253000	4255000	there's a lot of research
4255000	4257000	in quantum computing.
4257000	4259000	Because...
4259000	4261000	I don't know if you...
4261000	4263000	In quantum computing,
4263000	4265000	did you get error correction later?
4265000	4267000	No, I only gave up after two weeks.
4267000	4269000	No, I only gave up after two weeks.
4269000	4271000	Anyway,
4271000	4273000	error correction is a very difficult problem.
4273000	4275000	error correction is a very difficult problem.
4275000	4277000	Because you can't do both sides.
4277000	4279000	Because you can't do both sides.
4279000	4281000	Because it's easy to do error correction
4281000	4283000	One is 1.
4283000	4285000	You repeat it 3 times
4285000	4287000	and it becomes 11111111.
4287000	4289000	You repeat it 3 times and it becomes 111111.
4289000	4291000	If it becomes 101,
4291000	4293000	you know the middle is wrong.
4293000	4295000	If it becomes 101, you know the middle is wrong.
4295000	4297000	But you can't do it that way.
4297000	4299000	Because there's
4299000	4301000	non-cloning theory,
4301000	4303000	you can't do the copy
4303000	4305000	so you need
4305000	4307000	You need
4307000	4309000	quantum correction.
4309000	4311000	It's a huge research.
4311000	4313000	It has
4313000	4315000	surface code, color code,
4315000	4317000	super math.
4317000	4319000	I've
4319000	4321000	seen some before
4321000	4323000	and I think it's super hard.
4323000	4325000	I haven't finished yet.
4325000	4327000	Error correction
4327000	4329000	can only
4329000	4331000	correct
4331000	4333000	discrete errors.
4333000	4335000	But what we usually
4335000	4337000	do is
4337000	4339000	correct
4339000	4341000	continuous errors.
4341000	4343000	It's not
4343000	4345000	that hard.
4345000	4347000	It can
4347000	4349000	do continuous
4349000	4351000	stabilizing.
4351000	4353000	I can
4353000	4355000	continuously
4355000	4357000	stabilize it
4357000	4359000	instead of
4359000	4361000	doing something
4361000	4363000	to stabilize it.
4367000	4369000	Like you said,
4369000	4371000	quantum itself
4371000	4373000	can't be measured.
4373000	4375000	It can't measure accurately.
4375000	4377000	No matter what experiment you do today,
4377000	4379000	you need to measure
4379000	4381000	to know what you get.
4381000	4383000	Or quantum computing
4383000	4385000	needs to measure
4385000	4387000	to know
4387000	4389000	what signal it receives.
4389000	4391000	Or error correction
4391000	4393000	needs to measure
4393000	4395000	to know if it
4395000	4397000	receives the wrong signal.
4397000	4399000	Like you said,
4399000	4401000	it's hard to measure.
4401000	4403000	Is there
4403000	4405000	enough
4405000	4407000	technology
4407000	4409000	to measure
4409000	4411000	or is it still
4411000	4413000	lacking?
4413000	4415000	Your question
4415000	4417000	has
4417000	4419000	two parts.
4419000	4421000	One is
4421000	4423000	generally
4423000	4425000	readout
4425000	4427000	can be done.
4427000	4429000	But if you
4429000	4431000	reverse the
4431000	4433000	superposition
4433000	4435000	with readout,
4435000	4437000	it's hard.
4437000	4439000	We need to separate
4439000	4441000	these two parts.
4441000	4443000	Generally,
4443000	4445000	readout is easy.
4445000	4447000	I can't say that.
4447000	4449000	It depends on
4449000	4451000	your system.
4451000	4453000	QuantumDot
4453000	4455000	or IronTrap.
4455000	4457000	IronTrap's readout is the easiest.
4457000	4459000	The other two
4459000	4461000	are a bit harder.
4461000	4463000	But in fact,
4463000	4465000	we all know
4465000	4467000	how to do it.
4467000	4469000	But
4469000	4471000	the result you measure
4471000	4473000	is
4473000	4475000	0 and 1.
4475000	4477000	But
4477000	4479000	if you want to
4479000	4481000	measure the state,
4481000	4483000	you need to do it
4483000	4485000	10 times.
4485000	4487000	7 times is 0.
4487000	4489000	7 times is 0.
4489000	4491000	You can't
4491000	4493000	reverse it.
4493000	4495000	It's 0.7 or 0.3.
4495000	4497000	Right.
4497000	4499000	This is
4499000	4501000	because
4501000	4503000	you usually
4503000	4505000	measure
4505000	4507000	more than one qubit.
4507000	4509000	It's not hard
4509000	4511000	to measure a qubit.
4511000	4513000	But you need
4513000	4515000	thousands of qubits.
4515000	4517000	You need to
4517000	4519000	do it
4519000	4521000	many times
4521000	4523000	to
4523000	4525000	have enough confidence
4525000	4527000	that the result is right.
4527000	4529000	You need
4529000	4531000	thousands of qubits
4531000	4533000	to
4533000	4535000	measure
4535000	4537000	a qubit.
4537000	4539000	Then you can reverse
4539000	4541000	the result.
4541000	4543000	It's hard.
4543000	4545000	And there will be
4545000	4547000	some error.
4547000	4549000	The error
4549000	4551000	is different from
4551000	4553000	the number of times you need to measure.
4553000	4555000	Anyway.
4555000	4557000	OK. Thank you.
4559000	4561000	Any questions?
4565000	4567000	If no,
4567000	4569000	let's give
4569000	4571000	a round of applause.
4571000	4573000	Thank you.
4573000	4575000	Thank you.
4575000	4577000	Come on, Taiwan.
4579000	4581000	OK.
4581000	4583000	That's all.
4583000	4585000	You can leave now.
4585000	4587000	OK. Bye.
4587000	4589000	Thank you.
4589000	4591000	Nice to meet you.
4591000	4593000	Nice to meet you.
4593000	4595000	Nice to meet you.
4595000	4597000	Nice to meet you.
4597000	4599000	Let me say something.
4599000	4601000	I'll post the video
4601000	4603000	in the blog.
4603000	4605000	Only the members can see it.
4605000	4607000	If you have any questions,
4607000	4609000	you can send it to me.
4609000	4611000	Or you can contact him directly.
4611000	4613000	Or you can email him.
4613000	4615000	OK.
4615000	4617000	If
4617000	4619000	you want to join
4619000	4621000	me,
4621000	4623000	it's catchang.
4623000	4625000	Yes.
4625000	4627000	Or you can
4627000	4629000	see if you can
4629000	4631000	tag me in the blog.
4631000	4633000	Or add me.
4633000	4635000	Yes.
4635000	4637000	It's easier for everyone to contact.
4641000	4643000	And
4643000	4645000	I forgot.
4645000	4647000	Pingyuan.
4647000	4649000	Pingyuan.
4651000	4653000	Hello.
4653000	4655000	Hello.
4655000	4657000	If you have any questions,
4657000	4659000	we can talk about it.
4659000	4661000	If you're interested,
4661000	4663000	I'm going to apply for a blog post.
4663000	4665000	I'm looking for a blog post
4665000	4667000	for quantum computing.
4667000	4669000	You can ask me any questions.
4669000	4671000	OK.
4671000	4673000	I'm doing
4673000	4675000	maybe not a direct relationship,
4675000	4677000	but it's still computing.
4677000	4679000	Supercomputing.
4679000	4681000	Yes.
4683000	4685000	It's really hard.
4685000	4687000	Yes.
4687000	4689000	Yes.
4689000	4691000	The so-called
4691000	4693000	quantum...
4693000	4695000	Sorry.
4695000	4697000	It's my wedding photo.
4699000	4701000	I'm going to cover it.
4701000	4703000	It's a big field
4703000	4705000	called quantum simulation.
4705000	4707000	I don't know if quantum simulation
4707000	4709000	can simulate
4709000	4711000	some of the characteristics
4711000	4713000	of chemical molecules.
4713000	4715000	I don't know if
4715000	4717000	other systems
4717000	4719000	can simulate
4719000	4721000	in the future.
4721000	4723000	Yes.
4723000	4725000	It's a big field.
4725000	4727000	Yes.
4727000	4729000	OK.
4729000	4731000	OK.
4731000	4733000	Talk to you later. Bye.
4733000	4735000	Bye.
