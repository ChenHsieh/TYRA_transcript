1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Can you see me now?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ok

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Can you see my screen now?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, yes, yes

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I will turn off my camera

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So it will be smoother

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ok

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let me tell you

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There are two more people here

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One is here

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
One is over there

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The camera may not be able to see

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There are three people here

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If they have any questions

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't be surprised if they are real people

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sorry

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There were some microphone issues

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's why we are delaying

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The topic I am going to talk about

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
looks a bit

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
difficult to understand

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Functional connectivity and dynamics

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and burn organization

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In short

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The main purpose of my research

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
is to look at the functional connections

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
between neural networks

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The so-called functional connections

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
are the neural signals

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
generated by neurons

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
during activation

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How these neural signals

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
are transmitted between different brains

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is the main thing

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am going to talk about today

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will divide it into two parts

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The first part is introduction

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Introduction is a general

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
background idea

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If you are not a neurologist

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You need to know something

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to make it easier for us to explain

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is one of the main research

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The second part is

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the current message

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It is about a

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
special project

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The last part is all about that project

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The first part is

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
a little bit

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
scientific

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The second part is more about

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that research

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have seen

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the comments

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Some people are just

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
talking about science

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So I want to talk about

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
what is neuroscience

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have seen

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
on the internet

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Neuroscience is a

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
comprehensive research

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It includes chemistry,

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
medicine, physiology, medicine

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
even computer science and engineering

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There are a lot of subjects

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
From the perspective of

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
modern neuroscience

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There are

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
cells

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and neurons

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
enlarge the scale

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There are cognitive science

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and behavioral science

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Finally, there is transfer medicine

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It is to apply the research

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
in the lab to clinical

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you want to

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There are micro scale,

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
mesoscale and macroscale

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The last part is

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
about the research

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The first part is

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
between neurons

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The research topic is

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
between neurons

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let me correct

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The first part is

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
about single neurons

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The second part is

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
between neurons

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The last part is

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
between neurons

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The biggest part

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
is what I have done

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
At the same time

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What I have done

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
will cover the last part

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will use

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
a simple sentence

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It is about

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
neural connectivity

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You will hear

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
functional connectivity

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It is about

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the connectivity

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
of neurons

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There is another point

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We want to see

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the connection of

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
human behavior

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
For example,

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
their behavior

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
in clinical

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
or in cognitive science

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I will talk about

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
functional connectivity later

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will talk about

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
functional connectivity later

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Some people

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
have studied

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
psychology or

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
cognitive science

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
They have heard about

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
some theories

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I will give you examples

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The left one is

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Localization

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Scientists

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
are studying

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
brain function

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
or human behavior

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They want to

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
find out which part of the brain

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
is responsible for which function

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is a result of

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
FMRI

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can see

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the three colored areas

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This means that

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
when the subject is doing something

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the neurons in these three areas are active

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is a more

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
traditional theory

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
They think

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
they need to

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
classify

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
which part of the brain

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
is responsible for which function

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Another one is called

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Distributed Brain Network

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
These two schools

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
have been fighting for a long time

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But recently

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
because of some new research methods

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Most people think

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
this is more like the human brain we expect

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In this new school

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
their focus

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
is not on studying

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
a single brain area

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
but on the functionalities of the brain areas

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This yellow arrow

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For example, this brain area

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
may send a message to this area

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and this area

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
may send a message to this area

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So the brain area

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
receives feedback

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and sends the signal

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
to this area

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The picture on the right

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is more like what I am doing now

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is the so-called

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Functional Connectivity

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This is the so-called

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Functional Connectivity

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is the so-called

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Functional Connectivity

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So how do we

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
study it?

185
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How can we measure

186
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the so-called Functional Connectivity?

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
In statistics

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
or basic definition

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Functional Connectivity

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
is like

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
describing two brain areas

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
or two different areas

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
in the same area

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
For example,

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the picture on the right

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
is a brain

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's say there are three areas

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
we call region of interest

199
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
1, 2, 3, 3

200
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The blue, red, and green lines

201
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
refer to

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the time course

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I am using the example of FMRI

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is the signal change

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
caused by the activation of neurons

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is the signal change

207
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We use these signals

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
as the basic research

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a bit like the ingredients

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
of cooking

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
After you get these things

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you start to use different methods

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to see the relationship between them

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Of course, you don't have to use FMRI

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can use many different machines

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
For example, the EEG of the brain

217
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
or the MEG of the brain

218
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But I am using FMRI

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
for my research

220
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So any so-called Functional Connectivity

221
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
based on FMRI

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We call it

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
time course or time series

224
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We use this data to do the research

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's say you have three areas

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
of interest

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The first thing you need to do

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
is to extract their signals

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Then

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
what you need to do is

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
to use different methods

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
to calculate the relationship

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
between two brain areas

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The most common is

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Pairwise Correlation

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you use Pairwise Correlation

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you will see a lot of values

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
For example

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is the relationship

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
between RI2 and RI1

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If they are positive

242
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
For example, this is

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
about 0.5

244
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This means that

245
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
this area and this area

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
are connected

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't look at the

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
diagonal one

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It means that

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
they are connected

251
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But this is not a normal situation

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is because we are calculating

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So usually after we calculate

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and get this evidence

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We will force the diagonal line

256
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to become 0

257
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is mainly

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the way we use

259
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of course, in this part

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Many people use different methods

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
For example, Partial Correlation

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There are many ways to use

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It doesn't mean which method is better

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It depends on

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
what you want to observe

267
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
After that

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
After we get

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
this evidence

270
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
we will be curious

271
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
what we are going to do next

272
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Many people

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
find a big problem

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There are too many signals

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and too much information

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
what I'm going to talk about next

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is to use some new methods

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
so that you

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
can

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
report some data

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to let everyone know

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
how different these numbers

284
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
represent the whole matrix

285
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Wait a minute

286
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Ok

287
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So just now we have

288
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
got the evidence

289
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What I'm going to talk about

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
today is

291
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Graph Theory

292
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and Dynamic Functional Connectivity

293
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sorry

294
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let me interrupt

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Ok

296
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I just want to tell you

297
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you have any questions

298
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you can

299
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
put them in the chat

300
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and I will

301
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
find the time to ask

302
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Or if you have any questions

303
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you can also ask

304
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and I will answer

305
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the questions

306
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't see the chat

307
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
so I don't know what you are asking

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you have any questions

309
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you can ask

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Ok

311
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Before we talk about Graph Theory

312
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
do you have any questions?

313
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If not, let's continue

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Here we have a little bit

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
of abstract

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I will try my best

317
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you have any questions

318
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
we can continue later

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you have studied Maths

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you will know that Graph Theory

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is a part of Maths

322
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Its purpose is

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to describe the relationship

324
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
between two points

325
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
to describe the relationship

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
between two points

327
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
In Neuroscience

328
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Graph Theory is a good tool

329
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In Graph Theory

330
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
you can get a lot of different values

331
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Each value

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
represents a feature of the network

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
For example

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
we will talk about

335
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
some different values later

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Some values may represent

337
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
how well the signal is integrated

338
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
in the brain

339
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
or how well it is integrated

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
in a single system

341
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So there will be some different messages

342
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When you are doing

343
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Graph Theory

344
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
there are two important things

345
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that you must get

346
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The first one is Node

347
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The other one is Edge

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Node is the region of interest

349
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
On the right side

350
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
this is the information

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
of the actual recipient

352
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I have 36 RIs

353
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
so there are 36 brain areas

354
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Usually we put the left brain area

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
in the front

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and the right brain area

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in the back

358
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So this whole matrix

359
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
represents the relationship

360
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
between each of the 36 brain areas

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The so-called edge

362
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
is the connectivity matrix

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
which is this

364
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Usually we get this matrix

365
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
which is the one you saw before

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
which is the one you saw before

367
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
which is the one you saw before

368
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
which is the one you saw before

369
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
which is the one you saw before

370
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The one above this threshold

371
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
we think it actually has a connection

372
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The one below this threshold

373
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we force it to become 0

374
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
we force it to become 0

375
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We don't look at these connections

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We think it is weaker

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
maybe because of some miscommunication

378
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So with these two files

379
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
you can run Graph Theory

380
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This is what we talked about

381
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
at the beginning

382
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When you run Graph Theory

383
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you can get a lot of different values

384
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
which represent a certain specialness on the Internet

385
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
With these values

386
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you can get to know the Internet better

387
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you can get to know the Internet better

388
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and you can also report

389
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the differences between different things

390
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
For example, there are two groups

391
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
One is patient and the other is normal person

392
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and you get this matrix

393
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but if you just show this matrix to everyone

394
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and say that the patient's matrix looks like this

395
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and the normal person's matrix looks like this

396
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But this matrix has too much information

397
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's hard for you to

398
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
find out which side is wrong

399
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
or which side is different

400
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So if you use graph theory

401
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So if you use graph theory

402
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you can report a number

403
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
For example, how good is the overall information of the brain

404
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Then the number of patients may be lower

405
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
or the number of normal people will be higher

406
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is one of the benefits of using graph theory

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is one of the benefits of using graph theory

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So below

409
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is an example

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That is, what kind of value do we have?

411
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That is, what kind of value do we have?

412
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Here you can see different colors

413
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Here you can see different colors

414
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The green part is the so-called integration

415
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The green part is the so-called integration

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If you have this value

417
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It represents integration

418
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It means that the signal

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How well is it integrated in the brain

420
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How well is it integrated in the brain

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Then the blue one

422
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's called segregation

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's a bit like two different things

424
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's a bit like two different things

425
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It means that in a single system

426
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It means that in a single system

427
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
In a single system

428
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
how good the information is integrated

429
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
because you can see

430
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If this is a system

431
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is another system

432
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So-called integration is the relationship between the system and the system

433
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So-called integration is the relationship between the system and the system

434
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The yellow one is called loco majors

435
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The yellow one is called loco majors

436
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you have 100 RIs

437
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If you have 100 RIs

438
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Then you will have 100 numbers

439
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Each number represents this characteristic RI

440
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The red one is called centrality

441
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The red one is called centrality

442
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
In short, this is the importance of this point

443
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
In short, this is the importance of this point

444
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
In short, this is the importance of this point

445
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
These two

446
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
They are the same

447
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If you have wrong graph theory today

448
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If you have wrong graph theory today

449
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
A matrix will have several different numbers

450
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Suppose it has 36 RIs

451
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Suppose it has 36 RIs

452
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So, this half side

453
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
is a matrix, only one number

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
no matter how many RIs it has

455
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
no matter how many RIs it has

456
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,020
Also, there is a black one here, called Hubs

457
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,020


458
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,040
Also, there is a black one here, called Hubs

459
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
as in the middle

460
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
In the end, there will fastly be one

461
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
About Hubs

462
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
In short, you can have a lot

463
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
It's a bit like

464
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
connecting different systems

465
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
For example, this is a system

466
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Here is another system

467
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
You may find signals fromone system to another

468
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
You may find signals fromone system to another

469
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
So the importance of Hubs becomes very important

470
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
So the importance of Hubs becomes very important

471
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Its role is like connecting different systems

472
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
There is a picture at the end

473
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
We will briefly introduce

474
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
the Hubs that are recognized so far

475
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,040
the Hubs that are recognized so far

476
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
Here is the graph theory part

477
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Here is the graph theory part

478
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Next, this is called Dynamic Functional Converting Team

479
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Next, this is called Dynamic Functional Converting Team

480
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
This is a bit newer

481
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
This is about 5 or 6 years

482
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
This is about 5 or 6 years

483
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
It's been about 4 or 5 years

484
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
More people are researching

485
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
We have already mentioned that

486
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
You can get a reference

487
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
You can get a reference

488
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
This reference represents

489
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
the relationship between different RIs

490
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
the relationship between different RIs

491
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
In the early days

492
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
In the early days

493
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Because this reference

494
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
It's the same in time

495
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
It won't change

496
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
But with a new method

497
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
You will find that it is constantly changing

498
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
You will find that it is constantly changing

499
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
The brain is not a stable system

500
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
The brain is not a stable system

501
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
It keeps changing

502
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
It's called non-stationary

503
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
This functional connectivity pattern

504
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
This functional connectivity pattern

505
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
It continues to change

506
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
The time is about a few seconds to a few minutes

507
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
The time is about a few seconds to a few minutes

508
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
From 26 seconds to 86 seconds

509
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
From 26 seconds to 86 seconds

510
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Its reference looks like this

511
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
From 26 seconds to 162 seconds

512
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
It will look different

513
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
This is more than 400 seconds

514
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
This is more than 400 seconds

515
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
If you don't care about the time difference

516
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
If you don't care about the time difference

517
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
If you have less than 5 minutes

518
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
If you have less than 5 minutes

519
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
This is the average time difference

520
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
It looks like this

521
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
But you can find that they are all different

522
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
In addition to the difference in time difference

523
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,040
If you use the wrong graph theory

524
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
You will find that there are many points

525
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Originally there is a connection

526
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
But at a certain point in time

527
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
There is no connection

528
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
For example, the first one is the visual area

529
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
At this point in time

530
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
It has a connection with the other two RIs

531
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
But you will find here

532
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
It has a connection with more RIs

533
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
This is completely gone

534
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
So you can know

535
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
It continues to change

536
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
It continues to change

537
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Time and space are different

538
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Time and space are different

539
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Here is the relationship of time

540
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Here is the relationship of space

541
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Here is a video

542
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Here is a video

543
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
Here is a video

544
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Here is a video

545
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Here is a video

546
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
You can see that it continues to change at different points in time

547
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
So this graph is not fixed

548
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
So this graph is not fixed

549
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
It keeps changing

550
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
It keeps changing

551
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
This is 300 seconds

552
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
This is 300 seconds

553
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
The duration is more than 300 seconds

554
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
The duration is more than 300 seconds

555
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
So you can see

556
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
At this point

557
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
There is a connection between the two ris

558
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
But it disappeared when we go to the next time

559
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,040
We can prove that

560
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Functional connectivity continues to change

561
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Functional connectivity continues to change

562
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Why should we study this

563
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
What are the advantages

564
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Some people have done research before

565
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Some people have done research before

566
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Sorry

567
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,040
It's because the flow of function connectivity

568
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,040
It's very much related to the human cognition

569
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
For example

570
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Some people use cognitive features

571
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
and invite the objects

572
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
they ask them to do

573
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Work in memory taste

574
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
when the brain of manabla

575
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,040


576
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
their functional connectivity

577
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
is constantly changing

578
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
and when fuctional connectivity

579
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
become bigger

580
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,040
the performance of the host is getting better and better

581
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
So this is a piece of evidence

582
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
that tells us

583
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Functional connectivity is constantly changing

584
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
and this change is actually

585
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,040
very much related to human cognition

586
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,040
In addition to the host doing things

587
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
When humans are resting

588
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
You can also observe

589
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Functional connectivity is constantly changing

590
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
This is actually a bit like

591
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
the experiment I'm going to talk about

592
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Because when I'm doing experiments

593
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
My data is mainly resting

594
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
And then

595
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Next is

596
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Okay, so far

597
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I want to ask if there are any questions

598
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Because the next one is for a specific experiment

599
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Background

600
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Hello

601
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Hello

602
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Yes, I heard

603
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Hello, I would like to ask

604
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
If you imagine each node as a time series

605
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Then the picture in front of you

606
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Its edge is a direction

607
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
That thing should not be calculated by Pearson Correlation

608
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Which one

609
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
You mean this one or the one in front

610
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
The part of the graph theory in front

611
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
It's like this direction in the brain

612
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
How do you get it

613
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Oh yes

614
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
In the front

615
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
There is a picture of how we get the evidence

616
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
There is a place to tell you

617
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Basically if you use

618
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Pairwise Correlation

619
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
There is no so-called direction

620
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
But if you use other

621
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
For example, there is a so-called Bayesian Network

622
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
If you use that method

623
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
You can get the so-called

624
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Relation

625
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
You see this one on the right

626
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
This curve is actually symmetrical

627
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Because the method I use is Partial Correlation

628
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
With Simple Correlation

629
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
So here you can't see any relation

630
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
But if I use today

631
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
For example

632
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Bayesian Model Network

633
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
It will tell you that I have two

634
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
RIE and RIE2

635
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
The relationship between them

636
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Is it from 1 to 2 or 2 to 1

637
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
If you use Bayesian

638
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
You can get this information

639
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
But the one I use today

640
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I can't tell you the relation

641
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
So it becomes

642
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
It depends on how you get the evidence

643
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
It will tell you

644
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
You are

645
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
In fact, there is also this

646
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Your evidence

647
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Can be used

648
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
There is directionality

649
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
There is no directionality

650
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
You can also use weighted or unweighted

651
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
That is

652
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Each value represents a different strength

653
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Or you can also turn it into

654
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
A binary matrix

655
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
There is only 1 and 0

656
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
1 means it is not connected

657
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
0 means it is not connected

658
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Any other questions

659
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Then I will continue

660
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Okay, next one

661
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
It's more about

662
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
The experiment I'm going to talk about

663
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Because I'm actually now

664
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
In

665
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Our lab

666
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
There is a called

667
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Pacific Parkinson's Research Center

668
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
So our

669
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Most of the subjects are

670
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Patients with Parkinson's

671
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
And some normal control

672
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
What we are mainly talking about

673
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Is whether we can

674
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Use functional connectivity

675
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
To find the so-called biological indicator

676
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
We call it biomarker

677
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
If we can find this biomarker

678
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
The first one is

679
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Can increase the diagnosis rate

680
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
If you don't know

681
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
How sick this person is

682
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
You can scan his brain

683
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Then use this method

684
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
You can roughly classify

685
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Is he very serious

686
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
For example, today

687
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,040
There is a person

688
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
The diagnosis is early

689
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
But you want to know

690
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
For example, after 10 years or 5 years

691
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
How is his condition

692
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Do we need to take some preventive measures

693
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
If we have this kind of information

694
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
We can also predict

695
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
What will happen in 5 or 10 years

696
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
In short

697
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Because there were a lot of research

698
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Also using

699
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Racine state fMRI

700
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
These studies have reported

701
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Whether you are using graph theory

702
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Or so-called dynamic functional connectivity

703
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
You can find

704
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Some differences between patients and normal people

705
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
These patients

706
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Not just limited to

707
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Parkinson's

708
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
For example, Alzheimer's

709
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Or some depression

710
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Or bipolar disorder, etc.

711
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
So what we mainly see today

712
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Is if

713
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
We are purely talking about Parkinson's disease

714
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Can we use

715
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Racine state functional connectivity

716
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Find a so-called biomarker

717
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Before that, there are two important

718
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Concepts to introduce first

719
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Brain organization and dynamic functional connectivity

720
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
So actually this

721
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
I have talked about the previous background

722
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Brain organization

723
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
You use graph theory

724
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Then get a lot of numbers

725
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Different numbers

726
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Will represent different network features

727
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
These features

728
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Also represent

729
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
So-called brain organization

730
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
There are two points here

731
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
For example, there are two principles

732
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
The first one is

733
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Functional integration

734
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
It means to look at the message

735
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Neural network message

736
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
In the whole system

737
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Then the other one is

738
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Functional segregation

739
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
In a single system

740
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
In fact, we can say

741
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
The human brain is in

742
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
A balance between segregation and integration

743
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
It's not all integration

744
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
But it won't

745
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
It's all segregation

746
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Then I think

747
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
If you are doing

748
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
For example, when you are doing

749
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Higher-level work

750
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
You need integration

751
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Because you have different areas of the brain

752
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
To cooperate with each other

753
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
To complete this work

754
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
If you do it very simply

755
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
For example, I just need to reach out and get a drink

756
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
This action may be

757
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Simpler, not too much effort

758
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Then it's more like segregation

759
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
So we will say

760
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
This is the balance between these two things

761
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
The other one is the dynamic functional connectivity

762
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
We usually

763
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
We all say

764
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
We will use the so-called time-varying method

765
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
To measure dynamic functional connectivity

766
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
This method

767
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
There are many different

768
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Different methods

769
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
One of the methods I will talk about later is called sliding window

770
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
It is one of the many different methods

771
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Then that method is

772
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
So far

773
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Most commonly used

774
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Just like we just said

775
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Because the brain is not a stationary system

776
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
So you need to know

777
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
How does it change in time?

778
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Then in our research today

779
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Do you want

780
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
The most interesting thing is to know

781
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
How does the brain connect with the disease?

782
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
How does the brain connect with cognitive functions?

783
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Here is

784
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
The main method of this experiment

785
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Let me adjust

786
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
it

787
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
There are a lot of parameters

788
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
This is a simple experiment

789
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
We have 10

790
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
There are 12

791
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
This is their

792
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Demographic

793
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Because

794
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
PD patients are usually

795
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Old

796
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
50

797
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
More than 55 years old

798
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Older people are more likely to have this disease

799
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
And

800
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
There are more male patients

801
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
So I usually see PD patients

802
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
It is not surprising that there are more male patients

803
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
And then

804
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
UBTRS

805
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
This thing

806
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
It's a bit like

807
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
From nature

808
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
The indicator of the disease

809
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
If this indicator is higher, it means that this patient

810
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
More serious

811
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
It's actually a bit like

812
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Bigger

813
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
We actually

814
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
After this, we can divide it into

815
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Many different indicators

816
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Each indicator represents a certain

817
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Symptoms

818
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
This means

819
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,040
How slow is the patient's action

820
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Trauma

821
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Tremor

822
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Rigidity

823
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
PIGT

824
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Postural Instability

825
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
And Gay Disorder

826
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
It means

827
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
His balance is not very good

828
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Coordination between actions

829
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
HNY

830
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
This is another

831
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
If you want to know

832
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
This patient

833
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
How serious

834
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Stage 2 to 5

835
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
2.5 is mild

836
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Not very serious

837
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
The most serious is 5 to 6

838
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
That's more serious

839
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Usually when we do the experiment

840
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
We need someone to cooperate

841
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
So we all follow the mild patient

842
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
About 2 to 3

843
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
And disease duration

844
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
How many days have they changed

845
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
This is their

846
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Out of a dosage

847
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Some people will

848
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Do research on drugs

849
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
We usually record

850
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Their condition

851
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
This is called apathy

852
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
It actually describes

853
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Many patients with Parkinson's

854
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
They lost their usual mood

855
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Become a couch potato

856
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Don't want to do anything

857
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Can't do anything

858
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
We call this condition apathy

859
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Another one is depression

860
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Although it is not

861
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Mental disorder

862
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
It will cause depression

863
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Or anxiety

864
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
We all record

865
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
The last one is

866
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Montreal Cognitive Assessment

867
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
The main purpose is to measure

868
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Their cognitive function

869
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
These are all the clinical data

870
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
What we will do later

871
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Is to use

872
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Graph theory

873
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
And dynamic function

874
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
To measure

875
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Their

876
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Function

877
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
And try to

878
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Compare this function

879
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
With the clinical data

880
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
To see which data

881
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Is related to their brain

882
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
I think

883
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Let's talk about

884
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Parkinson's disease

885
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
We call it

886
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Neurodegeneration disease

887
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
It is caused by

888
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Neurodegeneration

889
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
What is neurodegeneration

890
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Dopamine depletion

891
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
It is caused by

892
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Neurodegeneration

893
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
So

894
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
There is not enough dopamine

895
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
In the brain

896
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Dopamine is a very important neurotransmitter

897
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Without this substance

898
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
There will be a lot of behavior

899
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Can't work normally

900
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
And so on

901
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Where is this dopamine

902
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
There is a place called

903
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Substantial Nigra

904
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
It will be here

905
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
The black part

906
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
In the middle of the brain

907
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
In a deep place

908
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
If you zoom in

909
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
It looks like this

910
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
This is a normal person's

911
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Substantial Nigra

912
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
You can see the black part

913
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Substantial Nigra

914
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Latin means black

915
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
This is the place where dopamine is produced

916
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
This is the patient

917
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
You can see the black part

918
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
There is not much black

919
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
It means

920
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
The patient who produces dopamine is dead

921
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
So there is not much

922
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Dopamine

923
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
The main symptoms

924
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
You can see resting tremor

925
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
If you tell them to relax

926
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
It will move

927
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Even his shoulder blades will move

928
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Brachycardia is very slow

929
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
For example, he walks very slowly

930
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
Take things

931
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
The whole action is not very slow

932
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Rigidity is stiff

933
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
We usually bend our hands

934
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Then we will lose strength

935
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Then they bend back

936
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
In this process

937
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
You can feel that his action is very stiff

938
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Then the other side

939
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Postural problem

940
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
There will be problems with their balance

941
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Many patients will fall easily

942
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
The body is also very uncoordinated

943
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
In addition, in recent years

944
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Many people are very interested in

945
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Non-motor symptoms

946
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
In addition to these

947
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
There are also some

948
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Not so related to exercise

949
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Not so related to action

950
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
For example

951
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
If you have seen

952
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
I forgot if it was science or nature

953
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
General scientific reports

954
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
They mentioned

955
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Many people think Parkinson's disease

956
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
Has a lot to do with gastrointestinal diseases

957
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
There are many, many patients

958
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Complaining about gastrointestinal diseases

959
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
Many people

960
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Many patients

961
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Complaining about gastrointestinal diseases

962
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
So there is also a vote

963
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Researchers are now studying

964
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Related to gastrointestinal diseases and Parkinson's disease

965
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
I am more interested in

966
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
cognitive functions

967
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Although they

968
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
The main problem you see

969
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Is action

970
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
But their cognitive functions

971
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Changed a lot

972
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
The most obvious is

973
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Concentration and execution

974
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
If you ask them to do

975
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Very simple cognitive tasks

976
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
They can do very well

977
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
But if you ask them to do very complicated

978
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Need to keep switching

979
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Method

980
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
They are easy to fail

981
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
So this is a

982
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Proof

983
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Their cognitive functions

984
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
There is a little degradation

985
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
As for the data I used

986
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Resistive Function MRI

987
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,040
A total of 8 minutes

988
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Then I

989
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
There is one here

990
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Tell you

991
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
How do we do the experiment

992
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
What is the so-called data

993
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
This picture is MRI

994
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
You see

995
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
MRI machine

996
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Usually we ask the patient to lie on the examination bed

997
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Then the doctor will put

998
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
In the middle, this is a button

999
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Search for them

1000
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Then the bed will rise

1001
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Send the patient to the center of the entire machine

1002
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Because the magnetic field in the middle is more stable

1003
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Then we started

1004
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Scan

1005
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
One thing you need to say

1006
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
MRI's noise is very loud

1007
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
So we will give the patient

1008
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Earplugs

1009
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Protect their hearing

1010
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
Because it is a magnetic field

1011
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
So there can be no metal on the body

1012
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
For example, keys, wallets, rings

1013
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
All have to be taken down

1014
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Including women's underwear

1015
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
So for the time being

1016
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
How to change clothes

1017
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Then this is the file

1018
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
The image we got

1019
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
In principle

1020
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
We will scan two images

1021
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
The most basic

1022
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
One is called T1 Weighted Imaging

1023
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
This is to provide you a structural image

1024
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
You can see it clearly

1025
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
This image will tell you where the brain is

1026
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Gray is gray

1027
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
White is white

1028
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
The empty place in the middle

1029
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
There is water

1030
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Brain

1031
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
These two are eyeballs

1032
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
The middle is the air

1033
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
This image provides you a very clear

1034
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Information on the structure

1035
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
In addition, we will scan the functional imaging

1036
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
We call Bolt Signal

1037
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Here is written

1038
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
This image is physical

1039
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
If you don't deal with it, you can't see anything

1040
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
You can only see the middle

1041
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
CSF

1042
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Next to it

1043
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
You can't clearly define the brain

1044
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Gray and white

1045
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
So when we analyze

1046
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
The point is to analyze this image

1047
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Ok

1048
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Because actually

1049
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
The principle of FMI is quite complicated

1050
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
This is what I have found so far

1051
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
I have seen the simplest and most powerful

1052
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
A picture can be introduced to everyone

1053
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
CSF is in

1054
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
When the nervous system is active

1055
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
It needs oxygen, oxygen and blood

1056
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
So here is

1057
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Now the nervous system is active

1058
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
The blood vessels near the nervous system

1059
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
Start to increase blood flow

1060
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Fresh blood

1061
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
To this place

1062
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,040
So here you will find

1063
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
A lot of fresh blood

1064
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Because oxygen needs to enter the nervous system

1065
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
Fresh blood will come

1066
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
There are a lot of different

1067
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
There are a lot of new oxygen here

1068
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
Then in

1069
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Exhaustive blood vessels

1070
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
When interchanging

1071
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
It will produce a signal

1072
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
We can produce a signal

1073
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
Because MRI is

1074
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Strong magnetic field

1075
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
We used to learn that Faraday's law

1076
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
Magnetic field

1077
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Because of the change in magnetic field

1078
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
It will produce an electric signal

1079
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Will be just

1080
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Receive the electric signal

1081
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
After that, it will go through a lot of

1082
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Different image processing

1083
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
You will get it

1084
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
You will see this image

1085
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
In addition

1086
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Exhaustive and

1087
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Exhaustive blood vessels and

1088
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
The imbalance of the oxygen blood vessels

1089
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Will cause the signal

1090
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
So

1091
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
The picture we just talked about

1092
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
The so-called Tom Cruise

1093
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Is this thing

1094
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
After we get this thing

1095
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
We can start the follow-up analysis

1096
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Of course the story is not that simple

1097
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Because from you get the signal

1098
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
You can analyze

1099
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
There are a lot of things to do

1100
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,040
To correct the difference in time

1101
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
To correct the difference in space

1102
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
Sometimes it may shake your head

1103
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
You can't just take his data

1104
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
You have to correct these things first

1105
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
These things we call preprocessing

1106
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
I didn't talk too much today

1107
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Just let you know

1108
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
The difference in time and space

1109
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
The focus part will be

1110
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
How do you analyze them

1111
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Wait a minute

1112
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,040
Is there any

1113
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Image acquisition

1114
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
Can i ask a question

1115
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,040
Is there any problem with the scene

1116
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Is the scene

1117
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
Did you get this picture

1118
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
You got this picture

1119
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Then you turn it like this

1120
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
Then you use

1121
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Turn it into this picture

1122
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
After sending this picture in

1123
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Then he will give you this

1124
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
His

1125
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Regional interest

1126
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
You have to set a few points on the picture

1127
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Then he will find it

1128
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
How do you know

1129
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
He asked you

1130
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
If we get this picture

1131
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
To this side

1132
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Basically how to get there

1133
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Because I omitted a lot of things

1134
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
So

1135
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
I'll talk about it now

1136
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
If we do it in our lab

1137
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
We will get this T1 and Bolt signal

1138
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Then we will throw T1

1139
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
To a software called FreeSurfer

1140
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
The purpose is to do so-called

1141
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
That's why I got those

1142
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
RIERR333

1143
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
We take this T1

1144
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
We put each brain area

1145
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Label up

1146
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
Give him an ID

1147
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
Then we put this at the same time

1148
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
The image obtained by FMI

1149
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
To do the pre-processing

1150
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
After the pre-processing

1151
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
We want to put this T1 with the label

1152
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Two FMI in place

1153
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,040
Because they say

1154
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
The subject's head won't move too much

1155
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
But we still have to put these two images in place

1156
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
To make sure

1157
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
The one we see

1158
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
For example, the area seen on T1

1159
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
On FMI

1160
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
Is the same area

1161
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
So this is very important

1162
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
When we put T1 and FMI in place

1163
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
We told the computer

1164
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
Let's define a few RIERR333

1165
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
From T1

1166
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
If there are 100

1167
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
I told the computer

1168
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
I want 90

1169
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
All listed

1170
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
There is a step called

1171
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Time course extraction

1172
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
After we put these two in place

1173
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
I said these 90 RIERR333

1174
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
You go get their time course

1175
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
For example, the first RIERR333

1176
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Here

1177
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
I'll take his time course

1178
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Take it out

1179
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Then the second RIERR333

1180
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
I'll take his

1181
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
Just like this

1182
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
How big is that RIERR333

1183
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
How big can it be

1184
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Actually this depends on you

1185
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
How to do cortical postulation

1186
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,040
Basically

1187
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
This

1188
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,040
The resolution is 1x1x1mm

1189
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
If there is

1190
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
Some areas will be bigger

1191
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,040
For example, if you have a prefrontal cortex

1192
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
It's a big piece

1193
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
If you want a very small one

1194
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
Anterior cingulate cortex will be smaller

1195
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
So that doesn't necessarily depend on your brain area

1196
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
What do you usually decide

1197
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
What do you usually decide

1198
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Ha ha ha

1199
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
This is a very tricky question

1200
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Ha ha ha

1201
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
If you look at this area

1202
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
There is no change at all

1203
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
It's in another area

1204
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
So now most people

1205
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Tend to use

1206
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
It's a bit like watching you do postulation

1207
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
How many brain areas do you have

1208
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
Usually

1209
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
At least

1210
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
There should be more than 90

1211
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
I know there are more than 100 in FreeSurfer

1212
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
A lot of people take out more than 100 brain areas

1213
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
Because he doesn't know which one he wants to see

1214
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Just take out all the brain areas

1215
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
Take out all the information

1216
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
Some people are very specific

1217
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
They assume

1218
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Which brain area has a special relationship with which brain area

1219
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
They want to see

1220
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
They will have a purpose

1221
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Select those brain areas first

1222
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,040
But indeed

1223
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
At the beginning, when I was writing articles

1224
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
You write articles

1225
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
The question that often comes back is why do you choose these brain areas

1226
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
Ha ha ha

1227
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
So now people

1228
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Because I think it's a bit of a avoidance

1229
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Plus you really don't know

1230
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
Where is the change

1231
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
All brain areas

1232
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
Ha ha ha

1233
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
Ha ha ha

1234
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Ha ha ha

1235
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Ha ha ha

1236
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
Ha ha ha

1237
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
Ha ha ha

1238
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
In fact

1239
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
It should be said that we already have

1240
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
Different software and different

1241
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
So-called templates

1242
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
You will get different brain areas

1243
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
In fact, this is indeed

1244
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
There is a big problem in doing imaging

1245
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
Generally speaking

1246
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
My answer will be

1247
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,040
You will

1248
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
We will have a defined brain area

1249
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
For example, you are doing free surfer

1250
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
You must know

1251
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
In FreeSurfer

1252
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
The brain areas in that list

1253
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
We want these

1254
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
There is another one called AAL

1255
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
Another template

1256
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
In another software

1257
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
If you say this is AAL template

1258
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
We probably know what brain areas

1259
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
In principle

1260
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
I don't think they are too different

1261
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
But there is a vote of people

1262
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
People who specialize in so-called postulation

1263
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
They will tell you which one

1264
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
Different templates will have different

1265
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
Disadvantages

1266
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
Last year

1267
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
I don't know if you have seen that report

1268
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,040
There was a paper last year

1269
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Nature

1270
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
There is a Human Connectome Project in the United States

1271
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
They are a few thousand less

1272
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Then they

1273
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
Use the information of those thousands of people

1274
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
And at the same time it also includes

1275
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,040
Different modalities

1276
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,040
For example, MIT1 image has functional images

1277
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
There is also T2

1278
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
Or Proton Density Modeling

1279
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
Many different images

1280
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
All modalities are put together

1281
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,040
Use all these modalities

1282
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,040
To build another template

1283
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
Then I remember

1284
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,040
More than 100 brain areas than we currently know

1285
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,040
More than 200

1286
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
So this becomes

1287
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,040
How do you define your brain area

1288
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,040
It's a bit tricky

1289
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
At present we can only say

1290
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
Which template you use

1291
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Or which software you use

1292
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
We probably know what your so-called brain areas are

1293
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,040
Any other questions?

1294
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,040
For example

1295
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
For example, that area

1296
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,040
If you have big or small

1297
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,040
You can set big or small

1298
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
For example, when you are small

1299
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
Its signal is very strong

1300
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
But when you have a large area

1301
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,040
You have to remove the signal

1302
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
Actually there is

1303
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,040
I always don't believe

1304
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,040
For example, there are some things in the brain area

1305
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,040
Its signal is very, very bad

1306
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Because it happens to be interconnected with the air

1307
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,040
You can see here

1308
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,040
There is still a brain area here

1309
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,040
This is the prefrontal cortex

1310
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
But it is already close to the sinus

1311
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,040
So it's very close to this place

1312
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,040
It looks okay in T1

1313
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,040
But in FMR, you can see it's super bad

1314
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,040
Half of the frontal area is gone

1315
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,040
For example, in the frontal area

1316
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,040
Some very small areas

1317
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
Such as the frontal pole

1318
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
That area is very small and close to the air

1319
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
So its FMR signal is super bad

1320
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,040
I usually

1321
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,040
My approach is

1322
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,040
I don't want to look at that area

1323
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,040
If your signal is already very bad

1324
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
You see it again

1325
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
What do you say

1326
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,040
This is because

1327
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,040
It's caused by the difference in FMR

1328
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
Or is it because your own signal is bad

1329
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,040
So my approach is

1330
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,040
Put those too small areas

1331
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,040
Or in that kind of signal

1332
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,040
I don't want those areas

1333
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,040
Is there any

1334
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,040
Is there any area

1335
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
Where the signal is bad

1336
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,040
Frontal

1337
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,040
The area closest to the frontal

1338
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Because it's too close to the air

1339
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
There will be a so-called partial volume effect

1340
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,040
If you look at this picture

1341
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,040
The signal is bad in the front area

1342
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,040
And then there is the orbital frontal cortex

1343
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,040
This is close to the nasal cavity

1344
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,040
There is a lot of air there, so the signal is bad

1345
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,040
And then the other place is the temporal pole

1346
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
Just a little bit in front of the temporal

1347
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
And then there is the inferior temporal cortex

1348
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,040
At the very bottom of the temporal

1349
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,040
Because it's already close to the skull base

1350
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,040
So those places

1351
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
I usually see

1352
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
If you actually see it

1353
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,040
The whole information sharing

1354
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
If you find that there is an important change

1355
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,040
If it's there, I'll be a little hesitant

1356
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,040
Then go back and see if my image blurring is good

1357
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,040
Decide again

1358
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,040
Do I believe him

1359
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,040
Is there anything else

1360
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,040
Ok let's go next

1361
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Ok this is a bit

1362
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
Be a little patient

1363
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,040
Because this is a bit

1364
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
It's the background I just talked about

1365
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,040
Background for this experiment

1366
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
Now I'm going to talk about

1367
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
The method used for this experiment

1368
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,040
Then you will see

1369
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
The first thing I want to talk about is

1370
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

1371
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,040
I use sliding window

1372
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,040
This blue is the so-called fMRI time core

1373
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,040
That's what we've been talking about

1374
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,040
The most important thing when doing sliding window

1375
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,040
The first step is that you have to define

1376
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,040
Your so-called window length

1377
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,040
How big is your window

1378
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,040
I use 20 time points here

1379
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,040
That is to say

1380
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,040
I only include

1381
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,040
The first 20 time points

1382
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
Then I do

1383
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,040
Correlation, I use Pearson's correlation here

1384
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,040
Then I will get a metric

1385
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,040
This metric means

1386
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,040
I have 54

1387
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
hri

1388
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,040
Is the relationship between these 54 hri

1389
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,040
After finishing here

1390
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,040
I will move my window forward

1391
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,040
Do the same thing

1392
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,040
You will get the second metric

1393
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,040
How long does a time point usually last

1394
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
It depends on your MRI

1395
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Scanning parameters

1396
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,040
We have two seconds here

1397
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,040
Then you keep doing the same thing

1398
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,040
Until you finish

1399
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,040
All the fMRI time cores

1400
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,040
After that, I have a total of

1401
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,040
221 window correlation metrics

1402
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Then the next

1403
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
One important thing is

1404
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,040
I got so many metrics

1405
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,040
Each one is not the same

1406
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
How do I report

1407
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,040
What is their variability

1408
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,040
Here we calculate 7

1409
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,040
I call it network feature

1410
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,040
According to these

1411
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,040
According to these metrics

1412
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,040
I calculate some numbers

1413
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,040
Each number represents

1414
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,040
Variability

1415
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,040
For example, the first one I call it

1416
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,040
Network variation

1417
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,040
The first one is very simple

1418
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,040
We want to see the overall variability

1419
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,040
The first one and the second

1420
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,040
Correlation metrics

1421
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,040
Take all the numbers and subtract them

1422
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,040
Then for each

1423
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,040
221 metrics

1424
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,040
Do the same thing on average

1425
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,040
So the numbers we get

1426
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,040
It's a bit like

1427
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,040
On average

1428
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,040
The variability of your entire brain

1429
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,040
Then the second

1430
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,040
Network power

1431
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,040
This is actually very simple

1432
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,040
It mainly adds all the

1433
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
On average

1434
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
The purpose of this is to get

1435
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
It's a bit like on average

1436
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,040
The strength of your connectivity

1437
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Then here

1438
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,040
These are very similar from C to G and A

1439
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
But the difference is

1440
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,040
A is measuring the whole brain

1441
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
All numbers

1442
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
All elements in this metric

1443
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
But C to D

1444
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,040
C to G is

1445
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,040
For specific

1446
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,040
For example, this is called

1447
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,040
We only calculate

1448
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,040
The connection between the opposite brain areas

1449
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,040
Then

1450
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040
This is

1451
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,040
Then this is

1452
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,040
Same on the same side

1453
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Then divide it here

1454
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,040
On the left and on the right

1455
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
So you can see that the math

1456
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,040
Actually quite similar

1457
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,040
But when we count C to G

1458
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,040
The value we get is

1459
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,040
For example, when we count C

1460
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,040
We take the right angle

1461
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,040
Because the right angle represents

1462
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,040
Connectivity from left to right

1463
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
Then

1464
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,040
Here is the sliding window

1465
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,040
That's it

1466
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,040
The other graph theory

1467
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,040
I made it more fancy here

1468
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,040
I have a little bit

1469
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,040
The graph theory and the sliding window

1470
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,040
Combined together

1471
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,040
So in the front you will find that it is exactly the same as the sliding window

1472
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Until this step

1473
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
All the same

1474
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,040
The difference is that when I got this metric

1475
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,040
I didn't just add or subtract it

1476
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,040
Do some processing to calculate

1477
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,040
The so-called network feature

1478
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,040
Instead, I first apply a threshold

1479
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,040
Above a certain threshold

1480
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,040
I determine that these connections are real connections

1481
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Under this threshold

1482
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,040
It's not, it's an imprecision

1483
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,040
Then I put this

1484
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,040
Thresholded edges

1485
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,040
There is something called

1486
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,040
Brain Connectivity Toolbox

1487
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,040
This is a free download on the Internet

1488
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,040
You can run it with MATLAB

1489
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
After I throw it into the graph theory

1490
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,040
Every window I will get two

1491
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,040
Global Feature Measure

1492
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,040
And a Local Measure

1493
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,040
In fact, you can get more

1494
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,040
I just use these three for the time being

1495
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,040
The so-called Global Measure is

1496
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,040
There will be a number for each indicator

1497
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,040
Local Measure is

1498
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,040
See how many RRI it has

1499
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,040
How many numbers

1500
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,040
After all done

1501
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,040
I will have 221 stats

1502
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,040
Then there are three numbers for each window

1503
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,040
This is a bit complicated

1504
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,040
But in a nutshell

1505
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,040
I got a lot of different numbers

1506
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,040
Or the so-called network features

1507
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,040
Then the point is to see

1508
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Between patient and normal control

1509
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,040
What's the difference

1510
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,040
Then the next one

1511
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,040
it is good

1512
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,040
In fact, this is a bit

1513
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,040
Is there a problem

1514
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,040
It's okay, I want to ask this one

1515
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,040
You can continue to talk

1516
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,040
Don't ignore me

1517
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,040
After the analysis of the RRI

1518
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,040
We got the so-called

1519
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,040
These are the numbers

1520
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,040
When using the sliding window

1521
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,040
We will get the power

1522
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,040
The other

1523
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,040
Specific connection

1524
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,040
This is inter-hemisphere

1525
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,040
Then here is cross-hemisphere

1526
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,040
And in the same brain

1527
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
The same brain

1528
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,040
Then there is left and right

1529
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,040
The so-called flexibility

1530
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,040
In fact, we take the correlation value

1531
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,040
The correlation value of two windows

1532
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,040
Two minus and then equal

1533
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,040
So

1534
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,040
In the sliding window value

1535
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,040
If the value is higher

1536
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,040
It means its connectivity is more dynamic

1537
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,040
The more mutable

1538
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,040
Then dynamic graphical approach

1539
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,040
Is what we just talked about

1540
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,040
Combined graph theory and sliding window

1541
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,040
It's the same global feature

1542
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,040
I have two

1543
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,040
One is global efficiency

1544
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,040
The other is modularity

1545
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,040
It may be difficult to explain here

1546
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,040
I can't explain

1547
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,040
If you don't know

1548
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,040
You may need to check

1549
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,040
I will show you a paper later

1550
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,040
There may be a complete

1551
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,040
It's easier to understand

1552
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,040
In short, global efficiency

1553
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,040
The way it is calculated

1554
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,040
The shortest distance between these two points

1555
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,040
Make them equal

1556
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,040
Do the math

1557
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,040
Then equal

1558
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
This global efficiency represents

1559
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,040
Information

1560
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,040
The information of the neural network

1561
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,040
In the whole brain

1562
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,040
How well it is integrated

1563
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
So it is also

1564
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,040
An indicator of integration

1565
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,040
Modularity is just the opposite

1566
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,040
It is an indicator of segregation

1567
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,040
Modularity is actually

1568
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,040
Under this network

1569
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
Will this network be

1570
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,040
Will it be divided into

1571
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,040
Several different

1572
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,040
Small networks

1573
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,040
Then it is

1574
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,040
An indicator of segregation

1575
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,040
This means

1576
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,040
If the modularity value is higher

1577
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,040
It means

1578
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,040
In a single system

1579
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,040
Will be better integrated

1580
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,040
These two points are the opposite

1581
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,040
Integration and segregation

1582
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,040
Then another local measure

1583
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,040
Betweenness centrality

1584
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,040
This is the brain area

1585
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,040
This RRI

1586
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,040
How important it is in the whole network

1587
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,040
That is to see

1588
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,040
How many

1589
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,040
The shortest path

1590
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Through this

1591
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,040
This RRI

1592
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,040
If this number is higher

1593
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,040
It means that this brain area is more important

1594
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,040
It may be the hubs we just talked about

1595
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,040
After having these numbers

1596
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,040
The first thing we do is

1597
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,040
See the difference between the patient and the PD

1598
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,040
See if there is any difference

1599
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,040
In addition, these numbers

1600
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,040
Do a linear regression with clinical indicators

1601
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,040
See what happens

1602
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,040
Then the next one

1603
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,040
it is good

1604
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,040
I have to go to the bathroom

1605
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,040
This is the result

1606
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,040
I can tell you

1607
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,040
If you just do a two-sample t-test

1608
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,040
I can't see any difference

1609
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,040
Between the patient and the normal person

1610
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,040
Those numbers are completely the same

1611
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,040
But when we do simple

1612
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Peterson's correlation

1613
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,040
You can find

1614
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,040
This is the result of sliding window

1615
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,040
Dynamic connectivity

1616
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,040
You can find

1617
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,040
Let's look at the above two

1618
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,040
Age and network power

1619
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,040
And I put a small picture

1620
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,040
You can know which connection it is

1621
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
Inter-dimensional connectivity is related

1622
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,040
But I can tell you

1623
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,040
I think this is more like

1624
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,040
Normal human aging will occur

1625
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,040
Because I see this on Parkinson's patients

1626
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,040
But I also see it on normal people

1627
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,040
So this one

1628
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,040
We won't do so much discussion for the time being

1629
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,040
But the more interesting thing is this

1630
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,040
This is the postural instability

1631
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,040
Gait disorder

1632
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,040
That is, the number of their balance and body coordination

1633
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,040
With

1634
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,040
On the right

1635
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,040
This is the right

1636
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,040
Dynamic functional connectivity

1637
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
Related to them

1638
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,040
That is to say, the more serious the patient

1639
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,040
His right connectivity

1640
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,040
The harder it is

1641
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,040
Can't change

1642
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,040
Then this is the dose of the drug

1643
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,040
It's the same

1644
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,040
When the drug dose is higher

1645
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,040
They are also with

1646
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,040
This one

1647
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,040
This connectivity is also more rigid

1648
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,040
You can find

1649
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,040
If it's based on these two relationships

1650
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,040
We can roughly think

1651
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,040
Parkinson's disease

1652
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,040
Their

1653
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,040
Connectivity is not so dynamic

1654
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,040
More rigid

1655
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,040
In addition, because this is just

1656
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,040
Simple correlation

1657
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,040
We want to do postural correlation

1658
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,040
Is to remove some

1659
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,040
Effect

1660
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,040
For example, age

1661
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,040
If our condition for age is

1662
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,040
We remove the age

1663
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,040
If we do correlation again

1664
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,040
In fact, you will find that only this value

1665
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,040
Related

1666
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,040
The same thing is significant

1667
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,040
Only this value

1668
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,040
With these dynamic features

1669
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,040
Related

1670
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,040
Then next

1671
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,040
This is what I just said

1672
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,040
Dynamic

1673
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Graphical features

1674
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,040
Graph theory and dynamics

1675
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,040
Generally

1676
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,040
Red is PD

1677
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,040
Blue is normal control

1678
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,040
You can find that PD patients

1679
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,040
Generally

1680
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,040
Higher global efficiency

1681
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,040
This number also represents

1682
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,040
Signal

1683
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,040
How well the whole brain is integrated

1684
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,040
You will find that overall

1685
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,040
In fact, they are better than the patient

1686
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,040
This is a bit

1687
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,040
Make people feel

1688
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,040
Why is the patient better

1689
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,040
In fact, we think

1690
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,040
This is the so-called compensator effect

1691
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,040
Because

1692
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,040
We just said

1693
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,040
Because the patient's brain

1694
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,040
Their connectivity is more rigid

1695
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,040
Because it is more rigid

1696
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,040
So they become the existing

1697
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,040
Connectivity needs to be better integrated

1698
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,040
To maintain normal brain function

1699
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,040
Then next

1700
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,040
This is the so-called local measure

1701
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,040
That is, each subject

1702
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,040
There are several numbers

1703
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,040
Depends on how many RRI

1704
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,040
Each RRI will give you a number

1705
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,040
Because I am here

1706
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,040
Do dynamic graph theory

1707
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,040
So you can see that there are several different windows

1708
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,040
Generally you can see

1709
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,040
These brain areas

1710
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,040
PD and normal control

1711
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,040
There are significant differences

1712
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,040
Brain area

1713
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,040
A bit small

1714
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,040
Blue is normal

1715
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,040
Red is PD

1716
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,040
Normal people

1717
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,040
Most of them will show higher

1718
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,040
Centrality

1719
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,040
It means

1720
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,040
These brain areas

1721
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,040
Parkinson's patients

1722
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,040
Become less important

1723
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,040
Because between the centrality

1724
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,040
This brain area

1725
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,040
How important

1726
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,040
You can find that all of these

1727
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,040
Relatively low

1728
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,040
Then there are significant differences

1729
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,040
It is worth mentioning

1730
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,040
The red one

1731
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,040
They are called cortical hubs

1732
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,040
Blue

1733
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,040
The so-called cortical hubs

1734
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,040
So that's why

1735
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,040
I may have to jump out

1736
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,040
Tell you what hubs are

1737
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,040
The so-called hubs are actually

1738
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,040
It's important

1739
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,040
We are talking about

1740
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,040
If you are from Vancouver today

1741
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,040
Where we are now

1742
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,040
If you want to travel to Hamburg, Germany

1743
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,040
You have two options

1744
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,040
For example, this is Hansa Airlines

1745
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,040
You can take a plane to the most

1746
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,040
The simplest

1747
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,040
This is Zurich

1748
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Frankfurt or Munich

1749
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,040
You transfer from there

1750
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,040
Just turn once and you can go to Hamburg

1751
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,040
Then the one below is

1752
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,040
Airbus

1753
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,040
If you take off from Vancouver

1754
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,040
It's a bit small

1755
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,040
But it's also Zurich

1756
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,040
Frankfurt and Munich

1757
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,040
You can go to Hamburg

1758
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,040
In this case

1759
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,040
Zurich, Munich and Frankfurt

1760
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,040
The so-called hubs

1761
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,040
On the plane

1762
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,040
It's the so-called hubs

1763
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,040
Because they have more

1764
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,040
They have more different

1765
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,040
Airways

1766
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,040
Can go to different cities

1767
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,040
Similarly

1768
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,040
There are so-called hubs in the human brain

1769
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,040
Here on the right

1770
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,040
You can see

1771
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,040
All of these points are cortical hubs

1772
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,040
According to

1773
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,040
Previous research

1774
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,040
Then the yellow one

1775
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,040
Functional hubs

1776
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,040
In fMRI or other functional images

1777
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,040
Hubs obtained

1778
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,040
The red one

1779
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,040
Functional and structural

1780
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,040
In functional studies

1781
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,040
You will see

1782
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,040
Structural studies

1783
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,040
Structural images can also be seen

1784
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,040
The bigger one

1785
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,040
Rich club

1786
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,040
These big hubs

1787
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,040
Between each other

1788
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,040
Stronger

1789
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,040
Stronger

1790
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,040
More links

1791
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,040
The point is to tell everyone

1792
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,040
These hubs

1793
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,040
Play an important role in the entire brain network

1794
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,040
Because they have to

1795
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,040
Like a logistics center

1796
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,040
It has to distribute these messages

1797
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,040
Then direct them to

1798
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,040
The destination they need to reach

1799
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,040
Then we slightly

1800
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,040
Functional hubs and structural hubs

1801
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,040
What's the difference

1802
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Someone here asked

1803
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,040
If I use fMRI today

1804
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,040
Graph theory

1805
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,040
I can find hubs

1806
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,040
Functional hubs

1807
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,040
If I use

1808
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,040
Structural images

1809
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,040
Diffusion-weighted imaging

1810
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,040
Or

1811
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,040
DWI or DSI

1812
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,040
Structural images

1813
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,040
Hubs obtained

1814
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,040
Structural hubs

1815
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,040
The main difference is

1816
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
One uses fMRI

1817
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,040
Why

1818
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,040
They are different

1819
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,040
I asked someone

1820
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,040
The researcher told me

1821
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,040
His own suspicion is

1822
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,040
fMRI

1823
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,040
Very indirect measurement

1824
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,040
The signal may contain

1825
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,040
A lot of impurities

1826
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,040
Blood vessels, breathing, heartbeats

1827
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,040
He personally doubts

1828
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,040
The signal in fMRI is too impure

1829
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,040
So it will cause

1830
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,040
Your hubs to be different

1831
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,040
Hubs

1832
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,040
Left and right symmetry

1833
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,040
Another question

1834
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,040
Hubs are left and right symmetry

1835
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,040
Most of us think

1836
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,040
Hubs are left and right symmetry

1837
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,040
For example

1838
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,040
This is

1839
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,040
Superior frontal cortex

1840
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,040
They are symmetry

1841
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,040
If you find the left

1842
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,040
The area on the right will also be hubs

1843
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,040
But there may be a little

1844
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,040
Slightly different

1845
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,040
The left may be less obvious

1846
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,040
But we think hubs are symmetry

1847
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,040
So which hub

1848
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,040
Will connect

1849
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,040
The other question is

1850
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,040
Which hub will connect

1851
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,040
So far

1852
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,040
We think this big

1853
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,040
Rich club

1854
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,040
There is a thing called rich club

1855
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,040
Organization

1856
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,040
These hubs

1857
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,040
Can be called super hubs

1858
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,040
Very powerful

1859
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,040
So many different

1860
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,040
So in these big hubs

1861
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,040
They form another

1862
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,040
Powerful network

1863
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,040
So this is what we call

1864
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,040
There will be interconnection

1865
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,040
Can

1866
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,040
Another last thing

1867
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,040
I want to tell you

1868
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,040
We can go back a little

1869
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,040
We just mentioned here

1870
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,040
The red ones are all hubs

1871
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,040
Insula, Precuneus

1872
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,040
Thalamus and Hippocampus

1873
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,040
The next one you can find

1874
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,040
Thalamus, Hippocampus

1875
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,040
Insula

1876
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,040
Just now

1877
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,040
We saw on PDs patient

1878
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,040
Those hubs are less important

1879
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,040
So our result

1880
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,040
Here is the whole conclusion

1881
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,040
The first one we said

1882
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,040
Can we use rich club function

1883
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,040
As a bio-marker

1884
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,040
I wrote potentially

1885
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,040
There are a lot of things we haven't measured

1886
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,040
For the current result

1887
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,040
This is possible

1888
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,040
Just now

1889
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,040
We did a linear regression

1890
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,040
You will find

1891
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,040
PDs patient

1892
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,040
Their function

1893
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,040
Reduce dynamics

1894
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,040
Especially with this number

1895
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,040
PIGD is related

1896
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,040
In addition

1897
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,040
Because PDs patient

1898
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,040
Most of the time they show

1899
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,040
Global efficiency

1900
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,040
Their connectivity

1901
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,040
Is better integrated

1902
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,040
As I said

1903
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,040
This is the so-called

1904
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,040
Compensatory effect

1905
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,040
This is the result of local measure

1906
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,040
You can see

1907
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,040
On PDs

1908
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,040
A lot of hubs

1909
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,040
Lose their importance

1910
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,040
This is actually

1911
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,040
Similar to other people's research

1912
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,040
Because they mentioned before

1913
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,040
These hubs are actually more sensitive

1914
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,040
They are more likely to be affected by diseases

1915
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,040
So our research

1916
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,040
It's a bit like

1917
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,040
Even on PDs

1918
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,040
These cortical hubs

1919
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,040
Easier to be affected by diseases

1920
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,040
Because they lost their importance

1921
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,040
The only one that is not a hub

1922
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,040
Pre-SMA

1923
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,040
Somato

1924
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,040
Pre-SMA is another

1925
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,040
A little bit in front of the motor cortex

1926
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,040
Brain area

1927
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,040
I found a paper

1928
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,040
A long time ago

1929
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,040
This paper describes

1930
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,040
Pre-SMA and SMA

1931
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,040
The function of this area

1932
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,040
Is to control

1933
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,040
So-called body coordination

1934
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,040
It's interesting that we found

1935
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,040
Dynamics and body coordination

1936
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,040
The PIGD indicator is related

1937
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,040
So our final result

1938
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,040
We proposed

1939
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,040
It is possible

1940
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,040
This pre-SMA

1941
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,040
You can only see it on PD

1942
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,040
Even if it is not a cortical hub

1943
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,040
Its importance is also reduced

1944
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,040
Maybe because it controls this function

1945
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,040
On PD

1946
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,040
Is affected

1947
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,040
That's it

1948
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,040
Thank you

1949
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,040
Can I ask a question?

1950
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,040
Yes

1951
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,040
Thank you for your sharing

1952
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,040
It's wonderful

1953
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,040
I have a comment

1954
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,040
On the conclusion

1955
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,040
I have a comment

1956
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,040
Ok

1957
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,040
First of all

1958
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,040
I am a EEG

1959
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,040
I am not an FHI

1960
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,040
But these

1961
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,040
These analyses are quite common

1962
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,040
I think it's quite interesting

1963
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,040
But I think

1964
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,040
Your first point

1965
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,040
Your research

1966
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,040
The fact is

1967
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,040
You want to use this as a biomarker

1968
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,040
In fact, I think

1969
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,040
A little

1970
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,040
A little bit of killing with a knife

1971
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,040
What do you mean?

1972
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,040
That is to say

1973
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,040
In fact, the diagnosis method

1974
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,040
All very clear

1975
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,040
But if you continue to draw a

1976
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,040
If you only pay attention to

1977
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,040
If you only pay attention to the effect level

1978
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,040
You have to spend so much energy

1979
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,040
FMI

1980
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,040
Then do these very complex analyses

1981
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,040
Then

1982
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,040
In fact, I think

1983
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,040
A little bit of killing with a knife

1984
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,040
That is

1985
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,040
A simple thing

1986
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,040
I think

1987
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,040
This kind of function

1988
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Especially for me

1989
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,040
Is Parkinson's subpopulation

1990
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,040
I think it should be easier

1991
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,040
Easier to do

1992
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,040
Psychology

1993
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,040
Life Function

1994
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,040
Then

1995
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,040
Why is it important?

1996
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,040
Because it seems to be my own

1997
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,040
Related

1998
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,040
Music

1999
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,040
Wait a minute

2000
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,040
I can't hear it now

2001
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,040
There is a child

2002
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,040
Talking

2003
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,040
The child is not on my side

2004
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,040
The child is not on my side

2005
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,040
The child is not on my side

2006
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,040
Ok

2007
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,040
Let me continue

2008
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,040
I think

2009
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,040
Take this set of tools to do subpopulation

2010
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,040
May be more interesting

2011
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,040
Because like

2012
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,040
Some people

2013
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,040
For example, there is a rhythm

2014
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,040
To help Parkinson's disease

2015
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,040
To help them control

2016
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,040
Action control

2017
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,040
Although it works very well for some people

2018
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,040
But on another group of people

2019
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,040
Some Parkinson's disease people

2020
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,040
The effect is very poor

2021
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,040
Then this aspect

2022
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,040
I don't know why

2023
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,040
Then I think

2024
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,040
There may also be such a problem

2025
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,040
Then I think

2026
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,040
You can find more

2027
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,040
General neuropsychological

2028
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,040
Can't do

2029
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,040
Then I think

2030
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,040
Rather than saying this is a biomarker

2031
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,040
I think

2032
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,040
This purpose will be stronger

2033
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,040
For me

2034
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,040
Ok

2035
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,040
Let me talk a little bit

2036
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,040
Because I'm a little lazy

2037
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,040
So I only put

2038
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,040
May be a biomarker

2039
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,040
In fact, we do this thing

2040
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,040
There are other purposes

2041
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,040
The first one is that I said at the beginning

2042
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,040
The so-called disease prediction

2043
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,040
The original

2044
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,040
The ideal state is

2045
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,040
Then build a very powerful

2046
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,040
Then we can

2047
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,040
Because of this statistical power

2048
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,040
Can

2049
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,040
Produce a

2050
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,040
It's a bit like a disease model

2051
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,040
Then if we have new patients

2052
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,040
When we come in

2053
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,040
We can put his data into this disease model

2054
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,040
To try

2055
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,040
Can we predict

2056
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,040
What is the situation after five or ten years

2057
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,040
Because we can't really wait for him

2058
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,040
After five or ten years

2059
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,040
Use some drugs to control

2060
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,040
If we find

2061
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,040
I knew it was possible

2062
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,040
Will become more serious

2063
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,040
Can we take some

2064
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,040
Preventive measures

2065
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,040
Then another

2066
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,040
The purpose is

2067
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,040
So far

2068
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,040
Although the drug results can be controlled

2069
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,040
Such as tremor

2070
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,040
These can be controlled quite well

2071
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,040
But there are a lot of patients

2072
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,040
In fact, there is no way to use drugs

2073
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,040
So recently there are some people

2074
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,040
Spent a lot of effort

2075
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,040
In the study of so-called cognitive training

2076
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,040
They hope to use non-invasive

2077
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,040
No need to use drugs

2078
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,040
Just use training

2079
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,040
Can treat Parkinson's

2080
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
Obstacle to cognitive function

2081
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,040
But before doing this

2082
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,040
You have to know their cognitive function first

2083
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,040
Their whole

2084
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,040
What is the Cognitive Profile

2085
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,040
And even which domain is most likely to be affected

2086
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,040
Or which brain area

2087
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,040
The brain area responsible for those cognitive functions

2088
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,040
Is the weakest

2089
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,040
Will be attacked

2090
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,040
So this is why

2091
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,040
When we do local measures

2092
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,040
These brain areas are actually in Parkinson's disease

2093
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,040
It's more dangerous and less likely to be attacked

2094
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,040
That is, if we want to develop

2095
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,040
Non-invasive

2096
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,040
Treatment

2097
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,040
We can say

2098
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,040
For example, pre-SMA

2099
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,040
We target this area

2100
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,040
Design some cognitive functions

2101
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,040
To strengthen the neural network of this area

2102
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,040
It is possible to use this way

2103
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,040
We can improve

2104
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,040
Its cognitive function

2105
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,040
A bit like this

2106
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,040
This is more interesting

2107
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,040
In addition

2108
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,040
I know

2109
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,040
My own research is

2110
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,040
When listening to a more recent pattern

2111
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,040
Pre-SMA disease is active

2112
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,040
This is an externalization

2113
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,040
Another question is

2114
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,040
For example

2115
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,040
In terms of signal interpretation

2116
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,040
You mentioned

2117
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,040
For example, a patient with Parkinson's disease

2118
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,040
Compared to a person with typical control

2119
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,040
Their signal

2120
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,040
Will be stronger

2121
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,040
Am I right?

2122
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,040
But you mentioned

2123
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,040
This is a conversation hypothesis

2124
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,040
But I don't know what you're talking about

2125
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,040
Because I've heard this hypothesis many times

2126
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,040
In fact, this hypothesis is true

2127
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,040
You can talk about it in reverse

2128
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,040
If the signal is strong, it is a conversation

2129
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,040
Where is the accuracy?

2130
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,040
Do you understand what I mean?

2131
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,040
I believe this is not my first question

2132
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,040
What do you think of this question?

2133
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,040
In fact, you asked this question

2134
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,040
Many clinical researchers are asking

2135
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:38,040
I would say

2136
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,040
If you are single

2137
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,040
For example, you only have fMRI data

2138
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,040
Then you see

2139
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,040
In theory, you expect patients to show

2140
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,040
Lower value

2141
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,040
But the result shows that the patient's value has risen

2142
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,040
This may be a conversation effect

2143
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,040
But if you want to talk about conversation effect

2144
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,040
You need to have another piece of data

2145
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,040
To support it

2146
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,040
For example, you have behavior

2147
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,040
When doing the same thing

2148
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,040
The patient did better than normal people

2149
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,040
In this case

2150
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,040
Or there is no difference

2151
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,040
We have another piece of data

2152
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,040
We can say it is a conversation effect

2153
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,040
In addition, in recent years

2154
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,040
There is a rather popular topic

2155
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,040
They are called male adaptation

2156
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,040
When you see the value rise

2157
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,040
It may not necessarily mean

2158
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,040
It is just a so-called male adaptation

2159
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,040
Maybe this connection

2160
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,040
It is controlled by another network

2161
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,040
But because of the disease

2162
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,040
The network that controls this connection

2163
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,040
It's not that good

2164
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,040
It has no male function

2165
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,040
It can't control that network

2166
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,040
If you control that connection

2167
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,040
Then you see the value of the connection

2168
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,040
You think it may be

2169
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,040
It may be a conversation effect

2170
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,040
But maybe it's just because

2171
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,040
The network that controls it

2172
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,040
There is no way to do it properly

2173
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,040
There may be a total pattern change

2174
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,040
It's not just a problem with the connectivity

2175
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,040
I think

2176
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,040
The data dimension is very large

2177
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,040
In fact, to explain

2178
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,040
I think it's very difficult

2179
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,040
I have another question

2180
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,040
It's about signal processing

2181
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,040
This is a more general connectivity issue

2182
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,040
That is to say

2183
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,040
If you use both signals

2184
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,040
If you look at it

2185
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,040
But since both signals are blood vessels

2186
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,040
The signal at each point in the blood vessel

2187
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,040
It's not independent

2188
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,040
My blood vessels have upstream and downstream

2189
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,040
My downstream signal is of course dependent

2190
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,040
How do you know

2191
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,040
How do you know

2192
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,040
This is a neural signal

2193
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,040
This is a neural connectivity signal

2194
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,040
Not a blood vessel connectivity signal

2195
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,040
I can tell you

2196
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,040
I have no way to know

2197
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,040
That's why I said before

2198
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,040
It's a very dirty signal

2199
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,040
It's very

2200
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,040
Not direct

2201
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,040
And very dirty

2202
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,040
Its signal actually includes

2203
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,040
For example, CBB, CBF

2204
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,040
All these things will affect

2205
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,040
Even the whole magnetic field

2206
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,040
Homogeneity will also affect you

2207
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,040
So frankly

2208
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,040
I have no way to know

2209
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,040
Many people use other

2210
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,040
Mathematical models

2211
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,040
For example, the balloon model

2212
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,040
If you want to analyze more

2213
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,040
More precise mathematical models

2214
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,040
It's possible to tell you

2215
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,040
In the end

2216
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,040
If you split the whole signal into many parts

2217
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,040
Which parts may not come from

2218
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,040
Neural is from other

2219
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,040
This is possible

2220
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,040
But I didn't list the mathematical model

2221
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,040
So at the moment I can only say

2222
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,040
The changes I see

2223
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,040
We can only assume

2224
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,040
Most of it comes from neural

2225
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,040
So we have to do a lot of pre-processing

2226
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,040
To ensure that the signals we get

2227
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,040
Are not artificial

2228
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,040
Not fake

2229
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,040
I have another

2230
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,040
Sorry, the last signal question

2231
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,040
Too often heard

2232
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,040
I never had an expert to ask me

2233
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,040
Sorry

2234
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,040
In addition, the structural hub you mentioned

2235
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,040
And the functional hub

2236
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,040
Can be different

2237
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,040
But I think there is a place

2238
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,040
I find it difficult to understand

2239
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,040
For example, if I have a functional hub today

2240
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,040
There must be a neural connection in the middle

2241
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,040
Right?

2242
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,040
That means I'm in the structure today

2243
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,040
For example, I went to scan the brain today

2244
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,040
I scanned a bunch of highways

2245
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,040
Then the neural highway does not go

2246
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,040
They go to the local alley

2247
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,040
Right?

2248
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,040
You just say

2249
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,040
I don't go to Taipei to Kaohsiung

2250
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,040
I just cut from Taichung today

2251
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,040
Cut to Hualien

2252
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,040
Go there

2253
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,040
Right

2254
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,040
How do you explain

2255
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,040
The difference between the two

2256
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,040
In addition to the signal problem

2257
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,040
How is it possible

2258
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,040
Right

2259
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,040
Actually, the question you asked

2260
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,040
No, but this is a good question

2261
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,040
There are a lot of things in this field

2262
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,040
Unanswered

2263
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,040
A lot of people spent a lot of effort to try to answer

2264
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,040
Then this is one of them

2265
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,040
Your question is actually discussing

2266
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,040
The so-called

2267
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,040
Connection between functional connectivity

2268
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,040
Structural connectivity

2269
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,040
This is a big

2270
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,040
It's like a star and a big field

2271
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,040
A lot of people are doing

2272
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,040
Just like us

2273
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,040
In theory

2274
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,040
If A and B are these two points

2275
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,040
There is a structural connection in the middle

2276
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,040
For example, there is a connection in the middle of the white matter

2277
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,040
So in theory

2278
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,040
When you see the functional connection

2279
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,040
In theory, you should also see the structural connection

2280
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,040
This makes sense

2281
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,040
Because you must have something to let you go

2282
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,040
When doing analysis

2283
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,040
We often see

2284
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,040
For example, between A and B

2285
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,040
There is a functional connection in the middle

2286
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,040
But there is no functional connection in the middle

2287
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,040
There are many different

2288
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,040
There are many roles

2289
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,040
There are many possibilities

2290
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,040
For example, between A and B

2291
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,040
For example, there is no white connection

2292
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,040
But maybe

2293
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,040
There is a third point C

2294
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,040
It connects A and B

2295
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,040
It is possible that the signal is from C

2296
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,040
It is possible that the signal is from A to C

2297
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,040
It is possible

2298
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,040
In addition to the signal and the possibility

2299
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,040
In addition to the signal and the possibility

2300
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,040
We can't

2301
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,040
We can't

2302
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,040
Tell you why

2303
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,040
This is why we have been trying

2304
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,040
Want to understand the functional connection

2305
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,040
The relationship between structural connection

2306
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,040
I have an idea

2307
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,040
Because like people

2308
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,040
Generally outside

2309
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,040
For example, our brain is being trained

2310
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,040
General daily life training

2311
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,040
For example, there will be a lot of complex visual and auditory scenarios

2312
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,040
For example, there will be a lot of complex visual and auditory scenarios

2313
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,040
You have to interact with a lot of people

2314
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,040
These should be well

2315
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,040
The brain has to deal with the most

2316
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,040
But today you lie in the FMI

2317
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,040
For example, it is a resting state

2318
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,040
And listen to a bunch of noise

2319
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,040
In fact, it is a very unnatural situation

2320
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,040
In fact, it is a very unnatural situation

2321
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,040
You just tell him

2322
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,040
I just don't want you to walk the highway today

2323
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,040
I just want you to walk a very strange one

2324
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,040
Then lie down for a few minutes

2325
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,040
So I think maybe

2326
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,040
Is it because of this reason

2327
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,040
Because it is not under the nature of nature

2328
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,040
So I can't find the function

2329
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,040
The same situation

2330
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,040
This is also possible

2331
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,040
This is also possible

2332
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,040
There is a kind

2333
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,040
In fact, when the resting state just came out

2334
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,040
A lot of people are

2335
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,040
There are a lot of discussions about this matter

2336
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,040
There is another way

2337
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,040
In addition to FMI

2338
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,040
You can use EEG or MEG

2339
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,040
Different modality

2340
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,040
To measure its functional

2341
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,040
EEG and MEG environment

2342
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,040
Compared to functional MRI

2343
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,040
Are closer to human normal living environment

2344
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,040
So in this way

2345
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,040
Maybe what you get

2346
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,040
Will be closer to normal

2347
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,040
Under the situation

2348
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,040
I hope so. Thank you for your answer.

2349
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,040
Sorry

2350
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,040
OK

2351
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,040
Any other questions?

2352
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,040
Can I continue to ask questions?

2353
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,040
Can I ask a question first?

2354
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,040
Follow Andrew's question

2355
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,040
OK

2356
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,040
Do you want to ask other questions?

2357
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,040
I might ask some

2358
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,040
Everyone's questions

2359
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,040
Then I will follow Andrew

2360
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,040
You just said

2361
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,040
How do you know

2362
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,040
Now the correlation

2363
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,040
Or any association

2364
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,040
The nerve

2365
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,040
Not the blood

2366
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,040
If

2367
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,040
I am not

2368
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,040
The expert in this area

2369
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,040
But I am thinking

2370
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,040
Is it possible

2371
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,040
It's a little strange

2372
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,040
Something big

2373
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,040
Into the blood vessel

2374
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,040
So this thing

2375
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,040
Will flow with the blood

2376
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,040
But this thing cannot be used by the nerve

2377
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,040
Then you can

2378
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,040
Measure this thing

2379
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,040
And cut it off

2380
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,040
In fact, this is a bit like

2381
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,040
I know

2382
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,040
In fact, this is a bit like what we are talking about

2383
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,040
Contrast Enhancement

2384
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,040
In any image

2385
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,040
In fact, this is often used in hospitals

2386
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,040
If it is MRI

2387
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,040
They will play a contrast called gadolinium

2388
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,040
This thing will not be

2389
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,040
Nerve-absorbed

2390
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,040
It mainly flows with the blood vessel

2391
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,040
Different places in the body

2392
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,040
But there is a problem

2393
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,040
If you are talking about

2394
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,040
Functional MRI

2395
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,040
You want to measure the nerve of the brain

2396
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,040
But once you get to the brain

2397
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,040
The so-called BBB is the blood vessel

2398
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,040
There are a lot of drugs that can't get to the brain

2399
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,040
So this is

2400
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,040
The problem of contrast

2401
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,040
In fact, another solution

2402
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,040
There are a lot of people in the so-called multimodal modality

2403
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,040
Because we all know

2404
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,040
FMR has many shortcomings

2405
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,040
So far we have not been able to

2406
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,040
To overcome these shortcomings

2407
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,040
Then we add another modality

2408
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,040
The other modality

2409
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,040
It has no FMR shortcomings

2410
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,040
We hope to combine the advantages

2411
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,040
For example, you often hear

2412
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,040
The so-called FMR and EEG simultaneous recording

2413
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,040
The so-called FMR and EEG simultaneous recording

2414
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,040
That is, the veterinarian brings the EEG into the FMR at the same time

2415
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,040
That is, the veterinarian brings the EEG into the FMR at the same time

2416
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,040
Then you can go to the FMR signal at the same time

2417
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,040
You can get EEG again

2418
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,040
EEG signals are cleaner

2419
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,040
It's less affected by the blood vessel

2420
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,040
But at the same time

2421
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,040
This method will cause the EEG signal to be very bad

2422
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,040
Because as soon as you enter the FMR

2423
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,040
It will often affect the signal

2424
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,040
So I can only say

2425
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,040
There is no absolute good way

2426
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,040
But many people have tried

2427
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,040
Want to solve the shortcomings of FMR

2428
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,040
Okay, I'm done

2429
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,040
My other question has nothing to do with this

2430
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,040
So who asked first

2431
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,040
My own background

2432
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,040
Is doing machine learning and neuroscience

2433
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,040
Then

2434
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,040
I'm very curious about Mesoteli

2435
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,040
I'm very curious about Mesoteli

2436
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,040
Like you guys

2437
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,040
For us

2438
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,040
Because you use sliding windows

2439
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,040
Then there is overlapping LAM

2440
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,040
In a sense

2441
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,040
You make the strong signal stronger

2442
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,040
The weak signal becomes weaker

2443
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,040
So the rest are those

2444
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,040
Very strong connectivity nodes

2445
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,040
Then you turn this connectivity

2446
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,040
Then you turn this connectivity

2447
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,040
Just look at the hub

2448
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,040
You can catch some features

2449
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,040
Then we have some cooperation here

2450
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,040
The plan is to say

2451
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,040
If we don't go to the feature part

2452
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,040
We just use the connectivity matrix

2453
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,040
To do features

2454
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,040
Will it be better

2455
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,040
So usually you will find this connectivity matrix very noisy

2456
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,040
Then like we did

2457
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,040
If we take the matrix between different patients

2458
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,040
To do a distance computation

2459
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,040
We wanted to predict the result

2460
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,040
Is it possible to see it in our machine learning method

2461
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,040
For example, people with Parkinson's

2462
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,040
Brain activity will be more like

2463
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,040
Then there is a non-connectivity

2464
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,040
And distance will be farther

2465
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,040
But it doesn't seem to have this effect

2466
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,040
I want to ask you

2467
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,040
Is there any theory

2468
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,040
Or if it's different people, the brain operation is too different

2469
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,040
So they all have Parkinson's

2470
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,040
Their brain connectivity may not be the same

2471
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,040
There is something called intersubject variability

2472
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,040
This is actually

2473
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,040
People who do clinical research often encounter

2474
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,040
Headache problem

2475
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,040
Although our current research is actually a bit

2476
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,040
I think it's a bit oversimplified

2477
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,040
We all say

2478
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,040
A group of patients and a group of normal people

2479
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,040
We often say that this is the patient group

2480
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,040
We see this thing

2481
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,040
But in fact, because of intersubject variability

2482
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,040
Everyone's brain is different

2483
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,040
Everyone is unique

2484
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,040
The degree of illness

2485
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,040
May not be the same

2486
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,040
So this is a reason

2487
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,040
Why you can't see

2488
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,040
Because everyone is really different

2489
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,040
This thing

2490
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,040
In our lab and our research center

2491
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,040
Many people encounter this problem

2492
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,040
Another thing is

2493
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,040
The method of sliding windows

2494
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,040
Actually so far

2495
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,040
Although sliding windows are the most commonly used

2496
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,040
In fact, frankly, because it is the simplest

2497
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,040
So everyone uses it, but it has a lot of problems

2498
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,040
The first one is how long your window length is

2499
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,040
Then the second one is if your overlap

2500
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,040
How long is your overlap

2501
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,040
These are all some problems

2502
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,040
So now more and more people

2503
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,040
Will propose different ways

2504
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,040
To measure the so-called

2505
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,040
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

2506
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,040
For example, there seems to be one

2507
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,040
What is it called

2508
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,040
DCC

2509
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,040
Conditional Correlation

2510
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,040
I kind of forgot what it was doing

2511
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,040
But a lot of people

2512
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,040
Just go back

2513
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,040
To use the so-called

2514
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,040
Mathematical model

2515
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,040
To calculate the so-called

2516
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,040
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

2517
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,040
Then I can ask

2518
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,040
You said there is a step where you do some

2519
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,040
Thresholding

2520
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,040
What is the threshold

2521
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,040
0.5 or something

2522
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,040
Thresholding is a big problem

2523
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,040
According to the information I showed you today

2524
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,040
In fact, my threshold is 0.3

2525
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,040
Because I use

2526
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,040
Simple Correlation

2527
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,040
Generally speaking, we think that 0.3 or more

2528
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,040
Is the so-called mild

2529
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,040
There is a correlation

2530
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,040
0.3 or less is more like

2531
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,040
It's hard to say

2532
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,040
Is there really a correlation

2533
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,040
But in fact, I have tried other methods

2534
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,040
There is a

2535
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,040
Proportional Thresholding

2536
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,040
Its thresholding is actually not based on

2537
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,040
Absolute value

2538
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,040
It is based on the density of the entire matrix

2539
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,040
That is, I take the front

2540
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,040
For example, the front

2541
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,040
30% density

2542
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,040
In this case, it becomes

2543
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,040
When you do graph theory

2544
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,040
Every edge value

2545
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,040
Every subject has the same value

2546
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,040
This is actually

2547
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,040
Strictly speaking, it is a fair way

2548
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,040
But the drawback is

2549
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,040
It may not be so sensitive

2550
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,040
Some things it can't detect

2551
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,040
Thank you

2552
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,040
it is good

2553
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,040
Have you tried

2554
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,040
Is it better than treatment?

2555
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,040
I'm doing this

2556
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,040
Live

2557
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,040
The question is

2558
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,040
Is there a comparison of treatment before and after treatment?

2559
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,040
Then I am currently running in the lab computer

2560
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,040
That is, the information we receive

2561
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,040
In fact, there will be

2562
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,040
We will record

2563
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,040
When they come

2564
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,040
OnMedication and OffMedication

2565
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,040
Ask them not to take medicine the night before

2566
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,040
Come to us the next morning

2567
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,040
Ask them to take medicine after scanning

2568
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,040
Scan again in the afternoon

2569
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,040
The purpose of this experiment is to see

2570
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,040
Because they all take LipaDopa

2571
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,040
It depends on this medicine

2572
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,040
Will it affect their cognitive ability?

2573
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,040
Then I just used

2574
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,040
SlidingWindow method

2575
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,040
I can tell you in a simple way

2576
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,040
The simplest way

2577
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,040
The result is

2578
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,040
The result of taking medicine and not taking medicine

2579
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,040
If you take medicine

2580
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,040
It's hard for me to see

2581
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,040
The patient who takes medicine is different from the normal person

2582
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,040
On the contrary, the patient who does not take medicine

2583
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,040
See a lot of difference from the normal person

2584
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,040
But this is the problem

2585
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,040
It sounds very normal

2586
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,040
Because the patient took the medicine

2587
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,040
Theoretically, it is more similar to the normal person

2588
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,040
But if I use different methods

2589
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,040
The result I see is completely different

2590
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,040
So I'm still thinking about it

2591
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,040
Find out which one is the real result

2592
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,040
The nerve

2593
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:08,040
It weakens

2594
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,040
Maybe it takes a while

2595
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,040
Or maybe it doesn't take a while

2596
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,040
For example

2597
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,040
If you take medicine for a period of time

2598
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,040
Then

2599
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,040
Before you take any medicine

2600
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,040
Just

2601
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,040
Because I think

2602
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,040
For example, the nerve

2603
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,040
It will die

2604
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,040
It's over

2605
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,040
So if you go to take medicine

2606
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,040
It's hard to say

2607
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,040
For example, it can have a long-term effect the next day

2608
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,040
No

2609
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,040
For PT patients

2610
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,040
Their dopamine is dead

2611
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,040
Bye-bye

2612
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,040
The so-called levodopa

2613
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,040
It's just that the drug will produce

2614
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,040
Something similar to dopamine

2615
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,040
They are called left-handed dopamine

2616
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,040
Use these things

2617
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,040
To temporarily control his illness

2618
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,040
Then they

2619
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,040
The effect of the drug is really hard to say

2620
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,040
Everyone is different

2621
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,040
Is there a way

2622
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,040
Or something

2623
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,040
Let the cell regenerate

2624
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,040
Oh this is that

2625
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,040
Signal plasticity

2626
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,040
Isn't that what you are doing?

2627
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,040
You said I misunderstood you

2628
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,040
The question on the spot

2629
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,040
Is with that

2630
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,040
The so-called regeneration

2631
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,040
Cell regeneration is related

2632
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,040
Because he is doing plasticity

2633
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,040
So he asked this question

2634
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,040
To be frank

2635
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,040
I'm not very clear

2636
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,040
But at least so far

2637
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,040
On the PT patient

2638
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,040
I heard I haven't heard anything like that

2639
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,040
But I know

2640
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,040
Because of my own research

2641
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,040
In addition to Parkinson's disease

2642
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,040
Another one called multiple sclerosis

2643
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,040
Multiple sclerosis

2644
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,040
The biggest problem with him is that the water is dead

2645
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,040
We call demyelination

2646
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,040
There is a vote of people who are studying very seriously

2647
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,040
Is it possible to remyelination

2648
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,040
Let him die of water

2649
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,040
Then come back

2650
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,040
It should be said

2651
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,040
Maybe there are some drugs

2652
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,040
Or some special

2653
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,040
Genetic treatment or something

2654
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,040
But this result has not yet been widely accepted

2655
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,040
Um

2656
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,040
If you use cognitive functions

2657
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,040
Indeed now some people will think

2658
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,040
He developed a set

2659
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,040
The so-called cognitive training

2660
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,040
Then let the patient test this cognitive training

2661
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,040
After a long time

2662
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,040
This cognitive training can strengthen his

2663
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,040
One kind of neural connection

2664
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,040
Even if you don't have so many multiple sclerosis

2665
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,040
If that neural connection is strengthened

2666
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,040
To some extent

2667
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,040
It can maintain your basic brain function

2668
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,040
That's another one

2669
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,040
Kind of like

2670
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,040
Another kind of training

2671
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,040
Um

2672
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,040
I haven't seen much

2673
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,040
Ok

2674
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,040
Any other questions

2675
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,040
I think we seem to be talking for a long time

2676
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,040
Ok

2677
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,040
Let me take a look

2678
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,040
Oh

2679
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:20,040
Let me take a look at that

2680
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,040
question

2681
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,040
Someone asked me to take off the outlier

2682
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,040
Um

2683
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,040
I didn't take off the outlier

2684
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,040
Because I

2685
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:32,040
If you look at the picture directly

2686
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,040
There is no patient

2687
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,040
It feels like

2688
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,040
Very different from others

2689
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,040
But when we are

2690
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,040
I didn't talk about this experiment today

2691
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,040
But in other plans

2692
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,040
We do leave one out

2693
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,040
That is, when we take the patient's information

2694
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,040
To do

2695
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:52,040
Related to statistics

2696
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,040
Another thing called leave one out

2697
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,040
Let's say we have 10 patients today

2698
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,040
Then we only put 9 in

2699
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,040
And then after this calculation

2700
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,040
Take one of them away

2701
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,040
And then put another one in

2702
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,040
Just throw one person away at a time

2703
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,040
And then get a new one

2704
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,040
So in this case, our final result

2705
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,040
The result we report is

2706
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,040
That effect is

2707
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,040
You will see it every time

2708
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,040
This kind of effect

2709
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,040
Strictly speaking, it can be removed

2710
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,040
Ok

2711
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,040
Machine learning? Yes

2712
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,040
We have a group of people doing machine learning

2713
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,040
But I'm not so familiar with machine learning

2714
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,040
So I'm still learning

2715
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,040
Next door

2716
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,040
But I have one of my own

2717
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,040
It's called CCA

2718
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:38,040
Canonical Correlation Analysis

2719
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,040
That CCA is actually not

2720
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,040
It has nothing to do with any image

2721
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,040
It is purely related to clinical data

2722
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:46,040
That is a little bit of the most basic machine learning

2723
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,040
We are doing that

2724
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,040
Multi-Modality

2725
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,040
Multi-Modality

2726
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,040
Multi-Variant Analysis

2727
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,040
CCA is two data

2728
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,040
Trying to project to the same domain

2729
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,040
You have two different groups of data

2730
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:02,040
Oh, I don't have that

2731
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,040
If you want to merge it

2732
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,040
Do you have CCA?

2733
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,040
I'm doing CCA

2734
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,040
There is actually no different

2735
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,040
That is purely

2736
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,040
Two different data for patients

2737
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:18,040
One is their demographic

2738
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,040
That is their age

2739
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,040
The other set is their cognitive scores

2740
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,040
Only these two have no impact

2741
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,040
Can I ask

2742
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,040
Like we are doing machine learning

2743
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,040
We have found some data before

2744
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,040
It seems that this kind of data you are doing

2745
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:34,040
I can't find it on the Internet

2746
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,040
Is it very private?

2747
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,040
Can't do anything

2748
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,040
It's very protective

2749
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,040
No

2750
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:44,040
Now a lot of

2751
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,040
Google

2752
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,040
Human Connectome Project

2753
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,040
UK Biobank

2754
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,040
German National Cohort

2755
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,040
These are actually

2756
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,040
Thousands of people missing

2757
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,040
All can be downloaded

2758
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,040
All FMRI

2759
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,040
They all have

2760
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,040
They have MRI

2761
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,040
Some have EEG

2762
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,040
Some have functional MRI

2763
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,040
Structural MRI

2764
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,040
Depends on their different

2765
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,040
Labels

2766
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,040
If you

2767
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,040
Go to

2768
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:20,040
Human Connectome Project

2769
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,040
One of them

2770
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:24,040
Human Connectome Project is mainly normal people

2771
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,040
But they have other cooperative

2772
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:28,040
Project

2773
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,040
For example, there is autism

2774
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,040
Or other diseases

2775
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,040
If you

2776
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,040
Interested in Parkinson

2777
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:38,040
You can go online

2778
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,040
PPMI

2779
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,040
Initiative

2780
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,040
Something like that

2781
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,040
Or Michael J Fox Foundation

2782
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:48,040
There are files inside that you can download for free

2783
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,040
But you have to register with them first

2784
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:52,040
They want to know who you are

2785
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,040
Then you can free download

2786
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,040
Do you have any questions?

2787
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,040
Is there any other questions?

2788
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,040
Is there any other questions?

2789
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,040
That's all

2790
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,040
OK

2791
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,040
Thank you

2792
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,040
Applause

2793
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,040
Thank you

2794
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,040
Bye

2795
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:26,040
Bye
