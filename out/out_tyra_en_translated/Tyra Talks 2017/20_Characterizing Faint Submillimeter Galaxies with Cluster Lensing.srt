00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello everyone, I'm the host for today, Zhang Yanyong, and we're going to have our 21st Terra Talk.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today's speaker is Xu Liyan.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Xu Liyan and I have known each other for almost two years.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's really interesting because we're at Caltech, and Xu Liyan is studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In 2016, we had a year-long visit to Caltech and IPAC.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
At that time, we met Xu Liyan.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Xu Liyan happens to be a senior in the Department of Physics at Caltech, but he was studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Did I say that correctly?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm from the Department of Physics.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, you're from the Department of Physics.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But you're studying astronomy at Manoa University.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My advisor is from Manoa University.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I see.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's interesting because he's from Hawaii, and they were surfing.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was surfing, so we became good friends.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Of course, his main job is still doing astronomy observation research in Hawaii.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
After returning from Caltech, in 2017, he recently obtained a Ph.D. degree, so he is a new doctor.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Liyan's research is mainly galaxy observation.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In his doctoral career, he is going to talk to us about this big topic today.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He published 34 papers, but today he will focus on the latest one.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you are interested in learning more about the previous papers, you can contact him directly.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Without further ado, let's welcome Liyan to give us his speech.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll mute myself.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'd like to remind everyone to mute your microphone when you speak.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You can start.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, I'll start.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you have any questions, please mute your microphone.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm afraid people won't understand.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, sorry.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We forgot something.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We need to clap.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We need to mute our microphone when we clap.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, you can start.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, thank you.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As you can see, my title is Characterizing Faint Sub-millimeter Galaxies with Posture Lensing.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you don't read astronomy, you can only understand Characterizing, Faint, and Width.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll explain what they mean.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
In short, I'm studying a galaxy called Sub-millimeter Galaxy.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The wavelength detected by this galaxy is called Sub-millimeter.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sub-millimeter is shorter than millimeter.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Millimeter is in kilometers.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Traditionally, people use 850 micrometers to study Sub-millimeter Galaxy.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Now I'll explain why I'm studying this galaxy and what I'm studying.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why do we study this galaxy?

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's related to the evolution of the universe.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can google the history of the universe.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You'll see a similar picture.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Maybe you've heard of it.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It started from the Big Bang.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The history of the universe is shown here.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It started from the Big Bang.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then there was a period of time called Inflation.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
At that time, the temperature of the universe was still very high.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It was all gaseous gas.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Until the temperature dropped to the ground.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The gaseous electrons in the universe were recombined with the gaseous atoms.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They became neutral gas atoms.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
From then on, light can start to run freely in the universe.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Before that, any light would be scattered by those gaseous electrons.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
From then on, light can run freely in the universe.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
At that time, the universe was scattered by those gaseous electrons.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But the temperature of the universe was still very high.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
After the temperature dropped to the ground.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The temperature of the gaseous atoms dropped to the ground.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The temperature of the universe was still very high.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Before that, there was the so-called Dark Age.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Basically, in the Big Bang, Inflation, and Cosmic Microwave Background.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
During this period, I think that this part of history is a matter of physicists.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The theory of explosion is a matter of physicists.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is a very physical thing.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And Big Bang.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
From the beginning of the formation of the galaxy.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
After the first galaxy was formed.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This part can be done by astronomers.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Astronomers can do this part.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I said that the temperature of the universe.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because the universe is constantly expanding.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The temperature slowly drops.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And these gaseous atoms.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It can be further combined into gaseous atoms.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, gaseous atoms.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If the temperature is cool enough.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
After gravity collapses.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It will form a star.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then the star will...

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Everyone should have heard of the star.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Just like our sun.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It produces the reaction of fusion.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So it will shine.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Then it will generate energy.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then the star will not be produced one by one.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They are produced in groups.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That is to form the so-called galaxy.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The galaxy is...

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
A galaxy is basically more than a billion of stars.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It is a system of galaxies.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So from this time on.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
After the beginning of the galaxy.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It is to produce a lot of galaxies.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The universe produces more and more galaxies.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Then we study...

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean this part.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I am studying the so-called...

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Galaxy formation and evolution.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The formation and evolution of galaxies.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That is very important.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I want to study...

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The star formation.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The history of star formation.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That is the so-called cosmic star formation history.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We want to use...

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That is to say.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
From the first star to now.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The evolution of the universe.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have to understand the evolution of the universe.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
One of them.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You have to understand.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It is very important.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
How to say.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
One of the important factors.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Is the star formation.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you look at astronomy.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No matter what you are studying.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No matter you are studying.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The evolution of the galaxy.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Galaxy formation and evolution.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Or you want to study.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The stars.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
For example, our solar system.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Or study the comet.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The asteroid.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In the universe.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No matter what kind of weather you study.

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It must be related to the comet.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Related to the stars.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because you have the star.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
After you have the star formation.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
After you have the star formation.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
These stars.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Merge together.

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Becomes a galaxy.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So it is related to the galaxy.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then you.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Comet.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Comet system.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Like our solar system.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
After the comet is formed.

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then.

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Some dust around the comet.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Slowly formed a comet.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then the comet goes around the comet.

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Like the comet.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Nebula.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is also.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You can say.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Astronomy.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No matter what you are studying.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I say astronomy.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If it is.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The physics of cosmology.

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It doesn't count.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Astronomy.

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Basically.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Whatever you do.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No matter what you do.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Will be related to.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Star formation.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So the history of star formation.

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Star formation history.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So it is a very important.

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you want to understand this universe.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is a very important thing.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
OK.

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I believe I have.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Convinced everyone.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Star formation history.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is a very important thing.

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But.

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Star formation history.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When we do research.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Found.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This picture on the left.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Is the so-called.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I put the star formation history.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This thing.

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Brighten it.

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then this place.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This axis on the left is called.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Star formation rate.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Density.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Star formation rate.

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is the star formation rate.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Then you can imagine.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Star formation rate.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Is every year.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Its unit is.

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ah.

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Ah.

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Star formation rate.

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Divided by.

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Time.

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then its unit is basically.

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Every year.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Basically every year.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Can produce.

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How much.

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Solar mass.

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This unit is.

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Solar mass.

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is solar mass.

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So this part is called.

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Star formation rate.

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Then if you are in volume.

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So it's star formation rate.

229
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Then in unit volume.

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Then this is.

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
NPC is a.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ah.

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The distance unit of astronomy.

234
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then.

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't.

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't care how it comes.

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then it is a distance unit.

238
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Then three dimensions.

239
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So this part is.

240
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Ah.

241
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The orbit is green.

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
In unit volume.

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So it's called star formation rate.

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Density.

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Horizontal.

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is look back time.

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So the more to the right is the longer.

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
OK.

249
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then this look back time.

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Can be corresponded to the so-called.

251
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Redshift.

252
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Called redshift.

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ah.

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Then this.

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I will explain it later.

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Because this is.

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
For people who don't study astronomy.

258
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Should not know what this is.

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OK.

260
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But you can.

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can tell you now.

262
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The more to the right is.

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Ah.

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The earlier.

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The universe.

266
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That.

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Zero.

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This place is now.

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
OK.

270
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So the time travel is from the right to the left.

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Not from the left to the right.

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
OK.

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Then this picture is basically a.

274
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Star formation.

275
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
History picture.

276
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then you want to.

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Measure this picture.

278
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ah.

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You.

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We.

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ah.

282
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Will find.

283
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There are two.

284
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There are basically.

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There are two kinds of observations.

286
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Is very important.

287
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That is.

288
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Ah.

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
When we used to.

290
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Probably in the 90s.

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
When.

292
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The end of the 90s.

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We have some.

294
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ah.

295
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ah.

296
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ah.

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Satellite.

298
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Ah.

299
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That is the space telescope.

300
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We go to measure.

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The whole universe.

302
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Background radiation.

303
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That.

304
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There are different wavelengths.

305
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Background radiation.

306
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That.

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Then I mentioned.

308
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Cosmic microwave background.

309
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Cosmic microwave background.

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That is.

311
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
CMB.

312
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Here.

313
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Ah.

314
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Then this.

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Is the intensity of light.

316
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then.

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Horizontal.

318
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Is the wavelength.

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So this is basically.

320
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Light wave.

321
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That.

322
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
CMB.

323
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Probably in this place.

324
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Then we will find.

325
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There are two components in this universe.

326
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
CMB does not count.

327
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There are two.

328
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Very important components.

329
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
One is called.

330
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Cosmic optical background.

331
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It is visible light.

332
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Background.

333
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then the other part.

334
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It is called.

335
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Cosmic infrared background.

336
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It is the background of infrared.

337
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then we found.

338
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
These two.

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Background.

340
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Their amount.

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Is almost.

342
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Almost.

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What does this tell us?

344
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Because in this universe.

345
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Horizontal.

346
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They will emit.

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Ah.

348
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Polar light.

349
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Visible light.

350
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Or near infrared light.

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That.

352
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Horizontal.

353
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Directly emitted light.

354
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Basically.

355
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is the component.

356
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Optical background.

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
OK.

358
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But.

359
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This.

360
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Universe.

361
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The.

362
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Horizontal.

363
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
In this universe.

364
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Star formation.

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
OK.

366
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
About half.

367
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It is not.

368
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We can.

369
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Directly observe.

370
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It is called.

371
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Dusty star formation.

372
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What does it mean?

373
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That is.

374
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When you.

375
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A.

376
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Area.

377
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
When a lot of stars are produced.

378
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Then.

379
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
A lot of new stars.

380
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Huge stars.

381
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They.

382
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Soon.

383
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Will fall.

384
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then become.

385
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The so-called supernova.

386
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Supernova.

387
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then.

388
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
These.

389
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
These huge stars.

390
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They produce.

391
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They are.

392
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
A lot of heavy elements.

393
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Then.

394
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
By the end of the year.

395
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It becomes a supernova.

396
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Will explode.

397
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Then.

398
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Will put these heavy elements.

399
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That is.

400
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That is.

401
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Talk about this.

402
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Space in the universe.

403
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Then.

404
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
These heavy elements.

405
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Some of these heavy elements.

406
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
For example.

407
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Carbon.

408
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
These things.

409
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They will form.

410
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Star dust.

411
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That is.

412
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Dust.

413
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That.

414
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Dust particles.

415
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That is.

416
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Like dust.

417
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Floating.

418
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In space.

419
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That.

420
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Dust.

421
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Will be.

422
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Directly emit light.

423
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh.

424
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
These straight.

425
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Horizontal.

426
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That.

427
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Light is.

428
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
External light.

429
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The visible light.

430
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Near infrared.

431
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Is the near infrared light.

432
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
These dusts.

433
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Will be.

434
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
These.

435
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Parts of the light.

436
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Absorbed.

437
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Then.

438
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
From our perspective.

439
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
From the observer's point of view.

440
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That is to say.

441
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It'll block him.

442
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Block that part of the light.

443
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But after it's blocked.

444
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The energy is residual.

445
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
After it's absorbed.

446
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He will.

447
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Radiate again.

448
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Recharge.

449
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
These energies.

450
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
About half.

451
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Will be.

452
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
These dusts.

453
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Absorbed.

454
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So we call.

455
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Dusty star formation.

456
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Or.

457
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Dust.

458
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Hidden star formation.

459
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Or.

460
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Dust obscured star formation.

461
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Anyway.

462
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The point is.

463
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
These star formations.

464
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Will be.

465
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Dust.

466
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
To.

467
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
To.

468
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
To be.

469
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Obscured by these dusts.

470
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Then.

471
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They absorb the energy.

472
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Then emit infrared light.

473
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh.

474
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That is to say.

475
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You have to understand.

476
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The star formation of this universe.

477
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You have to understand.

478
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
These two different.

479
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You can directly observe.

480
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The other is.

481
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You can't directly observe.

482
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Then.

483
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
These.

484
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You can't directly observe.

485
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You have to.

486
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
In a longer wavelength.

487
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
To observe.

488
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That is.

489
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Far infrared light.

490
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Or.

491
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sub-millimeter.

492
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Or even.

493
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Millimeter.

494
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Millimeter.

495
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This.

496
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Kilometer.

497
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I just said.

498
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Sub-millimeter.

499
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is.

500
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Less than a kilometer.

501
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Wavelength.

502
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
OK.

503
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
OK.

504
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So.

505
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Simply.

506
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Simply.

507
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Follow-on.

508
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
In this universe.

509
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There is a large part.

510
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Star formation.

511
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Is.

512
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Blocked by dust.

513
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Then.

514
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You want to understand.

515
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That part.

516
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Star formation.

517
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You can only observe.

518
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This wavelength.

519
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Longer wavelength.

520
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
OK.

521
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Then.

522
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I just said.

523
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I mentioned.

524
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is called.

525
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Redshift.

526
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This thing.

527
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Then I will explain.

528
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What is.

529
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Redshift.

530
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Then.

531
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Redshift.

532
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Simply speaking.

533
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If you have studied physics.

534
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You should know.

535
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The effect of Duplo.

536
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
When.

537
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
When you.

538
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This thing.

539
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Uh.

540
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This wave.

541
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If it goes away from you.

542
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When.

543
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The wavelength you receive.

544
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Will be stretched.

545
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Or.

546
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Simply speaking.

547
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's frequency.

548
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Change.

549
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Uh.

550
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Frequency.

551
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Change.

552
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Uh.

553
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Short.

554
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Or long.

555
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Frequency.

556
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Change.

557
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Uh.

558
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Slower.

559
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Then.

560
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Then.

561
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If something.

562
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Is close to you.

563
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Then.

564
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Its wavelength.

565
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Will.

566
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Will.

567
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Uh.

568
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Short.

569
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Or.

570
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Frequency.

571
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Uh.

572
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Change.

573
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So.

574
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You hear.

575
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The ambulance.

576
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
For example.

577
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If it's close to you.

578
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Its sound.

579
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Will change.

580
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The pitch will be higher.

581
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The pitch of the ambulance.

582
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Will change.

583
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Uh.

584
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The pitch.

585
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000

Okay.

590
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Then.

591
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
When we observe.

592
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000

593
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000

752
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
The most common unit of distance is light year

753
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,140
But

754
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,140
Basically light year is a

755
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,140
Astronomers

756
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,140
use it

757
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
to do science education

758
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
and talk to the general public

759
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Astronomers almost never use light year

760
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,140
This unit

761
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
Astronomers will use

762
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Distance unit may use

763
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
Part second

764
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,140
But if it is

765
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Like my research department

766
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
We will not use distance unit

767
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,140
We will use relationship unit

768
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Why?

769
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Because when you reach a large

770
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,140
dimension

771
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,140
The so-called distance

772
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,140
is no longer an objective fact

773
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,140
The so-called distance

774
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,140
is no longer an objective fact

775
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,140
For example, I am standing here

776
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,140
and another person is standing here

777
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
The so-called distance

778
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,140
We are both

779
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,140
in the same time and space

780
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,140
We measure the distance

781
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,140
It is an objective fact

782
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,140
But when you discuss the entire

783
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,140
universe

784
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
The size of the universe

785
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
When the distance is very far

786
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
The so-called distance

787
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,140
must be defined

788
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
The distance is no longer an objective fact

789
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
There are different definitions

790
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
of distance

791
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Why define it?

792
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
Because our universe is constantly expanding

793
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,140
So it is a very complicated

794
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,140
And it involves the evolution of our universe

795
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
I don't have time to talk about it today

796
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,140
To put it simply

797
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,140
The picture on my right

798
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
The picture on my right

799
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
Is the relationship between distance and redshift

800
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
The picture on my right

801
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
Is the distance in Giga light year

802
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Giga light year is

803
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
Giga is billions

804
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
So the light year is billions

805
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,140
Or

806
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,140
Age in Giga year

807
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
There is a lookback time

808
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,140
This curve is the time

809
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,140
When we

810
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,140
Redshift to the right

811
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,140
How long ago we saw

812
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,140
This is called lookback time

813
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,140
The other is called luminosity distance

814
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Angular diameter distance

815
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,140
Line of cycle movement distance

816
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,140
And Naive Hubble distance

817
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
These are all distances

818
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
That is the distance under different definitions

819
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
In conclusion

820
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
I won't talk about these distances today

821
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
How they are defined

822
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,140
And what they can do

823
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,140
But in conclusion

824
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,140
We can directly measure the distance

825
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,140
Is this luminosity and angular diameter

826
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,140
These two distances

827
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,140
But I won't talk about it in detail

828
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,140
But I won't talk about it in detail

829
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
To put it simply

830
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
The conclusion is

831
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
It is not very convenient to use distance

832
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
Because you are talking about the distance

833
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,140
And these distances

834
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
The relationship between distance and redshift

835
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,140
Is linear

836
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,140
Even the angular diameter distance is strange

837
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
To

838
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,140
Redshift 1 or more

839
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,140
It is decreasing

840
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,140
So it is not very convenient to use distance

841
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
It is not a convenient variable

842
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
So usually when studying cosmology

843
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,140
Or galaxy evolution

844
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
We use redshift

845
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,140
As our distance

846
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,140
So we often say

847
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,140
How much redshift is your galaxy

848
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,140
Basically, the larger the redshift

849
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Ok

850
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Sorry

851
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,140
Can you hear me?

852
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,140
Yes

853
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,140
I have a question

854
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,140
You have to calculate the original wavelength

855
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,140
In addition to the redshift

856
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,140
How do you know the original wavelength?

857
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,140
The next step is to talk about it

858
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,140
Basically

859
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,140
Redshift is a very important variable

860
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,140
Redshift is a very important variable

861
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,140
Redshift is a very important variable

862
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Redshift is a very important variable

863
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,140
Otherwise

864
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,140
If there is no redshift

865
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,140
When you do some modeling

866
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,140
You only have a free parameter

867
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,140
So we need

868
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,140
Do a lot of

869
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,140
Measurement and modeling

870
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,140
We hope we will know

871
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,140
Redshift

872
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,140
How to measure redshift

873
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Basically observe the wavelength

874
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Divide by its original wavelength

875
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
And subtract 1

876
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,140
I want to emphasize that

877
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Measurement of redshift is very important

878
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,140
Basically it is optical

879
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Whether you are

880
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Studying the star or galaxy

881
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,140
They are all similar

882
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,140
You use optical

883
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,140
Optical theory

884
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,140
Optical theory is usually visible light

885
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,140
Or near infrared

886
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,140
Ok

887
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,140
Usually you use a large telescope

888
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,140
We have two modes of observation

889
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,140
Visible light telescope

890
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Or near infrared

891
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
One is called imaging

892
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,140
Imaging

893
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,140
You can imagine

894
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,140
It is taking pictures

895
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
It is directly taking images

896
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,140
The other mode is called spectroscopy

897
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
The other mode is called spectroscopy

898
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,140
Basically it uses

899
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
The concept of light in physics

900
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,140
You observe a star

901
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
You observe a star

902
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
After the light passes through the telescope

903
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
After the light passes through the telescope

904
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
After the light passes through the telescope

905
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,140
Finally

906
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,140
There will be diffraction

907
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
We can measure the intensity of light

908
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,140
As a function of wave length

909
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Ok

910
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
How do we measure redshift

911
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
We know

912
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
Today's sky

913
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Whether star or galaxy

914
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,140
We know

915
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,140
What should the original spectrum look like

916
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,140
Redshift equals to 0

917
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,140
So we need to know

918
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
But this is not difficult

919
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,140
Because a lot of these things

920
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,140
There will be a lot of absorption lines

921
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Or radiation

922
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,140
Absorption line

923
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,140
Or emission line

924
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,140
Hα

925
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
Oxygen

926
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,140
These things

927
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,140
Basically, after listening to the study for a long time

928
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,140
We must have a galaxy

929
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,140
There must be a model

930
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,140
And these

931
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,140
Emission line

932
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Or absorption line

933
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,140
How much is it?

934
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,140
Because we are on earth

935
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,140
We can do it in the chemical lab

936
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
We can know

937
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,140
These absorption lines and emission lines

938
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,140
Their wavelength

939
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
Without redshift

940
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,140
How much

941
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,140
Let's say today

942
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Two galaxy spectrum

943
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,140
We found this

944
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,140
We have these spectrum

945
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
We all know

946
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,140
How much it should be when there is no redshift

947
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Then we can know their ratio

948
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,140
The ratio from here to here

949
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
Then we can measure

950
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,140
The redshift of this galaxy

951
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,140
Is there a problem here?

952
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,140
If not, I will continue to talk about the next part

953
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,140
Basically, the redshift event

954
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,140
It is the concept of redshift

955
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,140
Now back to my topic

956
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
Why do I study the sub-millimeter galaxy?

957
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,140
I just mentioned

958
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
Because there are two kinds of star formation in the universe

959
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,140
One is that we can directly observe

960
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,140
Visible light can be directly observed

961
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,140
The other half is

962
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Will be absorbed by dust

963
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,140
Radiation

964
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,140
That part

965
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,140
Can only be observed

966
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,140
In the far infrared or sub-millimeter

967
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Sub-millimeter

968
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,140
The observation of sub-millimeter

969
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
There is another point

970
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,140
The so-called negative k-correction

971
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,140
Now I will explain

972
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,140
What is negative k-correction

973
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
I just said

974
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,140
There is a redshift in our universe

975
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,140
So I drew a graph on the left

976
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,140
This graph is a very typical

977
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,140
Star formation galaxy

978
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,140
There is a galaxy

979
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,140
It is a very dusty galaxy

980
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,140
It has a lot of star dust

981
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,140
So the light of the star

982
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,140
Will be absorbed by the dust

983
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Then put it in the far infrared

984
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Basically this part

985
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,140
The smooth part

986
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
Is the far infrared light

987
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,140
The far infrared light emitted by dust

988
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,140
The left side

989
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
This is the star

990
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,140
And this part

991
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,140
What is hot

992
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,140
I said I put the far infrared light

993
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,140
This part is colder

994
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
Right part

995
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,140
This is radio

996
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,140
This is a synchrotron radiation

997
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
If he is consumed by the paralleloscope

998
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
The paralleloscope rotates

999
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
Then release

1000
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
Synchrotron Radiation

1001
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
I forgot the Chinese name of Synchrotron Radiation

1002
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
But it releases radiation

1003
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,140
Its light wave is here

1004
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,140
Anyway

1005
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,140
Then I did this thing

1006
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
I put a light wave

1007
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,140
Redshift

1008
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,140
From 0.5 to 10

1009
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,140
As I said just now

1010
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Redshift is what causes the wavelength to change

1011
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
But it is not very far

1012
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,140
As I said just now

1013
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,140
It is 1 plus z

1014
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,140
OK

1015
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,140
So your wavelength

1016
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140
You observe the wavelength

1017
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,140
The original wavelength is 1 plus z

1018
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
So you can imagine

1019
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
When you have a galaxy

1020
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,140
If you can move it freely

1021
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,140
If you want to move it further and further

1022
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,140
What I see

1023
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,140
The light wave will get fatter and fatter

1024
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,140
It's not just moving

1025
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,140
It's getting fatter and fatter

1026
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,140
Because it is 1 plus z

1027
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,140
There are two effects

1028
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,140
First, when you move it further and further

1029
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,140
Its light wave will get fatter and fatter

1030
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
But the second thing is the so-called inverse square law

1031
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,140
When you move a star

1032
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Or a galaxy

1033
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,140
If you move it further and further

1034
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,140
Naturally, what we observe is getting darker and darker

1035
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,140
It's the same as the square

1036
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,140
So you see

1037
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,140
When you move to a higher and higher Redshift

1038
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,140
Its overall normalization

1039
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,140
It's getting lower and lower

1040
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,140
Because it gets darker and darker

1041
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,140
But the other effect is

1042
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,140
You move it to the right more and more

1043
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,140
Then there will be a very interesting phenomenon

1044
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,140
Just because

1045
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
The light wave formed by cold dust

1046
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,140
It's like this curve

1047
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,140
Then we observe

1048
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,140
Millimeters

1049
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,140
Or millimeters

1050
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,140
When we observe the wavelength

1051
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,140
We found

1052
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,140
A dusty galaxy

1053
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,140
When you move it further and further

1054
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,140
We observe

1055
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,140
We observe

1056
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,140
The flux

1057
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
Almost unchanged

1058
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,140
Almost unchanged

1059
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Why?

1060
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,140
Because of two effects

1061
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,140
The first effect is

1062
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,140
When you move it further and further

1063
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,140
It will naturally get fatter and fatter

1064
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,140
But the other effect is

1065
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,140
You move the light wave to the right

1066
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,140
So what we observe is getting closer and closer

1067
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
More and more to the right

1068
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,140
We observe

1069
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
Like this galaxy

1070
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,140
We observe

1071
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,140
These two effects

1072
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,140
To a certain extent, it's a little offset

1073
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,140
So this effect is called

1074
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,140
Because of Redshift

1075
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Cause you

1076
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,140
Offset the effect of distance

1077
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,140
This effect is called Negative K Correction

1078
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,140
There is actually another

1079
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,140
Positive K Correction

1080
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,140
Positive K Correction is

1081
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,140
For example, if you observe

1082
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,140
If you observe the radio

1083
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,140
When you move it further and further

1084
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
In addition to

1085
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
The further the distance

1086
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
The further the distance

1087
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,140
The further the brightness

1088
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,140
When you move the light wave to the right

1089
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,140
It will also make you

1090
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Make your brightness lower

1091
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
So this is called Positive K Correction

1092
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Both of its effects

1093
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Cause your brightness to be lower

1094
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,140
Negative K Correction

1095
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
Redshift

1096
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,140
The further the distance

1097
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,140
The further the distance

1098
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,140
The effect is opposite

1099
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,140
It's a little bit

1100
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
So it's called Negative K Correction

1101
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
And then when we observe

1102
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Often in the

1103
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
About one millimeter

1104
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,140
These two effects are almost offset

1105
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,140
So you observe

1106
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,140
Hello, I have a question

1107
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,140
Yes

1108
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,140
Please ask

1109
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,140
My question is

1110
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,140
If you say

1111
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,140
If you say

1112
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,140
The emission of dust

1113
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Is because its energy is

1114
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,140
Absorbed by dust

1115
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,140
After that, the dust releases energy

1116
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,140
So it's actually a bit like

1117
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,140
Thermal Equilibrium

1118
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
Blackbody Radiation

1119
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,140
It's not a perfect blackbody

1120
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,140
It's called Modified Blackbody

1121
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,140
Hello

1122
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,140
Hello, can you hear me?

1123
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,140
It's not a perfect blackbody

1124
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,140
It's a blackbody radiation

1125
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,140
But

1126
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
So it's basically thermal radiation

1127
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,140
Right?

1128
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,140
It's called Modified

1129
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,140
But its spectrum to some extent

1130
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Corresponds to temperature, right?

1131
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,140
Yes, that's what I just said

1132
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,140
This is very smooth

1133
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,140
Then I have a question

1134
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
Why is the temperature of different galaxies

1135
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,140
The same

1136
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,140
It will be different

1137
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,140
Why is the temperature the same?

1138
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,140
Different

1139
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,140
Hello

1140
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Hello

1141
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,140
I can hear you

1142
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,140
I can hear you

1143
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,140
It won't be the same

1144
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,140
I can hear you

1145
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
So the temperature is different

1146
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,140
I can hear you

1147
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,140
This part

1148
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,140
This part is the so-called

1149
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,140
Thermal dust

1150
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,140
When the temperature is different

1151
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,140
Its shape will be slightly different

1152
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,140
Hello

1153
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,140
Can you hear me?

1154
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
I can't hear you

1155
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,140
OK

1156
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,140
But you have to assume

1157
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,140
This point will never run away

1158
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
Can you hear me?

1159
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
Yes

1160
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
It's broken

1161
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
It's broken

1162
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
What?

1163
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,140
You have to assume this point

1164
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,140
It's broken

1165
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
I

1166
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Basically

1167
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,140
You probably want to say

1168
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,140
If their spectrum is different

1169
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
It won't be so good

1170
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
But it should be

1171
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,140
The example I am giving now is just a typical example

1172
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
OK

1173
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,140
But the typical example is like this

1174
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Then when your temperature is different

1175
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
Its shape will be slightly different

1176
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,140
But it won't be so bad

1177
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,140
They are basically similar

1178
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,140
But the temperature is different

1179
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,140
The shape is slightly different

1180
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,140
Then they all have a similar effect

1181
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
I just said

1182
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,140
It's not 100% perfect

1183
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,140
It's just about

1184
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,140
Does this explain your question?

1185
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,140
Yes

1186
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,140
It's not perfect

1187
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,140
Thank you

1188
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,140
The example I am giving now is just a typical example

1189
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
The example I am giving now is just a typical example

1190
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,140
But different Galaxy's spectrum will definitely be different

1191
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,140
But they all have a similar effect

1192
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,140
But they all have a similar effect

1193
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,140
But it's not perfect

1194
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,140
OK

1195
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
I will continue

1196
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,140
OK

1197
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
I will draw this effect on the right

1198
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
I will draw this effect on the right

1199
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,140
This is what we observe

1200
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
This Galaxy is called Redshift

1201
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
This is Redshift

1202
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
This is the intensity of light

1203
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
Then the different color curves here

1204
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Then the different color curves here

1205
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
It corresponds to different observations

1206
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
It corresponds to different observations

1207
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
So like here

1208
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,140
0.8 microns

1209
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,140
0.8 microns

1210
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,140
0.8 microns

1211
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,140
It's about 800 nanometers

1212
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,140
800 nanometers is red light

1213
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,140
OK

1214
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
It's positive

1215
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,140
OK

1216
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,140
It's positive

1217
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,140
OK

1218
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,140
OK

1219
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
OK

1220
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,140
OK

1221
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
OK

1222
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
OK

1223
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
OK

1224
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,140
OK

1225
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,140
OK

1226
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,140
OK

1227
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,140
OK

1228
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
OK

1229
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
OK

1230
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,140
OK

1231
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
It's positive

1232
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,140
It's positive

1233
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,140
OK

1234
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
0.8 microns

1235
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
0.8 microns

1236
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
No difference

1237
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
0.8 microns

1238
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,140
0.8 microns

1239
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
0.8 microns

1240
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,140
Here is 500

1241
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,140
500 micrometers

1242
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,140
450 micrometers

1243
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,140
About

1244
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,140
About 850 and 1 mm

1245
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,140
These wavelengths

1246
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
Are near here

1247
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Almost flat

1248
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
OK

1249
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
So

1250
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,140
The conclusion is

1251
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,140
When the wavelength you observe is

1252
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
Sub-millimeter or millimeter

1253
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,140
You have a good effect

1254
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,140
No matter how far you move

1255
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,140
The brightness you observe

1256
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,140
Almost unchanged

1257
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,140
So with this effect

1258
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,140
You can use it to detect

1259
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Detect

1260
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,140
Very high redshift galaxy

1261
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
Very far galaxy

1262
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,140
Very early galaxy in the universe

1263
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,140
If you use a more traditional

1264
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
Visible wavelength

1265
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,140
You will find that its brightness drops very quickly

1266
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
So of course, your distant galaxy is very dark

1267
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,140
It's not easy to observe

1268
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,140
If you use radio

1269
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,140
Radio is wireless radio

1270
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,140
If you use wireless radio to observe

1271
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,140
You will still see this picture

1272
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,140
It also drops very quickly

1273
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
So it's the same for distant galaxies

1274
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,140
It's very hard to observe

1275
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140
If you want to observe

1276
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,140
You have to do a long exposure

1277
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,140
Observation is very deep

1278
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,140
The deeper you are, the farther you can observe

1279
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,140
But sub-millimeter or millimeter

1280
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,140
This is almost flat

1281
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,140
So you can use this technique

1282
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,140
To detect

1283
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
Compared to visible light or radio

1284
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,140
It's much easier

1285
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,140
Much easier

1286
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,140
To observe these distant galaxies

1287
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,140
This is why sub-millimeter is very important

1288
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,140
I'm going to talk about

1289
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,140
Now the point is

1290
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,140
What I'm studying is called sub-millimeter galaxies

1291
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
In the 1990s

1292
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,140
Kearny used

1293
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,140
Sub-millimeter

1294
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,140
Telescope

1295
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,140
It's a telescope

1296
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,140
Called JCMD

1297
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,140
I will have a photo later

1298
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,140
To shoot a famous field in the sky

1299
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Called Hubble Deep Field

1300
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Because this field

1301
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
They used Hubble telescope

1302
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,140
To shoot a very deep image

1303
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
This is the image taken by Hubble telescope

1304
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,140
Visible light image

1305
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,140
Then they used JCMD

1306
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
To shoot the same area

1307
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,140
This

1308
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
The image on the right

1309
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,140
Is a sub-millimeter image

1310
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,140
With JCMD

1311
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,140
There is a bright spot here

1312
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,140
There may be a bright spot here

1313
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,140
This is a

1314
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,140
Sub-millimeter source

1315
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,140
Before JCMD

1316
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,140
We only use some

1317
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,140
Space telescope to measure the background

1318
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,140
We can measure

1319
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,140
Sub-millimeter

1320
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
But we don't

1321
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,140
Understand

1322
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,140
What source is this background

1323
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,140
From

1324
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
With JCMD

1325
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,140
Resolve the background

1326
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
Into individual sources

1327
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
We can see the individual sub-millimeter

1328
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,140
I just talked about

1329
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

1330
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
Sub-millimeter galaxies are basically dusty

1331
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,140
They are very

1332
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,140
Intense

1333
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
Star formation

1334
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,140
Very intense

1335
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,140
Very intense

1336
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,140
Very intense

1337
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,140
Starburst gas

1338
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,140
Why is the sub-millimeter

1339
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,140
Very bright

1340
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,140
Originally

1341
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,140
If it is red

1342
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,140
If we have a dusty galaxy

1343
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Its peak

1344
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,140
About

1345
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Its wavelength

1346
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
About 100 micrometer

1347
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,140
But when you move to

1348
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
When redshift is above 1

1349
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,140
When the distance of your galaxy

1350
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Is above redshift 1

1351
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Its peak may move to

1352
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,140
About millimeter

1353
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Or sub-millimeter

1354
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,140
Why is it

1355
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Very bright

1356
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Its original wavelength

1357
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Is about 100 micrometer

1358
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,140
100 micrometer is

1359
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,140
In astronomy

1360
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,140
This wavelength is called distant infrared

1361
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Distant infrared

1362
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,140
Because it is

1363
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,140
Above redshift 1

1364
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,140
When we observe it

1365
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,140
The wavelength we observe

1366
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,140
Is below

1367
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,140
Sub-millimeter and millimeter

1368
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,140
Wavelength

1369
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,140
Ok

1370
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,140
This sub-millimeter galaxy

1371
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,140
Is a very dusty starburst galaxy

1372
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,140
It is usually difficult

1373
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
It is written here

1374
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
It is difficult to observe in visible wavelengths

1375
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,140
Or so-called rest frame UV

1376
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
These visible wavelengths

1377
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,140
For these distant information

1378
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,140
When it is emitted

1379
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,140
When it is emitted

1380
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
When the light is emitted

1381
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,140
It is a rest frame UV

1382
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,140
When we observe

1383
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,140
It is redshift visible

1384
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,140
So we observe it as visible light

1385
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,140
But when it is emitted

1386
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,140
It is actually UV

1387
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,140
These sub-millimeter galaxies

1388
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,140
Because it is very dusty

1389
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,140
Basically their UV

1390
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,140
Often absorbed by dust

1391
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,140
So in visible wavelengths

1392
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,140
You often can't see them

1393
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,140
Can't observe them

1394
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,140
When it is sub-millimeter wavelength

1395
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,140
You will find

1396
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,140
A very bright source

1397
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,140
Ok

1398
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
I will continue

1399
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,140
How to observe these

1400
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

1401
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,140
As I said

1402
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,140
In the 90s, they used JCMP

1403
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140
To find these sub-millimeter galaxies

1404
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,140
This kind of telescope is called single-dash

1405
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
It only has one antenna

1406
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,140
Telescope

1407
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
Ok

1408
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,140
Basically using this kind of single-dash

1409
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
To scan our sky

1410
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,140
Is the most effective way to find these sub-millimeter galaxies

1411
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,140
I will introduce later

1412
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,140
Another technique

1413
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
Interferometry

1414
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,140
Interferometry

1415
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,140
I will talk about it later

1416
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,140
This kind of single-dash

1417
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,140
I will talk about the conclusion first

1418
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,140
The conclusion is

1419
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
It is the most effective way

1420
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,140
To scan the sky

1421
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,140
To find these sources

1422
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,140
It has a problem

1423
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,140
Its resolution is very low

1424
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Why?

1425
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,140
Basically

1426
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,140
The image we took

1427
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,140
The image we took

1428
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,140
The image we took

1429
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,140
Is proportional to the wavelength

1430
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,140
And is proportional to the size of the telescope

1431
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,140
This is basically

1432
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,140
It comes from physical light

1433
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,140
It comes from light

1434
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,140
If you have studied light

1435
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,140
You should be familiar with this

1436
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,140
So today we observe

1437
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,140
Sub-millimeter or far-infrared

1438
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Or radio

1439
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,140
These are relatively long wavelengths

1440
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,140
On the contrary, if you observe visible light

1441
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,140
Or UV

1442
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,140
Those are relatively short wavelengths

1443
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,140
These long wavelengths

1444
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,140
This lambda is very large

1445
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,140
So the image resolution

1446
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,140
Will be worse

1447
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,140
If you want to make your image resolution

1448
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,140
A little better

1449
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,140
You have to build a bigger telescope

1450
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,140
Let your diameter

1451
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,140
Build a bigger telescope

1452
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,140
I will talk about this later

1453
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,140
Talk more

1454
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,140
This kind of single-dash telescope

1455
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,140
Because the wavelength is long

1456
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,140
So its resolution is very low

1457
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,140
So it has two problems

1458
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,140
The first is that if the resolution is very low

1459
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,140
You observe a source

1460
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,140
Then when you want to go to other wavelengths

1461
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,140
To find it in other wavelengths

1462
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,140
The corresponding point

1463
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,140
Is the counterpart

1464
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,140
You don't know where it is

1465
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,140
Because its resolution is too bad

1466
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,140
So you have to

1467
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,140
You don't know where its precise position is

1468
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,140
If you want to know its precise position

1469
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,140
You need to use interference

1470
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,140
Do further observation

1471
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,140
OK, my next slide

1472
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
Will talk about what interference is

1473
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,140
Like this picture

1474
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,140
This is the result

1475
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,140
The source observed by JCMP

1476
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,140
Maybe it's a big one

1477
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,140
Sorry, I don't have a picture here

1478
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,140
A big one

1479
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,140
You can't get it

1480
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,140
Where is the precise position

1481
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,140
But after the observation of the interference

1482
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,140
You can get it

1483
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,140
A higher resolution image

1484
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,140
Then you can accurately measure its position

1485
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,140
After measuring its position

1486
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,140
You go to other wavelengths

1487
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,140
For example, this is the image of Hubble telescope

1488
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,140
Then you go to other wavelengths

1489
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,140
To find its corresponding counterpart

1490
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,140
Or not

1491
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,140
This is the first problem

1492
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,140
Its resolution is too bad

1493
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,140
So you have to use interference

1494
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,140
The second problem is called confusion limit

1495
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,140
Basically, it is also caused by low resolution

1496
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,140
Because your resolution is bad

1497
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,140
When your resolution is bad

1498
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,140
In our universe

1499
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,140
Whether you are exploring the stars

1500
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,140
Or stars

1501
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,140
In this universe

1502
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,140
Dark things

1503
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,140
More than bright things

1504
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,140
There may be a power law

1505
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,140
Here

1506
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,140
Then when you

1507
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,140
There are more dark things

1508
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,140
It means that these darker subliminal galaxies

1509
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
The density

1510
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,140
The density in the sky

1511
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,140
Is greater than those brighter subliminal galaxies

1512
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,140
Is greater than those brighter subliminal galaxies

1513
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,140
The meaning of confusion limit

1514
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,140
When you observe

1515
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,140
When the resolution is very low

1516
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,140
Then when you

1517
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,140
If there are a lot of

1518
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,140
Darker subliminal galaxies

1519
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,140
Because they are a lot

1520
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,140
Because they are a lot

1521
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,140
Then they will all come together

1522
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,140
Then they will all come together

1523
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,140
Come together and become one

1524
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,140
In other words, you observe one

1525
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,140
A very bright source

1526
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,140
In fact, it may be a lot of dark

1527
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,140
Darker subliminal galaxies

1528
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,140
Darker subliminal galaxies

1529
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,140
Because your resolution is too bad

1530
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,140
So you see a lot

1531
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,140
So this will cause something called

1532
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,140
Confusion limit

1533
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,140
Because the resolution of your telescope is bad

1534
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,140
So you can't observe

1535
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,140
You will have a limit

1536
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,140
A star that is darker than this limit

1537
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,140
You can't directly observe

1538
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,140
Because the stars that are darker than this limit

1539
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,140
They are a lot

1540
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,140
Because of your low resolution

1541
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,140
All blend together

1542
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,140
OK

1543
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,140
So this limit will cause

1544
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,140
Observe a subliminal galaxy

1545
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,140
It has a limit

1546
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,140
Its brightness is like this

1547
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,140
Too many Jansky at 850 microns

1548
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,140
I won't explain today

1549
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,140
What unit is this mini Jansky

1550
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,140
Anyway, it is a unit of brightness

1551
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,140
OK

1552
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,140
This brightness can be converted to

1553
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,140
Its absolute brightness

1554
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,140
Called luminosity

1555
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,140
About 10 to 12 squares

1556
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,140
Solar luminosity

1557
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,140
Solar luminosity is the brightness of the sun

1558
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,140
So this limit

1559
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,140
It corresponds to 10 to 12 squares

1560
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,140
The brightness of the sun

1561
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,140
This kind of star is called

1562
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,140
Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy

1563
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,140
It is very very bright

1564
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,140
Dusty Galaxy

1565
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,140
In other words, we use JCMP

1566
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,140
Or use this kind of single dish

1567
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,140
The source we can detect

1568
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,140
It is very very very bright

1569
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,140
Then we can't detect

1570
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,140
Darker

1571
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,140
This is its problem

1572
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,140
OK, I will explain later

1573
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,140
My thesis

1574
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,140
How to solve this problem

1575
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,140
Now I will explain the interference cloud

1576
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,140
What is the interference cloud

1577
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,140
I just said

1578
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,140
Resolution you observe

1579
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,140
It is proportional to wavelength

1580
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,140
Resolution of the telescope

1581
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,140
So you want

1582
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,140
Resolution is very bad

1583
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
If we want to improve our resolution

1584
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,140
Then we build a bigger telescope

1585
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,140
Let D

1586
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,140
But this is the problem

1587
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,140
You have to build a very big telescope

1588
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,140
Or a very big antenna

1589
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,140
Because we are a long-wave field

1590
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,140
In fact, our telescope is the so-called antenna

1591
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,140
Just like this

1592
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,140
I think I just drew it

1593
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,140
It is an antenna

1594
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,140
Then we have to build a very big

1595
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,140
Gigantic antenna

1596
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,140
It is very very expensive

1597
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,140
So this thing

1598
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,140
It is not economic

1599
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,140
So how to solve it

1600
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,140
It is the so-called interference cloud

1601
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,140
Interference cloud means

1602
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,140
We don't build a super big antenna

1603
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,140
We build a lot of small antennas

1604
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,140
Like the picture of my background

1605
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,140
We build multiple small antennas

1606
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,140
Then

1607
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,140
We accept the signal

1608
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,140
Make a cross correlation

1609
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,140
This technology is called

1610
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,140
Interference cloud

1611
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,140
Then

1612
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,140
It is a bit like

1613
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,140
When you put a lot of small antennas

1614
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,140
Then spread it

1615
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,140
Spread it on the ground

1616
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,140
It is a bit like

1617
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,140
You have a big telescope

1618
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,140
But not so perfect

1619
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,140
It has a lot

1620
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,140
When you deal with images

1621
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,140
It has a lot of complicated details

1622
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,140
I won't talk about these

1623
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,140
But basically what you can do is

1624
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,140
When you spread a lot of small antennas

1625
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,140
The resolution can be similar to

1626
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,140
A big telescope

1627
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,140
It is equivalent to increasing the low

1628
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,140
So you can get a

1629
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,140
Higher resolution image

1630
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,140
So I gave an example here

1631
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,140
Then this side

1632
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,140
This picture is

1633
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,140
I used JCMP

1634
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,140
I took a picture

1635
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,140
A very wide image

1636
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,140
Then there is a bright spot inside

1637
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,140
Is a

1638
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,140
Submarine source

1639
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,140
Zoom in

1640
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,140
Then

1641
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,140
Why is it called SCUBA-2?

1642
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,140
Because we use JCMP

1643
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,140
Observe the camera

1644
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,140
Of the submarine galaxy

1645
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,140
That camera

1646
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,140
Is called SCUBA-2

1647
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,140
Then we observe

1648
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,140
Then we need to use interference cloud

1649
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,140
The background pattern

1650
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,140
This interference cloud is very famous

1651
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,140
ELMA telescope

1652
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,140
ELMA is built in Chile

1653
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,140
It is the most powerful

1654
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,140
Interference cloud in the world

1655
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,140
Then it observes the submarine

1656
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,140
Then you use ELMA

1657
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,140
Observe this sky

1658
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,140
In fact, this example is just right

1659
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,140
This is not

1660
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,140
Like this picture is

1661
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,140
Observed by my group

1662
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,140
But ELMA is observed by other groups

1663
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,140
Then they just observe this area

1664
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,140
Then this red dot is equivalent to

1665
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,140
It corresponds to the same

1666
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,140
SCUBA-2 image

1667
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,140
This is the center of the source

1668
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,140
Then we have ELMA observation

1669
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,140
We get a much higher resolution image

1670
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,140
Just found this one

1671
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,140
In fact, it is three

1672
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,140
Submarine galaxies

1673
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,140
Then because our resolution is very poor

1674
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,140
Put them together

1675
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,140
OK

1676
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,140
OK

1677
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,140
Someone may ask you

1678
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,140
Why don't you use interference cloud

1679
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,140
Just observe

1680
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,140
Right

1681
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,140
Why use

1682
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,140
I just said

1683
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,140
SCUBA-2

1684
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,140
The reason is

1685
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,140
There are two

1686
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,140
Interference cloud observation

1687
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,140
Compared to

1688
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,140
SCUBA-2

1689
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,140
Their observation is

1690
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,140
Observationally a lot more expensive

1691
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,140
The cost is higher

1692
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,140
OK

1693
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,140
Then the field of view is different

1694
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,140
The field of view is

1695
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,140
It can be

1696
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,140
Includes

1697
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,140
The size of the area is different

1698
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,140
I use SCUBA-2 today

1699
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,140
I use JCMP's SCUBA-2 camera

1700
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,140
I can observe

1701
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,140
I can observe such a large area at a time

1702
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,140
OK

1703
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,140
But if I use interference cloud

1704
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,140
Interference cloud

1705
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,140
Not for this thing

1706
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,140
Interference cloud is suitable for

1707
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,140
Observe individual sources

1708
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,140
Then it can only observe a small area at a time

1709
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,140
That is to say

1710
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,140
SCUBA-2 and interference cloud

1711
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,140
These two things

1712
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,140
Their purpose is different

1713
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,140
So why do I say

1714
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,140
SCUBA-2 is the most efficient way

1715
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,140
Because SCUBA-2

1716
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,140
Although the resolution is poor

1717
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,140
But it is

1718
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,140
It can have a relatively large

1719
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,140
Observation area

1720
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,140
So it can be effective

1721
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,140
To scan the entire sky

1722
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,140
Scan a large area

1723
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,140
OK

1724
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,140
So it is still the most effective

1725
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,140
To scan a large area

1726
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,140
Then find the source

1727
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,140
Then when we find these individual sources

1728
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,140
We use interference cloud

1729
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,140
To separate

1730
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,140
We use interference cloud

1731
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,140
To follow up

1732
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,140
Then get it

1733
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,140
Higher resolution

1734
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,140
This is the effective way of observation

1735
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,140
So basically the two of them

1736
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,140
The purpose is not the same

1737
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,140
Because it can only scan a small area at a time

1738
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,140
So if you want to scan a large area

1739
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,140
You have to observe

1740
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,140
Observe here, observe there

1741
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,140
Do a lot

1742
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,140
To the sky

1743
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,140
To a lot of different areas

1744
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,140
Then there is a way to put it together

1745
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,140
Such a large area

1746
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,140
This is very inefficient

1747
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,140
OK

1748
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,140
Speaking of this

1749
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,140
Do you have any questions

1750
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,140
I have a question

1751
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,140
You just said

1752
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,140
Interference cloud basically uses a lot of

1753
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,140
Small

1754
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,140
What is it called in Chinese?

1755
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,140
antenna

1756
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,140
antenna

1757
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,140
These antennas must be

1758
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,140
Gathered at the same point

1759
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,140
Or distributed well

1760
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,140
Even a few hundred miles

1761
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,140
Can also be distributed well

1762
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,140
Like my picture

1763
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,140
Usually interference cloud

1764
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,140
It has different configurations

1765
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,140
Will follow you

1766
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,140
The purpose observed by astronomers

1767
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,140
To adjust its configuration

1768
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,140
Usually you want to hear

1769
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,140
What is the so-called extended configuration

1770
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,140
Compact configuration

1771
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,140
Subcompact

1772
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,140
That means they have

1773
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,140
Spread it widely

1774
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,140
So it can be moved

1775
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,140
Yes, it can be moved

1776
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,140
Basically, the wider you spread

1777
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,140
Your resolution will be better

1778
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,140
Because the wider you spread

1779
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,140
Effectively

1780
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,140
The farther they are

1781
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,140
It's like you build a very large network

1782
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,140
Let you have low increase

1783
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,140
The wider you spread

1784
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,140
Your resolution is higher

1785
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,140
It is possible

1786
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,140
Different countries

1787
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,140
Antennas can also be formed

1788
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,140
Such a set

1789
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,140
Because this has been done for a long time

1790
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,140
This has been done for a long time

1791
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,140
Is

1792
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,140
Different wavelengths

1793
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,140
Like this

1794
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,140
A long time ago

1795
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,140
VLBI

1796
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,140
Very Large Baseline Intergalactic

1797
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,140
It

1798
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,140
But its wavelength is not

1799
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,140
The wavelength we are discussing today

1800
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,140
I believe that

1801
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,140
If I remember correctly, it should be longer

1802
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,140
That VLBI

1803
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,140
It's all over the world

1804
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,140
The antenna

1805
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,140
I remember the United States

1806
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,140
There is one in Arizona

1807
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,140
There is one in Hawaii

1808
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,140
A little more east

1809
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,140
I forgot

1810
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,140
Then it's all over the world

1811
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,140
So its baseline

1812
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,140
So the baseline

1813
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,140
I forgot to say

1814
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,140
Interferometry will talk about the name of the baseline

1815
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,140
Baseline is basically the distance between the antenna and the antenna

1816
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,140
The VLBI I just said

1817
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,140
Its baseline is very long

1818
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,140
Because it is equivalent to

1819
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,140
The size of the whole earth

1820
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,140
Baseline

1821
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,140
So it can do very high resolution

1822
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,140
A kind of observation

1823
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,140
Thank you

1824
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,140
So I just said

1825
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,140
Our single dish

1826
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,140
There are two questions

1827
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,140
The first one is that my resolution is very poor

1828
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,140
So I'm going to use interferometry

1829
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,140
To do more follow-up observations

1830
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,140
The other question is that I just said

1831
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,140
There will also be a detection limit

1832
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,140
How do I solve this?

1833
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,140
This is what my thesis is doing

1834
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,140
How do I solve this problem?

1835
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,140
Is to use so-called gravity

1836
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,140
OK

1837
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,140
I don't know how many of these listeners are studying physics

1838
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,140
If you are not studying physics

1839
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,140
You may have heard of it for the first time

1840
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,140
The so-called gravity is Einstein's relativity

1841
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,140
That is to say

1842
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,140
If there is gravity, it will cause time-space distortion

1843
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,140
Time-space distortion

1844
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,140
Time-space distortion will cause

1845
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,140
When the light passes through a gravitational field

1846
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,140
It will turn

1847
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,140
So it's like a透鏡

1848
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,140
Like a 突透鏡

1849
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,140
Have you ever played 突透鏡 when you were a kid?

1850
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,140
突透鏡 can gather light

1851
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,140
You can gather the light of the sun

1852
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,140
And then you can burn a paper on the ground

1853
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,140
So 突透鏡 has the effect of gathering light

1854
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,140
Or you can say

1855
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,140
It can make something darker

1856
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,140
After passing through your 突透鏡

1857
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,140
It looks brighter

1858
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,140
So

1859
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,140
Gravity can have this effect

1860
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,140
Because it can gather light

1861
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,140
So we often use gravity in astronomy

1862
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,140
To study very distant stars

1863
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,140
Very distant stars

1864
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,140
When you

1865
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,140
Suppose we observe a very distant galaxy here

1866
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,140
We are here

1867
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,140
But then just assume we are here

1868
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,140
There is a galaxy cluster in the middle of the light path

1869
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,140
Galaxy cluster

1870
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,140
Galaxy cluster is a lot of galaxies

1871
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,140
They are clustered together

1872
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,140
Galaxy cluster is

1873
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,140
In this universe

1874
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
It is the

1875
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,140
The largest

1876
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,140
Bound system

1877
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,140
Gravitationally bound system

1878
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,140
The quality of the galaxy

1879
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,140
Usually 10 to 14

1880
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,140
15

1881
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,140
Because its quality is very, very large

1882
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,140
So the galaxy must have

1883
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,140
Very strong gravity

1884
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,140
So they

1885
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,140
Can be used as a 突透鏡

1886
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,140
So these backgrounds

1887
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,140
These distant galaxies will be

1888
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,140
The galaxy cluster

1889
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,140
After having this focus

1890
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,140
It will become brighter

1891
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,140
So

1892
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,140
Astronomers often use this technique

1893
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,140
To observe very distant stars

1894
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,140
Because very distant stars

1895
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,140
Of course they will be darker

1896
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,140
Because it's too far

1897
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,140
But with the help of gravity

1898
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,140
We can observe a brighter brightness

1899
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,140
So it helps us

1900
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,140
To study the early universe

1901
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,140
OK

1902
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,140
Hubble telescope

1903
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,140
In the past few years

1904
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,140
There was a program called FrontierField

1905
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,140
FrontierField program

1906
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,140
It picked

1907
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,140
Six very bright galaxies

1908
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,140
These six

1909
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,140
Then

1910
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,140
The Hubble telescope took pictures of these six galaxies

1911
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,140
Very, very deep image

1912
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,140
So there will be

1913
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,140
A very beautiful visible image

1914
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,140
So

1915
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,140
The purpose of this FrontierField program

1916
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,140
Is

1917
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,140
To study very distant stars

1918
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,140
It uses

1919
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,140
The galaxy cluster as a focus

1920
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,140
To study distant stars

1921
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,140
So

1922
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,140
In this picture

1923
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,140
Let me show you

1924
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,140
Like this

1925
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,140
It's the galaxy cluster

1926
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,140
The focus of the galaxy

1927
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,140
But

1928
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,140
There is a line here

1929
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,140
These are all

1930
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,140
After gravity

1931
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,140
Distance star

1932
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,140
In English, it's Lensed

1933
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,140
They have been gravitated

1934
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,140
Lensed

1935
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,140
Distant star

1936
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,140
If you are a physicist

1937
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,140
You may have heard of Einstein ring

1938
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,140
These are the so-called Einstein ring

1939
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,140
Because it's a distant star

1940
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,140
Then

1941
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,140
After it's gravitated

1942
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,140
We see it

1943
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,140
Then we will see

1944
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,140
A ring

1945
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,140
The same

1946
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,140
The shape

1947
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,140
It's because it's a very distant star

1948
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,140
After gravity

1949
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,140
Okay

1950
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,140
This is Hubble

1951
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,140
FrontierField program

1952
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,140
But what am I observing today?

1953
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,140
I'm the girl up there

1954
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,140
I'm the same

1955
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,140
Because of this Hubble

1956
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,140
This program

1957
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,140
So my thesis is

1958
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:14,140
I used my JCMP telescope

1959
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,140
JCMP telescope has a scuba tube camera

1960
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:18,140
Then I also went to shoot

1961
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,140
A lot of galaxies

1962
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,140
We shot a total of nine galaxies

1963
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,140
Then include five FrontierField

1964
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,140
That is

1965
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,140
These five

1966
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,140
Except for this

1967
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:32,140
These five we shot

1968
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,140
Why don't we shoot this?

1969
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,140
Because of its coordinate

1970
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,140
This galaxy is too difficult to make

1971
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,140
It's too difficult to make in the sky

1972
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,140
But our JCMP

1973
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,140
It's in Hawaii and it's in the North Pole

1974
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:46,140
So it can't shoot this

1975
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,140
So we only shoot these five

1976
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,140
So I said including five FrontierField

1977
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,140
So

1978
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,140
We use the effect of gravity

1979
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,140
So we use the effect of gravity

1980
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,140
We do sub-millimeter observation

1981
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,140
So I just said this question

1982
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,140
TooManyGenski

1983
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,140
This limit problem can be solved

1984
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,140
Why? Because if we have the effect of gravity

1985
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,140
We observed

1986
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,140
The limit of the observation brightness

1987
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,140
It's still TooManyGenski

1988
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,140
But these

1989
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,140
TooManyGenski

1990
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,140
It was actually darker

1991
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,140
It is today

1992
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,140
After the effect of gravity

1993
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,140
After the effect of gravity

1994
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,140
But in fact we see

1995
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,140
Better than this limit

1996
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,140
Darker than this limit

1997
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,140
Sub-millimeter Galaxy

1998
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,140
That is to say, we use the effect of gravity

1999
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,140
We can observe

2000
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,140
Darker than the brightness of 10

2001
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,140
These Galaxy

2002
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,140
OK

2003
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,140
Then there is

2004
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,140
Today we use sub-millimeter

2005
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,140
Observe these

2006
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,140
There is another benefit

2007
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,140
That is

2008
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,140
If you observe today

2009
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,140
It's a visible wave segment

2010
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,140
Like this

2011
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,140
In this image

2012
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,140
Galaxy cluster

2013
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,140
And those background information

2014
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,140
Like these one by one

2015
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,140
So you have to find a way to distinguish them

2016
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,140
If you want to study

2017
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,140
High-resolution Galaxy

2018
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,140
But if you observe

2019
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,140
Sub-millimeter

2020
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,140
There will be no problem

2021
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,140
If you observe sub-millimeter

2022
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,140
These gravity sensors are basically transparent

2023
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,140
Why?

2024
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,140
Galaxy cluster

2025
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,140
Most of them are elliptical Galaxy

2026
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,140
These elliptical Galaxy are very old

2027
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,140
Very old Galaxy

2028
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,140
They don't have star formation

2029
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,140
No star formation

2030
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,140
And they don't have dust

2031
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,140
So these elliptical Galaxy

2032
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,140
They basically don't emit

2033
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,140
Far infrared light

2034
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,140
They basically don't emit

2035
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,140
Far infrared emission

2036
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,140
They don't have dust emission

2037
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,140
In addition, these stars

2038
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,140
Their redshift is about 0.5

2039
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,140
0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6

2040
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,140
So even if they have

2041
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:04,140
Far infrared emission

2042
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,140
They won't go to sub-millimeter

2043
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,140
So the conclusion is

2044
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,140
The conclusion is

2045
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,140
These Galaxy clusters

2046
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,140
They don't emit sub-millimeter

2047
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,140
So when you are shooting this star

2048
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,140
Then you use sub-millimeter

2049
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,140
To observe

2050
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,140
You see any

2051
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,140
You see any of these sources

2052
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,140
They are basically background

2053
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,140
They are all emitted from a very distant universe

2054
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,140
Not the star itself

2055
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,140
Because I just said

2056
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,140
The elliptical Galaxy in the star

2057
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,140
They don't emit far infrared emission

2058
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,140
So this is a very neat thing

2059
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,140
You don't have to

2060
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,140
Not like you are in visible light

2061
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,140
You still have to distinguish

2062
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,140
The background and the cluster itself

2063
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,140
So these two pictures

2064
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,140
Basically my

2065
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,140
This is how it looks

2066
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,140
And then

2067
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,140
This blue and red area

2068
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,140
It's basically the Hubble telescope

2069
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,140
The area that has been observed

2070
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,140
OK

2071
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:04,140
So why do we

2072
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,140
We have to observe these redshift stars

2073
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,140
Because the Hubble telescope

2074
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,140
Get these areas of very deep visible light

2075
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,140
Then we also use sub-millimeter to shoot

2076
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,140
We can find these

2077
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,140
Sub-millimeter sources

2078
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,140
And then we need to

2079
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,140
We can also go to the Hubble telescope

2080
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,140
To find the counterpart

2081
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,140
It's in visible light

2082
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,140
Right

2083
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,140
It's not just the Hubble telescope

2084
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,140
It also has other telescopes

2085
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,140
That is to say

2086
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,140
These areas are very rich

2087
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,140
Very rich

2088
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,140
Observations

2089
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,140
What we do today

2090
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,140
We are also in the area

2091
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,140
We use

2092
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,140
Sub-millimeter

2093
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,140
Then the picture I showed today

2094
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:50,140
The left is 450 micrometers

2095
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,140
The right is 850 micrometers

2096
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,140
Then we mainly use 850

2097
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,140
Then today

2098
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,140
The yellow circle

2099
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,140
The circle

2100
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,140
It's one by one

2101
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,140
Sub-millimeter sources

2102
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,140
Then this cluster

2103
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,140
It's Abell 370

2104
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:10,140
That's the one I just

2105
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,140
One of the Hubble

2106
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,140
Ok

2107
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,140
Then

2108
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,140
With this image

2109
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:20,140
We can detect a lot of darker

2110
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:22,140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

2111
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,140
Because I said that they were observed by us

2112
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,140
So they are actually

2113
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,140
Lower than our original

2114
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,140
Sub-millimeter observation

2115
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,140
Then we have to study these darker

2116
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

2117
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,140
What to do

2118
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,140
Here is the explanation

2119
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,140
The picture on the right

2120
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,140
It's called

2121
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,140
Sub-millimeter number count

2122
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,140
The horizontal axis is 850 micrometers

2123
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,140
The vertical axis is basically

2124
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:56,140
Number density

2125
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:58,140
That is

2126
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,140
The number of sub-millimeter galaxies

2127
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,140
The number of unit areas

2128
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,140
Then divided by

2129
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,140
Unit brightness

2130
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,140
So its unit is like this

2131
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,140
Because it is the number divided by

2132
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,140
Area divided by

2133
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,140
Flux

2134
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:16,140
But basically it is

2135
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,140
Number density per area per

2136
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,140
Flux

2137
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,140
If you measure it out, it's like this

2138
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,140
Then

2139
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,140
Usually we use this model

2140
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,140
This is called Broken Power Law

2141
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,140
Here is a Power Law

2142
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,140
Here is another Power Law

2143
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,140
Then today this red line

2144
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,140
Is the Confusion Limit I just said

2145
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,140
If I use JCMP to observe today

2146
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,140
Our limit is this

2147
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:46,140
Is this red line

2148
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,140
OK, so if we observe

2149
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,140
General sky area like this

2150
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,140
These three are general sky areas

2151
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,140
They are not sub-millimeter sky areas

2152
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,140
We can only constrain this part

2153
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,140
But if we observe today

2154
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,140
These blue circles are all

2155
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:02,140
Sub-millimeter sky areas

2156
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,140
That is galaxy cluster

2157
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,140
We can only observe the darker background

2158
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,140
Sub-millimeter galaxy

2159
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,140
Because they are lensed

2160
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,140
We can also have

2161
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,140
Measurement on the left side of the limit

2162
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,140
So we can constrain

2163
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,140
This part that we couldn't observe

2164
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,140
OK

2165
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,140
This picture is very basic

2166
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,140
The darker it is, the higher the density

2167
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,140
This is why the dark

2168
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,140
Sub-millimeter galaxy is important

2169
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,140
We used to have this limit

2170
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,140
We can only observe this part of the sub-millimeter galaxy

2171
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,140
But in fact, the dark galaxy is more

2172
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,140
The density of the dark galaxy is more than that of the bright galaxy

2173
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,140
That is to say

2174
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,140
In this universe

2175
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,140
You have to study

2176
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,140
We are studying

2177
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,140
Cosmic Star Formation History

2178
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,140
Then I want to study

2179
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,140
Dusty part

2180
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,140
Dusty part

2181
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,140
In this part

2182
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,140
The dark sub-millimeter galaxy

2183
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,140
Its contribution is far greater than

2184
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,140
This brighter sub-millimeter galaxy

2185
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,140
The reason is very simple

2186
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,140
Because its density is higher

2187
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,140
Although they are darker

2188
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,140
So they contribute

2189
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,140
If you only compare a single sub-millimeter galaxy

2190
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,140
Then one is bright and one is dark

2191
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,140
Of course the darker one

2192
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,140
Will be less than a brighter one

2193
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,140
But because

2194
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,140
You are a power law

2195
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,140
Its number density is a function of flux

2196
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,140
Is a power law

2197
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,140
Darker

2198
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,140
Its number is much more than the bright ones

2199
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,140
So in general

2200
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,140
Dark sub-millimeter galaxy

2201
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,140
Contribute star formation

2202
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,140
Is much more than the bright ones

2203
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:42,140
So they are important

2204
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,140
Is there any problem here?

2205
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,140
No

2206
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,140
What about the picture on the left?

2207
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,140
This is called

2208
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,140
Star Formation Rate Density

2209
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,140
But it also

2210
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,140
Normalize itself

2211
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:00,140
It is per

2212
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,140
Star Formation Rate

2213
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,140
The horizontal axis is the star formation rate

2214
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,140
It is the star formation rate

2215
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,140
How much solar mass is generated per year

2216
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,140
Here is the star formation

2217
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,140
Sorry

2218
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,140
Here is the galaxy

2219
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,140
Its number density

2220
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,140
Per star formation rate

2221
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:22,140
Log star formation rate

2222
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,140
The picture is like this

2223
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,140
The picture on the left

2224
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:28,140
Is observed by optical

2225
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,140
Optical

2226
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:32,140
To get the curve

2227
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,140
The curve on the right

2228
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,140
Is observed by sub-millimeter

2229
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,140
To get the curve

2230
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,140
Then you will find

2231
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,140
The population on the left

2232
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,140
Is the optical environment

2233
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,140
As I said

2234
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,140
Because it is a redshift galaxy

2235
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,140
Its redstripe is actually UB

2236
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,140
OK

2237
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,140
These

2238
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,140
UVs

2239
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,140
Or the optical samples

2240
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,140
On the left

2241
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,140
On the left

2242
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,140
You will find these two populations

2243
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,140
Here are different curves

2244
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,140
From different papers

2245
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,140
These two

2246
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,140
These two populations

2247
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:14,140
Almost do not overlap

2248
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:16,140
Why do not overlap?

2249
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,140
Because these

2250
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,140
Can be directly observed by optical

2251
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:22,140
Because the star formation rate

2252
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,140
Is not so high

2253
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,140
Because usually the more dusty

2254
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,140
The more dusty

2255
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,140
The higher the star formation rate

2256
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,140
Usually like this

2257
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,140
So these sub-millimeter samples

2258
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,140
They are very dusty galaxies

2259
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,140
Although they are all on the right

2260
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,140
Their star formation rate is very high

2261
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,140
Then there is the confusion limit

2262
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,140
I just said

2263
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,140
Your sub-millimeter sample is limited to

2264
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:48,140
The single digit limit

2265
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,140
And these other visible light waves

2266
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,140
Their samples overlap

2267
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,140
So what we want to do today is

2268
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,140
I use gravity

2269
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:58,140
I can observe the darker

2270
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,140
Sub-millimeter

2271
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

2272
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,140
This red line and this red line

2273
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,140
Basically correspond

2274
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,140
I have gravity

2275
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,140
I want to let the curve on the right

2276
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,140
Extend to the left

2277
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:14,140
Is to extend my sub-millimeter sample

2278
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,140
Extend to the left

2279
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:18,140
Let my sub-millimeter sample

2280
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,140
With these visible light observed samples

2281
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,140
Can overlap

2282
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,140
Then after the overlap

2283
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,140
The most important thing comes

2284
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,140
I

2285
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,140
I have observed

2286
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,140
After this sub-millimeter sample

2287
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,140
The question I want to ask is

2288
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,140
In this place

2289
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,140
I put this sample to the left

2290
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:40,140
My sub-millimeter galaxy

2291
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,140
In this place

2292
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:44,140
Is it these

2293
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,140
These visible light

2294
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,140
Can see the galaxy

2295
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:50,140
Are they the same thing?

2296
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,140
Or is it completely different?

2297
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,140
Part is the same, part is the same

2298
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:56,140
Part is the same, part is different

2299
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,140
This thing is very important, why?

2300
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,140
Because we are

2301
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,140
Establish, we are measuring our universe

2302
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,140
Star formation history

2303
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,140
I just said that there are two populations in the universe

2304
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,140
These two populations are very important

2305
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,140
One is directly observed by visible light

2306
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,140
One is to use long-wave long-wave red light

2307
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,140
These two samples

2308
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:16,140
We can measure their

2309
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,140
Star formation history contribution to our universe

2310
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:20,140
OK

2311
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,140
Both are important

2312
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,140
Because there are two populations

2313
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:26,140
We have to combine them together

2314
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,140
Is the total star formation in our universe

2315
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,140
OK

2316
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,140
Then we can draw

2317
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,140
The picture I just drew in the first page

2318
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,140
Is the star formation history of the universe

2319
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:38,140
We have to put these two observations

2320
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,140
Combine together

2321
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,140
But today

2322
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,140
When we extend the sub-minimum sample here

2323
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:46,140
Then we have to know

2324
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,140
Are these sub-minimum samples

2325
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:50,140
These sub-minimum samples

2326
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,140
These sub-minimum galaxies

2327
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,140
Is it already

2328
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,140
Included in these samples

2329
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,140
Right

2330
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,140
In case we observe

2331
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,140
We extend this sample here

2332
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:04,140
Then in case these sub-minimum galaxies

2333
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,140
In this place

2334
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,140
Sub-minimum galaxies

2335
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,140
Already included in these UV

2336
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,140
These visible light samples

2337
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,140
Then we just

2338
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,140
We don't have to do it anymore

2339
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,140
Because there is no need to

2340
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,140
Study those darker sub-minimum galaxies

2341
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,140
Because those darker sub-minimum galaxies

2342
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,140
Basically it's you

2343
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:26,140
Those galaxies selected by visible light

2344
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:28,140
It's the same thing

2345
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,140
Why do we have to go to Africa

2346
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,140
To use more difficult

2347
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,140
Long-wave long-wave observation to study them

2348
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,140
Because it's the same thing

2349
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:38,140
In fact

2350
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,140
On the contrary

2351
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:42,140
In case these sub-minimum galaxies

2352
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,140
In this part of the sub-minimum galaxies

2353
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,140
Not all

2354
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,140
Already included in this sample

2355
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,140
Then we have to know

2356
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,140
OK

2357
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,140
How many fractions are already included in it

2358
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:56,140
How many fractions are not included

2359
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,140
That is to say

2360
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,140
We want to know how many fractions

2361
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,140
In this part of the sub-minimum galaxy

2362
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,140
We can directly see the visible light

2363
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,140
How much is still visible

2364
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,140
Still can't see

2365
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,140
We have this information

2366
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,140
After we quantize it

2367
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:14,140
We can accurately put

2368
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,140
This UV sample

2369
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:18,140
The visible light sample

2370
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,140
Contribute to the star formation

2371
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,140
And our sub-minimum sample

2372
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:24,140
Contribute to the star formation

2373
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:26,140
Add them up

2374
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,140
Because if these two samples today

2375
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,140
Are completely independent

2376
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,140
Then just add them up

2377
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:34,140
When they overlap

2378
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,140
This part may not be completely independent

2379
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,140
But it may not be completely dependent

2380
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,140
So we have to know

2381
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,140
How many fractions are overlapping

2382
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,140
How many sub-minimum sources

2383
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,140
It is actually also in the UV

2384
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,140
Will see

2385
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,140
This is why

2386
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:52,140
Study the darker sub-minimum galaxy

2387
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,140
Very important

2388
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:56,140
We want to know

2389
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:58,140
How many of them

2390
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,140
Already included in the rest-frame UV sample

2391
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,140
So we can accurately

2392
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:04,140
To measure

2393
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:06,140
The star formation of our entire universe

2394
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:08,140
Another important reason is

2395
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,140
Because we found

2396
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,140
In the past, these sub-minimum galaxies

2397
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,140
Hello

2398
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:16,140
I have a question

2399
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,140
Can't hear

2400
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,140
My question is

2401
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:24,140
If you put them

2402
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,140
Extend

2403
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,140
I use typing

2404
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,140
You can talk while typing

2405
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,140
Because after typing, I have to quit to see

2406
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:46,140
Can you hear me

2407
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:50,140
Hello

2408
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:52,140
Sorry

2409
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,140
I accidentally pressed you to leave

2410
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,140
So you're back

2411
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,140
Yes

2412
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,140
My question is

2413
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,140
Can you hear me

2414
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:10,140
If you extend

2415
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:12,140
If it's different

2416
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,140
You know it's different

2417
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,140
But if you extend and overlap

2418
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,140
How do you know it's the same

2419
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,140
Maybe it's still different

2420
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,140
The so-called difference means

2421
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,140
Suppose I detect

2422
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:28,140
Suppose I detect

2423
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,140
Some darker

2424
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,140
Sub-minimum galaxies

2425
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:52,140
I detect some darker

2426
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,140
Sub-minimum galaxies

2427
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,140
Their star formation rate

2428
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:58,140
Can you hear me

2429
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,140
I detect some darker

2430
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,140
Sub-minimum galaxies

2431
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,140
Their star formation rate

2432
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:10,140
What I want to do is

2433
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:12,140
Very simple

2434
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,140
What I want to do is

2435
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,140
Like this

2436
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,140
Like this

2437
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,140
What I want to do is very simple

2438
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,140
Suppose I have a sub-minimum galaxy

2439
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,140
Darker than this

2440
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,140
Then I use the interferometer

2441
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,140
To accurately measure its position

2442
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,140
Then I go to the visible wave field

2443
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:38,140
That is the Hubble telescope

2444
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,140
Or other telescope

2445
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,140
To find out if it corresponds to

2446
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,140
The visible counterpart

2447
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,140
When you have a visible counterpart

2448
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,140
And it's a very obvious counterpart

2449
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,140
It means

2450
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,140
It is

2451
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,140
It is this kind of galaxy

2452
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,140
It is the galaxy found in the visible wave field

2453
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,140
On the contrary, if you

2454
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,140
Basically

2455
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,140
This kind of galaxy

2456
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,140
If you find it has a visible emission

2457
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,140
It means

2458
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,140
It is this kind of galaxy

2459
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,140
It is this kind of galaxy

2460
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,140
I'm talking about

2461
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:18,140
Statistically

2462
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:20,140
Not a galaxy

2463
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,140
I'm not talking about

2464
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:24,140
A sub-minimum galaxy

2465
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,140
Is it a galaxy in a paper

2466
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:28,140
Is it a galaxy in a paper

2467
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,140
I'm talking about

2468
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,140
Statistically

2469
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,140
Can a sub-minimum galaxy

2470
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,140
Can a sub-minimum galaxy

2471
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,140
Do you know what I mean?

2472
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:40,140
So what you have to do is very simple

2473
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:42,140
You use the interferometer to accurately measure

2474
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:44,140
The position of a sub-minimum

2475
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,140
Then we go to the visible beam

2476
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,140
To see if it emits light

2477
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,140
Or if it is completely non-existent

2478
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,140
That's it

2479
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,140
I want to ask

2480
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,140
I see

2481
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,140
I understand

2482
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,140
I may have missed it

2483
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:04,140
So in this way

2484
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,140
The visible and non-visible light emitted by a star

2485
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,140
The visible and non-visible light emitted by a star

2486
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,140
The brightness of these two lights

2487
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:12,140
There is no certain relationship

2488
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,140
The so-called non-visible light

2489
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,140
Is the sub-minimum we talked about

2490
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,140
Is the sub-minimum we talked about

2491
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,140
It's actually a little bit

2492
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:26,140
I'll talk about it later

2493
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,140
Usually

2494
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,140
It should be related

2495
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:32,140
Of course

2496
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:34,140
Because

2497
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,140
Because it's with your

2498
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,140
The amount of dust in the galaxy

2499
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,140
The amount of dust in the galaxy

2500
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,140
Does it matter?

2501
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:44,140
How much dust

2502
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,140
It's related, right?

2503
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:48,140
It's related, right?

2504
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:50,140
I'll talk about it later

2505
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,140
Others are studying

2506
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,140
A lower shift galaxy

2507
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,140
I'll talk about it later

2508
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:58,140
I'll talk about it later

2509
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,140
I'll continue

2510
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:04,140
I hope I've convinced you

2511
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:06,140
I hope I've convinced you

2512
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,140
Why I'm studying the sub-minimum galaxy

2513
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:10,140
Two things

2514
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,140
I haven't talked about the second thing

2515
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,140
The first thing is what I asked

2516
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,140
The second thing is

2517
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,140
The previous astronomers found

2518
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,140
The bright sub-minimum galaxies

2519
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,140
The brightness is brighter than the two-minimum galaxies

2520
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,140
The brightness is brighter than the two-minimum galaxies

2521
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,140
They are all very dusty

2522
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:28,140
Very intense star forming galaxies

2523
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,140
They are all very dusty very intense star forming galaxies

2524
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,140
The green star forming galaxies

2525
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:34,140
They are all very dusty

2526
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,140
very intense star forming galaxies

2527
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:38,140
These sub-minimum galaxies

2528
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,140
These sub-minimum galaxies

2529
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,140
They are all major mergers

2530
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:44,140
They are all major mergers

2531
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,140
They are conglomerates

2532
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,140
They are conglomerates

2533
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,140
They are conglomerates

2534
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,140
You can look up

2535
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,140
You can look up

2536
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,140
The answer

2537
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,140
The answer

2538
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:00,140
The answer is SMG

2539
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,140
The answer is SMG

2540
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,140
The answer is SMG

2541
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,140
I forgot to mention

2542
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,140
The darker stars are SMG

2543
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,140
The darker stars are SMG

2544
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,140
Are these also major mergers?

2545
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,140
Are these also major mergers?

2546
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,140
Or are they conglomerates?

2547
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:18,140
Or are they conglomerates?

2548
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,140
They are not intense

2549
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,140
They are not intense

2550
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,140
Not major mergers

2551
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:26,140
Not major mergers

2552
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,140
They are isolated disks

2553
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,140
These star formation data

2554
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,140
These star formation data

2555
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:34,140
are not major mergers

2556
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:38,140
They are simple spiral galaxies

2557
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,140
They are simple spiral galaxies

2558
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:42,140
...

2559
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,140
They are not that intense

2560
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,140
They are not that intense

2561
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,140
so their star formation rate is not that high

2562
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:50,140
...

2563
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,140
