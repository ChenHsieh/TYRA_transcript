0	6000	Let's start recording.
6000	8000	Okay.
8000	10000	Okay, I got it. Thank you.
10000	12000	Let's start.
12000	14000	Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Yanping.
14000	16000	I'm your host today.
16000	18000	But I'll probably talk for a while
18000	20000	and then I'll be gone.
20000	22000	Because my wife's waist is twisted
22000	24000	to the point where she can't hold the baby.
24000	26000	So...
26000	28000	I'm going to have an emergency meeting later.
28000	30000	So today,
30000	32000	let's welcome Hanxi to share
32000	34000	with us...
34000	36000	He's the only one who has a webcam
36000	38000	so he's Hanxi.
38000	40000	He's going to share
40000	42000	with us about the
42000	44000	law related to
44000	46000	public safety.
46000	48000	Because
48000	50000	Hanxi...
50000	52000	Is Hanxi right?
52000	54000	Yes, that's right.
54000	56000	Okay.
56000	58000	My Chinese isn't very good.
58000	60000	Hanxi used to
60000	62000	study law.
62000	64000	But then he went to the police station
64000	66000	to study...
66000	68000	He studied for a while
68000	70000	in Yang Ming's police station.
70000	72000	Then he came back to study law.
72000	74000	His major is
74000	76000	the law related to
76000	78000	public safety.
78000	80000	Hanxi will share the details with us later.
80000	82000	No problem.
82000	84000	We're happy to have Hanxi here today
84000	86000	because he's probably our first law student.
86000	88000	Also, he's probably our first...
88000	90000	I guess,
90000	92000	pure humanist.
92000	94000	So we're happy that we can finally
94000	96000	expand to a more complete
96000	98000	academic field.
98000	100000	There are people in all fields.
100000	102000	Without further ado,
102000	104000	let's give a round of applause to welcome Hanxi.
104000	106000	I'm the only one in charge of filming.
106000	108000	Because
108000	110000	today's guest is not alone.
110000	112000	Today's guest is not alone.
112000	114000	Let me briefly introduce myself.
114000	116000	I'm a friend of Yuhui.
116000	118000	Let's get to know each other.
120000	122000	Why is my microphone
122000	124000	turned off all of a sudden?
124000	126000	Okay.
126000	128000	Yeah.
128000	130000	It's like
130000	132000	a small roundtable.
132000	134000	It's like a chat.
134000	136000	It's not a formal report.
136000	138000	Since we have the opportunity,
138000	140000	let's get to know each other.
140000	142000	Okay.
142000	144000	I'm not sure
144000	146000	which school you're from.
146000	148000	So let's...
148000	150000	Let me introduce myself.
150000	152000	Let me introduce myself.
152000	154000	I'm from UNC.
154000	156000	I'm from Beka.
156000	158000	I'm majoring in social psychology.
158000	160000	Who's next?

178000	180000	I'm majoring in
180000	182000	high-performance computing.
182000	184000	It's related to supercomputers.
184000	186000	It's related to supercomputers.
186000	188000	I'm doing an internship
188000	190000	in Tennessee.
190000	192000	So you're not in DC.
192000	194000	I'll be back in September.
194000	196000	I'll be back in September.
196000	198000	Cool.
200000	202000	So your name is
202000	204000	Zhuang Ping...
204000	206000	Bi Yue.
206000	208000	Zhuang Bi Yue.
208000	210000	Bi Yue Xuan Hua.
210000	212000	Okay.
216000	218000	Let's switch to Caltech.
218000	220000	We have two people here.
220000	222000	I'm Zhuang Ye You.
222000	224000	I'm working in Caltech
224000	226000	and NASA JPL.
226000	228000	I'm working on dark matter experiments.
228000	230000	I'm Yu Zhe Jing.
230000	232000	You can call me Zhe.
232000	234000	I'm studying in Taiwan University.
234000	236000	I'm studying in Taiwan University.
236000	238000	I'm working in Caltech.
238000	240000	I used to work in chemical engineering.
240000	242000	I'm working in environmental engineering.
242000	244000	That's cool.
244000	246000	That's cool.
254000	256000	So there's one more person.
264000	266000	He left a comment
266000	268000	in the chat room.
268000	270000	Oh, okay.
272000	274000	He's studying geography.
274000	276000	He's studying geography.
276000	278000	What field is he studying?
278000	280000	Geography is pretty broad.
280000	282000	It ranges from biology to natural science.
282000	284000	I'm pretty interested in this.
290000	292000	So we're going to
292000	294000	chat with Zhuang.
294000	296000	Physical Geography.
296000	298000	Okay.
298000	300000	Okay.
308000	310000	You've been to Charleston.
310000	312000	Okay.
312000	314000	I'm going to start.
320000	322000	I'm going to hand over my video.
322000	324000	I'm going to hand over my video.
328000	330000	Okay.
330000	332000	Hello, everyone.
332000	334000	I'm at Georgetown
334000	336000	studying law.
336000	338000	If you have any questions,
338000	340000	feel free to ask.
340000	342000	You can see my screen.
342000	344000	I think you can hear me.
344000	346000	If you have any questions,
346000	348000	feel free to ask.
348000	350000	I'm happy to share
350000	352000	my research topic with you.
352000	354000	I'm at Georgetown Law School.
354000	356000	I'm at Georgetown Law School.
356000	358000	It's a big classroom.
358000	360000	The signal here is very good.
360000	362000	I'm preparing this topic
362000	364000	about obesity
364000	366000	and soda tax.
366000	368000	I'm preparing this topic
368000	370000	about obesity
370000	372000	and soda tax.
372000	374000	I'm preparing this topic
374000	376000	about obesity
376000	378000	and soda tax.
378000	380000	I'm happy to share
380000	382000	my research topic
382000	384000	with you.
384000	386000	As for this topic,
386000	388000	as for this topic,
388000	390000	I've seen your research background
390000	392000	and your interest.
392000	394000	and your interest.
394000	396000	You are a Law student,
396000	398000	after my research.
398000	400000	You have a reputation
400000	402000	as an authority
402000	404000	in social science
404000	406000	You have a reputation as an authority
406000	408000	in social science
408000	410000	in social science
410000	412000	and with the social issue.
412000	414000	and with the social issue.
414000	416000	I am not sure
416000	418240	If we are too
418240	420000	boring or too hard Louise.
420000	422000	I am not sure
452000	454000	is a good
454000	456000	introduction.
456000	458000	Well
458000	460000	Briefly is a bit
460000	462000	complicated because
462000	464000	Actually I have
464000	466000	been to many schools
466000	468000	and by the way
468000	470000	this is the 5th
470000	472000	University of Charleston
472000	478000	So there are
478000	480000	my field
480000	482000	On the one hand, I was born with a legal background
482000	484000	as you all know
484000	486000	I studied law
486000	488000	and then became a lawyer
488000	490000	I was born with a legal background and trained
490000	492000	I also studied law
492000	494000	and now I am studying law
494000	496000	On the other hand, I have
496000	498000	a different background
498000	500000	from other law students
500000	502000	in my work experience
502000	504000	and medical background
504000	506000	How to say
506000	508000	My first
508000	510000	political work
510000	512000	I put a small picture here
512000	514000	My first political work
514000	516000	was in Seattle
516000	518000	ICHS
518000	520000	International Community Health Service
520000	522000	International Community Health Service
522000	524000	hospital work
524000	526000	At that time, I was in UW
526000	528000	2007
528000	530000	After graduating from the University of Charleston
530000	532000	I went there to work
532000	534000	This is my first political work
534000	536000	Because I was a lawyer in Taiwan before
536000	538000	I haven't worked in Taiwan
538000	540000	That was my first political work
540000	542000	For a lawyer in Taiwan
542000	544000	I worked in a hospital
544000	546000	I think this is a very surprising thing
546000	548000	Anyway
548000	550000	So that year
550000	552000	to some extent
552000	554000	I got interested in medical law
554000	556000	and then
556000	558000	jumped out
558000	560000	When I returned to Taiwan
560000	562000	I tried to keep it as relevant as possible
562000	564000	So I continued to specialize in medical law
564000	566000	in the field of public health law
568000	570000	So can everyone hear me?
570000	572000	Because I found this
572000	574000	quite strange
574000	576000	I can't hear everyone's voice
576000	578000	We can hear you
578000	580000	Welcome everyone to speak at any time
580000	582000	Otherwise
582000	584000	It's my first time to find this kind of self-talk
584000	586000	It feels strange
586000	588000	You can't see anyone
588000	590000	It's like practicing a speech
590000	592000	I can hear you
592000	594000	I can hear you
596000	598000	Will it be better if I turn it on?
598000	600000	If you don't mind
600000	602000	I feel like I can see your face
604000	606000	Because I'm not wearing clothes right now
606000	608000	So I don't want to see
608000	610000	So I don't want to see
610000	612000	But other people who are wearing clothes can turn it on
612000	614000	Other people who are wearing clothes can turn it on
616000	618000	If there is an answer, we will turn it on
618000	620000	Okay, no problem, thank you
620000	622000	Can we turn on the video?
622000	624000	Can we turn on the video?
624000	626000	Yes, you can turn off the sound
626000	628000	Yes, you can turn off the sound
628000	630000	At least there is a video
630000	632000	It feels better to talk to a real person
632000	634000	It feels better to talk to a real person
634000	636000	Okay, thank you
636000	638000	To put it simply
638000	640000	I'm basically a lawyer
640000	642000	I went to Taiwan to study law
642000	644000	But I'm interested in public health law
644000	646000	So I chose this topic
646000	648000	OK, I'm probably
648000	650000	It's 6.20 right now
650000	652000	It's actually quite simple
652000	654000	My presentation is divided into three parts
654000	656000	The first one is introduction
656000	658000	I want to introduce the background of this research
658000	660000	Why did we choose sugar?
660000	662000	Why did we choose soda
662000	664000	And the intervention of public health
664000	666000	And the intervention of public health
666000	668000	The second one
668000	670000	I reported a case study
670000	672000	One of the things I studied was the case of Sodatex
672000	674000	One of the things I studied was the case of Sodatex
674000	676000	Finally, I hope to leave some time for discussion
676000	678000	Finally, I hope to leave some time for discussion
678000	680000	About Sodatex
680000	682000	Because Caltech should be in LA
682000	684000	Because Caltech should be in LA
684000	686000	So if there are students from
686000	688000	So if there are students from
688000	690000	San Francisco or Berkeley
690000	692000	They are really
692000	694000	Within the scope of the use of Sodatex
694000	696000	Because there is Sodatex in the city
696000	698000	May feel better
698000	700000	But this is a trend
700000	702000	So all cities in the United States
702000	704000	are moving in this direction
704000	706000	So maybe you will have this problem
706000	708000	So maybe you will have this problem
708000	710000	I have talked to the LA public health officials
710000	712000	I have talked to the LA public health officials
712000	714000	So it may not be in the short term
714000	716000	But this proposal has always existed
716000	718000	It is possible
718000	720000	After the discussion
720000	722000	After the discussion
722000	724000	After the discussion
724000	726000	There must be pros and cons
726000	728000	There must be pros and cons
728000	730000	There must be pros and cons
730000	732000	So I will use my time
732000	734000	So I will use my time
734000	736000	What is the concept of Sodatex?
736000	738000	So I will use my time
738000	740000	Isn't there any in California?
740000	742000	Isn't there any in California?
742000	744000	People in California
744000	746000	People in California
746000	748000	People in California
748000	750000	Are using cities as units
750000	752000	Are using cities as units
752000	754000	To increase the Sodatex
754000	756000	To increase the Sodatex
756000	758000	Most correct names are
759000	761000	more accurate translation is
761000	763000	more accurate translation is
767000	769000	it is except this Salestex
769000	771000	it is except this Salestex
771000	773000	it is in addition to a SodaTex
773000	775000	it is the at the top
775000	777000	more than now
777000	778060	700
781000	783000	This trend continues
786000	787000	more and more places
787000	789000	plus tax
789000	791000	plus tax
791000	793000	When buying fuel
793000	795000	it is more expensive
797000	799000	like buying cigarettes and drinking alcohol
799000	801000	The tax on it has a higher price
801000	803000	The tax on it has a higher price
805000	807000	Not exactly
807000	809000	extent
809000	811000	Not exactly
811000	813000	not exactly
813000	815000	I don't know if you will talk about it later
815000	817000	I don't know if you will talk about it later
817000	819000	I just want to ask
819000	821000	Does the tax cover
821000	823000	hand shake drinks
823000	825000	like bubble milk tea
827000	829000	For now
829000	831000	for bubble milk
831000	833000	This is a good question
833000	835000	Because most of it
835000	837000	in tax
837000	839000	is made
839000	841000	the finished product
841000	843000	But
843000	845000	if it is a
845000	847000	freshly made drink
