0	13000	Hello everyone, I'm the host for today, Zhang Yanyong, and we're going to have our 21st Terra Talk.
14000	16000	Today's speaker is Xu Liyan.
16000	21000	Xu Liyan and I have known each other for almost two years.
21000	30000	It's really interesting because we're at Caltech, and Xu Liyan is studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.
30000	36000	In 2016, we had a year-long visit to Caltech and IPAC.
36000	38000	At that time, we met Xu Liyan.
38000	43000	Xu Liyan happens to be a senior in the Department of Physics at Caltech, but he was studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.
43000	45000	Did I say that correctly?
45000	48000	I'm from the Department of Physics.
48000	50000	Oh, you're from the Department of Physics.
50000	53000	But you're studying astronomy at Manoa University.
53000	57000	My advisor is from Manoa University.
57000	58000	I see.
58000	62000	It's interesting because he's from Hawaii, and they were surfing.
62000	65000	I was surfing, so we became good friends.
65000	70000	Of course, his main job is still doing astronomy observation research in Hawaii.
70000	79000	After returning from Caltech, in 2017, he recently obtained a Ph.D. degree, so he is a new doctor.
79000	82000	Liyan's research is mainly galaxy observation.
82000	87000	In his doctoral career, he is going to talk to us about this big topic today.
87000	94000	He published 34 papers, but today he will focus on the latest one.
94000	104000	If you are interested in learning more about the previous papers, you can contact him directly.
104000	108000	Without further ado, let's welcome Liyan to give us his speech.
108000	110000	I'll mute myself.
110000	115000	I'd like to remind everyone to mute your microphone when you speak.
115000	116000	Thank you.
116000	117000	You can start.
117000	119000	Okay, I'll start.
120000	125000	If you have any questions, please mute your microphone.
125000	128000	I'm afraid people won't understand.
130000	131000	Oh, sorry.
131000	133000	We forgot something.
133000	134000	We need to clap.
134000	137000	We need to mute our microphone when we clap.
140000	142000	Okay, you can start.
142000	143000	Okay, thank you.
144000	153000	As you can see, my title is Characterizing Faint Sub-millimeter Galaxies with Posture Lensing.
153000	161000	If you don't read astronomy, you can only understand Characterizing, Faint, and Width.
161000	164000	I'll explain what they mean.
165000	172000	In short, I'm studying a galaxy called Sub-millimeter Galaxy.
172000	182000	The wavelength detected by this galaxy is called Sub-millimeter.
182000	187000	Sub-millimeter is shorter than millimeter.
187000	189000	Millimeter is in kilometers.
190000	202000	Traditionally, people use 850 micrometers to study Sub-millimeter Galaxy.
202000	208000	Now I'll explain why I'm studying this galaxy and what I'm studying.
209000	211000	Okay.
211000	216000	Why do we study this galaxy?
216000	219000	It's related to the evolution of the universe.
219000	227000	You can google the history of the universe.
227000	229000	You'll see a similar picture.
229000	234000	The age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.
234000	235000	Maybe you've heard of it.
236000	239000	It started from the Big Bang.
239000	243000	The history of the universe is shown here.
243000	244000	It started from the Big Bang.
244000	249000	Then there was a period of time called Inflation.
249000	253000	At that time, the temperature of the universe was still very high.
253000	255000	It was all gaseous gas.
256000	259000	Until the temperature dropped to the ground.
259000	266000	The gaseous electrons in the universe were recombined with the gaseous atoms.
266000	269000	They became neutral gas atoms.
269000	274000	From then on, light can start to run freely in the universe.
274000	280000	Before that, any light would be scattered by those gaseous electrons.
281000	285000	From then on, light can run freely in the universe.
285000	290000	At that time, the universe was scattered by those gaseous electrons.
290000	291000	Okay.
291000	295000	But the temperature of the universe was still very high.
295000	299000	So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.
299000	302000	After the temperature dropped to the ground.
302000	304000	The temperature of the gaseous atoms dropped to the ground.
304000	307000	The temperature of the universe was still very high.
307000	311000	So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.
311000	313000	Before that, there was the so-called Dark Age.
313000	314000	Okay.
314000	319000	Basically, in the Big Bang, Inflation, and Cosmic Microwave Background.
319000	324000	During this period, I think that this part of history is a matter of physicists.
324000	327000	The theory of explosion is a matter of physicists.
327000	329000	This is a very physical thing.
329000	330000	And Big Bang.
331000	334000	From the beginning of the formation of the galaxy.
334000	336000	After the first galaxy was formed.
336000	339000	This part can be done by astronomers.
339000	341000	Astronomers can do this part.
341000	343000	I said that the temperature of the universe.
343000	345000	Because the universe is constantly expanding.
345000	347000	The temperature slowly drops.
347000	350000	And these gaseous atoms.
350000	354000	It can be further combined into gaseous atoms.
354000	356000	Okay, gaseous atoms.
356000	358000	If the temperature is cool enough.
358000	360000	After gravity collapses.
360000	362000	It will form a star.
362000	364000	Then the star will...
364000	366000	Everyone should have heard of the star.
366000	367000	Just like our sun.
367000	369000	It produces the reaction of fusion.
369000	370000	So it will shine.
370000	371000	Then it will generate energy.
371000	372000	Okay.
372000	375000	Then the star will not be produced one by one.
375000	377000	They are produced in groups.
377000	380000	That is to form the so-called galaxy.
380000	382000	The galaxy is...
382000	385000	A galaxy is basically more than a billion of stars.
385000	386000	Okay.
386000	388000	It is a system of galaxies.
388000	391000	So from this time on.
391000	393000	After the beginning of the galaxy.
393000	396000	It is to produce a lot of galaxies.
396000	399000	The universe produces more and more galaxies.
399000	400000	Okay.
400000	402000	Then we study...
402000	403000	I mean this part.
403000	404000	I am studying the so-called...
404000	407000	Galaxy formation and evolution.
407000	410000	The formation and evolution of galaxies.
410000	413000	That is very important.
413000	416000	I want to study...
416000	418000	The star formation.
418000	420000	The history of star formation.
420000	424000	That is the so-called cosmic star formation history.
424000	426000	We want to use...
426000	427000	That is to say.
427000	431000	From the first star to now.
431000	433000	The evolution of the universe.
433000	435000	You have to understand the evolution of the universe.
435000	436000	One of them.
436000	437000	You have to understand.
437000	439000	It is very important.
439000	441000	How to say.
441000	443000	One of the important factors.
443000	446000	Is the star formation.
446000	447000	Because.
447000	450000	If you look at astronomy.
450000	452000	No matter what you are studying.
452000	453000	No matter you are studying.
453000	455000	The evolution of the galaxy.
455000	456000	Galaxy formation and evolution.
456000	459000	Or you want to study.
459000	460000	The stars.
460000	462000	For example, our solar system.
462000	464000	Or study the comet.
464000	466000	The asteroid.
466000	467000	In the universe.
467000	469000	No matter what kind of weather you study.
469000	471000	It must be related to the comet.
471000	473000	Related to the stars.
473000	474000	Because you have the star.
474000	476000	After you have the star formation.
476000	477000	After you have the star formation.
477000	478000	These stars.
478000	479000	Merge together.
479000	480000	Becomes a galaxy.
480000	482000	So it is related to the galaxy.
482000	483000	Then you.
483000	485000	Comet.
485000	486000	Comet system.
486000	487000	Like our solar system.
487000	489000	After the comet is formed.
489000	490000	Then.
490000	493000	Some dust around the comet.
493000	495000	Slowly formed a comet.
495000	498000	Then the comet goes around the comet.
498000	499000	Like the comet.
499000	500000	Nebula.
500000	501000	This is also.
501000	502000	So.
502000	503000	You can say.
503000	504000	Astronomy.
504000	506000	No matter what you are studying.
506000	508000	I say astronomy.
508000	509000	If it is.
509000	510000	The physics of cosmology.
510000	511000	It doesn't count.
511000	512000	Astronomy.
512000	513000	Basically.
513000	514000	Whatever you do.
514000	515000	No matter what you do.
515000	516000	Will be related to.
516000	517000	Star formation.
517000	518000	So the history of star formation.
518000	519000	Star formation history.
519000	521000	So it is a very important.
521000	524000	If you want to understand this universe.
524000	525000	This is a very important thing.
526000	527000	OK.
527000	528000	Then.
528000	529000	I believe I have.
529000	530000	Convinced everyone.
530000	531000	Star formation history.
531000	533000	Is a very important thing.
533000	534000	But.
534000	536000	Star formation history.
536000	539000	When we do research.
539000	540000	Found.
540000	541000	This picture on the left.
541000	542000	Is the so-called.
542000	544000	I put the star formation history.
544000	545000	This thing.
545000	546000	Brighten it.
546000	547000	Then this place.
547000	549000	This axis on the left is called.
549000	551000	Star formation rate.
551000	552000	Density.
552000	554000	Star formation rate.
554000	556000	Is the star formation rate.
556000	557000	Then you can imagine.
557000	558000	Star formation rate.
558000	559000	Is every year.
559000	561000	Its unit is.
561000	562000	Ah.
562000	563000	Ah.
563000	564000	Star formation rate.
564000	565000	Divided by.
565000	566000	Time.
566000	567000	Then its unit is basically.
567000	568000	Every year.
568000	569000	Basically every year.
569000	570000	Can produce.
570000	571000	How much.
571000	572000	Solar mass.
572000	573000	This.
573000	574000	This unit is.
574000	575000	Solar mass.
575000	576000	Is solar mass.
576000	577000	So this part is called.
577000	578000	Star formation rate.
578000	580000	Then if you are in volume.
580000	581000	So it's star formation rate.
581000	583000	Then in unit volume.
583000	584000	Then this is.
584000	585000	NPC is a.
585000	586000	Ah.
586000	587000	The distance unit of astronomy.
587000	588000	Then.
588000	589000	Don't.
589000	590000	Don't care how it comes.
590000	591000	Then it is a distance unit.
591000	592000	Then three dimensions.
592000	593000	So this part is.
593000	594000	Ah.
594000	595000	The orbit is green.
595000	596000	In unit volume.
596000	598000	So it's called star formation rate.
598000	599000	Density.
599000	600000	Horizontal.
600000	602000	This is look back time.
602000	604000	So the more to the right is the longer.
604000	605000	OK.
605000	606000	Then this look back time.
606000	608000	Can be corresponded to the so-called.
608000	609000	Redshift.
609000	610000	Called redshift.
610000	611000	Ah.
611000	612000	Then this.
612000	613000	I will explain it later.
613000	614000	Because this is.
614000	616000	For people who don't study astronomy.
616000	618000	Should not know what this is.
618000	619000	OK.
619000	620000	But you can.
620000	621000	I can tell you now.
621000	622000	The more to the right is.
622000	623000	Ah.
623000	624000	The earlier.
624000	625000	The universe.
625000	626000	That.
626000	627000	Zero.
627000	628000	This place is now.
628000	629000	OK.
629000	631000	So the time travel is from the right to the left.
631000	633000	Not from the left to the right.
633000	634000	OK.
634000	635000	Then this picture is basically a.
635000	636000	Star formation.
636000	637000	History picture.
637000	639000	Then you want to.
639000	641000	Measure this picture.
641000	642000	Ah.
642000	643000	You.
643000	644000	We.
644000	645000	Ah.
645000	646000	Will find.
646000	647000	There are two.
647000	648000	There are basically.
648000	649000	There are two kinds of observations.
649000	650000	Is very important.
650000	651000	That is.
651000	652000	Ah.
652000	653000	When we used to.
653000	654000	Probably in the 90s.
654000	655000	When.
655000	656000	The end of the 90s.
656000	657000	We have some.
657000	658000	Ah.
658000	659000	Ah.
659000	660000	Ah.
660000	661000	Satellite.
661000	662000	Ah.
662000	663000	That is the space telescope.
663000	664000	We go to measure.
664000	665000	The whole universe.
665000	666000	Background radiation.
666000	667000	That.
667000	668000	There are different wavelengths.
668000	669000	Background radiation.
669000	670000	That.
670000	671000	Then I mentioned.
671000	672000	Cosmic microwave background.
672000	673000	Cosmic microwave background.
673000	674000	That is.
674000	675000	CMB.
675000	676000	Here.
676000	677000	Ah.
677000	678000	Then this.
678000	679000	Is the intensity of light.
679000	680000	Then.
680000	681000	Horizontal.
681000	682000	Is the wavelength.
682000	683000	So this is basically.
683000	684000	Light wave.
684000	685000	That.
685000	686000	CMB.
686000	687000	Probably in this place.
687000	688000	Then we will find.
688000	689000	There are two components in this universe.
689000	690000	CMB does not count.
690000	691000	There are two.
691000	692000	Very important components.
692000	693000	One is called.
693000	695000	Cosmic optical background.
695000	697000	It is visible light.
697000	698000	Background.
698000	699000	Then the other part.
699000	700000	It is called.
700000	701000	Cosmic infrared background.
701000	702000	It is the background of infrared.
702000	703000	Then we found.
703000	704000	These two.
704000	705000	Background.
705000	706000	Their amount.
706000	707000	Is almost.
707000	708000	Almost.
708000	709000	What does this tell us?
709000	710000	Because in this universe.
710000	711000	Horizontal.
711000	712000	They will emit.
712000	713000	Ah.
713000	714000	Polar light.
714000	715000	Visible light.
715000	716000	Or near infrared light.
716000	717000	That.
717000	718000	Horizontal.
718000	719000	Directly emitted light.
719000	720000	Basically.
720000	721000	This is the component.
721000	722000	Optical background.
722000	723000	OK.
723000	724000	But.
724000	725000	This.
725000	726000	Universe.
726000	727000	The.
727000	728000	Horizontal.
728000	729000	In this universe.
729000	730000	Star formation.
730000	731000	OK.
731000	732000	About half.
732000	733000	It is not.
733000	734000	We can.
734000	735000	Directly observe.
735000	736000	It is called.
736000	737000	Dusty star formation.
737000	738000	What does it mean?
738000	739000	That is.
739000	740000	When you.
740000	741000	A.
741000	742000	Area.
742000	743000	When a lot of stars are produced.
743000	744000	Then.
744000	745000	A lot of new stars.
745000	746000	Huge stars.
746000	747000	They.
747000	748000	Soon.
748000	749000	Will fall.
749000	750000	Then become.
750000	751000	The so-called supernova.
751000	752000	Supernova.
752000	753000	Then.
753000	754000	These.
754000	755000	These huge stars.
755000	756000	They produce.
756000	757000	They are.
757000	758000	A lot of heavy elements.
758000	759000	Then.
759000	760000	By the end of the year.
760000	761000	It becomes a supernova.
761000	762000	Will explode.
762000	763000	Then.
763000	764000	Will put these heavy elements.
764000	765000	That is.
765000	766000	That is.
766000	767000	Talk about this.
767000	768000	Space in the universe.
768000	769000	Then.
769000	770000	These heavy elements.
770000	771000	Some of these heavy elements.
771000	772000	For example.
772000	773000	Carbon.
773000	774000	These things.
774000	775000	They will form.
775000	776000	Star dust.
776000	777000	That is.
777000	778000	Dust.
778000	779000	That.
779000	780000	Dust particles.
780000	781000	That is.
781000	782000	Like dust.
782000	783000	Floating.
783000	784000	In space.
784000	785000	That.
785000	786000	Dust.
786000	787000	Will be.
787000	788000	Directly emit light.
788000	789000	Oh.
789000	790000	These straight.
790000	791000	Horizontal.
791000	792000	That.
792000	793000	Light is.
793000	794000	External light.
794000	795000	The visible light.
795000	796000	Near infrared.
796000	797000	Is the near infrared light.
797000	798000	These dusts.
798000	799000	Will be.
799000	800000	These.
800000	801000	Parts of the light.
801000	802000	Absorbed.
802000	803000	Then.
803000	804000	From our perspective.
804000	805000	From the observer's point of view.
805000	806000	That is to say.
806000	807000	It'll block him.
807000	808000	Block that part of the light.
808000	809000	But after it's blocked.
809000	810000	The energy is residual.
810000	811000	After it's absorbed.
811000	812000	He will.
812000	813000	Radiate again.
813000	814000	Recharge.
814000	815000	These energies.
845000	846000	About half.
846000	847000	Will be.
847000	848000	These dusts.
848000	849000	Absorbed.
849000	850000	So we call.
850000	851000	Dusty star formation.
851000	852000	Or.
852000	853000	Dust.
853000	854000	Hidden star formation.
854000	855000	Or.
855000	856000	Dust obscured star formation.
856000	857000	Anyway.
857000	858000	The point is.
858000	859000	These star formations.
859000	860000	Will be.
860000	861000	Dust.
861000	862000	To.
862000	863000	To.
863000	864000	To be.
864000	865000	Obscured by these dusts.
865000	866000	Then.
866000	867000	They absorb the energy.
867000	868000	Then emit infrared light.
868000	869000	Oh.
869000	870000	That is to say.
870000	871000	You have to understand.
871000	872000	The star formation of this universe.
872000	873000	You have to understand.
873000	874000	These two different.
874000	875000	You can directly observe.
875000	876000	The other is.
876000	877000	You can't directly observe.
877000	878000	Then.
878000	879000	These.
879000	880000	You can't directly observe.
880000	881000	You have to.
881000	882000	In a longer wavelength.
882000	883000	To observe.
883000	884000	That is.
884000	885000	Far infrared light.
885000	886000	Or.
886000	887000	Sub-millimeter.
887000	888000	Or even.
888000	889000	Millimeter.
889000	890000	Millimeter.
890000	891000	This.
891000	892000	Kilometer.
892000	893000	I just said.
893000	894000	Sub-millimeter.
894000	895000	Is.
895000	896000	Less than a kilometer.
896000	897000	Wavelength.
897000	898000	OK.
898000	899000	OK.
899000	900000	So.
900000	901000	Simply.
901000	902000	Simply.
902000	903000	Follow-on.
903000	904000	In this universe.
904000	905000	There is a large part.
905000	906000	Star formation.
906000	907000	Is.
907000	908000	Blocked by dust.
908000	909000	Then.
909000	910000	You want to understand.
910000	911000	That part.
911000	912000	Star formation.
912000	913000	You can only observe.
913000	914000	This wavelength.
914000	915000	Longer wavelength.
915000	916000	OK.
916000	917000	Then.
917000	918000	I just said.
918000	919000	I mentioned.
919000	920000	This is called.
920000	921000	Redshift.
921000	922000	This thing.
922000	923000	Then I will explain.
923000	924000	What is.
924000	925000	Redshift.
925000	926000	Then.
926000	927000	Redshift.
927000	928000	Simply speaking.
928000	929000	If you have studied physics.
929000	930000	You should know.
930000	931000	The effect of Duplo.
931000	932000	When.
932000	933000	When you.
933000	934000	This thing.
934000	935000	Uh.
935000	936000	This wave.
936000	937000	If it goes away from you.
937000	938000	When.
938000	939000	The wavelength you receive.
939000	940000	Will be stretched.
940000	941000	Or.
941000	942000	Simply speaking.
942000	943000	It's frequency.
943000	944000	Change.
944000	945000	Uh.
945000	946000	Frequency.
946000	947000	Change.
947000	948000	Uh.
948000	949000	Short.
949000	950000	Or long.
950000	951000	Frequency.
951000	952000	Change.
952000	953000	Uh.
953000	954000	Slower.
954000	955000	Then.
955000	956000	Then.
956000	957000	If something.
957000	958000	Is close to you.
958000	959000	Then.
959000	960000	Its wavelength.
960000	961000	Will.
961000	962000	Will.
962000	963000	Uh.
963000	964000	Short.
964000	965000	Or.
965000	966000	Frequency.
966000	967000	Uh.
967000	968000	Change.
968000	969000	So.
969000	970000	You hear.
970000	971000	The ambulance.
971000	972000	For example.
972000	973000	If it's close to you.
973000	974000	Its sound.
974000	975000	Will change.
975000	976000	The pitch will be higher.
976000	977000	The pitch of the ambulance.
977000	978000	Will change.
978000	979000	Uh.
979000	980000	The pitch.
980000	981000	Will be lower.
981000	982000	Okay.
982000	983000	The wave.
983000	984000	Also has this Duplo effect.
984000	985000	Okay.
985000	986000	Then.
986000	987000	When we observe.
987000	988000	The object.
988000	989000	In the universe.
989000	990000	Uh.
991000	992000	Uh.

1242140	1244140	Astronomers
1244140	1246140	use it
1246140	1248140	to do science education
1248140	1250140	and talk to the general public
1250140	1252140	Astronomers almost never use light year
1252140	1254140	This unit
1254140	1256140	Astronomers will use
1256140	1258140	Distance unit may use
1258140	1260140	Part second
1260140	1262140	But if it is
1262140	1264140	Like my research department
1264140	1266140	We will not use distance unit
1266140	1268140	We will use relationship unit
1268140	1270140	Why?
1270140	1272140	Because when you reach a large
1272140	1274140	dimension
1274140	1276140	The so-called distance
1276140	1278140	is no longer an objective fact
1278140	1280140	The so-called distance
1280140	1282140	is no longer an objective fact
1282140	1284140	For example, I am standing here
1284140	1286140	and another person is standing here
1286140	1288140	The so-called distance
1288140	1290140	We are both
1290140	1292140	in the same time and space
1292140	1294140	We measure the distance
1294140	1296140	It is an objective fact
1296140	1298140	But when you discuss the entire
1298140	1300140	universe
1300140	1302140	The size of the universe
1302140	1304140	When the distance is very far
1304140	1306140	The so-called distance
1306140	1308140	must be defined
1308140	1310140	The distance is no longer an objective fact
1310140	1312140	There are different definitions
1312140	1314140	of distance
1314140	1316140	Why define it?
1316140	1318140	Because our universe is constantly expanding
1318140	1320140	So it is a very complicated
1320140	1324140	And it involves the evolution of our universe
1324140	1326140	I don't have time to talk about it today
1326140	1328140	To put it simply
1328140	1330140	The picture on my right
1330140	1332140	The picture on my right
1332140	1334140	Is the relationship between distance and redshift
1334140	1336140	The picture on my right
1336140	1338140	Is the distance in Giga light year
1338140	1340140	Giga light year is
1340140	1342140	Giga is billions
1342140	1344140	So the light year is billions
1344140	1346140	Or
1346140	1348140	Age in Giga year
1348140	1350140	There is a lookback time
1350140	1352140	This curve is the time
1352140	1354140	When we
1354140	1356140	Redshift to the right
1356140	1358140	How long ago we saw
1358140	1360140	This is called lookback time
1360140	1362140	The other is called luminosity distance
1362140	1364140	Angular diameter distance
1364140	1366140	Line of cycle movement distance
1366140	1368140	And Naive Hubble distance
1368140	1370140	These are all distances
1370140	1372140	That is the distance under different definitions
1372140	1374140	In conclusion
1374140	1376140	I won't talk about these distances today
1376140	1378140	How they are defined
1378140	1380140	And what they can do
1380140	1382140	But in conclusion
1382140	1384140	We can directly measure the distance
1384140	1386140	Is this luminosity and angular diameter
1386140	1388140	These two distances
1388140	1390140	But I won't talk about it in detail
1390140	1392140	But I won't talk about it in detail
1392140	1394140	To put it simply
1394140	1396140	The conclusion is
1396140	1398140	It is not very convenient to use distance
1398140	1400140	Because you are talking about the distance
1400140	1402140	And these distances
1402140	1404140	The relationship between distance and redshift
1404140	1406140	Is linear
1406140	1408140	Even the angular diameter distance is strange
1408140	1410140	To
1410140	1412140	Redshift 1 or more
1412140	1414140	It is decreasing
1414140	1416140	So it is not very convenient to use distance
1416140	1418140	It is not a convenient variable
1418140	1420140	So usually when studying cosmology
1420140	1422140	Or galaxy evolution
1422140	1424140	We use redshift
1424140	1426140	As our distance
1426140	1428140	So we often say
1428140	1430140	How much redshift is your galaxy
1430140	1432140	Basically, the larger the redshift
1432140	1434140	Ok
1434140	1436140	Sorry
1436140	1438140	Can you hear me?
1438140	1440140	Yes
1440140	1442140	I have a question
1442140	1444140	You have to calculate the original wavelength
1444140	1446140	In addition to the redshift
1446140	1448140	How do you know the original wavelength?
1448140	1450140	The next step is to talk about it
1450140	1452140	Basically
1452140	1454140	Redshift is a very important variable
1454140	1456140	Redshift is a very important variable
1456140	1458140	Redshift is a very important variable
1458140	1460140	Redshift is a very important variable
1460140	1462140	Otherwise
1462140	1464140	If there is no redshift
1464140	1466140	When you do some modeling
1466140	1468140	You only have a free parameter
1468140	1470140	So we need
1470140	1472140	Do a lot of
1472140	1474140	Measurement and modeling
1474140	1476140	We hope we will know
1476140	1478140	Redshift
1478140	1480140	How to measure redshift
1480140	1482140	Basically observe the wavelength
1482140	1484140	Divide by its original wavelength
1484140	1486140	And subtract 1
1486140	1488140	I want to emphasize that
1488140	1490140	Measurement of redshift is very important
1490140	1492140	Basically it is optical
1492140	1494140	Whether you are
1494140	1496140	Studying the star or galaxy
1496140	1498140	They are all similar
1498140	1500140	You use optical
1500140	1502140	Optical theory
1502140	1504140	Optical theory is usually visible light
1504140	1506140	Or near infrared
1506140	1508140	Ok
1508140	1510140	Usually you use a large telescope
1510140	1512140	We have two modes of observation
1512140	1514140	Visible light telescope
1514140	1516140	Or near infrared
1516140	1518140	One is called imaging
1518140	1520140	Imaging
1520140	1522140	You can imagine
1522140	1524140	It is taking pictures
1524140	1526140	It is directly taking images
1526140	1528140	The other mode is called spectroscopy
1528140	1530140	The other mode is called spectroscopy
1530140	1532140	Basically it uses
1532140	1534140	The concept of light in physics
1534140	1536140	You observe a star
1536140	1538140	You observe a star
1538140	1540140	After the light passes through the telescope
1540140	1542140	After the light passes through the telescope
1542140	1544140	After the light passes through the telescope
1544140	1546140	Finally
1552140	1554140	There will be diffraction
1556140	1558140	We can measure the intensity of light
1558140	1560140	As a function of wave length
1560140	1562140	Ok
1562140	1564140	How do we measure redshift
1564140	1566140	We know
1566140	1568140	Today's sky
1568140	1570140	Whether star or galaxy
1570140	1572140	We know
1572140	1574140	What should the original spectrum look like
1574140	1576140	Redshift equals to 0
1576140	1578140	So we need to know
1578140	1580140	But this is not difficult
1580140	1582140	Because a lot of these things
1582140	1584140	There will be a lot of absorption lines
1584140	1586140	Or radiation
1586140	1588140	Absorption line
1588140	1590140	Or emission line
1590140	1592140	Hα
1592140	1594140	Oxygen
1594140	1596140	These things
1596140	1598140	Basically, after listening to the study for a long time
1598140	1600140	We must have a galaxy
1600140	1602140	There must be a model
1602140	1604140	And these
1604140	1606140	Emission line
1606140	1608140	Or absorption line
1608140	1610140	How much is it?
1610140	1612140	Because we are on earth
1612140	1614140	We can do it in the chemical lab
1614140	1616140	We can know
1616140	1618140	These absorption lines and emission lines
1618140	1620140	Their wavelength
1620140	1622140	Without redshift
1622140	1624140	How much
1624140	1626140	Let's say today
1626140	1628140	Two galaxy spectrum
1628140	1630140	We found this
1630140	1632140	We have these spectrum
1632140	1634140	We all know
1634140	1636140	How much it should be when there is no redshift
1636140	1638140	Then we can know their ratio
1638140	1640140	The ratio from here to here
1640140	1642140	Then we can measure
1642140	1644140	The redshift of this galaxy
1646140	1648140	Is there a problem here?
1648140	1650140	If not, I will continue to talk about the next part
1654140	1656140	Basically, the redshift event
1656140	1658140	It is the concept of redshift
1658140	1660140	Now back to my topic
1660140	1662140	Why do I study the sub-millimeter galaxy?
1664140	1666140	I just mentioned
1666140	1668140	Because there are two kinds of star formation in the universe
1668140	1670140	One is that we can directly observe
1670140	1672140	Visible light can be directly observed
1672140	1674140	The other half is
1674140	1676140	Will be absorbed by dust
1676140	1678140	Radiation
1678140	1680140	That part
1680140	1682140	Can only be observed
1682140	1684140	In the far infrared or sub-millimeter
1684140	1686140	Sub-millimeter
1688140	1690140	The observation of sub-millimeter
1690140	1692140	There is another point
1692140	1694140	The so-called negative k-correction
1694140	1696140	Now I will explain
1696140	1698140	What is negative k-correction
1698140	1700140	I just said
1700140	1702140	There is a redshift in our universe
1702140	1704140	So I drew a graph on the left
1706140	1708140	This graph is a very typical
1710140	1712140	Star formation galaxy
1712140	1714140	There is a galaxy
1714140	1716140	It is a very dusty galaxy
1716140	1718140	It has a lot of star dust
1718140	1720140	So the light of the star
1720140	1722140	Will be absorbed by the dust
1722140	1724140	Then put it in the far infrared
1724140	1726140	Basically this part
1728140	1730140	The smooth part
1730140	1732140	Is the far infrared light
1732140	1734140	The far infrared light emitted by dust
1734140	1736140	The left side
1738140	1740140	This is the star
1740140	1742140	And this part
1742140	1744140	What is hot
1748140	1750140	I said I put the far infrared light
1750140	1752140	This part is colder
1754140	1756140	Right part
1756140	1758140	This is radio
1758140	1760140	This is a synchrotron radiation
1764140	1766140	If he is consumed by the paralleloscope
1766140	1768140	The paralleloscope rotates
1768140	1770140	Then release
1770140	1772140	Synchrotron Radiation
1772140	1774140	I forgot the Chinese name of Synchrotron Radiation
1774140	1776140	But it releases radiation
1776140	1778140	Its light wave is here
1778140	1780140	Anyway
1780140	1782140	Then I did this thing
1782140	1784140	I put a light wave
1784140	1786140	Redshift
1786140	1788140	From 0.5 to 10
1788140	1790140	As I said just now
1790140	1792140	Redshift is what causes the wavelength to change
1792140	1794140	But it is not very far
1794140	1796140	As I said just now
1796140	1798140	It is 1 plus z
1798140	1800140	OK
1800140	1802140	So your wavelength
1802140	1804140	You observe the wavelength
1804140	1806140	The original wavelength is 1 plus z
1806140	1808140	So you can imagine
1808140	1810140	When you have a galaxy
1810140	1812140	If you can move it freely
1812140	1814140	If you want to move it further and further
1814140	1816140	What I see
1816140	1818140	The light wave will get fatter and fatter
1818140	1820140	It's not just moving
1820140	1822140	It's getting fatter and fatter
1822140	1824140	Because it is 1 plus z
1824140	1826140	There are two effects
1826140	1828140	First, when you move it further and further
1828140	1830140	Its light wave will get fatter and fatter
1830140	1832140	But the second thing is the so-called inverse square law
1832140	1834140	When you move a star
1834140	1836140	Or a galaxy
1836140	1838140	If you move it further and further
1838140	1840140	Naturally, what we observe is getting darker and darker
1840140	1842140	It's the same as the square
1842140	1844140	So you see
1844140	1846140	When you move to a higher and higher Redshift
1846140	1848140	Its overall normalization
1848140	1850140	It's getting lower and lower
1850140	1852140	Because it gets darker and darker
1852140	1854140	But the other effect is
1854140	1856140	You move it to the right more and more
1856140	1858140	Then there will be a very interesting phenomenon
1858140	1860140	Just because
1860140	1862140	The light wave formed by cold dust
1862140	1864140	It's like this curve
1864140	1866140	Then we observe
1866140	1868140	Millimeters
1868140	1870140	Or millimeters
1870140	1872140	When we observe the wavelength
1872140	1874140	We found
1874140	1876140	A dusty galaxy
1876140	1878140	When you move it further and further
1878140	1880140	We observe
1880140	1882140	We observe
1882140	1884140	The flux
1884140	1886140	Almost unchanged
1886140	1888140	Almost unchanged
1888140	1890140	Why?
1890140	1892140	Because of two effects
1892140	1894140	The first effect is
1894140	1896140	When you move it further and further
1896140	1898140	It will naturally get fatter and fatter
1898140	1900140	But the other effect is
1900140	1902140	You move the light wave to the right
1902140	1904140	So what we observe is getting closer and closer
1904140	1906140	More and more to the right
1906140	1908140	We observe
1908140	1910140	Like this galaxy
1910140	1912140	We observe
1912140	1914140	These two effects
1914140	1916140	To a certain extent, it's a little offset
1916140	1918140	So this effect is called
1918140	1920140	Because of Redshift
1920140	1922140	Cause you
1922140	1924140	Offset the effect of distance
1924140	1926140	This effect is called Negative K Correction
1926140	1928140	There is actually another
1928140	1930140	Positive K Correction
1930140	1932140	Positive K Correction is
1932140	1934140	For example, if you observe
1934140	1936140	If you observe the radio
1936140	1938140	When you move it further and further
1938140	1940140	In addition to
1940140	1942140	The further the distance
1942140	1944140	The further the distance
1944140	1946140	The further the brightness
1946140	1948140	When you move the light wave to the right
1948140	1950140	It will also make you
1950140	1952140	Make your brightness lower
1952140	1954140	So this is called Positive K Correction
1954140	1956140	Both of its effects
1956140	1958140	Cause your brightness to be lower
1958140	1960140	Negative K Correction
1960140	1962140	Redshift
1962140	1964140	The further the distance
1964140	1966140	The further the distance
1966140	1968140	The effect is opposite
1968140	1970140	It's a little bit
1970140	1972140	So it's called Negative K Correction
1972140	1974140	And then when we observe
1974140	1976140	Often in the
1976140	1978140	About one millimeter
1978140	1980140	These two effects are almost offset
1980140	1982140	So you observe
1982140	1984140	Hello, I have a question
1984140	1986140	Yes
1986140	1988140	Please ask
1988140	1990140	My question is
1990140	1992140	If you say
1992140	1994140	If you say
1994140	1996140	The emission of dust
1996140	1998140	Is because its energy is
1998140	2000140	Absorbed by dust
2000140	2002140	After that, the dust releases energy
2002140	2004140	So it's actually a bit like
2004140	2006140	Thermal Equilibrium
2006140	2008140	Blackbody Radiation
2008140	2010140	It's not a perfect blackbody
2010140	2012140	It's called Modified Blackbody
2012140	2014140	Hello
2014140	2016140	Hello, can you hear me?
2016140	2018140	It's not a perfect blackbody
2018140	2020140	It's a blackbody radiation
2020140	2022140	But
2022140	2024140	So it's basically thermal radiation
2024140	2026140	Right?
2026140	2028140	It's called Modified
2028140	2030140	But its spectrum to some extent
2030140	2032140	Corresponds to temperature, right?
2032140	2034140	Yes, that's what I just said
2034140	2036140	This is very smooth
2036140	2038140	Then I have a question
2038140	2040140	Why is the temperature of different galaxies
2040140	2042140	The same
2042140	2044140	It will be different
2044140	2046140	Why is the temperature the same?
2046140	2048140	Different
2048140	2050140	Hello
2054140	2056140	Hello
2056140	2058140	I can hear you
2058140	2060140	I can hear you
2060140	2062140	It won't be the same
2062140	2064140	I can hear you
2064140	2066140	So the temperature is different
2066140	2068140	I can hear you
2068140	2070140	This part
2070140	2072140	This part is the so-called
2072140	2074140	Thermal dust
2074140	2076140	When the temperature is different
2076140	2078140	Its shape will be slightly different
2080140	2082140	Hello
2082140	2084140	Can you hear me?
2086140	2088140	I can't hear you
2088140	2090140	OK
2090140	2092140	But you have to assume
2092140	2094140	This point will never run away
2094140	2096140	Can you hear me?
2096140	2098140	Yes
2098140	2100140	It's broken
2100140	2102140	It's broken
2102140	2104140	What?
2104140	2106140	You have to assume this point
2108140	2110140	It's broken
2110140	2112140	I
2112140	2114140	Basically
2114140	2116140	You probably want to say
2116140	2118140	If their spectrum is different
2118140	2120140	It won't be so good
2120140	2122140	But it should be
2122140	2124140	The example I am giving now is just a typical example
2124140	2126140	OK
2126140	2128140	But the typical example is like this
2128140	2130140	Then when your temperature is different
2130140	2132140	Its shape will be slightly different
2132140	2134140	But it won't be so bad
2134140	2136140	They are basically similar
2136140	2138140	But the temperature is different
2138140	2140140	The shape is slightly different
2140140	2142140	Then they all have a similar effect
2142140	2144140	I just said
2144140	2146140	It's not 100% perfect
2146140	2148140	It's just about
2148140	2150140	Does this explain your question?
2156140	2158140	Yes
2158140	2160140	It's not perfect
2160140	2162140	Thank you
2162140	2164140	The example I am giving now is just a typical example
2164140	2166140	The example I am giving now is just a typical example
2166140	2168140	But different Galaxy's spectrum will definitely be different
2168140	2170140	But they all have a similar effect
2170140	2172140	But they all have a similar effect
2172140	2174140	But it's not perfect
2174140	2176140	OK
2176140	2178140	I will continue
2178140	2180140	OK
2180140	2182140	I will draw this effect on the right
2182140	2184140	I will draw this effect on the right
2184140	2186140	This is what we observe
2186140	2188140	This Galaxy is called Redshift
2188140	2190140	This is Redshift
2190140	2192140	This is the intensity of light
2192140	2194140	Then the different color curves here
2194140	2196140	Then the different color curves here
2196140	2198140	It corresponds to different observations
2198140	2200140	It corresponds to different observations
2200140	2202140	So like here
2202140	2204140	0.8 microns
2204140	2206140	0.8 microns
2206140	2208140	0.8 microns
2208140	2210140	It's about 800 nanometers
2210140	2212140	800 nanometers is red light
2212140	2214140	OK
2214140	2216140	It's positive
2216140	2218140	OK
2218140	2220140	It's positive
2220140	2222140	OK
2222140	2224140	OK
2224140	2226140	OK
2226140	2228140	OK
2228140	2230140	OK
2230140	2232140	OK
2232140	2234140	OK
2234140	2236140	OK
2236140	2238140	OK
2238140	2240140	OK
2240140	2242140	OK
2242140	2244140	OK
2244140	2246140	OK
2246140	2248140	OK
2248140	2250140	It's positive
2250140	2252140	It's positive
2252140	2254140	OK
2254140	2256140	0.8 microns
2256140	2258140	0.8 microns
2258140	2260140	No difference
2264140	2266140	0.8 microns
2266140	2268140	0.8 microns
2268140	2270140	0.8 microns
2270140	2272140	Here is 500
2272140	2274140	500 micrometers
2274140	2276140	450 micrometers
2276140	2278140	About
2278140	2280140	About 850 and 1 mm
2280140	2282140	These wavelengths
2282140	2284140	Are near here
2284140	2286140	Almost flat
2286140	2288140	OK
2288140	2290140	So
2290140	2292140	The conclusion is
2292140	2294140	When the wavelength you observe is
2294140	2296140	Sub-millimeter or millimeter
2296140	2298140	You have a good effect
2298140	2300140	No matter how far you move
2300140	2302140	The brightness you observe
2302140	2304140	Almost unchanged
2304140	2306140	So with this effect
2306140	2308140	You can use it to detect
2308140	2310140	Detect
2310140	2312140	Very high redshift galaxy
2312140	2314140	Very far galaxy
2314140	2316140	Very early galaxy in the universe
2316140	2318140	If you use a more traditional
2318140	2320140	Visible wavelength
2320140	2322140	You will find that its brightness drops very quickly
2322140	2324140	So of course, your distant galaxy is very dark
2324140	2326140	It's not easy to observe
2326140	2328140	If you use radio
2328140	2330140	Radio is wireless radio
2330140	2332140	If you use wireless radio to observe
2332140	2334140	You will still see this picture
2334140	2336140	It also drops very quickly
2336140	2338140	So it's the same for distant galaxies
2338140	2340140	It's very hard to observe
2340140	2342140	If you want to observe
2342140	2344140	You have to do a long exposure
2344140	2346140	Observation is very deep
2346140	2348140	The deeper you are, the farther you can observe
2348140	2350140	But sub-millimeter or millimeter
2350140	2352140	This is almost flat
2352140	2354140	So you can use this technique
2354140	2356140	To detect
2356140	2358140	Compared to visible light or radio
2358140	2360140	It's much easier
2360140	2362140	Much easier
2362140	2364140	To observe these distant galaxies
2364140	2366140	This is why sub-millimeter is very important
2370140	2372140	I'm going to talk about
2372140	2374140	Now the point is
2374140	2376140	What I'm studying is called sub-millimeter galaxies
2376140	2378140	In the 1990s
2380140	2382140	Kearny used
2382140	2384140	Sub-millimeter
2384140	2386140	Telescope
2386140	2388140	It's a telescope
2388140	2390140	Called JCMD
2390140	2392140	I will have a photo later
2392140	2394140	To shoot a famous field in the sky
2394140	2396140	Called Hubble Deep Field
2396140	2398140	Because this field
2398140	2400140	They used Hubble telescope
2400140	2402140	To shoot a very deep image
2402140	2404140	This is the image taken by Hubble telescope
2404140	2406140	Visible light image
2406140	2408140	Then they used JCMD
2408140	2410140	To shoot the same area
2410140	2412140	This
2412140	2414140	The image on the right
2414140	2416140	Is a sub-millimeter image
2416140	2418140	With JCMD
2418140	2420140	There is a bright spot here
2420140	2422140	There may be a bright spot here
2422140	2424140	This is a
2424140	2426140	Sub-millimeter source
2428140	2430140	Before JCMD
2430140	2432140	We only use some
2432140	2434140	Space telescope to measure the background
2434140	2436140	We can measure
2436140	2438140	Sub-millimeter
2438140	2440140	But we don't
2440140	2442140	Understand
2442140	2444140	What source is this background
2444140	2446140	From
2446140	2448140	With JCMD
2448140	2450140	Resolve the background
2450140	2452140	Into individual sources
2452140	2454140	We can see the individual sub-millimeter
2454140	2456140	I just talked about
2456140	2458140	Sub-millimeter galaxies
2458140	2460140	Sub-millimeter galaxies are basically dusty
2460140	2462140	They are very
2462140	2464140	Intense
2464140	2466140	Star formation
2466140	2468140	Very intense
2468140	2470140	Very intense
2470140	2472140	Very intense
2472140	2474140	Starburst gas
2474140	2476140	Why is the sub-millimeter
2476140	2478140	Very bright
2478140	2480140	Originally
2480140	2482140	If it is red
2482140	2484140	If we have a dusty galaxy
2484140	2486140	Its peak
2486140	2488140	About
2488140	2490140	Its wavelength
2490140	2492140	About 100 micrometer
2492140	2494140	But when you move to
2494140	2496140	When redshift is above 1
2496140	2498140	When the distance of your galaxy
2498140	2500140	Is above redshift 1
2500140	2502140	Its peak may move to
2502140	2504140	About millimeter
2504140	2506140	Or sub-millimeter
2506140	2508140	Why is it
2508140	2510140	Very bright
2510140	2512140	Its original wavelength
2512140	2514140	Is about 100 micrometer
2514140	2516140	100 micrometer is
2516140	2518140	In astronomy
2518140	2520140	This wavelength is called distant infrared
2520140	2522140	Distant infrared
2522140	2524140	Because it is
2524140	2526140	Above redshift 1
2526140	2528140	When we observe it
2528140	2530140	The wavelength we observe
2530140	2532140	Is below
2532140	2534140	Sub-millimeter and millimeter
2534140	2536140	Wavelength
2536140	2538140	Ok
2538140	2540140	This sub-millimeter galaxy
2540140	2542140	Is a very dusty starburst galaxy
2542140	2544140	It is usually difficult
2544140	2546140	It is written here
2546140	2548140	It is difficult to observe in visible wavelengths
2548140	2550140	Or so-called rest frame UV
2550140	2552140	These visible wavelengths
2552140	2554140	For these distant information
2554140	2556140	When it is emitted
2556140	2558140	When it is emitted
2558140	2560140	When the light is emitted
2560140	2562140	It is a rest frame UV
2562140	2564140	When we observe
2564140	2566140	It is redshift visible
2566140	2568140	So we observe it as visible light
2568140	2570140	But when it is emitted
2570140	2572140	It is actually UV
2572140	2574140	These sub-millimeter galaxies
2574140	2576140	Because it is very dusty
2576140	2578140	Basically their UV
2578140	2580140	Often absorbed by dust
2580140	2582140	So in visible wavelengths
2582140	2584140	You often can't see them
2584140	2586140	Can't observe them
2586140	2588140	When it is sub-millimeter wavelength
2588140	2590140	You will find
2590140	2592140	A very bright source
2592140	2594140	Ok
2594140	2596140	I will continue
2596140	2598140	How to observe these
2598140	2600140	Sub-millimeter galaxies
2600140	2602140	As I said
2602140	2604140	In the 90s, they used JCMP
2604140	2606140	To find these sub-millimeter galaxies
2606140	2608140	This kind of telescope is called single-dash
2608140	2610140	It only has one antenna
2610140	2612140	Telescope
2612140	2614140	Ok
2614140	2616140	Basically using this kind of single-dash
2616140	2618140	To scan our sky
2618140	2620140	Is the most effective way to find these sub-millimeter galaxies
2620140	2622140	I will introduce later
2622140	2624140	Another technique
2624140	2626140	Interferometry
2626140	2628140	Interferometry
2628140	2630140	I will talk about it later
2630140	2632140	This kind of single-dash
2632140	2634140	I will talk about the conclusion first
2634140	2636140	The conclusion is
2636140	2638140	It is the most effective way
2638140	2640140	To scan the sky
2640140	2642140	To find these sources
2642140	2644140	It has a problem
2644140	2646140	Its resolution is very low
2646140	2648140	Why?
2648140	2650140	Basically
2650140	2652140	The image we took
2652140	2654140	The image we took
2654140	2656140	The image we took
2656140	2658140	Is proportional to the wavelength
2658140	2660140	And is proportional to the size of the telescope
2660140	2662140	This is basically
2662140	2664140	It comes from physical light
2664140	2666140	It comes from light
2666140	2668140	If you have studied light
2668140	2670140	You should be familiar with this
2670140	2672140	So today we observe
2672140	2674140	Sub-millimeter or far-infrared
2674140	2676140	Or radio
2676140	2678140	These are relatively long wavelengths
2678140	2680140	On the contrary, if you observe visible light
2680140	2682140	Or UV
2682140	2684140	Those are relatively short wavelengths
2684140	2686140	These long wavelengths
2686140	2688140	This lambda is very large
2688140	2690140	So the image resolution
2690140	2692140	Will be worse
2692140	2694140	If you want to make your image resolution
2694140	2696140	A little better
2696140	2698140	You have to build a bigger telescope
2698140	2700140	Let your diameter
2700140	2702140	Build a bigger telescope
2702140	2704140	I will talk about this later
2704140	2706140	Talk more
2706140	2708140	This kind of single-dash telescope
2708140	2710140	Because the wavelength is long
2710140	2712140	So its resolution is very low
2712140	2714140	So it has two problems
2714140	2716140	The first is that if the resolution is very low
2716140	2718140	You observe a source
2718140	2720140	Then when you want to go to other wavelengths
2720140	2722140	To find it in other wavelengths
2722140	2724140	The corresponding point
2724140	2726140	Is the counterpart
2726140	2728140	You don't know where it is
2728140	2730140	Because its resolution is too bad
2730140	2732140	So you have to
2732140	2734140	You don't know where its precise position is
2734140	2736140	If you want to know its precise position
2736140	2738140	You need to use interference
2738140	2740140	Do further observation
2740140	2742140	OK, my next slide
2742140	2744140	Will talk about what interference is
2744140	2746140	Like this picture
2746140	2748140	This is the result
2748140	2750140	The source observed by JCMP
2750140	2752140	Maybe it's a big one
2752140	2754140	Sorry, I don't have a picture here
2754140	2756140	A big one
2756140	2758140	You can't get it
2758140	2760140	Where is the precise position
2760140	2762140	But after the observation of the interference
2762140	2764140	You can get it
2764140	2766140	A higher resolution image
2766140	2768140	Then you can accurately measure its position
2768140	2770140	After measuring its position
2770140	2772140	You go to other wavelengths
2772140	2774140	For example, this is the image of Hubble telescope
2774140	2776140	Then you go to other wavelengths
2776140	2778140	To find its corresponding counterpart
2778140	2780140	Or not
2780140	2782140	This is the first problem
2782140	2784140	Its resolution is too bad
2784140	2786140	So you have to use interference
2786140	2788140	The second problem is called confusion limit
2788140	2790140	Basically, it is also caused by low resolution
2790140	2792140	Because your resolution is bad
2792140	2794140	When your resolution is bad
2794140	2796140	In our universe
2796140	2798140	Whether you are exploring the stars
2798140	2800140	Or stars
2800140	2802140	In this universe
2802140	2804140	Dark things
2804140	2806140	More than bright things
2806140	2808140	There may be a power law
2808140	2810140	Here
2810140	2812140	Then when you
2812140	2814140	There are more dark things
2814140	2816140	It means that these darker subliminal galaxies
2816140	2818140	The density
2818140	2820140	The density in the sky
2820140	2822140	Is greater than those brighter subliminal galaxies
2822140	2824140	Is greater than those brighter subliminal galaxies
2824140	2826140	The meaning of confusion limit
2826140	2828140	When you observe
2828140	2830140	When the resolution is very low
2830140	2832140	Then when you
2832140	2834140	If there are a lot of
2834140	2836140	Darker subliminal galaxies
2836140	2838140	Because they are a lot
2838140	2840140	Because they are a lot
2840140	2842140	Then they will all come together
2842140	2844140	Then they will all come together
2844140	2846140	Come together and become one
2846140	2848140	In other words, you observe one
2848140	2850140	A very bright source
2850140	2852140	In fact, it may be a lot of dark
2852140	2854140	Darker subliminal galaxies
2854140	2856140	Darker subliminal galaxies
2856140	2858140	Because your resolution is too bad
2858140	2860140	So you see a lot
2860140	2862140	So this will cause something called
2862140	2864140	Confusion limit
2864140	2866140	Because the resolution of your telescope is bad
2866140	2868140	So you can't observe
2868140	2870140	You will have a limit
2870140	2872140	A star that is darker than this limit
2872140	2874140	You can't directly observe
2874140	2876140	Because the stars that are darker than this limit
2876140	2878140	They are a lot
2878140	2880140	Because of your low resolution
2880140	2882140	All blend together
2882140	2884140	OK
2884140	2886140	So this limit will cause
2886140	2888140	Observe a subliminal galaxy
2888140	2890140	It has a limit
2890140	2892140	Its brightness is like this
2892140	2894140	Too many Jansky at 850 microns
2894140	2896140	I won't explain today
2896140	2898140	What unit is this mini Jansky
2898140	2900140	Anyway, it is a unit of brightness
2900140	2902140	OK
2902140	2904140	This brightness can be converted to
2904140	2906140	Its absolute brightness
2906140	2908140	Called luminosity
2908140	2910140	About 10 to 12 squares
2910140	2912140	Solar luminosity
2912140	2914140	Solar luminosity is the brightness of the sun
2914140	2916140	So this limit
2916140	2918140	It corresponds to 10 to 12 squares
2918140	2920140	The brightness of the sun
2920140	2922140	This kind of star is called
2922140	2924140	Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy
2924140	2926140	It is very very bright
2926140	2928140	Dusty Galaxy
2928140	2930140	In other words, we use JCMP
2930140	2932140	Or use this kind of single dish
2932140	2934140	The source we can detect
2934140	2936140	It is very very very bright
2936140	2938140	Then we can't detect
2938140	2940140	Darker
2940140	2942140	This is its problem
2942140	2944140	OK, I will explain later
2944140	2946140	My thesis
2946140	2948140	How to solve this problem
2948140	2950140	Now I will explain the interference cloud
2952140	2954140	What is the interference cloud
2954140	2956140	I just said
2956140	2958140	Resolution you observe
2958140	2960140	It is proportional to wavelength
2960140	2962140	Resolution of the telescope
2962140	2964140	So you want
2964140	2966140	Resolution is very bad
2966140	2968140	If we want to improve our resolution
2968140	2970140	Then we build a bigger telescope
2970140	2972140	Let D
2976140	2978140	But this is the problem
2978140	2980140	You have to build a very big telescope
2980140	2982140	Or a very big antenna
2982140	2984140	Because we are a long-wave field
2984140	2986140	In fact, our telescope is the so-called antenna
2986140	2988140	Just like this
2988140	2990140	I think I just drew it
2990140	2992140	It is an antenna
2992140	2994140	Then we have to build a very big
2994140	2996140	Gigantic antenna
2996140	2998140	It is very very expensive
2998140	3000140	So this thing
3000140	3002140	It is not economic
3002140	3004140	So how to solve it
3004140	3006140	It is the so-called interference cloud
3006140	3008140	Interference cloud means
3008140	3010140	We don't build a super big antenna
3010140	3012140	We build a lot of small antennas
3012140	3014140	Like the picture of my background
3014140	3016140	We build multiple small antennas
3016140	3018140	Then
3018140	3020140	We accept the signal
3020140	3022140	Make a cross correlation
3022140	3024140	This technology is called
3024140	3026140	Interference cloud
3026140	3028140	Then
3028140	3030140	It is a bit like
3030140	3032140	When you put a lot of small antennas
3032140	3034140	Then spread it
3034140	3036140	Spread it on the ground
3036140	3038140	It is a bit like
3038140	3040140	You have a big telescope
3040140	3042140	But not so perfect
3042140	3044140	It has a lot
3044140	3046140	When you deal with images
3046140	3048140	It has a lot of complicated details
3048140	3050140	I won't talk about these
3050140	3052140	But basically what you can do is
3052140	3054140	When you spread a lot of small antennas
3054140	3056140	The resolution can be similar to
3056140	3058140	A big telescope
3058140	3060140	It is equivalent to increasing the low
3060140	3062140	So you can get a
3062140	3064140	Higher resolution image
3064140	3066140	So I gave an example here
3066140	3068140	Then this side
3068140	3070140	This picture is
3070140	3072140	I used JCMP
3072140	3074140	I took a picture
3074140	3076140	A very wide image
3076140	3078140	Then there is a bright spot inside
3078140	3080140	Is a
3080140	3082140	Submarine source
3082140	3084140	Zoom in
3084140	3086140	Then
3086140	3088140	Why is it called SCUBA-2?
3088140	3090140	Because we use JCMP
3090140	3092140	Observe the camera
3092140	3094140	Of the submarine galaxy
3094140	3096140	That camera
3096140	3098140	Is called SCUBA-2
3098140	3100140	Then we observe
3100140	3102140	Then we need to use interference cloud
3102140	3104140	The background pattern
3104140	3106140	This interference cloud is very famous
3106140	3108140	ELMA telescope
3108140	3110140	ELMA is built in Chile
3110140	3112140	It is the most powerful
3112140	3114140	Interference cloud in the world
3114140	3116140	Then it observes the submarine
3116140	3118140	Then you use ELMA
3118140	3120140	Observe this sky
3120140	3122140	In fact, this example is just right
3122140	3124140	This is not
3124140	3126140	Like this picture is
3126140	3128140	Observed by my group
3128140	3130140	But ELMA is observed by other groups
3130140	3132140	Then they just observe this area
3132140	3134140	Then this red dot is equivalent to
3134140	3136140	It corresponds to the same
3136140	3138140	SCUBA-2 image
3138140	3140140	This is the center of the source
3140140	3142140	Then we have ELMA observation
3142140	3144140	We get a much higher resolution image
3144140	3146140	Just found this one
3146140	3148140	In fact, it is three
3148140	3150140	Submarine galaxies
3150140	3152140	Then because our resolution is very poor
3152140	3154140	Put them together
3154140	3156140	OK
3156140	3158140	OK
3158140	3160140	Someone may ask you
3160140	3162140	Why don't you use interference cloud
3162140	3164140	Just observe
3164140	3166140	Right
3166140	3168140	Why use
3168140	3170140	I just said
3170140	3172140	SCUBA-2
3172140	3174140	The reason is
3174140	3176140	There are two
3176140	3178140	Interference cloud observation
3178140	3180140	Compared to
3180140	3182140	SCUBA-2
3182140	3184140	Their observation is
3184140	3186140	Observationally a lot more expensive
3186140	3188140	The cost is higher
3188140	3190140	OK
3190140	3192140	Then the field of view is different
3192140	3194140	The field of view is
3194140	3196140	It can be
3196140	3198140	Includes
3198140	3200140	The size of the area is different
3200140	3202140	I use SCUBA-2 today
3202140	3204140	I use JCMP's SCUBA-2 camera
3204140	3206140	I can observe
3206140	3208140	I can observe such a large area at a time
3208140	3210140	OK
3210140	3212140	But if I use interference cloud
3212140	3214140	Interference cloud
3214140	3216140	Not for this thing
3216140	3218140	Interference cloud is suitable for
3218140	3220140	Observe individual sources
3220140	3222140	Then it can only observe a small area at a time
3222140	3224140	That is to say
3224140	3226140	SCUBA-2 and interference cloud
3226140	3228140	These two things
3228140	3230140	Their purpose is different
3230140	3232140	So why do I say
3232140	3234140	SCUBA-2 is the most efficient way
3234140	3236140	Because SCUBA-2
3236140	3238140	Although the resolution is poor
3238140	3240140	But it is
3240140	3242140	It can have a relatively large
3242140	3244140	Observation area
3244140	3246140	So it can be effective
3246140	3248140	To scan the entire sky
3248140	3250140	Scan a large area
3250140	3252140	OK
3252140	3254140	So it is still the most effective
3254140	3256140	To scan a large area
3256140	3258140	Then find the source
3258140	3260140	Then when we find these individual sources
3260140	3262140	We use interference cloud
3262140	3264140	To separate
3264140	3266140	We use interference cloud
3266140	3268140	To follow up
3268140	3270140	Then get it
3270140	3272140	Higher resolution
3272140	3274140	This is the effective way of observation
3274140	3276140	So basically the two of them
3276140	3278140	The purpose is not the same
3278140	3280140	Because it can only scan a small area at a time
3280140	3282140	So if you want to scan a large area
3282140	3284140	You have to observe
3284140	3286140	Observe here, observe there
3286140	3288140	Do a lot
3288140	3290140	To the sky
3290140	3292140	To a lot of different areas
3292140	3294140	Then there is a way to put it together
3294140	3296140	Such a large area
3296140	3298140	This is very inefficient
3298140	3300140	OK
3300140	3302140	Speaking of this
3302140	3304140	Do you have any questions
3304140	3306140	I have a question
3306140	3308140	You just said
3308140	3310140	Interference cloud basically uses a lot of
3310140	3312140	Small
3312140	3314140	What is it called in Chinese?
3314140	3316140	antenna
3316140	3318140	antenna
3318140	3320140	These antennas must be
3320140	3322140	Gathered at the same point
3322140	3324140	Or distributed well
3324140	3326140	Even a few hundred miles
3326140	3328140	Can also be distributed well
3328140	3330140	Like my picture
3330140	3332140	Usually interference cloud
3332140	3334140	It has different configurations
3334140	3336140	Will follow you
3336140	3338140	The purpose observed by astronomers
3338140	3340140	To adjust its configuration
3340140	3342140	Usually you want to hear
3342140	3344140	What is the so-called extended configuration
3344140	3346140	Compact configuration
3346140	3348140	Subcompact
3348140	3350140	That means they have
3350140	3352140	Spread it widely
3352140	3354140	So it can be moved
3354140	3356140	Yes, it can be moved
3356140	3358140	Basically, the wider you spread
3358140	3360140	Your resolution will be better
3360140	3362140	Because the wider you spread
3362140	3364140	Effectively
3366140	3368140	The farther they are
3368140	3370140	It's like you build a very large network
3370140	3372140	Let you have low increase
3372140	3374140	The wider you spread
3374140	3376140	Your resolution is higher
3376140	3378140	It is possible
3378140	3380140	Different countries
3380140	3382140	Antennas can also be formed
3382140	3384140	Such a set
3384140	3386140	Because this has been done for a long time
3386140	3388140	This has been done for a long time
3388140	3390140	Is
3390140	3392140	Different wavelengths
3392140	3394140	Like this
3394140	3396140	A long time ago
3396140	3398140	VLBI
3398140	3400140	Very Large Baseline Intergalactic
3400140	3402140	It
3402140	3404140	But its wavelength is not
3404140	3406140	The wavelength we are discussing today
3406140	3408140	I believe that
3408140	3410140	If I remember correctly, it should be longer
3410140	3412140	That VLBI
3412140	3414140	It's all over the world
3414140	3416140	The antenna
3416140	3418140	I remember the United States
3418140	3420140	There is one in Arizona
3420140	3422140	There is one in Hawaii
3422140	3424140	A little more east
3424140	3426140	I forgot
3426140	3428140	Then it's all over the world
3428140	3430140	So its baseline
3430140	3432140	So the baseline
3432140	3434140	I forgot to say
3434140	3436140	Interferometry will talk about the name of the baseline
3436140	3438140	Baseline is basically the distance between the antenna and the antenna
3438140	3440140	The VLBI I just said
3440140	3442140	Its baseline is very long
3442140	3444140	Because it is equivalent to
3444140	3446140	The size of the whole earth
3446140	3448140	Baseline
3448140	3450140	So it can do very high resolution
3450140	3452140	A kind of observation
3454140	3456140	Thank you
3460140	3462140	So I just said
3462140	3464140	Our single dish
3464140	3466140	There are two questions
3466140	3468140	The first one is that my resolution is very poor
3468140	3470140	So I'm going to use interferometry
3470140	3472140	To do more follow-up observations
3472140	3474140	The other question is that I just said
3474140	3476140	There will also be a detection limit
3478140	3480140	How do I solve this?
3480140	3482140	This is what my thesis is doing
3482140	3484140	How do I solve this problem?
3484140	3486140	Is to use so-called gravity
3486140	3488140	OK
3488140	3490140	I don't know how many of these listeners are studying physics
3490140	3492140	If you are not studying physics
3492140	3494140	You may have heard of it for the first time
3494140	3496140	The so-called gravity is Einstein's relativity
3496140	3498140	That is to say
3498140	3500140	If there is gravity, it will cause time-space distortion
3500140	3502140	Time-space distortion
3502140	3504140	Time-space distortion will cause
3504140	3506140	When the light passes through a gravitational field
3506140	3508140	It will turn
3508140	3510140	So it's like a透鏡
3510140	3512140	Like a 突透鏡
3512140	3514140	Have you ever played 突透鏡 when you were a kid?
3514140	3516140	突透鏡 can gather light
3516140	3518140	You can gather the light of the sun
3518140	3520140	And then you can burn a paper on the ground
3520140	3522140	So 突透鏡 has the effect of gathering light
3522140	3524140	Or you can say
3524140	3526140	It can make something darker
3526140	3528140	After passing through your 突透鏡
3528140	3530140	It looks brighter
3530140	3532140	So
3532140	3534140	Gravity can have this effect
3534140	3536140	Because it can gather light
3536140	3538140	So we often use gravity in astronomy
3538140	3540140	To study very distant stars
3540140	3542140	Very distant stars
3542140	3544140	When you
3544140	3546140	Suppose we observe a very distant galaxy here
3546140	3548140	We are here
3548140	3550140	But then just assume we are here
3552140	3554140	There is a galaxy cluster in the middle of the light path
3554140	3556140	Galaxy cluster
3556140	3558140	Galaxy cluster is a lot of galaxies
3558140	3560140	They are clustered together
3560140	3562140	Galaxy cluster is
3562140	3564140	In this universe
3564140	3566140	It is the
3566140	3568140	The largest
3568140	3570140	Bound system
3570140	3572140	Gravitationally bound system
3572140	3574140	The quality of the galaxy
3574140	3576140	Usually 10 to 14
3576140	3578140	15
3578140	3580140	Because its quality is very, very large
3580140	3582140	So the galaxy must have
3582140	3584140	Very strong gravity
3584140	3586140	So they
3586140	3588140	Can be used as a 突透鏡
3588140	3590140	So these backgrounds
3590140	3592140	These distant galaxies will be
3592140	3594140	The galaxy cluster
3594140	3596140	After having this focus
3596140	3598140	It will become brighter
3598140	3600140	So
3600140	3602140	Astronomers often use this technique
3602140	3604140	To observe very distant stars
3604140	3606140	Because very distant stars
3606140	3608140	Of course they will be darker
3608140	3610140	Because it's too far
3610140	3612140	But with the help of gravity
3612140	3614140	We can observe a brighter brightness
3614140	3616140	So it helps us
3616140	3618140	To study the early universe
3618140	3620140	OK
3620140	3622140	Hubble telescope
3622140	3624140	In the past few years
3624140	3626140	There was a program called FrontierField
3626140	3628140	FrontierField program
3628140	3630140	It picked
3630140	3632140	Six very bright galaxies
3632140	3634140	These six
3634140	3636140	Then
3636140	3638140	The Hubble telescope took pictures of these six galaxies
3638140	3640140	Very, very deep image
3640140	3642140	So there will be
3642140	3644140	A very beautiful visible image
3644140	3646140	So
3646140	3648140	The purpose of this FrontierField program
3648140	3650140	Is
3650140	3652140	To study very distant stars
3652140	3654140	It uses
3654140	3656140	The galaxy cluster as a focus
3656140	3658140	To study distant stars
3658140	3660140	So
3660140	3662140	In this picture
3662140	3664140	Let me show you
3664140	3666140	Like this
3666140	3668140	It's the galaxy cluster
3668140	3670140	The focus of the galaxy
3670140	3672140	But
3672140	3674140	There is a line here
3674140	3676140	These are all
3676140	3678140	After gravity
3678140	3680140	Distance star
3680140	3682140	In English, it's Lensed
3682140	3684140	They have been gravitated
3684140	3686140	Lensed
3686140	3688140	Distant star
3688140	3690140	If you are a physicist
3690140	3692140	You may have heard of Einstein ring
3692140	3694140	These are the so-called Einstein ring
3694140	3696140	Because it's a distant star
3696140	3698140	Then
3698140	3700140	After it's gravitated
3700140	3702140	We see it
3702140	3704140	Then we will see
3704140	3706140	A ring
3706140	3708140	The same
3708140	3710140	The shape
3710140	3712140	It's because it's a very distant star
3712140	3714140	After gravity
3714140	3716140	Okay
3716140	3718140	This is Hubble
3718140	3720140	FrontierField program
3720140	3722140	But what am I observing today?
3722140	3724140	I'm the girl up there
3724140	3726140	I'm the same
3726140	3728140	Because of this Hubble
3728140	3730140	This program
3730140	3732140	So my thesis is
3732140	3734140	I used my JCMP telescope
3734140	3736140	JCMP telescope has a scuba tube camera
3736140	3738140	Then I also went to shoot
3738140	3740140	A lot of galaxies
3740140	3742140	We shot a total of nine galaxies
3742140	3744140	Then include five FrontierField
3744140	3746140	That is
3746140	3748140	These five
3748140	3750140	Except for this
3750140	3752140	These five we shot
3752140	3754140	Why don't we shoot this?
3754140	3756140	Because of its coordinate
3756140	3758140	This galaxy is too difficult to make
3758140	3760140	It's too difficult to make in the sky
3760140	3762140	But our JCMP
3762140	3764140	It's in Hawaii and it's in the North Pole
3764140	3766140	So it can't shoot this
3766140	3768140	So we only shoot these five
3768140	3770140	So I said including five FrontierField
3770140	3772140	So
3772140	3774140	We use the effect of gravity
3776140	3778140	So we use the effect of gravity
3778140	3780140	We do sub-millimeter observation
3780140	3782140	So I just said this question
3782140	3784140	TooManyGenski
3784140	3786140	This limit problem can be solved
3786140	3788140	Why? Because if we have the effect of gravity
3788140	3790140	We observed
3790140	3792140	The limit of the observation brightness
3792140	3794140	It's still TooManyGenski
3794140	3796140	But these
3796140	3798140	TooManyGenski
3798140	3800140	It was actually darker
3800140	3802140	It is today
3802140	3804140	After the effect of gravity
3804140	3806140	After the effect of gravity
3806140	3808140	But in fact we see
3808140	3810140	Better than this limit
3810140	3812140	Darker than this limit
3812140	3814140	Sub-millimeter Galaxy
3814140	3816140	That is to say, we use the effect of gravity
3816140	3818140	We can observe
3818140	3820140	Darker than the brightness of 10
3820140	3822140	These Galaxy
3822140	3824140	OK
3824140	3826140	Then there is
3826140	3828140	Today we use sub-millimeter
3828140	3830140	Observe these
3830140	3832140	There is another benefit
3832140	3834140	That is
3834140	3836140	If you observe today
3836140	3838140	It's a visible wave segment
3838140	3840140	Like this
3840140	3842140	In this image
3842140	3844140	Galaxy cluster
3844140	3846140	And those background information
3846140	3848140	Like these one by one
3848140	3850140	So you have to find a way to distinguish them
3850140	3852140	If you want to study
3852140	3854140	High-resolution Galaxy
3854140	3856140	But if you observe
3856140	3858140	Sub-millimeter
3858140	3860140	There will be no problem
3860140	3862140	If you observe sub-millimeter
3862140	3864140	These gravity sensors are basically transparent
3864140	3866140	Why?
3866140	3868140	Galaxy cluster
3868140	3870140	Most of them are elliptical Galaxy
3872140	3874140	These elliptical Galaxy are very old
3874140	3876140	Very old Galaxy
3876140	3878140	They don't have star formation
3878140	3880140	No star formation
3880140	3882140	And they don't have dust
3882140	3884140	So these elliptical Galaxy
3884140	3886140	They basically don't emit
3886140	3888140	Far infrared light
3888140	3890140	They basically don't emit
3890140	3892140	Far infrared emission
3892140	3894140	They don't have dust emission
3894140	3896140	In addition, these stars
3896140	3898140	Their redshift is about 0.5
3898140	3900140	0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6
3900140	3902140	So even if they have
3902140	3904140	Far infrared emission
3904140	3906140	They won't go to sub-millimeter
3906140	3908140	So the conclusion is
3908140	3910140	The conclusion is
3910140	3912140	These Galaxy clusters
3912140	3914140	They don't emit sub-millimeter
3914140	3916140	So when you are shooting this star
3916140	3918140	Then you use sub-millimeter
3918140	3920140	To observe
3920140	3922140	You see any
3922140	3924140	You see any of these sources
3924140	3926140	They are basically background
3926140	3928140	They are all emitted from a very distant universe
3928140	3930140	Not the star itself
3930140	3932140	Because I just said
3932140	3934140	The elliptical Galaxy in the star
3934140	3936140	They don't emit far infrared emission
3936140	3938140	So this is a very neat thing
3938140	3940140	You don't have to
3940140	3942140	Not like you are in visible light
3942140	3944140	You still have to distinguish
3944140	3946140	The background and the cluster itself
3946140	3948140	So these two pictures
3948140	3950140	Basically my
3950140	3952140	This is how it looks
3952140	3954140	And then
3954140	3956140	This blue and red area
3956140	3958140	It's basically the Hubble telescope
3958140	3960140	The area that has been observed
3960140	3962140	OK
3962140	3964140	So why do we
3964140	3966140	We have to observe these redshift stars
3966140	3968140	Because the Hubble telescope
3968140	3970140	Get these areas of very deep visible light
3970140	3972140	Then we also use sub-millimeter to shoot
3972140	3974140	We can find these
3974140	3976140	Sub-millimeter sources
3976140	3978140	And then we need to
3978140	3980140	We can also go to the Hubble telescope
3980140	3982140	To find the counterpart
3982140	3984140	It's in visible light
3984140	3986140	Right
3986140	3988140	It's not just the Hubble telescope
3988140	3990140	It also has other telescopes
3990140	3992140	That is to say
3992140	3994140	These areas are very rich
3994140	3996140	Very rich
3996140	3998140	Observations
3998140	4000140	What we do today
4000140	4002140	We are also in the area
4002140	4004140	We use
4004140	4006140	Sub-millimeter
4006140	4008140	Then the picture I showed today
4008140	4010140	The left is 450 micrometers
4010140	4012140	The right is 850 micrometers
4012140	4014140	Then we mainly use 850
4014140	4016140	Then today
4016140	4018140	The yellow circle
4018140	4020140	The circle
4020140	4022140	It's one by one
4022140	4024140	Sub-millimeter sources
4024140	4026140	Then this cluster
4026140	4028140	It's Abell 370
4028140	4030140	That's the one I just
4030140	4032140	One of the Hubble
4032140	4034140	Ok
4034140	4036140	Then
4036140	4038140	With this image
4038140	4040140	We can detect a lot of darker
4040140	4042140	Sub-millimeter galaxies
4042140	4044140	Because I said that they were observed by us
4044140	4046140	So they are actually
4046140	4048140	Lower than our original
4048140	4050140	Sub-millimeter observation
4050140	4052140	Then we have to study these darker
4052140	4054140	Sub-millimeter galaxies
4054140	4056140	What to do
4058140	4060140	Here is the explanation
4060140	4062140	The picture on the right
4062140	4064140	It's called
4064140	4066140	Sub-millimeter number count
4068140	4070140	The horizontal axis is 850 micrometers
4072140	4074140	The vertical axis is basically
4074140	4076140	Number density
4076140	4078140	That is
4078140	4080140	The number of sub-millimeter galaxies
4080140	4082140	The number of unit areas
4082140	4084140	Then divided by
4084140	4086140	Unit brightness
4086140	4088140	So its unit is like this
4088140	4090140	Because it is the number divided by
4090140	4092140	Area divided by
4092140	4094140	Flux
4094140	4096140	But basically it is
4096140	4098140	Number density per area per
4098140	4100140	Flux
4100140	4102140	If you measure it out, it's like this
4104140	4106140	Then
4106140	4108140	Usually we use this model
4110140	4112140	This is called Broken Power Law
4112140	4114140	Here is a Power Law
4114140	4116140	Here is another Power Law
4116140	4118140	Then today this red line
4118140	4120140	Is the Confusion Limit I just said
4120140	4122140	If I use JCMP to observe today
4122140	4124140	Our limit is this
4124140	4126140	Is this red line
4126140	4128140	OK, so if we observe
4128140	4130140	General sky area like this
4130140	4132140	These three are general sky areas
4132140	4134140	They are not sub-millimeter sky areas
4134140	4136140	We can only constrain this part
4136140	4138140	But if we observe today
4138140	4140140	These blue circles are all
4140140	4142140	Sub-millimeter sky areas
4142140	4144140	That is galaxy cluster
4144140	4146140	We can only observe the darker background
4146140	4148140	Sub-millimeter galaxy
4148140	4150140	Because they are lensed
4150140	4152140	We can also have
4152140	4154140	Measurement on the left side of the limit
4156140	4158140	So we can constrain
4158140	4160140	This part that we couldn't observe
4160140	4162140	OK
4162140	4164140	This picture is very basic
4164140	4166140	The darker it is, the higher the density
4168140	4170140	This is why the dark
4170140	4172140	Sub-millimeter galaxy is important
4172140	4174140	We used to have this limit
4174140	4176140	We can only observe this part of the sub-millimeter galaxy
4176140	4178140	But in fact, the dark galaxy is more
4178140	4180140	The density of the dark galaxy is more than that of the bright galaxy
4180140	4182140	That is to say
4182140	4184140	In this universe
4184140	4186140	You have to study
4186140	4188140	We are studying
4188140	4190140	Cosmic Star Formation History
4190140	4192140	Then I want to study
4192140	4194140	Dusty part
4194140	4196140	Dusty part
4196140	4198140	In this part
4198140	4200140	The dark sub-millimeter galaxy
4200140	4202140	Its contribution is far greater than
4202140	4204140	This brighter sub-millimeter galaxy
4204140	4206140	The reason is very simple
4206140	4208140	Because its density is higher
4208140	4210140	Although they are darker
4210140	4212140	So they contribute
4212140	4214140	If you only compare a single sub-millimeter galaxy
4214140	4216140	Then one is bright and one is dark
4216140	4218140	Of course the darker one
4218140	4220140	Will be less than a brighter one
4220140	4222140	But because
4222140	4224140	You are a power law
4224140	4226140	Its number density is a function of flux
4226140	4228140	Is a power law
4228140	4230140	Darker
4230140	4232140	Its number is much more than the bright ones
4232140	4234140	So in general
4234140	4236140	Dark sub-millimeter galaxy
4236140	4238140	Contribute star formation
4238140	4240140	Is much more than the bright ones
4240140	4242140	So they are important
4242140	4244140	Is there any problem here?
4246140	4248140	No
4248140	4250140	What about the picture on the left?
4250140	4252140	This is called
4252140	4254140	Star Formation Rate Density
4254140	4256140	But it also
4256140	4258140	Normalize itself
4258140	4260140	It is per
4260140	4262140	Star Formation Rate
4262140	4264140	The horizontal axis is the star formation rate
4264140	4266140	It is the star formation rate
4266140	4268140	How much solar mass is generated per year
4268140	4270140	Here is the star formation
4272140	4274140	Sorry
4274140	4276140	Here is the galaxy
4276140	4278140	Its number density
4278140	4280140	Per star formation rate
4280140	4282140	Log star formation rate
4282140	4284140	The picture is like this
4284140	4286140	The picture on the left
4286140	4288140	Is observed by optical
4288140	4290140	Optical
4290140	4292140	To get the curve
4292140	4294140	The curve on the right
4294140	4296140	Is observed by sub-millimeter
4296140	4298140	To get the curve
4298140	4300140	Then you will find
4300140	4302140	The population on the left
4302140	4304140	Is the optical environment
4304140	4306140	As I said
4306140	4308140	Because it is a redshift galaxy
4308140	4310140	Its redstripe is actually UB
4310140	4312140	OK
4312140	4314140	These
4314140	4316140	UVs
4316140	4318140	Or the optical samples
4318140	4320140	On the left
4320140	4322140	On the left
4322140	4324140	You will find these two populations
4324140	4326140	Here are different curves
4326140	4328140	From different papers
4328140	4330140	These two
4330140	4332140	These two populations
4332140	4334140	Almost do not overlap
4334140	4336140	Why do not overlap?
4336140	4338140	Because these
4338140	4340140	Can be directly observed by optical
4340140	4342140	Because the star formation rate
4342140	4344140	Is not so high
4344140	4346140	Because usually the more dusty
4346140	4348140	The more dusty
4348140	4350140	The higher the star formation rate
4350140	4352140	Usually like this
4352140	4354140	So these sub-millimeter samples
4354140	4356140	They are very dusty galaxies
4356140	4358140	Although they are all on the right
4358140	4360140	Their star formation rate is very high
4360140	4362140	Then there is the confusion limit
4362140	4364140	I just said
4364140	4366140	Your sub-millimeter sample is limited to
4366140	4368140	The single digit limit
4368140	4370140	And these other visible light waves
4370140	4372140	Their samples overlap
4372140	4374140	So what we want to do today is
4374140	4376140	I use gravity
4376140	4378140	I can observe the darker
4378140	4380140	Sub-millimeter
4380140	4382140	Sub-millimeter galaxies
4382140	4384140	This red line and this red line
4384140	4386140	Basically correspond
4386140	4388140	I have gravity
4388140	4390140	I want to let the curve on the right
4390140	4392140	Extend to the left
4392140	4394140	Is to extend my sub-millimeter sample
4394140	4396140	Extend to the left
4396140	4398140	Let my sub-millimeter sample
4398140	4400140	With these visible light observed samples
4400140	4402140	Can overlap
4402140	4404140	Then after the overlap
4404140	4406140	The most important thing comes
4406140	4408140	I
4408140	4410140	I have observed
4410140	4412140	After this sub-millimeter sample
4412140	4414140	The question I want to ask is
4414140	4416140	In this place
4416140	4418140	I put this sample to the left
4418140	4420140	My sub-millimeter galaxy
4420140	4422140	In this place
4422140	4424140	Is it these
4424140	4426140	These visible light
4426140	4428140	Can see the galaxy
4428140	4430140	Are they the same thing?
4430140	4432140	Or is it completely different?
4432140	4434140	Part is the same, part is the same
4434140	4436140	Part is the same, part is different
4436140	4438140	This thing is very important, why?
4438140	4440140	Because we are
4440140	4442140	Establish, we are measuring our universe
4442140	4444140	Star formation history
4444140	4446140	I just said that there are two populations in the universe
4446140	4448140	These two populations are very important
4448140	4450140	One is directly observed by visible light
4450140	4452140	One is to use long-wave long-wave red light
4452140	4454140	These two samples
4454140	4456140	We can measure their
4456140	4458140	Star formation history contribution to our universe
4458140	4460140	OK
4460140	4462140	Both are important
4462140	4464140	Because there are two populations
4464140	4466140	We have to combine them together
4466140	4468140	Is the total star formation in our universe
4468140	4470140	OK
4470140	4472140	Then we can draw
4472140	4474140	The picture I just drew in the first page
4474140	4476140	Is the star formation history of the universe
4476140	4478140	We have to put these two observations
4478140	4480140	Combine together
4480140	4482140	But today
4482140	4484140	When we extend the sub-minimum sample here
4484140	4486140	Then we have to know
4486140	4488140	Are these sub-minimum samples
4488140	4490140	These sub-minimum samples
4490140	4492140	These sub-minimum galaxies
4492140	4494140	Is it already
4494140	4496140	Included in these samples
4496140	4498140	Right
4498140	4500140	In case we observe
4500140	4502140	We extend this sample here
4502140	4504140	Then in case these sub-minimum galaxies
4504140	4506140	In this place
4506140	4508140	Sub-minimum galaxies
4508140	4510140	Already included in these UV
4510140	4512140	These visible light samples
4512140	4514140	Then we just
4514140	4516140	We don't have to do it anymore
4516140	4518140	Because there is no need to
4518140	4520140	Study those darker sub-minimum galaxies
4520140	4522140	Because those darker sub-minimum galaxies
4522140	4524140	Basically it's you
4524140	4526140	Those galaxies selected by visible light
4526140	4528140	It's the same thing
4528140	4530140	Why do we have to go to Africa
4530140	4532140	To use more difficult
4532140	4534140	Long-wave long-wave observation to study them
4534140	4536140	Because it's the same thing
4536140	4538140	In fact
4538140	4540140	On the contrary
4540140	4542140	In case these sub-minimum galaxies
4542140	4544140	In this part of the sub-minimum galaxies
4544140	4546140	Not all
4546140	4548140	Already included in this sample
4548140	4550140	Then we have to know
4550140	4552140	OK
4552140	4554140	How many fractions are already included in it
4554140	4556140	How many fractions are not included
4556140	4558140	That is to say
4558140	4560140	We want to know how many fractions
4560140	4562140	In this part of the sub-minimum galaxy
4562140	4564140	We can directly see the visible light
4564140	4566140	How much is still visible
4566140	4568140	Still can't see
4568140	4570140	We have this information
4570140	4572140	After we quantize it
4572140	4574140	We can accurately put
4574140	4576140	This UV sample
4576140	4578140	The visible light sample
4578140	4580140	Contribute to the star formation
4580140	4582140	And our sub-minimum sample
4582140	4584140	Contribute to the star formation
4584140	4586140	Add them up
4586140	4588140	Because if these two samples today
4588140	4590140	Are completely independent
4590140	4592140	Then just add them up
4592140	4594140	When they overlap
4594140	4596140	This part may not be completely independent
4596140	4598140	But it may not be completely dependent
4598140	4600140	So we have to know
4600140	4602140	How many fractions are overlapping
4602140	4604140	How many sub-minimum sources
4604140	4606140	It is actually also in the UV
4606140	4608140	Will see
4608140	4610140	This is why
4610140	4612140	Study the darker sub-minimum galaxy
4612140	4614140	Very important
4614140	4616140	We want to know
4616140	4618140	How many of them
4618140	4620140	Already included in the rest-frame UV sample
4620140	4622140	So we can accurately
4622140	4624140	To measure
4624140	4626140	The star formation of our entire universe
4626140	4628140	Another important reason is
4628140	4630140	Because we found
4630140	4632140	In the past, these sub-minimum galaxies
4632140	4634140	Hello
4634140	4636140	I have a question
4638140	4640140	Can't hear
4640140	4642140	My question is
4642140	4644140	If you put them
4644140	4646140	Extend
4646140	4648140	I use typing
4650140	4652140	You can talk while typing
4652140	4654140	Because after typing, I have to quit to see
4664140	4666140	Can you hear me
4668140	4670140	Hello
4670140	4672140	Sorry
4672140	4674140	I accidentally pressed you to leave
4680140	4682140	So you're back
4682140	4684140	Yes
4684140	4686140	My question is
4686140	4688140	Can you hear me
4688140	4690140	If you extend
4690140	4692140	If it's different
4692140	4694140	You know it's different
4694140	4696140	But if you extend and overlap
4696140	4698140	How do you know it's the same
4698140	4700140	Maybe it's still different
4700140	4702140	The so-called difference means
4702140	4704140	Suppose I detect
4706140	4708140	Suppose I detect
4708140	4710140	Some darker
4712140	4714140	Sub-minimum galaxies
4730140	4732140	I detect some darker
4732140	4734140	Sub-minimum galaxies
4734140	4736140	Their star formation rate
4736140	4738140	Can you hear me
4742140	4744140	I detect some darker
4744140	4746140	Sub-minimum galaxies
4746140	4748140	Their star formation rate
4748140	4750140	What I want to do is
4750140	4752140	Very simple
4752140	4754140	What I want to do is
4754140	4756140	Like this
4756140	4758140	Like this
4764140	4766140	What I want to do is very simple
4766140	4768140	Suppose I have a sub-minimum galaxy
4768140	4770140	Darker than this
4770140	4772140	Then I use the interferometer
4772140	4774140	To accurately measure its position
4774140	4776140	Then I go to the visible wave field
4776140	4778140	That is the Hubble telescope
4778140	4780140	Or other telescope
4780140	4782140	To find out if it corresponds to
4782140	4784140	The visible counterpart
4786140	4788140	When you have a visible counterpart
4788140	4790140	And it's a very obvious counterpart
4790140	4792140	It means
4792140	4794140	It is
4794140	4796140	It is this kind of galaxy
4796140	4798140	It is the galaxy found in the visible wave field
4798140	4800140	On the contrary, if you
4802140	4804140	Basically
4804140	4806140	This kind of galaxy
4806140	4808140	If you find it has a visible emission
4808140	4810140	It means
4810140	4812140	It is this kind of galaxy
4812140	4814140	It is this kind of galaxy
4814140	4816140	I'm talking about
4816140	4818140	Statistically
4818140	4820140	Not a galaxy
4820140	4822140	I'm not talking about
4822140	4824140	A sub-minimum galaxy
4824140	4826140	Is it a galaxy in a paper
4826140	4828140	Is it a galaxy in a paper
4828140	4830140	I'm talking about
4830140	4832140	Statistically
4832140	4834140	Can a sub-minimum galaxy
4834140	4836140	Can a sub-minimum galaxy
4836140	4838140	Do you know what I mean?
4838140	4840140	So what you have to do is very simple
4840140	4842140	You use the interferometer to accurately measure
4842140	4844140	The position of a sub-minimum
4844140	4846140	Then we go to the visible beam
4846140	4848140	To see if it emits light
4848140	4850140	Or if it is completely non-existent
4850140	4852140	That's it
4854140	4856140	I want to ask
4856140	4858140	I see
4858140	4860140	I understand
4860140	4862140	I may have missed it
4862140	4864140	So in this way
4864140	4866140	The visible and non-visible light emitted by a star
4866140	4868140	The visible and non-visible light emitted by a star
4868140	4870140	The brightness of these two lights
4870140	4872140	There is no certain relationship
4876140	4878140	The so-called non-visible light
4878140	4880140	Is the sub-minimum we talked about
4880140	4882140	Is the sub-minimum we talked about
4882140	4884140	It's actually a little bit
4884140	4886140	I'll talk about it later
4886140	4888140	Usually
4888140	4890140	It should be related
4890140	4892140	Of course
4892140	4894140	Because
4894140	4896140	Because it's with your
4896140	4898140	The amount of dust in the galaxy
4898140	4900140	The amount of dust in the galaxy
4900140	4902140	Does it matter?
4902140	4904140	How much dust
4904140	4906140	It's related, right?
4906140	4908140	It's related, right?
4908140	4910140	I'll talk about it later
4910140	4912140	Others are studying
4912140	4914140	A lower shift galaxy
4914140	4916140	I'll talk about it later
4916140	4918140	I'll talk about it later
4918140	4920140	I'll continue
4922140	4924140	I hope I've convinced you
4924140	4926140	I hope I've convinced you
4926140	4928140	Why I'm studying the sub-minimum galaxy
4928140	4930140	Two things
4930140	4932140	I haven't talked about the second thing
4932140	4934140	The first thing is what I asked
4934140	4936140	The second thing is
4936140	4938140	The previous astronomers found
4938140	4940140	The bright sub-minimum galaxies
4940140	4942140	The brightness is brighter than the two-minimum galaxies
4942140	4944140	The brightness is brighter than the two-minimum galaxies
4944140	4946140	They are all very dusty
4946140	4948140	Very intense star forming galaxies
4948140	4950140	They are all very dusty very intense star forming galaxies
4950140	4952140	The green star forming galaxies
4952140	4954140	They are all very dusty
4954140	4956140	very intense star forming galaxies
4956140	4958140	These sub-minimum galaxies
4958140	4960140	These sub-minimum galaxies
4960140	4962140	They are all major mergers
4962140	4964140	They are all major mergers
4964140	4966140	They are conglomerates
4966140	4968140	They are conglomerates
4968140	4970140	They are conglomerates
4970140	4972140	You can look up
4972140	4974140	You can look up
4974140	4976140	The answer
4976140	4978140	The answer
5038140	5040140	The answer is SMG
5040140	5042140	The answer is SMG
5042140	5044140	The answer is SMG
5044140	5046140	I forgot to mention
5046140	5048140	The darker stars are SMG
5048140	5050140	The darker stars are SMG
5050140	5052140	Are these also major mergers?
5052140	5054140	Are these also major mergers?
5054140	5056140	Or are they conglomerates?
5056140	5058140	Or are they conglomerates?
5058140	5060140	They are not intense
5060140	5062140	They are not intense
5062140	5064140	Not major mergers
5064140	5066140	Not major mergers
5066140	5068140	They are isolated disks
5068140	5070140	These star formation data
5070140	5072140	These star formation data
5072140	5074140	are not major mergers
5074140	5078140	They are simple spiral galaxies
5078140	5080140	They are simple spiral galaxies
5080140	5082140	...
5082140	5084140	They are not that intense
5084140	5086140	They are not that intense
5086140	5088140	so their star formation rate is not that high
