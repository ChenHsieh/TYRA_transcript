1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If you have any questions, you can just type them in the chat box.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No, he just said to start recording.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Because when I pressed it, he told me that my memory was full.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, I'm going to turn off the microphone now.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, bye bye.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, so if you have any questions later, you can just type them in the chat box.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Or you can just turn on your microphone and ask questions.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Because in fact, this video, if I were to talk to a person who does biological math, it would be about 20 minutes.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But in fact, I think it should be far more than that.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Because I hope to let everyone, even if it's not a biological math background, to get a little bit of an idea of what I'm doing.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
At least have a concept.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, I'm going to start.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My topic today is mainly to discuss how a cell decides to extend itself in one direction.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As you can see, the nerve cell on the left side of the projection film, it only extends in one direction.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Or it extends in many directions.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Like the nerve cell on the right, it extends in many directions.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So how does it control such a mechanism?

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is actually a very, very big problem.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And in different biological systems, they may use different methods to control it.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But no one has actually asked this question yet.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So today I'm going to use the mechanism that we already know, the mechanism that the organism extends in a certain direction.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's understand this mechanism and then study what kind of nature it has to decide whether it extends in one direction or in many directions.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So my topic today is Principles that Govern Competition or Coexistence in Rho-GTPase Driven Polarization.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rho-GTPase is a protein.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a very interesting protein.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're going to go all over it today.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What does polarization mean?

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let me explain it to you now.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
First of all, for a cell,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Modeling people often think about how to model a cell.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Generally, you would imagine that you have a cell membrane.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There's a cell tissue inside.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a cell box inside.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's DNA in the cell box.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We don't care about DNA.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All the protein is floating in your cell tissue.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If someone asks me how much of the protein in the cell tissue is dense,

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Different proteins are different.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
For example, I'll tell you that the density of the protein in the cell tissue is about this much, a fixed number.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's make an assumption.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The whole cell is uniform.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The density of the same protein in the cell tissue is basically the same.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In this situation, a cell can't tell which side is the head and which side is the tail.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
For a person, it is very important to distinguish between the head and the tail.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because first of all, you need to know where your head is.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You even need to distinguish between the front and the back.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Front and back.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Back and side.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Left and right.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So a lot of this kind of asymmetry is very important to the cell.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not just a whole individual thing for humans.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
For a cell, it's the same thing.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
For example, if this is a mobile cell,

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
For example, if this is a tissue,

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It needs to know where it's going.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The tail will shake and it will swim to the other side.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Even if it's not a mobile cell,

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It could be, for example, your intestinal mucosa cell.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It needs to know which side is the side with food or poop.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And which side is the side with blood vessels.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Because it's trying to get nutrients from one side to the other.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So it needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So for biological cells,

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's very important to establish this front and back axis.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Usually, the way this is done is

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
A certain protein may have a completely uniform distribution in the cell.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It needs to go through a certain process.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It needs to gather at the same end of the cell.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And then from that end,

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
For example, it starts from that end.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The skeleton of the cell grows from there.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
For example, if it wants to secrete protein,

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The secretion ball will move forward along the cell skeleton.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So it needs to gather the protein to that side first.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
After the cell skeleton, it will let everyone go that way.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If this is a long-term cell,

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It obviously needs to grow a cell skeleton first.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
After the direction of this axis, it needs to go.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The source of all this is that we need to polarize a certain protein.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's what we call polarization.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It needs to be gathered to the same end.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In the process of polarization,

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In fact, it's not just a problem of building an axis.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Another problem is,

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you want to build an axis, or do you want to build a lot of axes?

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's say you want to transport something out.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you want to transport it to one place at a time,

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Or do you want to transport it to a lot of places at a time?

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
For example, what you see now is

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The nerve cells of the hippocampus.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
In fact, no matter what nerve cells,

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's pretty much how it grows.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In the beginning, it only grew to one end.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It only grew to one end when it was very small.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Then it started to grow to a lot of places.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
These things that grow to a lot of ends,

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Things like trees, we call them trees.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The tree is the place where the nerve cells receive information.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
After the tree grows, it starts to grow the axis.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It only grows to one end.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
A nerve cell has a lot of trees, but it only has one axis.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So it needs to switch from growing to a lot of ends to only one end.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then the axis will grow very, very long.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So the information that the nerve cells receive

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The same information is passed to the same axis.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So obviously, for the nerve cells,

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
When it grows to one end, when it grows to a lot of ends,

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a very important thing.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is the main problem I have today.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Our lab is not actually doing nerve cells.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Our lab is doing hemoglobin.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hemoglobin is the only thing on top.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's called Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
In short, hemoglobin,

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hemoglobin is what we brew beer,

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Or beer yeast,

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or yeast for making bread.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We often encounter it because

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you put it in a non-oxidative space,

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When it eats sugar, it will dilute it into alcohol.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
People are a kind of wild creature,

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So they love to drink.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So we like hemoglobin very much.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In addition, we often use hemoglobin

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It produces a lot of carbon dioxide.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then it will make the bread fluffy.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Anyway, this is cold knowledge.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just want to tell you what is hemoglobin.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hemoglobin is the one we see above.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What hemoglobin does is it will sprout.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you have read biology in high school,

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You will learn the name of sprout growth.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That is to say,

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The way hemoglobin gives birth to children is

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It will first try to gather a certain protein to one end.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That end will become its head.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It will grow a tooth from the head.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The tooth will become its baby.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Then the tooth will split out again.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It will become a baby.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is the way hemoglobin gives birth.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So for hemoglobin,

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It is very important that it only grows one head.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is the reason?

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Because when it is split up,

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Its DNA will be divided into two parts.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then the average one part is divided to the child,

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
One part is kept by itself.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If it grows two heads today,

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It will have two children.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
At this time, it does not know how to divide its DNA.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Many times, the child will only get half of the DNA.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then it will die.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So for hemoglobin,

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It is very important that it only grows one head.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But at the same time,

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The one below is also another kind of sprout.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But it is the kind of sprout that grows spores.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But hemoglobin is very close relatives.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They basically use the same system

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
To decide how to grow their heads.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But the sprout that grows spores

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We call it Aspia gossypia.

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Aspia gossypia

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It does not only grow one part at a time.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Because if it grows like this,

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It will grow into a pipe.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It will become a very useless sprout.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
One important thing for it is that

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It needs to split up.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If it can grow today,

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then grow forward, split up,

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Everyone splits up,

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It can grow into a secret net.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That secret net can absorb

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The nutrients of the whole land or tree trunk.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So for these sprouts,

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It is important to grow many heads at a time.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But controlling how they grow their heads

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is to decide the protein at the end of their heads

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is the same kind of protein.

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This kind of protein is called Rho-GTPase.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It is called Rho.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This kind of protein is called Rho.

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The most important question today is

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This Rho-GTPase protein

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why does it have the same mechanism

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
To decide these two different results?

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What kind of method

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Can control it to grow one part or two parts?

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Today, my speech will be divided into two parts.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
One part is my theory

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
To discuss

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This Rho-GTPase protein

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How does it

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
From a state of uniformity in a cell

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
To a state of uniformity in a cell

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
How does this mechanism

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Decide whether it grows one part or two parts?

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This is the first part.

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This part is mainly used for

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Phenolphthalein and some other things.

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The second part is

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I want to start from the actual biological body

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Actually, I'm using yeast.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
To verify the knowledge I got from the previous theory

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Whether some rules

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Are applicable to this biological body.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So I'm going to divide it into two parts.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
One part is very mathematical.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You'll see me shaking there.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But you'll see me showing the persimmon

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And see my cat running.

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The other part

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You'll see the video of yeast.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So far, are there any questions?

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I have one

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Maybe I missed it.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I feel a little weird.

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think you're talking about

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
These bacteria have

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Have consciousness

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It can decide what it wants to do.

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not a bacteria.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's a cell.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Anyway, you know what I mean.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It decides where it grows.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Is it active?

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Actually, it is.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
For example, a yeast

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There are two ways it grows.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But anyway

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes, it is active.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The so-called active means

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's not random.

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I know it's not random.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because from the outside

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It doesn't look like it's random.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I mean, it decides where it's going to grow.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
For example

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's say there's a plant today.

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's going to grow in the opposite direction of gravity.

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Or grow in the direction of gravity.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then you turn it 90 degrees.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It will find the direction of gravity again.

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So it's actually

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In the direction of gravity

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's passively deciding where it's going to grow.

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe in the middle is some very simple

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Some underlying mechanisms of physics

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It may not be a conscious process.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But if it's a cell

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I can't imagine

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It can decide

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I want to put all the proteins in the same direction today.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And then it goes in the same direction.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
OK

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think I'll answer a simple question first.

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If your passive and active definition is like this

263
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If it is

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's a very simple

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Today there is a

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There is a source of information.

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And then it reacts to that source of information.

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And then if this simple process is passive

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's right.

270
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a passive mechanism.

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is the easy part.

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But the hard part

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's not my major.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Maybe it's

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So you think consciousness is

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's not a chemical reaction.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Or consciousness

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
With some biological cells

281
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The combination of reactions

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It may also

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The same pattern

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's the same as getting a message and then reacting.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's just that this process is very simple.

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Or it's a very difficult question.

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's right.

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's hard to answer that part of the question.

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And then that part is what I can't answer.

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But I think it's an interesting question.

291
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But just the simple part

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes, it is

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You can use a set of message transmission systems

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
To

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
To react to external messages

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
For example, this serum

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's going to be with another kind of

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Gender serum

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then it will try to grow there.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The reason is that the other one will release pheromones.

302
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Then it will grow there.

303
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If you think this is passive

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's right. All the processes I talked about today are passive.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
OK, thank you.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Are there any other questions?

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If not, I'll go down.

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Otherwise there is a question.

309
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
OK

310
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So

311
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let me say first that I haven't been on any creatures.

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So what I mean is that

313
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's not like a serum.

314
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
For example, you just said that there is a

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Gender

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Does the serum have a gender?

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's just that you said you want to match that example.

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Someone releases pheromones

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So this one will grow over there.

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So what you mean is that

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He can't decide for himself

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Contact that

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Sexuality

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is that right?

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Is that what it means?

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As long as someone releases pheromones, he will

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
not

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It should be said

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is what we see.

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That is to say, if you give him a group of serum today.

331
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then you put a group

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So the gender of the serum

333
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We will divide A and Alpha.

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
A and Alpha can be matched

335
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's it.

336
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So if you put a group of A and a group of Alpha today.

337
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you mix them together

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You can imagine it as a group of boys.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
A group of girls all mixed together

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
At this time, some people will run to

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Match with others

342
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Some people will not match with others

343
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Some people don't match

344
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's because they're in the wrong direction.

345
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Some people are because they

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's not right at all

347
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Pheromones

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So this is a phenomenon

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Is this his decision?

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Or did he decide not to say that?

352
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because I would think

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If this environment is for him

354
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's his mating that's more beneficial to him.

355
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
After this mating

356
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
After giving birth to a child

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If you can adapt to the environment

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Those who did not mate successfully

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They are likely to be killed by the gods.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then gradually

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This group of cells that will react

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So they are in the process of evolution

363
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Learn to react to pheromones

364
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is this a proactive process?

365
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I think it's a big question

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is how we understand the process

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But how do you determine

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Is this a conscious thing?

369
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think it's a big question

370
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I just said I can't answer

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OK, thank you

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are there any other questions?

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then I'll go down

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
it is good

375
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
In the past, there have been several studies

376
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We gradually realized that

377
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
These

378
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I just talked about

379
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It creates a front and back

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The principle of this polarity

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is a

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This mechanism of our so-called Turing text

383
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Turing

384
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Everyone should have heard a little bit

385
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Because there was a movie a while ago

386
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's called

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The Mutation Game

388
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The handsome guy in it

389
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Is playing Alan Turing

390
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So everyone should know who Alan Turing is

391
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Everyone may know

392
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He does computer

393
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And he is

394
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So-called mechanical consciousness

395
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Contribution in this area

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
In fact, he is a super genius

397
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I am studying this whole field

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Biomathematics

399
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Basically all

400
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is Turing text?

401
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Before

402
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Everyone has always had a doubt

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
For example, you see a tiger today

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It has a pattern

405
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You see a leopard, it has a pattern

406
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You see some fish

407
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It may have a pattern on it

408
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The pattern becomes a pattern

409
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
These patterns

410
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How did it come out?

411
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
How did these patterns come out?

412
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If you say there is something

413
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
To control these patterns

414
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That controls its thing

415
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So you have to go forward

416
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Then found

417
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It seems

418
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It seems to be in a certain step

419
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That pattern will need

420
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There is a way to self-release

421
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
From a completely uniform state

422
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Pattern comes out

423
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It does not need to be controlled at all

424
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It will automatically grow a pattern

425
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So everyone is very confused

426
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What does this machine look like?

427
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Alan Turing

428
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
First, with a very simple partial equation

429
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This conclusion

430
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He said

431
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If this cell is good

432
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Or a piece of land

433
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If it has two chemical substances

434
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
One is activator

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Then the other is substrate

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
One is

437
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
How to say activator?

438
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Activator should be easy to understand

439
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What it does is activate

440
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The other thing is substrate

441
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is its value

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What does activator do?

443
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Once there is this activator

444
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It will have a positive feedback

445
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Then let more activators grow

446
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Activator in the process of growing

447
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It absorbs the value and becomes activator

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
For example

449
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There may be an activator today

450
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The process of its positive feedback

451
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He went to catch another substrate

452
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Then turn that substrate into activator

453
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So in this process

454
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Once activator grows

455
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He will have a positive feedback

456
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
To make himself more and more

457
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But at the same time

458
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
In this process

459
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It will absorb the substrate

460
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So the substrate will become less and less

461
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If there is such a process

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
With activator

463
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It spreads very slowly

464
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Then substrate

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If it spreads very quickly

466
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
In this way, it will

467
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Such a system can make

468
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Point

469
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
A whole piece

470
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It can also make a strip

471
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It can make a very interesting pattern

472
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It can make a counterpoint

473
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It can even make a piece

474
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No substrate part

475
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So the same system

476
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
As long as you give it different parameters

477
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It can run

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Different pattern results

479
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So this is a very interesting thing

480
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The picture on the right

481
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is that we took one

482
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Entering its black and white photo

483
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Then take the photo

484
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Its brightness

485
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That model will automatically

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
According to the brightness above

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
To run

488
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Its pattern is all white

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Or dot or semicolon

490
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In short, this is a very cool thing

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Everyone realized

492
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It turns out that such a system

493
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Can make a piece

494
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Nothing

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Run out of the pattern

496
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That such a system

497
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What does it have to do with the activator I just talked about?

498
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The activator is probably like this

499
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That is to say

500
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Rho-GTPase

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It is a protein

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It has two forms

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
One is when it sticks to GTP

504
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This form is activator

505
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This form is active

506
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It can guide the downstream

507
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
All biological reactions

508
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
To go to it

509
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Then there is another form

510
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It is a non-living form

511
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It is Rho-GDP

512
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It is Rho-GDPase

513
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So this protein

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It has a non-living form of GTP

515
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Then it switches between these two forms

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
When the active Rho-GDP

518
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It spreads very slowly

519
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Then the active Rho-GDP

520
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If it spreads very quickly

521
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This becomes a

522
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Healing mechanism

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So actually in the cell

524
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The way it works is like this

525
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That is to say, we have a Rho-GDP

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It is stuck on the cell membrane

527
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Because it has a tail

528
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It is stuck on the cell membrane

529
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That

530
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Once there is a Rho-GDP

531
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It will try to

532
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Turn other Rho-GDP

533
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Into Rho-GDP

534
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So everyone sees that the red arrow

535
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is a positive feedback

536
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
At the same time, it also has another form

537
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Called Rho-GDP

538
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I just told you that it is a living form

539
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Its tail is wrapped

540
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So it can be in the cell

541
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Happy in the cell

542
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It spreads quickly in the cell

543
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There is an

544
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Activator substrate system

545
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It just happens to be its activator

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It spreads very slowly

547
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Then its substrate spreads very quickly

548
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And its activator

549
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It has a positive feedback

550
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The way we model this thing

551
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Is that we have a partial differential equation

552
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That is to say

553
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If we put the active form

554
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Called U

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The inactive form is called V

556
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That

557
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The change in time

558
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Will determine

559
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How fast it spreads

560
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And its

561
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I just put three arrows on it

562
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
To give it a reaction

563
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
At the same time

564
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Its V

565
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The change in time

566
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It depends on how fast it spreads

567
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And its chemical reaction

568
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's just a little bit special here

569
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Because the reactor

570
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That part

571
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's basically

572
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
If anything grows out of U

573
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It must have disappeared from V

574
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It can only be exchanged between V and U

575
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So its

576
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That term

577
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's positive and it's negative

578
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What this means

579
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Is that the whole system is qualitatively consistent

580
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
There is no term in here

581
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It will automatically

582
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Grow out of

583
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Rho GDP

584
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Or U

585
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
There is no term

586
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Any particle

587
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Disappears from the system

588
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I have a question

589
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Okay

590
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That is

591
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What is the unit of UV?

592
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Is it density?

593
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Or something like that

594
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yes, it should be

595
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It should be concentration

596
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But because it is

597
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
For example, the concentration on the entire cell membrane

598
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So it is

599
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It is the change in position and time

600
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But it is concentration

601
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So this is weird

602
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There is a problem with this

603
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I think your big D

604
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
U and big D

605
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's not a dimensionless value

606
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That is to say

607
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You are discussing

608
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
A

609
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Rho GDP

610
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
With a Rho GDP

611
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Interaction

612
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Discuss with you once

613
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Ten Rho GDP

614
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
With ten Rho GDP

615
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It won't be the same

616
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Because your big D is not dimensionless

617
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Do you understand? It can't be multiplied by ten

618
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Because it is not a value without units

619
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't understand

620
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes, I don't understand

621
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't understand

622
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So U and V are equal

623
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You said concentration

624
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's actually a concept of density

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
For example, unit volume

626
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
At this time

627
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
At this time, at this position

628
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Its density

629
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Then DU and DV are the rate of expansion

630
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
For example, the unit may be

631
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The unit should be

632
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Every second

633
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Then the molecule should be

634
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
For example, square meters or square meters

635
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It should be similar to this concept

636
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That is to say

637
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
DU and DV

638
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Its concept should be

639
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Every second it can

640
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It should be one square meter per second

641
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It should be like this

642
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
How much can it move outward every second

643
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Is this outward expansion

644
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
OK, confirm

645
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes, that's right

646
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But like this

647
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What did you just say

648
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
One U

649
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
One rho gdp

650
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
OK, good

651
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You remove the big F first

652
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because don't worry about the big F

653
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Both sides of this square

654
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
There is this small U or small V, right?

655
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So the two of them

656
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The units in this place

657
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Will be the same

658
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Then you put

659
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What is the right side of the square?

660
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Divided by two X

661
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then X is the unit of length

662
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Then on the left

663
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Divided by a T is the unit of time

664
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So your unit of big D is actually

665
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Distance per square unit time

666
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yes, yes

667
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So the dimension on both sides

668
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Is it right?

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But the distance per square unit time

670
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
This value

671
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In your change

672
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You discussed

673
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This whole distance

674
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
For example, the size of your change

675
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Or you only look at one at a time

676
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Or you only look at ten at a time

677
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This value will keep running

678
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It won't be unchanged

679
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Unless you take data

680
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Time also changes

681
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But it won't

682
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Because you take data

683
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You keep looking at it every second

684
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Keep looking

685
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So your value will change

686
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
From that

687
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
From that

688
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
From you

689
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
OK, all the way to that

690
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
All the way to that

691
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The unit of the expansion constant

692
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I followed up

693
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And then you said

694
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So why does it

695
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Why does it change

696
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's a fixed value

697
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Then

698
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You said why does it change

699
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I really don't understand

700
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Wait a minute

701
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm the only one who doesn't understand

702
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Is there anyone who can help me

703
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Say

704
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What does this mean

705
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think it sounds a bit strange

706
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because it

707
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah, I understand

708
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's a rate of expansion

709
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The rate of expansion should be related to the environment

710
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Instead of GDP or GDP

711
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
For example, you say the rate of expansion

712
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah

713
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The rate of expansion has nothing to do with GDP or GDP

714
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah, if you look at this rate of expansion

715
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It should be said that

716
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
On the cell membrane

717
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The rate of expansion is a slower value

718
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And then in the cell nucleus

719
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus

720
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus

721
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's another faster value

722
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But

723
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But in

724
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
In different locations

725
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Different time points

726
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
As long as it is

727
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
As long as it is on the cell membrane

728
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The rate of expansion is the same

729
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
As long as it is in the cell nucleus

730
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The rate of expansion is the same

731
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, okay, I know

732
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I know how to ask

733
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Then I change a question

734
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This big D

735
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Big D U or big D V

736
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
These two values

737
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What does it have to do with

738
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It will be with

739
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It will be with the nature of these two cells

740
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What kind of cell is it?

741
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Right?

742
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Correct

743
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Is there anything else?

744
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
No more

745
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's basically

746
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Theoretically, you should

747
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Theoretically, when you write this governing equation

748
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You should hope these two

749
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
These two numbers are basically used to present

750
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
To some extent

751
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's just about the relationship between this interaction

752
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Right?

753
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Just the two of them

754
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But if you do

755
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
No, I mean the two of them

756
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
If one is a stone

757
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Or one is a protein

758
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Obviously that D will be very different

759
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I can't even write

760
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Correct

761
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So it is

762
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Correct

763
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Characterize the nature of your system

764
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Or the nature of the unit in the system

765
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But

766
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It looks like your persimmon

767
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Dimension

768
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Will still be with

769
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
For example, how big do you put these cells

770
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It doesn't matter to cultivate

771
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It looks weird

772
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Wait, why am I

773
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It looks weird

774
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I think I can understand it

775
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Then I also know

776
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I understand your question

777
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I think I understand the question

778
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But why

779
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That D

780
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I guess what you mean is that

781
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That D

782
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I said Zhang Aiyong

783
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
What you mean is that

784
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That D is not a constant

785
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's actually a variable

786
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Right?

787
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Will change according to the unit you choose

788
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Correct

789
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So why is this a problem?

790
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So why is this a problem?

791
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I can know what that thing is

792
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It is a constant

793
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yes, you set a system

794
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It is a constant

795
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Then you change a system

796
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You change a constant

797
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So why is this a problem?

798
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Yes

799
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
This is equivalent to

800
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Your expansion equation

801
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
In fact, it is the same as the general heat transfer

802
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The expansion equation is the same

803
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yes, it's exactly the same

804
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Heat transfer coefficient is related to temperature

805
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It changes with temperature

806
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
No matter what it does

807
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It won't be a problem

808
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So I don't understand

809
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't understand what the problem is

810
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
My feeling is that

811
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This thing is not

812
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I won't say it's a problem

813
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But I will say it's not enough

814
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Is it not beautiful enough?

815
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Because it actually

816
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yes, it's actually a heat transfer

817
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
This is a matter of aesthetics

818
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because it's not enough

819
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Generalize

820
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I think I have to think about it

821
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Because I think we've been stuck for a long time

822
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It will take up a lot of your time

823
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I basically understand this equation

824
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Because this is actually

825
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's a heat diffusion equation

826
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's an expansion equation

827
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Then add the heat diffusion

828
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes

829
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Ok, let's continue today

830
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Thank you, I'm sorry

831
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No

832
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So

833
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That expansion constant

834
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's only two kinds

835
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
One is

836
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
One is the expansion constant of U

837
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It will be on the film

838
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's a slower value

839
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But it's the same in different positions

840
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Then

841
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The expansion constant of V is faster

842
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Bigger

843
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Speaking of this, I suddenly thought of

844
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You just said

845
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Their number

846
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Anyway, you just said that

847
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Magnitude is called magnitude

848
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So you don't need to add another

849
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Magnitude equation

850
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
For example, the total number must be zero

851
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No, because he himself

852
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
He himself

853
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I write it like this now

854
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
He will already be constant

855
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The reason is good first

856
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The expansion side

857
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He will only run to the side

858
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
He won't

859
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He won't disappear, right?

860
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So the expansion is already constant

861
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
What about the part of the reaction?

862
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You just disappear

863
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Because his reaction rate on the V side

864
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Is negative f of uv

865
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Then the reaction rate on the U side is

866
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
f of uv

867
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So

868
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Anything disappears from V

869
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He will use the same rate

870
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Come out from U

871
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So he will automatically say

872
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Yes, I understand

873
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
OK, thank you

874
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What about this system

875
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Basically

876
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You will see that

877
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Rho gtp

878
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
He is

879
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If he is anywhere

880
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
He has a little bit

881
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
More rho gtp

882
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He will

883
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Cause a positive feedback

884
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Then he will suck a lot of

885
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Substrate

886
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Then it becomes

887
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Just suck a lot of rho gtp

888
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Then it becomes a lot of rho gtp

889
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Gathered in that position

890
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
The problem is now rho gtp

891
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
At this time it causes a

892
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Rho gtp vacuum

893
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But in that cell

894
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Part of it is

895
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It doesn't seem to have

896
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Is rho gtp

897
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The concentration is very low

898
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But at this time

899
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Because in the cell

900
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
His expansion rate is very fast

901
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So this concentration vacuum

902
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Will be quickly

903
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's the rho gtp in other places

904
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Once it's subtracted

905
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It will be quickly sucked

906
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
To the cell membrane

907
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So such a mechanism

908
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Will quickly put

909
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The whole cell

910
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Rho gtp

911
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
All gathered

912
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
To the same cell membrane

913
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
To the same cell membrane

914
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
To the same cell membrane

915
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
To the same cell membrane

916
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
This is basically the

917
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Turing mechanism

918
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
In my special example

919
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
In my special example

920
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
More intuitive explanation

921
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
If I plot it directly

922
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It will be like this

923
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That is to say

924
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What you see today

925
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The orange text you see here

926
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The orange is

927
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The x-axis is the position

928
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Then the y-axis is

929
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The y-axis is the concentration

930
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Anyway, this mechanism

931
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It will basically let you

932
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Random

933
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It will automatically grow out

934
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
All of these objects

935
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Will try to gather

936
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
To the same location

937
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Then it will form a

938
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Concentration peak

939
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
According to our understanding of the Turing system

940
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
That is to say

941
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
How long is this cell

942
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Today is 3 microns

943
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
If I am today

944
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
On top of 3 microns

945
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Model this system

946
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It will grow out a peak

947
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But if I use 6 microns today

948
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It will grow out

949
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It will grow out two peaks

950
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
But we found

951
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The next thing that happens is

952
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
These two peaks

953
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They will

954
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
There is a bit of competition between them

955
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Because they are both

956
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Absorbing the same pool value

957
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Then so

958
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
When a peak

959
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
He grabbed

960
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That is, he

961
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
He will grab another peak

962
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
When the peak

963
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
He will put

964
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He will absorb

965
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Faster than the other

966
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Then

967
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So he put

968
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Another peak

969
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Things inside

970
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
All grabbed

971
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So he

972
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Although

973
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
A Turing system

974
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Theoretically

975
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Like the picture we just saw

976
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The same

977
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It can grow out a lot of dots

978
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But actually

979
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
In a

980
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Energy

981
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Quality

982
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
In the system

983
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
If you grow a lot of dots

984
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
A lot of dots

985
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They will compete with each other

986
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
In the end

987
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
There will only be one

988
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So

989
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
In a quality

990
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
He will

991
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
There will be competition

992
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That competition will decide

993
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
He has only one peak

994
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
We can understand it this way

995
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That is to say

996
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
This part

997
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You may have to

998
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Just believe me first

999
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Just

1000
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
A peak

1001
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
He absorbs

1002
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Absorbing these

1003
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The ability of the pool value

1004
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Actually determines

1005
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
His

1006
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Concentration of the peak

1007
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That is

1008
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The height of his peak

1009
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Basically

1010
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Decided

1011
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
His ability to absorb

1012
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Like the one on the right

1013
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The one on the right

1014
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
He has a stronger ability to absorb

1015
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So if you look at his

1016
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Under the pool value

1017
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
He will also cause

1018
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
A relatively large

1019
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Valuation vacuum

1020
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And then

1021
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
He will be more over there

1022
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That is the concentration of the cell value

1023
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Will be lower

1024
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
At the same time

1025
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
If you look at the small one

1026
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Because he has a poor ability to absorb

1027
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So he won't be so fast

1028
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Take

1029
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
All the cells under him

1030
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Grabbed

1031
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So the cell value under him

1032
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That one

1033
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The concentration is higher

1034
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
At this time he caused

1035
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Say

1036
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
At this time he caused

1037
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Say here

1038
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
There is a

1039
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The concentration of the cell value

1040
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Because in the cell value

1041
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
His

1042
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
His expansion is very fast

1043
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
At this time

1044
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
The substance will be very fast

1045
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
From the small peak on the left

1046
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Run to the right

1047
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And then

1048
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This is what happens at this time

1049
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That is

1050
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Everyone

1051
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Run over

1052
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Then he will be sucked to the other side

1053
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
This is probably

1054
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Why two peaks

1055
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Will compete with each other

1056
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
A

1057
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Rationale

1058
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
In fact

1059
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We are in the real

1060
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
There is such a phenomenon

1061
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
In the school drama

1062
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That is

1063
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
In fact, like me

1064
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Of course not only

1065
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
One

1066
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Rho GDP

1067
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
One Rho GDP

1068
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Between him

1069
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
There are other molecules involved

1070
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But basically

1071
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The concept is still the same

1072
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That is, everyone can still see

1073
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Say

1074
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I helped him point

1075
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Great

1076
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
That is

1077
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Basically everyone was here

1078
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
See that

1079
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That positive feedback

1080
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
He is not going to

1081
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Promote his own activation

1082
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
He is

1083
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
He will catch one

1084
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
One

1085
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Scaffold

1086
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Is a framework

1087
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Protein

1088
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That protein

1089
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Will stick to another

1090
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
A protein called GAP

1091
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But this GAP

1092
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Its role is

1093
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It is used to put

1094
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Rho GDP

1095
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Becomes Rho GDP

1096
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So once there are so many

1097
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Rho GDP

1098
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
After that

1099
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He will call out this green

1100
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And this yellow

1101
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Then this yellow

1102
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Will try to turn blue into yellow

1103
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So this

1104
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This one

1105
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Is a positive feedback

1106
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So basically

1107
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
In the school drama

1108
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We can see

1109
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I was just modeling

1110
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That thing

1111
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
In the school drama

1112
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We do see

1113
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
If today

1114
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Don't let that

1115
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Green

1116
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
This protein

1117
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's the one you'll see later

1118
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The black part

1119
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Is this green

1120
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Green protein

1121
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Or you let this

1122
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Red red protein

1123
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
He is

1124
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That Rho GDP

1125
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
In the school drama

1126
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's called CC42

1127
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
This protein

1128
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
If you let it shine

1129
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You'll see later

1130
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
First

1131
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It will grow out of a lot of points

1132
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But

1133
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
There will be competition between these different points

1134
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And then there's only one point left

1135
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And then there's only one point left

1136
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Everyone can see

1137
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
These two are the same cell

1138
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Different proteins

1139
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
There are two

1140
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And then it becomes one

1141
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And the one below

1142
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's the same

1143
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's

1144
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
At first

1145
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
There will be two points

1146
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And then these two points

1147
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Finally it becomes a point

1148
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Excuse me

1149
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So this competition

1150
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
This is not a simulation

1151
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
This is real

1152
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah, this is from the microscope

1153
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
See below

1154
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
If

1155
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
If you put that protein

1156
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
If you put a fluorescent protein on top

1157
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And then it's under the microscope

1158
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Recording

1159
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Recording the fluorescence

1160
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And then

1161
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah, I'm turning black and white now

1162
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So

1163
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The fluorescent part is black

1164
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Hi, I have a question

1165
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I've been looking

1166
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I've been looking for trouble

1167
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It's

1168
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
My question is

1169
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's the time under the video

1170
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Is that unit a second?

1171
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's a second

1172
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
A few minutes, a few seconds

1173
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So it's time under the video

1174
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So

1175
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
This whole video

1176
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's probably

1177
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
What ten minutes or something

1178
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah

1179
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And then he competed

1180
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
This process is probably

1181
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It will end in less than three minutes

1182
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
How much is the distance between the two points

1183
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The diameter of the entire cell

1184
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's about

1185
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Five

1186
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Millimeters

1187
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
No, no, no

1188
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Millimeters

1189
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's ten to the sixth square meter

1190
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Millimeters

1191
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's the diameter

1192
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So the distance between the two points is about

1193
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Two meters

1194
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So this kind of cell

1195
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
In the spread

1196
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Speed

1197
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Will

1198
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
In this ten-odd minutes

1199
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Will be less than

1200
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
The distance between the two points

1201
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Otherwise

1202
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Your F

1203
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
The parameters should have time

1204
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It won't be

1205
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Because you wait

1206
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Interaction is infinite

1207
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's not

1208
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Every moment

1209
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
To achieve its effect

1210
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Like this

1211
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
The F inside

1212
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Is

1213
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The parameters of the reaction rate inside

1214
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There is time

1215
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's

1216
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's in the F

1217
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Will be

1218
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Every second

1219
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
How much

1220
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
How much more can be generated every second

1221
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
How much

1222
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
The concentration of U

1223
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Directly like this

1224
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
The parameter in front

1225
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
There is time

1226
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
OK

1227
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I also have a question

1228
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That is

1229
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
GTP will consume GDP

1230
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That consumption is

1231
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Will

1232
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
As long as there is GDP

1233
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It will definitely consume it

1234
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Or

1235
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It has a certain criteria

1236
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
To a certain extent

1237
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Even if it has GDP around it

1238
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It doesn't care

1239
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
No, we are

1240
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
We are

1241
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
We didn't imagine

1242
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It has a threshold

1243
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That is

1244
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
As long as it

1245
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That is

1246
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
GTP will consume

1247
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That is

1248
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
GDP will consume GDP

1249
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Right?

1250
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Then

1251
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Then I mean

1252
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
This consumption is

1253
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
There is actually one less

1254
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That is

1255
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It has a key

1256
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
For example, you can see

1257
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There are two keys here

1258
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Right?

1259
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So it is

1260
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
For example, this one

1261
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
This key rate

1262
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
With

1263
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Road GDP

1264
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Is related

1265
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Then come back

1266
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The rate is related to

1267
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Road GDP

1268
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So today if there is

1269
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Very little road GDP

1270
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
A lot

1271
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
A lot of road GDP

1272
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Very little road GDP

1273
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That

1274
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Then this positive feedback

1275
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It will work hard to put the value

1276
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That is road GDP

1277
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
All become

1278
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It keeps becoming road GDP

1279
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Right?

1280
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Then but

1281
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Road GDP

1282
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It is also going back

1283
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It will also run back

1284
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So this is a bit

1285
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Depends on

1286
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
This middle balance

1287
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So

1288
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So

1289
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So GTP

1290
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That is the pink one

1291
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Will also have a chance to turn blue

1292
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It is not

1293
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Right

1294
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It is a

1295
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It is reversible

1296
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Right

1297
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Got it

1298
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Thank you

1299
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Right

1300
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So in this

1301
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
In this complex amount

1302
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It is a two-way arrow

1303
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
In the original simple amount

1304
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It is also a two-way arrow

1305
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That is

1306
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It can run on the model

1307
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It will fall back

1308
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But because

1309
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Because

1310
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Because if at that point

1311
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
There are a lot of road GDP

1312
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
The positive feedback will keep running

1313
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It is easy to be sucked

1314
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Hiding on the model

1315
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Ok

1316
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That

1317
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That's right

1318
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So we are in the project

1319
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Sometimes found

1320
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Indeed this system

1321
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It will indeed

1322
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
At the beginning

1323
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Several different

1324
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Peak

1325
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That is

1326
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Several different

1327
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Different blocks of road GDP

1328
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But they will compete with each other

1329
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Until the end

1330
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
There is one

1331
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That

1332
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The next question is coming

1333
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Ok

1334
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If I told him

1335
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Um

1336
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
These two road GDP

1337
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Peak

1338
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
They will definitely compete with each other

1339
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That

1340
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Then we solve it

1341
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Why only get a

1342
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
A

1343
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
A front end

1344
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Such a question

1345
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That

1346
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
In this case

1347
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Those that will grow

1348
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
How does it differ

1349
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
In the end

1350
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Under what circumstances

1351
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
These road GDPs

1352
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Peak

1353
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It will not compete

1354
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
This is my main question

1355
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And then I found

1356
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
In fact, a very simple thing

1357
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You just need to increase the length of the cell

1358
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Long enough

1359
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That is

1360
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
If it is a short cell

1361
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It will be over soon

1362
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But if it is a long cell

1363
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It actually started

1364
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It will also compete very quickly

1365
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But the competition

1366
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It seems to be competing

1367
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The speed becomes super slow

1368
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
There is no

1369
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
There will be a little competition at the beginning

1370
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So it disappeared

1371
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Just a few

1372
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
This peak and this peak disappeared

1373
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But in the end

1374
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
These four

1375
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
They seem to stay there all the time

1376
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Then it lasted

1377
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
A very long time

1378
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
it is good

1379
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That

1380
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So why is it like this

1381
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I slightly

1382
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Let me confirm

1383
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
If my understanding is not wrong

1384
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Between them

1385
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There should still be a rise

1386
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's just that it's an equilibrium

1387
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Does that mean

1388
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Of course there is a rise between each other

1389
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
That is

1390
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yes, they are actually

1391
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Still competing between each other

1392
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
The speed of that competition

1393
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Becomes very, very slow

1394
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That is, the competition at the beginning is very fast

1395
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I don't know why the competition at the end

1396
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Very slow

1397
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
If my own understanding

1398
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
According to that

1399
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
If you look at the expansion formula

1400
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Because it

1401
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Blue turns red

1402
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And red turns blue

1403
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's two-way

1404
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So if your distance is long enough

1405
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
If they each reach the local balance

1406
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Then they are the last

1407
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Those few peaks

1408
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Will not compete anymore

1409
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
because

1410
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Ah yes

1411
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I mean this

1412
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It should be like this, right

1413
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yes yes

1414
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It should be like this

1415
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
This meaning

1416
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yes

1417
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I guessed it myself

1418
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I am

1419
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Confirm

1420
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes

1421
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But according to what we said earlier

1422
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
If there are two peaks over there

1423
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
They should compete in the end

1424
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
That is

1425
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
They are right

1426
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
They are indeed

1427
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Local has reached an equilibrium

1428
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
That is to say

1429
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You will see this on top

1430
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
There is a small peak

1431
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
There will be a small

1432
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Concentration

1433
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
There will be a place

1434
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Is

1435
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's more concentrated

1436
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Then this

1437
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
This value

1438
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
On this side

1439
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's a little bit

1440
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It's a little bit

1441
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It's a little bit

1442
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's a little bit

1443
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's a little bit

1444
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
This value

1445
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
With

1446
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Its activator

1447
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
This is itself

1448
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Equal

1449
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Then this side

1450
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Equal

1451
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But under this balance

1452
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
The concentration here

1453
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Will be higher

1454
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Under this balance

1455
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The concentration here

1456
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Will be lower

1457
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Leading to

1458
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It will still compete in the end

1459
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Theoretically

1460
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
This mechanism

1461
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Should be

1462
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
How long

1463
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Still have to

1464
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Have a way

1465
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
To do

1466
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But if it looks like

1467
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
If the distance is long enough

1468
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Indeed they

1469
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The blue line

1470
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Will have a slope

1471
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So it will lead to

1472
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Flow from high

1473
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But at the same time

1474
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The orange line

1475
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Will return

1476
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Return to blue

1477
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So it's possible

1478
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The orange line

1479
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It will turn blue

1480
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Speed ​​higher than

1481
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Blue

1482
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
High place

1483
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Flow to low place

1484
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Then they will reach

1485
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
A kind of balance between each other

1486
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
A kind of balance between each other

1487
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
If the distance is long enough

1488
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
If the distance is long enough

1489
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Ah

1490
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But because

1491
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
In this system

1492
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Its blue

1493
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Its blue

1494
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Sorry

1495
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Because in this system

1496
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Its blue

1497
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Its blue

1498
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Its blue

1499
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Its blue

1500
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Its blue

1501
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Its blue

1502
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So it becomes

1503
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
The effect of blue expansion

1504
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Will

1505
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Far greater than red

1506
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Should say so

1507
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
OK

1508
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Then

1509
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Caused

1510
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Theoretically

1511
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It should run like this

1512
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yes

1513
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Theoretically it should be competitive

1514
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Then everyone wait for me

1515
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It seems that someone

1516
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Because I'm going to argue

1517
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Want to enter our house

1518
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Wait for me

1519
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Sorry

1520
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Pervert

1521
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Pervert

1522
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Ask them to come in and listen to the speech

1523
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
He is not here now

1524
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Can't hear it

1525
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
They have a speech

1526
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
They want to talk about that today

1527
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Just said

1528
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
They want to talk about Maya culture

1529
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And there is food to eat outside

1530
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Why do you think they will come in

1531
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Speaking of this

1532
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That one

1533
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Discuss a topic with everyone

1534
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
That is

1535
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We are now

1536
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Tara

1537
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That is the fund

1538
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
In fact, it can explode

1539
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That is food

1540
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
There is food

1541
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Because

1542
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Ah

1543
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
We are now with

1544
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
The education department wrote the grant

1545
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Is

1546
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It can be written up to 400 yuan at most

1547
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
But it has to be reported in time

1548
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That

1549
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That

1550
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We only buy this city now

1551
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So it actually costs more than 100 yuan

1552
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Less than 200 yuan

1553
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Then

1554
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
If everyone wants

1555
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
In fact, we think

1556
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What what

1557
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
No

1558
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
He should be talking to other people outside the door

1559
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Don't care about him

1560
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh ok

1561
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Then I will tell him quickly

1562
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Wait for me

1563
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
We are discussing another thing

1564
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So if everyone wants to say

1565
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Every time I open Tara

1566
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Buy some donuts or something

1567
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
In fact, you can

1568
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Send me some votes

1569
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Then

1570
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I will transfer this money to you

1571
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Then those votes can be used to report the education

1572
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Is the account of our project

1573
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Then everyone can

1574
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Save a little money

1575
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Every time you have a meeting

1576
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You can buy some donuts

1577
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Then you think about it

1578
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If you are interested

1579
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
We can discuss

1580
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Sorry

1581
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Then you can continue

1582
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Should

1583
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Why did you go to find other people

1584
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Correct

1585
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Correct

1586
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Where was I just now

1587
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Just now everyone is talking about

1588
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
There should be an equilibrium here

1589
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Then

1590
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
If the distance is too long

1591
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It should be said

1592
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
If the distance is long to a certain extent

1593
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Between him

1594
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Why is there an equilibrium

1595
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Actually, I don't understand

1596
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But

1597
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Let's leave it alone

1598
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Because now I think

1599
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Maybe it will be a bit difficult to explain

1600
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
why

1601
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
There will be no equilibrium

1602
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But

1603
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Actually we

1604
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
There is a way

1605
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Directly from

1606
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
This is called

1607
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Stability Analysis

1608
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That is to say

1609
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
If I look today

1610
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Two

1611
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Exactly the same

1612
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Peak

1613
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Then go to see this

1614
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Peak solution

1615
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
If there is stability in math

1616
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Will find

1617
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
He

1618
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
In fact, it will never be unstable

1619
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
He will always compete

1620
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
This is already

1621
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Is

1622
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
This is what we

1623
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Directly use math to prove

1624
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Say

1625
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
He will always compete

1626
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
This thing

1627
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Just me in this speech

1628
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I usually don't put that

1629
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Take out the math

1630
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So I hope everyone can believe me first

1631
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Say they will definitely compete

1632
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This thing

1633
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
But I know this is a bit

1634
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Excessive thing

1635
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It becomes

1636
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Everyone just have to believe me

1637
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But

1638
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But anyway

1639
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yes

1640
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Then it becomes

1641
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
This is very strange

1642
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
In the end

1643
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
If it is already mathematical proof

1644
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
He just

1645
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
He will definitely compete

1646
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
That is in the end

1647
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Is

1648
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
In the end

1649
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Why are they competing

1650
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The speed will become so slow

1651
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Later found

1652
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's like this

1653
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
That is to say

1654
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Because at first we guessed the distance

1655
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Because we are very obvious

1656
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We just made the distance longer

1657
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So we guessed the distance at first

1658
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Then I guess the distance

1659
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
They did it for about half a year

1660
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I found out later

1661
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Oh, it's not the distance

1662
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
In fact

1663
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
In fact

1664
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Will affect the most

1665
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Is the amount of protein in it

1666
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Ask us today

1667
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
If we are modeling this system

1668
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
That is to say

1669
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
If it is a small cell today

1670
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And a big cell

1671
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Then we all assume

1672
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
At the beginning

1673
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The concentration of protein in the cell

1674
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
If it's the same

1675
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Then when I put that cell

1676
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
When it gets longer

1677
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
At the same time

1678
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I also added all the protein

1679
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So if

1680
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Then

1681
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
This is the first thing

1682
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
The second thing

1683
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
The first thing is more trivial

1684
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
The second thing is to say

1685
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
We suddenly found this thing

1686
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That is

1687
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
If there was a peak

1688
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You keep stuffing protein in it

1689
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Keep stuffing protein

1690
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
The amount of protein

1691
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Damn

1692
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The amount of protein

1693
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
The mouse is gone

1694
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
If the amount of protein becomes more

1695
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
That peak will increase

1696
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
That is, it will become more

1697
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
More concentrated

1698
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But it doesn't grow to a certain extent

1699
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It just grows horizontally

1700
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
That means

1701
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It actually has a boundary

1702
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You can't go beyond that boundary

1703
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You can't grow higher than it

1704
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
The reason for this boundary is actually because

1705
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
If you are a little more familiar with this system

1706
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
If you realize this thing

1707
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
This is actually a bi-stable reaction

1708
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That is to say

1709
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
The concentration of U

1710
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
At the highest point

1711
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Is stable

1712
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Then the lowest point

1713
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Is also stable

1714
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So if it goes beyond that point

1715
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It will come back by itself

1716
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Then it stops at that point

1717
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Then this bi-stability

1718
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
This nature

1719
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It actually comes from

1720
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Every time a peak comes out

1721
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It will cause a value vacuum

1722
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Value vacuum will

1723
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The higher the peak, the more serious the value vacuum

1724
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But it can't get worse infinitely

1725
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Because it can't get negative

1726
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
So it will stop at a certain point

1727
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Then it limits

1728
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You basically can't grow that high anymore

1729
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Because it will become lower when it grows higher

1730
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
The value will not be able to support the peak

1731
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Will grow higher

1732
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Basically such a concept

1733
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
If you look at it from a mathematical point of view

1734
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
If we plot f of u, v

1735
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Assuming that this f of u, v is

1736
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
a u square b minus b u square

1737
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It is a

1738
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
As far as I know

1739
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
As far as I know

1740
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
The simplest

1741
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
This system

1742
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Polarized reactor

1743
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
a and b are a constant

1744
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Is a reaction constant

1745
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
There is time in it

1746
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Then u and v are density

1747
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
If it is such a reactor

1748
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
It actually looks like a green curve

1749
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
It's not right at first glance

1750
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
This is obviously a 2-dimensional

1751
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Why does it look like a 3-dimensional

1752
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That's because

1753
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
In

1754
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Steady-state

1755
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
How to say steady-state

1756
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
In steady-state

1757
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
d u d t is 0

1758
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So these two things

1759
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Now it becomes like this

1760
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
If you add the two things

1761
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
That f of u, v will just disappear

1762
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Then

1763
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
If f of u, v just disappears

1764
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You are on both sides at the same time

1765
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
If you do two points for x

1766
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
This thing will come out

1767
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
So the density of v and the density of u

1768
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It's actually a linear relationship

1769
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
This is actually a reaction

1770
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
This is the reaction

1771
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That is to say

1772
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
q is a constant

1773
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It's basically the level of the basal

1774
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
The density of the basal value

1775
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Then there will be one in the middle

1776
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
The vacuum of the value

1777
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
This vacuum of the value

1778
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It will actually react directly to that u

1779
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
That is

1780
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
How high is the density of the activator

1781
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
This can be solved directly

1782
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
After solving

1783
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
v is equal to this u plus q

1784
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
If you bring this in

1785
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
You will find that it is actually a three-dimensional

1786
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
This three-dimensional means

1787
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Today everyone will see this f of u, v term

1788
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Then I need a mouse now

1789
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
This f of u, v term means

1790
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
In fact, if x is u

1791
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The axis is f of u, v

1792
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Now there is no f of u, q

1793
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Because v is replaced by q

1794
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
OK

1795
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
There are two points in it

1796
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
These two points are all stable state

1797
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
That is to say

1798
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
If the density is slightly deviated

1799
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It will run this way

1800
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Then if it is slightly deviated on both sides

1801
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It will run to the middle

1802
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Then this is an unstable state

1803
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
In short, if both sides are

1804
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
When it is almost zero in density

1805
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It is directly zero in this world

1806
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
When the density is zero

1807
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It is a stable state

1808
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Then its density

1809
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
When it is in this position

1810
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It is also a stable state

1811
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So it will cause

1812
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It will cause

1813
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Your peak rose to a certain extent today

1814
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
It stops here, it will not rise anymore

1815
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
This is a stable state

1816
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The following is also a stable state

1817
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
So in such a system

1818
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
In fact, everyone will find that

1819
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
If there are two peaks today

1820
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And this big peak

1821
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It must be higher than the small peak

1822
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It will have a density gradient

1823
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Because of the relatively narrow peak

1824
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Its density here will be higher

1825
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
The higher the peak, the lower the density

1826
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But in fact, if today there are two

1827
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Different big peaks

1828
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
But it's just a wider one

1829
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
One is narrower

1830
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
If the height of the two is almost the same

1831
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
At the same time, the base density

1832
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
The height will be almost the same

1833
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
At this time, the middle one

1834
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
That density gradient

1835
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It becomes very, very small

1836
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Because the density gradient is too small

1837
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So this competition will become very, very fast

1838
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Follow up here

1839
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Have

1840
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Ok, let's assume that everyone has followed up

1841
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
If you don't follow up

1842
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You can directly accept this conclusion

1843
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
That is to say, we found out

1844
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Because

1845
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
First two things

1846
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
One thing is because there is a U peak

1847
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It will cause a V vacuum

1848
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
This vacuum can't run down infinitely

1849
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
This will definitely decide

1850
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
A peak height limit

1851
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
We call saturation point

1852
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It is saturated there

1853
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So in such a system

1854
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Saturation point must exist

1855
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
This is the first one

1856
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Then there is

1857
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
If the height of the peak

1858
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
When it is close to the saturation point

1859
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
At this time, even if the two peaks are not the same

1860
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
The competition between them

1861
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Because the density gradient is very, very small

1862
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So it becomes very, very, very slow

1863
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Except for that part

1864
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I also did this thing directly

1865
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I'm in my model

1866
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Change all the parameters I can change

1867
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Then I go

1868
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So in each one

1869
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
The two axes are different parameters

1870
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
This is the total value

1871
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Or this is the length

1872
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Or this is the reaction length

1873
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Or this is the expansion length

1874
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Can be changed

1875
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
After I changed it

1876
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I put the time between the two peaks

1877
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Plot out with color

1878
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
At the same time, I put the saturation index between them

1879
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Not the saturation index between them

1880
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
This is the peak saturation index

1881
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
The so-called saturation index

1882
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Its definition is

1883
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The closer the peak height

1884
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
The closer it is to the saturation point

1885
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Its color is more yellow

1886
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Then everyone will find

1887
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Competition time and saturation index

1888
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's almost completely correlated

1889
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
If I put the competition time

1890
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Plot in the y-axis

1891
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Then the x-axis is basically the height of the peak

1892
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I will get this dot

1893
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Every simulation here

1894
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
If you turn it into a dot

1895
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
You get a trend like this

1896
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Trend

1897
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
This trend means

1898
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
If I have two peaks competing today

1899
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
They compete very fast

1900
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So there is a group of dots here that is very fast

1901
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
In addition, there is a group of dots

1902
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It will become very, very slow

1903
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Because this curve

1904
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It basically becomes like this

1905
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It is a very dramatic switch

1906
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So it's almost a switch-like response

1907
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
As long as it protrudes a little bit

1908
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
It will become very, very slow

1909
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So today it's like a cell

1910
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It's in this state

1911
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Look at this state

1912
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Between the growing dots

1913
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Make a choice

1914
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Then we found this kind of

1915
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
In fact, it is not limited to the f of uv that I just showed

1916
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
That is, its f of uv can be replaced with various f of uv

1917
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
For example, I just used this picture

1918
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
That is to say, there are three arrows

1919
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
One up, one down, and then a positive feedback

1920
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Today we can make that positive feedback smaller

1921
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Make that positive feedback bigger

1922
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Today we can add an additional negative feedback on that positive feedback

1923
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Or we can make that positive feedback

1924
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
The positive feedback is actually

1925
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Active form to suppress the speed of its own fall

1926
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This is also another kind of positive feedback

1927
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We can change these f of uv in any way

1928
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
They will get the same conclusion in the end

1929
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That is, the more saturated the two peaks

1930
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Their competition will be slower

1931
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Then this is a switch-like response

1932
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So to make a conclusion

1933
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
First of all, if there are several clusters today

1934
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
That is, several different peaks of low-GTPS

1935
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
They will definitely compete

1936
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Then that is to say

1937
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
If these several peaks are all saturated

1938
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Their competition will be very, very slow

1939
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
If it's very, very slow

1940
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Basically in a biological system

1941
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You can almost say that they are two non-competing peaks

1942
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
They may have to spend billions of years

1943
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
To be able to compete

1944
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Then we are in the biological system

1945
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So we just think it's not going to compete

1946
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
This is part of my theory

1947
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Any questions?

1948
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Okay, if not

1949
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
The key question is actually

1950
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Whether those mathematics can be reflected

1951
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
In the biological system, right?

1952
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
At this time we did something called

1953
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Septim Mutant

1954
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
That is to say, this is also a small

1955
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I have a question

1956
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
So can I make the same conclusion

1957
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
So your experiment can't go

1958
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
That is, you can't go from the results of the experiment

1959
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
To probe

1960
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
What is the content of that big F

1961
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yes, because in fact

1962
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
My model only has U and V

1963
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Then a real model

1964
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
It actually needs more protein in it

1965
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Then I cut it into a simple form

1966
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
So in this simple form

1967
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
What should the F of U and V look like

1968
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
In fact, it's hard for me to say

1969
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But I just said a very important point

1970
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
No matter what form the F of U and V looks like

1971
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It doesn't matter

1972
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
The point is that no matter what form it looks like

1973
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
They will actually compete

1974
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And they will switch to non-competing

1975
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Because I think you will compete

1976
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Then it will reach the Global Equilibrium

1977
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
The biggest reason is

1978
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
If you go back to the front

1979
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
That partial T U is equal to big D

1980
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Then that is partial partial U plus F

1981
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Then the other one is minus F

1982
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
In fact, if you add the first line and the second line

1983
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Then you can get rid of F

1984
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And your big F doesn't depend on T or X

1985
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So you can just get rid of it

1986
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
So the whole Global Dynamics

1987
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It's only related to U, V, X, T

1988
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It has nothing to do with F itself

1989
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So from here, can I conclude

1990
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
In fact, from this equation

1991
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Theoretically, it shouldn't have anything to do with the connotation of F

1992
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Because it's an elliptical equation

1993
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I just spent an hour talking about this

1994
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
That's right

1995
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
OK

1996
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
OK

1997
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
OK

1998
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I just have

1999
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
OK

2000
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
So

2001
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So your experiment will focus on

2002
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Is

2003
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
It's a bit like the diffusion itself

2004
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Can this be verified

2005
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Instead of F

2006
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
You can test the content of F

2007
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Is that right?

2008
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I don't want to test what the content of F is

2009
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
OK

2010
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But if what I just inferred is right

2011
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
No matter what the content of F is

2012
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
First of all

2013
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
A system

2014
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
If they peak

2015
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
They can compete at the beginning

2016
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
But they may become a

2017
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Can't compete

2018
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It's a very, very slow competition

2019
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
This

2020
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
This

2021
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Then this will depend on a saturation point

2022
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Then I have to prove that the saturation point exists

2023
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So this is what experiments need to test

2024
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
OK, I see

2025
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
OK

2026
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
OK

2027
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Thank you

2028
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I have always

2029
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Who else just now

2030
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Is it

2031
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I have always wondered about the so-called competition

2032
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
This word

2033
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Because from your equation

2034
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Your

2035
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Your source term is that F

2036
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It doesn't have time

2037
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It doesn't have time to be its

2038
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
What do you call it?

2039
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Self-variable

2040
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
So this is an elliptical equation

2041
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Then it's only related to the boundary conditions

2042
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It will always reach a

2043
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Steady state solution

2044
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So just now your data proved

2045
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It will eventually have a

2046
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Steady state

2047
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
That is, a stable solution

2048
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
That has a stable solution

2049
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It means that it won't change at any time

2050
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That won't change at any time

2051
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It means that

2052
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
There will be no so-called competition between them

2053
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Relationship

2054
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So I have always been

2055
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I can't understand why

2056
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Math can prove

2057
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
They will have a competition

2058
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Because there is a competition

2059
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Because

2060
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Can I interrupt you first?

2061
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
OK

2062
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
So that's it

2063
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Today

2064
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But indeed

2065
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It can reach a

2066
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Stable state

2067
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
That is, the steady state solution

2068
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It may have two peaks

2069
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Right

2070
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
But that doesn't mean

2071
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
That steady state solution is stable

2072
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So this solution

2073
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It may be

2074
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Noise in any cell

2075
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Just

2076
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Get a bigger one

2077
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
A smaller one

2078
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
If it is unstable

2079
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
This situation will make them compete

2080
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Then

2081
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Let it from a

2082
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Two-peak steady state solution

2083
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Becomes only one-peak steady state solution

2084
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Because there is only one

2085
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Steady state means

2086
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
It won't change at any time

2087
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Yes

2088
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Steady state means

2089
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It won't change at any time

2090
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But if you leave the steady state

2091
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It may go to another steady state

2092
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
At this time we will say

2093
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
The original steady state is unstable

2094
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
So this deviation

2095
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Must be in

2096
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Initial condition

2097
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It appeared

2098
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It can't say that this system is halfway

2099
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It reached

2100
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
The current system reached the steady state

2101
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Then you have to say

2102
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It has a noise

2103
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Caused it to go to another place

2104
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Because when you have this noise

2105
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
When it appears

2106
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Your system is completely different

2107
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Yes yes

2108
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
This system is different

2109
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
So

2110
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So you can't use

2111
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
When I wrote this system

2112
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I should add a noise term later

2113
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
That's right

2114
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Because in the cell

2115
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Noise is something that exists at any time

2116
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
But if

2117
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Your source term

2118
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Source term should not only be f

2119
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Then uv

2120
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Should be f, uv

2121
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Then there is a time t

2122
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Then this system

2123
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
May be a noise of time

2124
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It doesn't have to be a noise of time

2125
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
That noise term doesn't need to be a noise of time

2126
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh

2127
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Just turn it into a snow machine

2128
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It will be in

2129
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
It's a snow machine

2130
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Take data

2131
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
You are in your take data

2132
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Throughout the history

2133
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
There will be a moment suddenly

2134
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
There will be a moment suddenly

2135
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
There will be fluctuation

2136
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I think that's what that t means

2137
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Yes

2138
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So actually I think

2139
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I probably know what you two are going to say

2140
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
In fact, that is to say

2141
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
If you just look at this value

2142
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It will actually reach the equilibrium at the end

2143
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Regardless of the equilibrium

2144
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
That is

2145
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Is stable or unstable

2146
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It just shouldn't change

2147
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But if there is a fluctuation

2148
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
It may suddenly fluctuate

2149
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Then put the unstable equilibrium

2150
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
The whole is biased to another place

2151
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
But this

2152
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
This fluctuation should actually be written

2153
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
There is a t in that F

2154
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But you didn't write it now

2155
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I think that's what it means

2156
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Yes

2157
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I understand what you are talking about

2158
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Theoretically, that's right

2159
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But anyway

2160
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Because I am now

2161
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Just because it's simple

2162
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I didn't write that noise term

2163
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
But if

2164
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
If its initial condition is noise

2165
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
In fact, it won't really run to two peaks

2166
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Stay

2167
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That is

2168
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Like this

2169
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It's just that there is noise

2170
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
It won't grow two exactly the same peaks

2171
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Then as long as they are two

2172
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
These two peaks are a bit different

2173
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
They will definitely compete

2174
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
The only stable or steady state at the end

2175
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I can understand what you want to say

2176
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
But what I want to say is that this picture

2177
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Can't represent what you want to say

2178
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Because this picture only shows

2179
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Its solution has not yet reached

2180
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Steady state

2181
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But I understand what you mean

2182
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I know

2183
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yes

2184
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It did not reach the steady state at the beginning

2185
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
If you put the steady state at the beginning

2186
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
It won't

2187
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It will be stuck there

2188
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Then you have to give it a little bit of noise

2189
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It can only run to one

2190
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
So what I mean is that this picture

2191
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
There is no way to explain what you are talking about

2192
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
But I can understand what you want to say

2193
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Sorry

2194
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Because I am doing the value simulation

2195
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So I have always been

2196
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Strange

2197
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
That

2198
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Some strange

2199
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Yes

2200
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
What we do is to solve

2201
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Solve two peaks

2202
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Then solve a peak

2203
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Then

2204
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Prove that the two peaks are not stable

2205
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
In this case

2206
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Once we know that the two peaks are not stable

2207
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
In fact, when we run the simulation

2208
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Even if the solution is there

2209
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
The simulation will not run to that solution

2210
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It is not an attractor

2211
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It will run to the stable

2212
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Steady state solution

2213
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
So they almost never really go

2214
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Unstable solution

2215
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
From a mathematical point of view

2216
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It will definitely

2217
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
It's what you just said

2218
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Put two peaks, one peak

2219
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
As long as there is no noise

2220
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Your equation is always that group

2221
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Then its source term noise is exactly the same

2222
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
It will definitely become the same solution

2223
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Because it is an elliptical equation

2224
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
In terms of numbers, that's another problem

2225
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Because you can't prove

2226
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
The numerical method you use

2227
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
No numerical

2228
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Numerical noise

2229
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Because I just mentioned it

2230
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Ok that's it

2231
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I think

2232
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
The simulation I just showed

2233
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
The main noise term

2234
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Is my initial condition

2235
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Sorry, let me wipe it

2236
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
How many more in your head

2237
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I just said

2238
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
7.30 right

2239
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Yes

2240
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And 1, 2, 3, 4

2241
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
But there are a lot of animations here

2242
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Otherwise I can walk faster

2243
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Then basically

2244
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I want everyone to watch the movie

2245
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Then

2246
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Otherwise we are like this

2247
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
You finish it first

2248
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
If we have time at the end, let's ask questions together

2249
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Thank you all

2250
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Deal

2251
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Ok

2252
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
So now the situation is

2253
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I want to see in the game

2254
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Can really see this

2255
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Is

2256
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Composition from fast to slow

2257
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
So it can grow two buds

2258
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
First of all, we do one thing

2259
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
When we were simulating

2260
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Let the composition

2261
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
From fast to slow

2262
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
The fastest way is to put that

2263
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
The distance is long, right

2264
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So now we make a longer cell

2265
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
This longer cell

2266
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
What actually happens is

2267
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
A real yeast

2268
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You should see two cells in the picture

2269
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Is a large cell

2270
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
After the small cell

2271
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
They will break

2272
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
They are now broken

2273
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But after that

2274
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I let one of its proteins

2275
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Is responsible for breaking it

2276
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
This protein is basically

2277
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Very unstable at 37 degrees

2278
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
But stable at 24 degrees

2279
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So that protein

2280
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It is invalid

2281
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
The result is that it can't be separated

2282
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
The result is like this

2283
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
You can look at the top cell first

2284
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It first grew a tooth

2285
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
At this time, only one tooth grew

2286
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
At this time, two teeth grew

2287
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
At this time, two teeth grew

2288
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
OK

2289
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
The following one

2290
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It grew a tooth

2291
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
It grew a tooth

2292
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
It grew a tooth

2293
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It grew three teeth

2294
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
It grew three teeth

2295
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
At this time, we can almost guess

2296
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
When it only grows one tooth

2297
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Because it's not broken here

2298
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So its entire cell is all connected

2299
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
It obviously has two

2300
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It looks like a cell, but it's not broken

2301
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
But at this time, it only grew a tooth

2302
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
We can almost be sure that

2303
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
This is probably what we did before

2304
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But it grew to a certain length

2305
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
But it found that it would grow a lot at this time

2306
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
But it found that it would grow a lot at this time

2307
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
But it found that it would grow a lot at this time

2308
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
If we use the same method

2309
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Let's go inside

2310
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
The one I just talked about

2311
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Is that the protein emits a silver light

2312
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
You'll see

2313
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
For example, let's say this one

2314
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
This cell cycle is over

2315
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It seems to be happening too fast

2316
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It stopped growing

2317
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
At this time, a bunch of them would grow at the beginning

2318
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
A few of them disappeared

2319
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Only these two remain

2320
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
After these two remain, they no longer compete

2321
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Then it becomes two teeth

2322
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
At the same time, there are many of them growing at the same time

2323
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
At the same time, there are many of them growing at the same time

2324
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
But in the end, these two compete

2325
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
So it only grows one

2326
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
This is the same situation

2327
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So we see that in the same group of cells

2328
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So we see that in the same group of cells

2329
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
There are a bunch of cells here

2330
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And each cell actually

2331
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Some of them will grow on both sides

2332
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Some of them will grow on one side

2333
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
In a population

2334
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
About 65% of the population

2335
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It will grow two teeth

2336
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It looks like

2337
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I ran out of the previous solution

2338
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
At the beginning, many different peaks came out

2339
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Then the small peak was quickly competed

2340
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
After the big peak stayed

2341
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
The competition became very slow

2342
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Then they will move forward

2343
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Then there are about 65% of the cells

2344
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
It's two teeth

2345
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
If I just said

2346
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
The conclusion of the mathematical side is correct

2347
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
If we put the whole system

2348
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
If the amount of protein in the system is adjusted

2349
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Then my peak should be from saturated

2350
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It's not saturated

2351
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So it has to go from compete very slowly to compete very quickly

2352
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Right?

2353
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Then we should see less

2354
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Two-button cells

2355
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So what we do is

2356
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
We are now comparing

2357
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
The first bar is wild type

2358
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Except

2359
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Normal, non-separable yeast

2360
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Then the second bar is

2361
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Normal yeast

2362
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
But it's inside

2363
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
That red or blue guy

2364
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
It only has half the amount

2365
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Then the third bar is

2366
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
The yellow guy inside

2367
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
The yellow protein has only half the amount

2368
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Then the fourth bar is

2369
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Both red and yellow have only half the amount

2370
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Then

2371
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
The last bar is

2372
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
All proteins in this cell have only half the amount

2373
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Then when we do this comparison

2374
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
We found that

2375
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
The more protein

2376
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
It will have more cells

2377
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
On both sides

2378
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Then the less protein

2379
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
The less population

2380
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It grows on both sides

2381
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
This means

2382
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
This is pretty much

2383
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
In line with our experiment

2384
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Our theory

2385
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Then

2386
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
But then people will say

2387
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Maybe it's not a matter of distance

2388
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Maybe it's not a matter of protein quality

2389
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Maybe the distance plays a bigger role

2390
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Like you see the cell on the left

2391
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Is it longer

2392
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
So it's slower

2393
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Because

2394
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Because of the spread

2395
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Because the longer the distance, the slower the spread

2396
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Then it will be more unbalanced

2397
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
This is another assumption

2398
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
But we found

2399
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
If we go to the two-body cell and the one-body cell

2400
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Then measure the length of their cells

2401
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Then we found that they didn't have much difference

2402
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
So this time I put this alternative hypothesis

2403
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Rejected

2404
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
My own hypothesis is better

2405
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Then another hypothesis

2406
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Is a mathematical hypothesis

2407
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I said you talked so much math in front

2408
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
It's really a bit boring

2409
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Because in fact we don't need this math

2410
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
To explain this

2411
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Today if our competition process

2412
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Is a peak to put another peak

2413
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
To compete

2414
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
That is to suck dry

2415
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Let's say we have two peaks today

2416
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
They don't need to saturate

2417
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Then these two peaks are higher

2418
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
But there are more things inside

2419
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
So it takes longer to suck dry

2420
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
So if we are

2421
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Fixed at a certain time

2422
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
It's going to start growing

2423
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
At that time it will start to grow two

2424
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
See, you don't need a saturation

2425
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Such an explanation

2426
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Then I want to reject this hypothesis

2427
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
So I did this

2428
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
In fact, in a math system

2429
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
In addition to the positive feedback I just mentioned

2430
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It actually has a negative feedback

2431
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
In a normal system

2432
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
It still has a negative feedback

2433
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
In the model

2434
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
If we remove this negative feedback

2435
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
It will increase the saturation point

2436
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
The result of increasing the saturation point

2437
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
That is to say

2438
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
If the original amount of protein

2439
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Is the same

2440
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
If you just increase the saturation point

2441
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
At this time it will become less saturated

2442
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
At this time it should

2443
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Compete faster

2444
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Because it's sharper

2445
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So it depends on

2446
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
In the actual cells

2447
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
If you remove this negative feedback

2448
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Is it like we thought

2449
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
It will become faster

2450
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
We found that

2451
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
This cell

2452
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It is less saturated

2453
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I'll close the door

2454
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
In this state

2455
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
We found

2456
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
In fact, if we compare

2457
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
These two genes

2458
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
There is a negative feedback

2459
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
If there is no negative feedback

2460
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
In fact, there is a negative feedback

2461
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It is

2462
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
The amount of protein in the patch

2463
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Is relatively small

2464
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
But even so, it still looks like it competes slower

2465
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Such a phenomenon

2466
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
With my alternative hypothesis

2467
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I didn't explain it

2468
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So I rejected this alternative hypothesis

2469
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Okay

2470
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
So far

2471
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
The experiments I have done

2472
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
It seems to be quite

2473
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
It seems to be quite

2474
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
In line with my math

2475
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
The hypothesis

2476
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Instead of other possible hypotheses

2477
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
So we got

2478
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
To sum up

2479
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Three conclusions

2480
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
One is

2481
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
When I make the pathogen

2482
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Longer

2483
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It will become more

2484
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Its competition

2485
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
The competition between the low-GTPS

2486
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It will become slower

2487
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So it becomes

2488
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It can increase by 2.5

2489
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Or even 3.5 or more

2490
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
This is quite in line with my model

2491
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Then again

2492
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
The saturation point can be moved

2493
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
If we can move the saturation point

2494
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
It means that basically

2495
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
We can support the saturation point

2496
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
In addition to the saturation point

2497
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
In addition to this hypothesis

2498
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I can't think of any other hypothesis

2499
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
To explain my last data

2500
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
So I will end it here

2501
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I am basically in a lab of the military

2502
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And everyone is doing experiments

2503
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
So on the left

2504
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
This is my teacher

2505
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
This is my senior

2506
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
She has gone to Boston

2507
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
They are doing experiments

2508
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
This group is mathematicians

2509
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I can't write the proof

2510
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
The proof part

2511
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
These two guys wrote it for me

2512
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Thank you very much

2513
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I don't know how to write the proof

2514
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
The following is my experiment

2515
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Thank you

2516
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Before entering Q&A

2517
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Because our time is late

2518
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
So if you have any questions

2519
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
You can leave

2520
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
No need to force

2521
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
In the dialogue room

2522
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I will post it again

2523
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
There is a feedback form

2524
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
You can fill in this video

2525
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Today

2526
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I am the host

2527
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
How is the meeting

2528
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Then the quality of the connection

2529
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Then the quality of the speech

2530
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And so on

2531
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Then if you are interested in

2532
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
The research of Jiangen

2533
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You can leave a message to him

2534
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Then I will help you forward it to Jiangen

2535
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
If you want to

2536
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Leave your contact information

2537
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Then discuss it in depth

2538
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Then I will put it in the dialogue box

2539
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Everyone can please click

2540
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
If you don't have any special

2541
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
If you have any comments, please click

2542
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Because this information

2543
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
We will apply for all kinds

2544
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
This

2545
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Support or

2546
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That proposal

2547
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
May use my data

2548
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Thank you for your help

2549
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Do you have any questions?

2550
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
You can ask directly

2551
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Thank you for the chat box

2552
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Because I just

2553
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Can't see the chat box

2554
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Let me ask first

2555
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Is

2556
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Does anyone take this model

2557
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
To study social phenomena

2558
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Because I always feel

2559
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
If we take the cell membrane

2560
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
As the territory of the United States

2561
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Then you use red and blue lines

2562
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Then this matter recently

2563
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Red and blue

2564
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And you see

2565
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
What is mentioned in the video

2566
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Including

2567
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Basically not

2568
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Protein

2569
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Think of it as a person

2570
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Or something

2571
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Such a model

2572
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Can be used to simulate

2573
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Or predict social phenomena

2574
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Do you know anyone doing this?

2575
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
What I know is

2576
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
First of all, I will talk about the limit

2577
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
That limit is first

2578
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I didn't model any highway

2579
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Or flying

2580
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
So that diffusion

2581
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Basically

2582
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
In real life

2583
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Will be defeated by a lot of this kind of fast transportation

2584
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
So he can't

2585
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Model a lot of things

2586
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
At least in today's society

2587
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I know someone doing

2588
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Turing pattern

2589
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Research on social science

2590
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Is about crime

2591
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
More like in a local

2592
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Little city

2593
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Which point

2594
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
For example

2595
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
For example

2596
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
A certain area in downtown

2597
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Then it is easy to produce criminals

2598
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Then the criminals will assume

2599
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Can spread out

2600
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But at the same time there is another group of people outside

2601
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
For example

2602
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I don't know if he is a policeman

2603
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Or a resident who is not a criminal

2604
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
He can be a witness

2605
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Anyway, he is in the model

2606
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Dynamics between the two

2607
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
He will have unknown changes at the same time

2608
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Then there are some

2609
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Criminals and witnesses

2610
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
These interactions between the police

2611
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Some are like this

2612
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But in fact we have seen a lot

2613
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Purely with a

2614
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Deterministic

2615
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Model

2616
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I haven't seen a lot

2617
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Or at least

2618
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Because I'm looking

2619
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
This is related to Turing pattern

2620
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Then I haven't seen a lot

2621
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Maybe a lot is related to Turing pattern

2622
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Ok very cool

2623
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Thank you everyone

2624
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I want to confirm

2625
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
My understanding

2626
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
This model

2627
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
The most important thing should be

2628
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Between two species

2629
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
The rate of spread is very large

2630
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
This is the first point

2631
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
The second point is

2632
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Because

2633
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
In theory, this model should be

2634
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
In the chemical field

2635
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Their molecular

2636
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Spreading

2637
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Between two different chemical substances

2638
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Then they

2639
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I am more curious about why

2640
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Their chemical

2641
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Expansion

2642
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Did not mention any

2643
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So-called Turing

2644
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Turing

2645
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
How do you say it in English?

2646
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Because Turing

2647
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
At the beginning of this

2648
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
His imagined activator and substrate

2649
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Are chemical reagents

2650
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Then he imagined

2651
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
In fact, this application is a lot

2652
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
In the case of non-living things

2653
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Someone even found some chemical reactions

2654
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
One is Diffuse slower

2655
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
One is Diffuse faster

2656
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Of course they will have a rate of spread

2657
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
So it won't be

2658
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It won't be mass conserved

2659
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
They really have a way to

2660
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Add chemical reactions

2661
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Then he really ran out of dots

2662
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
So do a lot in chemical reactions

2663
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So you have seen paper

2664
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Is the real world

2665
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Chemical substances will produce

2666
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
What is this called?

2667
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Turing pattern

2668
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Turing pattern

2669
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Is there such a thing in the real world?

2670
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Yes

2671
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Can work hard to give you

2672
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I haven't seen those for a long time

2673
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Because now it's chemical compounds

2674
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
But you really are in a

2675
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Cultivator

2676
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Then you add a certain substance and another substance

2677
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Then they ran out of dots

2678
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I remember

2679
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Is there anyone

2680
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Is there anyone studying that cat?

2681
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Dog? What animal pattern?

2682
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Yes

2683
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That's more of a guess

2684
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Because if it is a chemical substance

2685
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
What is your chemical substance

2686
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
What is their reaction rate

2687
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
All measured

2688
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
So that model

2689
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
How to write

2690
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
But if it's in cats and dogs

2691
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
We still

2692
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
As far as I know

2693
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
We don't know

2694
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Which one

2695
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Which one

2696
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Or

2697
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
There is another

2698
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
This is actually a more common

2699
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
One is

2700
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But

2701
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It will inhibit

2702
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Even so

2703
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I can't find which one is the key

2704
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Which one is the key

2705
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Because there are too many molecules in the body

2706
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So I don't know

2707
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
But they will point out

2708
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Look at the pattern of the cat

2709
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
It's exactly the same

2710
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It must be like this

2711
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Mechanism

2712
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
But no one really found that chemical substance

2713
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Even if you find that chemical substance

2714
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
You have to write that thing

2715
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
It is usually necessary to go through a lot of

2716
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Simplification

2717
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Because in the body

2718
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Any other questions

2719
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I have one

2720
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Common

2721
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I think

2722
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
For example, like Zhang Yanping just asked

2723
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Say that in social science

2724
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Or

2725
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Social psychology

2726
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Is there a way to use such a model

2727
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Go

2728
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Do research

2729
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Then, for example, he used one here

2730
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
A model like diffusion

2731
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Then someone just asked

2732
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
That's it

2733
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
At the beginning

2734
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
When he proposed such a model

2735
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
He is actually in chemistry

2736
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That is to say

2737
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
But I myself

2738
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
From the point of view of physics

2739
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I think

2740
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
These are just

2741
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It's called effective model

2742
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It's not really

2743
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I think you can't

2744
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
You have such a mathematical model

2745
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Then

2746
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
To get data is the same

2747
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Then he interpreted this

2748
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Interaction

2749
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
What is the nature of this system

2750
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Because

2751
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
For example

2752
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Just

2753
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I think he just means

2754
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You have a quantity

2755
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Then it changes over time

2756
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
It's a certain

2757
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
He to another variable

2758
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
How many times

2759
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
You can actually write a super long

2760
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
That is to say

2761
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
You write super long

2762
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Then see which one comes out

2763
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Is the most like

2764
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
But in fact, in chemistry

2765
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
For example, in chemistry

2766
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
The range of the equation

2767
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
At least

2768
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
That is to say

2769
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
The size of the molecule

2770
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Otherwise you enter a completely different

2771
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Then you are different

2772
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
So I think it's just

2773
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Effective model

2774
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Uh

2775
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Yeah, so we actually hate it

2776
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
In fact, there are a lot of models

2777
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Will do this thing

2778
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Uh

2779
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
In fact, like the original

2780
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
It's the same

2781
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
There is a

2782
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
There is a mechanism

2783
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It will grow

2784
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Just

2785
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
In physics

2786
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
It's the same

2787
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
But it doesn't mean

2788
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
The mechanism of the original model

2789
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
It's exactly the same

2790
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And indeed I told you today

2791
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
This model is also a very

2792
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Very simplified

2793
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
But there is actually a basis

2794
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
That is to say

2795
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
That's why I'm so happy to play with it

2796
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Because in fact

2797
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
In terms of Helmholtz

2798
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Of course, this is also simplified

2799
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
But in terms of Helmholtz

2800
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
We know the molecule

2801
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
In terms of

2802
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I can write a model

2803
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
On the membrane

2804
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
In the cytoplasm

2805
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And then

2806
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
On the membrane

2807
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And then this scaffold

2808
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And this circle

2809
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
And then they all have that protein

2810
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And if you kill one of the proteins

2811
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It really won't polarize

2812
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
So these are all genetic data

2813
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
In fact, it is very likely

2814
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
There are a lot of data

2815
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
This kind of circuit operation

2816
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
But if I want to write this out

2817
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

2818
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
7

2819
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
No, it's actually

2820
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
8

2821
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Diffusion equation

2822
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
System

2823
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Then it's hard to study

2824
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
But someone

2825
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
After this simplification

2826
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
It can go through some state-by-state assumptions

2827
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Then get one

2828
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
This kind of simplified

2829
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So there is a theory

2830
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
It's not entirely

2831
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I ran out of a model today

2832
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Then this model just

2833
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
It's just

2834
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
The appearance of the creature

2835
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
So we think that model is wrong

2836
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I think this kind of model is

2837
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
This is

2838
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Overclaiming the model

2839
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Can do things

2840
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I totally agree with what you just said

2841
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
But so we will pay attention

2842
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
We actually

2843
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Is that molecular mechanism a Turing mechanism?

2844
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Then we think it is

2845
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Because there are other creatures

2846
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Supporting it

2847
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
If today I am directly using the mechanism

2848
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Piled up

2849
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Then this model

2850
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
There is a way to see me in the creature

2851
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
The phenomenon is the same

2852
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I didn't give it a direct assumption

2853
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
You should look like a Turing mechanism

2854
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
When my model is 8

2855
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
When molecules

2856
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
It can't tell it's a Turing

2857
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
But it looks like a Turing

2858
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I'm more confident at this time

2859
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I think

2860
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
It should be said

2861
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I don't know what the person who just asked

2862
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
But my understanding

2863
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
It should be what he wants to ask

2864
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
You this model

2865
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
What you are doing now is that you assume

2866
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Use a very logical way to infer a model

2867
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Then find this model

2868
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Results with your research data

2869
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Can

2870
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Match your research data

2871
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
But such a conclusion

2872
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
There is no way to prove

2873
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Your model is really

2874
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
The mechanism of this real world

2875
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
You can only say your model

2876
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It's just a model

2877
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
It's not any law

2878
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
The question I asked just now

2879
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
My understanding is like this

2880
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I don't know if it's right

2881
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
My understanding is the same

2882
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
But the problem is

2883
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I can understand

2884
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
If you have a model today

2885
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Then you can use it to infer

2886
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Then you can infer a result

2887
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Then it's the same as the phenomenon

2888
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
This does not explain

2889
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
How things actually happen

2890
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
For example, I use a more familiar example

2891
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Even if I can model today

2892
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
On Facebook

2893
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
This

2894
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
How to diffuse

2895
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Then how it is

2896
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Between Racism and Anti-Racism

2897
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Make adjustments

2898
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
For this process

2899
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I can go to model this phenomenon

2900
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Then there is also effect

2901
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
But this does not explain

2902
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I can understand that this does not explain

2903
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Then I am on Facebook

2904
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
How to influence another user

2905
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Pull it to me

2906
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
This is not the case

2907
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
But conversely

2908
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
If I can't make a reasonable statement at the beginning

2909
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Say

2910
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
On Facebook

2911
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Interaction with people

2912
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Satisfy diffusion

2913
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I won't set this model at the beginning

2914
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Because you are blind

2915
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I want to set it up

2916
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I don't believe anyone sets it up like this

2917
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Like when I first started

2918
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Really

2919
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Really

2920
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Many models do this

2921
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
There are so many physics

2922
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
No one talks about it

2923
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
May be this mechanism

2924
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
We have a lot of people here

2925
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Models mess up

2926
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Sometimes I hate it

2927
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Models mess up

2928
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Make us famous

2929
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
But I want to talk about

2930
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
At the beginning

2931
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
When using this model

2932
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
He also said first

2933
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
We actually have a protein here

2934
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
It looks like it can satisfy

2935
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
This model

2936
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
The assumption at the beginning

2937
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Or the description of that

2938
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Only use it

2939
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
So I don't think

2940
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
In the case of Jenkins

2941
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
There is a big problem

2942
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Of course I don't think

2943
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
You have this problem

2944
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I don't think he meant it

2945
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
But

2946
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I think I understand what he said

2947
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I think

2948
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Because my model

2949
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
There are some mechanistic bases

2950
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
There are some

2951
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Data

2952
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Is to support

2953
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
These chemical reactions

2954
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
These chemical reactions

2955
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So I'm more confident about my model

2956
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
But even so

2957
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Anyway, I can't say

2958
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
That model itself

2959
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Is what actually happened

2960
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I totally agree with this sentence

2961
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
But actually from a more scientific

2962
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
If you think about it

2963
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Which model

2964
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
All models are false

2965
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
He must have gone through some simplifications

2966
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
At least he went through some simplifications

2967
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
In fact

2968
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Even when we

2969
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Understand any system

2970
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
The truth we understand

2971
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
It's not a truth

2972
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
All the theories we understand

2973
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It's not the truth

2974
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And we don't know

2975
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
There is no way to know

2976
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
The theory we understand is the truth

2977
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
There is no way to verify

2978
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Or

2979
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Yes

2980
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
First of all

2981
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
There is no way to verify

2982
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
And it's very hard to deny

2983
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
What we can do

2984
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Like what I was trying to do

2985
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I have a model today

2986
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Or I have a theory

2987
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
If there is only one theory

2988
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
It's hard for me to know

2989
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Is it right

2990
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
For example, God created man

2991
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
It's hard for me to know

2992
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
But if I have another theory

2993
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
For example, this theory

2994
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Explaining other phenomena is better than this

2995
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Or this theory

2996
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
There is a way

2997
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
This theory is easy to be denied

2998
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
We need to compare two theories

2999
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
The advantages between them

3000
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
We have a way to

3001
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
To be more realistic

3002
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It should look like this

3003
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
In the process

3004
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Of course there is no theory

3005
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
It's real

3006
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
We can only try to be as realistic as possible

3007
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
The process of being realistic

3008
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
We try to compare different theories

3009
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Put the bad theory aside

3010
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Then compare with a different theory

3011
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Then put the bad theory aside

3012
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Then try to be realistic in this process

3013
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
But our theory will never be true

3014
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I think it's totally fine

3015
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Because when you say

3016
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
You are a model

3017
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
It has already shown that it is such a thing

3018
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Because if you are from

3019
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Applied mathematics

3020
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Model, theorem, law

3021
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
These all represent different things

3022
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
So if you use the definition of people

3023
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
In the field of applied mathematics

3024
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
When you say it is a model

3025
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
In fact, people in the field of applied mathematics

3026
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
They won't care about

3027
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
The mechanism behind the model

3028
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
They will only ask

3029
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
You have a model, you have done validation

3030
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
You have done verification

3031
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Then this model is

3032
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
A reasonable model

3033
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
As for whether this model

3034
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Represents physics or the real world

3035
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
In fact, from the point of view of applied mathematics

3036
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
It's not that important

3037
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Because since you already call it a model

3038
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
It means that as long as it works

3039
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
That's it

3040
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
But we still try our best

3041
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I hope our model can explain

3042
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Is to be as realistic as possible

3043
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Because we

3044
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
After all, in the end, we want to solve the problem of life

3045
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
OK

3046
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
OK

3047
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
We don't have much time, is there any question?

3048
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
OK, just say it

3049
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Yeah, no, because

3050
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I may have to leave at half past five

3051
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I need to leave and prepare

3052
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
For the audience

3053
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Thank you very much for your support today

3054
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Thank you very much for your questions

3055
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I'm sorry it's a bit of a drag

3056
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I hope this cross-field research

3057
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Although it is cross-field

3058
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Because for me, cross-field

3059
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
We are always stuck in different areas

3060
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
In different areas

3061
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Our only advantage is that we can

3062
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Talk to people in different areas

3063
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Then I hope this video

3064
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Today's speech has a little bit with

3065
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Have conversations in different areas

3066
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Everyone can understand what I'm talking about

3067
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Then

3068
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Put this idea together a little bit

3069
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Be able to do something

3070
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Then I think this is pretty good today

3071
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Thank you very much

3072
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Thank you, Jian, very, very cool

3073
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Very wonderful

3074
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Thank you all again, bye
