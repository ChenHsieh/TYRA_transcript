1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Wow, you should be able to see the screen now.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm starting to record now.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I can see it now.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In 2011, I started, I worked on several projects before I joined Professor Citrin's lab in 2014.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And mainly we have been focusing on two types of optics, two types of phenomena in optics.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Basically, nonlinear optics and quantum optics.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So this is my talk is arranged.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll first introduce my outline, why we care about this study and why we want to do this research.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then I'm going to move on to two other setups.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
One is a semiconductor laser with feedback.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And I'm going to introduce the setup and one of the applications that we have been working on last two years.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The next I'm going to discuss a single photon emitters as we are now capable of generating one single photon at a time.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And we're going to discuss when we place a single photon emitter in front of mirror with feedback, with time delay feedback,

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
but complex or maybe complex phenomena we are hoping to observe.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I'll just start with very, very basic discussions.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So this is a most fundamental feedback system.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's very general use in maybe like mechanical engineering.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
When people study about the control theory, when they place a signal in front of anything,

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and then use the measurement result to feed it back into the system and see what's the phenomena they will observe.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Most of people want to control them.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And this is a big deal in control theory when they try to study this dynamical systems.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So here we see like very, I try to reduce the amount of equation that I have.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is the most simple equations.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is equation of motions.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So equation of motions, instead of just the original experimental parameters,

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
there could be because we have feedback.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So we'll have the delay time.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We have the feedback strength or other things included in the study of the equation of motions.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So this could be applying optics.

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
On these slides, I show two different setups for optics.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:10,000
One on the left is an integrated photonic circuit included inside this small optical electronic component.

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So basically they generate the photon within the wave intensity to generate random numbers.

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So I'll discuss this in more detail later.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But it's a well-studied system.

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
People can use it to generate entropies and or other entropy source.

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So the one on the right is a very similar setup.

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you imagine the semiconductor laser, a laser diode is now replaced with a single photon emitters.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So if here anyone know about laser, you could imagine it's a cavity.

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And then you have a luminant source within the cavity and generate lights.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And when the cavity has the same wavelength or they have the wavelength couples to this quantum dot.

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Actually, this is a quantum dot in the system.

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They could able to generate very high, very pure and very identical indistinguishable photons once at a time.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And we're now interested in placing this single photon emitter in front of a mirror.

44
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And study how we can, how we are able to control it.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And or maybe we cannot control it.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And this will see very interesting dynamics.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So this, so I began with the semiconductor with feedback.

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is this system where typically we'll call this external cavity semiconductor laser.

49
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The system is shown on the right.

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We have a laser.

51
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We place it in front of the mirror.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And we found a simple but I think quite clever way to control this feedback strength feeding back into the laser.

53
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then we can measure the intensity using just a high speed photodiode.

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And while doing this, we're also measuring the voltage with the intensity.

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So in here we see the external cavity length.

56
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So that's another critical parameters in our study.

57
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So that length, well, two times of this length divided by C is the delay time, which we'll discuss later in this slide in the presentations.

58
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, so this is the theory describing the external cavity semiconductor laser.

59
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Basically it's, well, obviously it's called, it's developed by Len and Kobayashi, these two guys.

60
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We basically describe the system with three parameters.

61
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We have electric field.

62
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have optical phase when it's entering the, when the feedback light is entering semiconductors.

63
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And we have the carriers or carrier numbers, which related to voltage measurement as I described in the previous slides.

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So, in this system, there are, so we have, so basically with this model, we can, we have the three equations of motions.

65
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And typically when people study nonlinear dynamics, people will study the behavior near the equilibrium point or in near, well, yes.

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And in our case, it's called external cavity mode.

67
00:08:40,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Basically, when you set this three equations to zero, then you're able to solve a set of solutions that it's stable, or it's just equilibrium, it's equals to zero.

68
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So as I mentioned, we have the external cavity frequency.

69
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is related to the delay time.

70
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And we have the relaxation oscillation frequency.

71
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's some, that's related to the current, the drive current.

72
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And yes, we can move on.

73
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So, in the first step, one of the most interesting thing that we are looking for is looking for a bifurcation diagram bifurcation diagram is when we change one of the parameters.

74
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
In the increasing or decreasing, we'll see the dynamics change according to these parameters.

75
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And the two parameters, two figures below, these are showing the intensity as a function of these parameters.

76
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:20,000
These parameters could be the cup, the feedback strength, as I mentioned before, or you can change the external cavity length, or you can change the drive currents.

77
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And we see this bifurcation, you start very well, quite simple.

78
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is we usually call this continuous wave.

79
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Basically, we have the laser, but it might increase or decrease the light a little bit.

80
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Then we have a jump.

81
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Then we increase this to, we have this bifurcation branch.

82
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So this two branch, that's showing that there's two stable solutions.

83
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So in the intensity, we'll usually see periodic regions.

84
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Basically, we have a sine wave.

85
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then the next we'll have, we will enter two other branch.

86
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
At this point, we'll usually see quasi-periodic.

87
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The next, we'll see chaotic intensity.

88
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, which is usually a big blur or very random thing.

89
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And that's how we use it for random number of generations.

90
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So as we discussed in the previous slides, we now have very well-studied models for a semiconductor laser.

91
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But as most of you must know that a laser is just a bunch of photons.

92
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Even though we can describe the model in very well in electric field and carrier numbers.

93
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But when we are generating a single photon at a time, we might see different behaviors.

94
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So changing from semiconductor lasers to a single photon emitters.

95
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's the second part of my research.

96
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And the one I show on the right is a single photon emitters.

97
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We have a few layers of mirrors.

98
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They're called bright reflectors or just mirrors.

99
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You have a quantum dot embedded in the center of this, of this pillar.

100
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then, so we have the photons emitting or count very confined in three directions.

101
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And we can control the photon frequency a little bit, but not too much.

102
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We can control and how fast we want to excite or excite the quantum dot and get a very nice photon, a single photon.

103
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So I'll first start with some results I have for semiconductor lasers with feedback.

104
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll first describe the properties and then I'm going to discuss one.

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Only one of the applications that we have is called optoelectronic oscillators.

106
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So this is basically our experimental setup with the probe on the right.

107
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We can measure the voltage and the intensity at the same time, which is very, yeah, it's very interesting.

108
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But somehow it hasn't been studied in the last 10, 20 years.

109
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
People usually focus on the intensity, not optical intensity, but not the carriers.

110
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So now with this, we'll be able to get voltage and intensity at the same time.

111
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So this is one of the first few bifurcation diagrams in experiments.

112
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The one I showed you before is theoretical bifurcation diagrams.

113
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So because we're only taking the AC signals, so there's not very change.

114
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There's not that much change in the in the vertical directions.

115
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Only the oscillations are being observed here.

116
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So the parameters that we are changing is the feedback strength.

117
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
As we can see, as we increase the feedback strength, we start from a laser, basically just a CW laser.

118
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And then we have a quasi-periodic regime and then we enter a periodic.

119
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then the next we have chaotic signals.

120
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So we were also able to measure the optical spectra at the same time.

121
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We see that in the CW regions, there's only one optical frequency, meaning just the laser is very stable.

122
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You only have one frequency.

123
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The next we have quasi-periodic regimes, which more than one external cavity mode are being excited.

124
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Then the next we enter the periodic regimes.

125
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
When we see the period is separated by the relaxation oscillation frequency.

126
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The relaxation oscillation frequency, I probably haven't mentioned this.

127
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's depending on the different semiconductor laser, depending on the laser diode and current that you're applying to.

128
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The last, when we increase the feedback strength, we enter a chaotic.

129
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Chaotic region when all of these external modes are being excited.

130
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then in a later work, we'll have another slide showing other method when we characterize how chaotic it is.

131
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So I think I have...

132
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So I have prepared a very short...

133
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Sorry, sorry.

134
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Can you interrupt?

135
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay.

136
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's okay.

137
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, it's already running.

138
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think it's okay.

139
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Is it?

140
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think it's okay.

141
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think it's okay.

142
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think it's okay.

143
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Is it?

144
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's not very continuous, but I think it's okay.

145
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh.

146
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah.

147
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay.

148
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So basically, it's from what I just said, from CW to quasi-periodic to periodic, and then there are some different dynamical regimes.

149
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah.

150
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And this, the next one is, this is chaotic time series for both intensity and the voltage.

151
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think we have enough for this.

152
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay, so can I ask a question?

153
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sure.

154
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So my question is actually for the previous, the prior slide.

155
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So in there, the previous one.

156
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So in there, yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So you have four, not really four, but four graphs, colorful graphs here.

158
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So the D, can you explain that a little bit?

159
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because other three use amplitude for the Y, but this one, this D is for frequency, right?

160
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What does that mean?

161
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yes, so we have four graphs in here.

162
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So for part, for figure A and B, this figure A is the intensity, and figure B is for the voltage.

163
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So they have very similar behaviors, but some, because we have limited voltage resolutions, so some of the small features cannot be observed in the voltage.

164
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The C is just a zoom in of A.

165
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We've been from zero to 25%.

166
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So focusing on first half or first one third of the figure A, and we have, we also have the optical spectrum of the intensity at the same time.

167
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And yes, the four figures in the bottom are representing the optical frequency.

168
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So they are the optical frequency offset by the optical frequency of the laser.

169
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is that okay?

170
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

171
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Sorry about that.

172
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So we have two amplitudes representing the intensity and the voltage.

173
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:13,000
In C and D, we focus on the first half of the intensity and compare that to the optical frequency at the same time.

174
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So we have intensity changing, and also at the same time we can measure the optical frequency that's higher or below the, we usually call this CW frequency, but yeah.

175
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So, and also we see that this, there's a bright stripes that they are separate by the frequency of the relaxation oscillations, relaxation oscillation frequencies.

176
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hello.

177
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Hello.

178
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Uh, I can, I can ask a question.

179
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Is this picture, is this the picture of the bifurcation when we solve the ODE?

180
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes, yes, this is the bifurcation obtained in the experiment.

181
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Bifurcation, I remember because I learned it a long time ago.

182
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But I remember that there is a parameter that changes a little bit and then there is a completely different result.

183
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Is that the thing?

184
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

185
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So what we have changed now is...

186
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So what's changed in here?

187
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Uh, it's changed, it's feedback strength, which is how much you get back just by shooting.

188
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh.

189
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh.

190
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So it's, let me think about it, let me see if there's any of this, okay.

191
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Uh, can you see this electric field?

192
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Uh, is it E0 or Kappa?

193
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
There's a Kappa behind the electric field in the Copernicus model.

194
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh.

195
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's what we can actually change in the experiment.

196
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh.

197
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We also changed a lot of things later on, but nothing else.

198
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is the simplest, and I think it's the most controllable.

199
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Because you use that optical method, control is a very simple thing, right?

200
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay, okay, thank you.

201
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So basically, we control feedback strength.

202
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And we can see that the Bifurcation Diagram looks like this.

203
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This picture is...

204
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, this picture took me a long time to make, because I'm very lazy.

205
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It took me a long time to make it.

206
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Anyway, okay.

207
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So next.

208
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So in this slide, I'm going to discuss only one of the applications of this system.

209
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So this is called an Optical Electronic Oscillator.

210
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This is typically used when we need to generate very high frequencies, but...

211
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Sorry.

212
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
High frequency of RF signals.

213
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's very difficult for us to use a quartz oscillator and use other multipliers to generate the same periodic frequencies.

214
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So on the top, this is for generating a periodic voltage signal, because we have direct access to the voltage now.

215
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We have very high...

216
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Well, we have pretty high quality factors, and then we can get the phase jitter less than...

217
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I think 10 to the minus 4 microseconds.

218
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So the frequency now we're generating at this, it's almost 10 gigahertz.

219
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay, so the ones below, these are to generate chaotic signals.

220
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
People usually ask, we usually want an RF signal, a periodic signal.

221
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Why we care about chaotic waveform or chaotic signals?

222
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So the answer is quite simple, actually.

223
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
People are trying to use...

224
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:57,000
In all the cryptographies, people use random number generations.

225
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But usually when we have the random number generations in electronic systems,

226
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
it's typically not a real random.

227
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
There are still some type of trace that we can find, and usually they are much slower.

228
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So in here, we generate the chaotic signal, and then we can use it as a type of random number generations.

229
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
There are other characterization methods for how randomness...

230
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What's the randomness or how chaotic we are for the signal.

231
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This is one of the results.

232
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So this is called largest Leopoldov exponent.

233
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
As someone mentioned...

234
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

235
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:12,000
As someone mentioned before, this is the separation when two signals at time equals zero and time equals sometimes.

236
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And then the separation of these two signals in its state space.

237
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:32,000
If this signal, the space or the distance they are separating is proportional to time,

238
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,000
there is a very exponent, and you take the log, and then you can see if this is chaotic,

239
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
you will have a positive largest Leopoldov exponent.

240
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
This is a very...

241
00:27:49,000 --> 00:28:01,000
One of the simple way, one of the well-studied way to study how chaotic a signal is.

242
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So next I'm going to discuss what happens if we place a single photon emitter with feedback.

243
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think maybe Leo is here.

244
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He also have few publications on feedback for waveguides.

245
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So for me, I'm just going to discuss feedbacks, a single photon feedback in optical regimes.

246
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll first discuss why feedback loop is important in quantum limits.

247
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
As I showed before, this is basically how a feedback system looks like.

248
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:58,000
There are two methods of feedback loops where we try to prepare quantum states.

249
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So the one in figure A, this is a measurement-based feedback loop.

250
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So you measure something, you want to prepare either 0 or 1, and then you measure it.

251
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And if it's not a target state, you just apply a Z gate or minus something times Z gate

252
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to feed it back into the quantum system and prepare the state as you wish.

253
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It has been done experimentally, shown in figure C.

254
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So this is just a feedback for, I think, single ions, I believe.

255
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So it's easy to prepare an ion within a cavity.

256
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So the other method, which I'm more interested in, or most people are more interested in,

257
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
is called coherent feedback.

258
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Without making the measurement, if we put a mirror in front of this photon source,

259
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
we can actually prepare the quantum dot in one of the target states.

260
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So the important of this is, or the major difference is, with coherent feedback,

261
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
we can actually prepare the dot in a superposition state.

262
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Unlike the measurement-based feedback, we can usually target in 0 or 1.

263
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I think not many people are.

264
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Anyway, so again, we have

265
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the equation of motions.

266
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Feedback schemes are control schemes using time delay.

267
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So they are period-guess, type-feed control,

268
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
rhythmic control, and extended time-delay feedback.

269
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So here, the coherent feedback can be used as period-guess type control

270
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
to eliminate the unstable orbit.

271
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Okay.

272
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So the advantage of period-guess type feedback is to provide, of course, feedback instantly.

273
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It can be applied in every regime to stabilize a system.

274
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's non-invasive.

275
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And one of the best thing is, if the delay time,

276
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
which should be a controllable parameter,

277
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the delay time, if it's matching the intrinsic orbital period,

278
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
it actually has a stabilizing effect.

279
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And the last is preserving the coherent state without making the measurement.

280
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This is probably one of the most important for quantum systems.

281
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So before we start on the study of feedback,

282
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm going to discuss a little bit, just introduce how a single emitter looks like.

283
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So this, the figure on the right, bottom right,

284
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
this is a single photon emitter that our collaborating,

285
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that our collaborator manufactured in the laboratory.

286
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Basically, it's three, five semiconductor materials

287
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
with embedded quantum dot inside in the center.

288
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They have very clever way to etch out the parts that's outside of the regions.

289
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So all they left is very well-defined micropillars.

290
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And they have the optical frequency matched to this frequency,

291
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
to the transition frequency of the quantum dots.

292
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And we have two other parameters,

293
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
that's the coupling strength and the decay rate of the quantum dot.

294
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Basically, if the decay rate is too high,

295
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
we call this a weak coupling regimes,

296
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
that the photon emits,

297
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:17,000
they emit the photon outside of the desired optical frequencies.

298
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So, okay.

299
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So for one single photon with feedback,

300
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,000
we will have studied the behavior of a single photon feedback.

301
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So, on the right, we have three figures.

302
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The first is without the external cavity, without feedback.

303
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So that's emitting a single photon.

304
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The next, when we have certain condition match for the external cavity length,

305
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
or the delay time with the transition time,

306
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
or the rapid frequency in the quantum dot,

307
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
we can drive the system,

308
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
even though it's in weak coupling regimes,

309
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:26,000
we can drive them in a very periodic way.

310
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So the one that I produce in the bottom is,

311
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I use the same method to generate the same result,

312
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
so I can compare with their result in the future.

313
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So we can generate very long periodic signals with feedback.

314
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
As I mentioned before, the way that,

315
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
so the figure on the left, this is classical.

316
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
When we have the delay time,

317
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:14,000
that is a multiple of the period,

318
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
intrinsic period of a system.

319
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
When this system match to the frequency of the delay time,

320
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
they will have very high repetitions.

321
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Basically, the orbit is more or less stabilizing itself.

322
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So they have level one, two, three, four, five, something.

323
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That's the multiple of these two matching.

324
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The one on the right,

325
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
this is, I use it for a quantum,

326
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
this is the same feedback in quantum regimes.

327
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Basically, we have the similar process,

328
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,000
but the decay or the repetition of two signals are decreasing

329
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:23,000
much faster than periodic feedback.

330
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
These are just a demonstration of how it looks like.

331
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We have the delay time at three different colors.

332
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know how to say this.

333
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The top in figure C,

334
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
we see that if the delay time is not multiple of this,

335
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,000
the orbit is not very repetitive.

336
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
As we increase the delay time,

337
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
we see the orbit is trying to match to the intrinsic orbit.

338
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's very, very repetitive.

339
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes, it's very repetitive as we change the delay time.

340
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Next, I'm going to discuss stability analysis.

341
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This is very common study to study any dynamical system,

342
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
especially with feedback.

343
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
When we have the feedback,

344
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:56,000
we'll try to calculate if a system is stable or it's a repeller,

345
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
it's a stable, or it's a saddle point.

346
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The criteria or the typical method is first to find

347
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the stationary state or equilibrium states

348
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
where all the equation of motions are being zero.

349
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The next is to find the Jacobian.

350
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Then to study the stability,

351
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
we find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian.

352
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:39,000
For a stable system,

353
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
the eigenvalue of the Jacobian will be the negative,

354
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
or the real part of is negative.

355
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Repeller, we have a positive real part.

356
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The saddle point will have some of the eigenvalues being positive

357
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and some of them being negative.

358
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Okay, so how do we study such system in a quantum system?

359
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
How do we study such dynamical behavior that we describe

360
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
usually in classical system, in a quantum system?

361
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:31,000
First, it's simple because we already have the equation of motions.

362
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The one we have here,

363
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the phi is a superposition of three states.

364
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We have excited quantum dots being CE,

365
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and we have micro cavity photons being CG,

366
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
or I think I labeled CC here, sorry.

367
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We have a photon in the external cavity being CGK.

368
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It's not that hard to,

369
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and then we have the Hamiltonian that describe these interactions.

370
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,000
We can just apply this wave function to the Hamiltonian,

371
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and then we can get, well, in Schrodinger's picture,

372
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and then we can get the equation three, well, equation of motions.

373
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Interestingly, because this G of KT is describing the coupling element

374
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
between each mode,

375
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
the population in, sorry, the population in the external cavity

376
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
is the superposition of infinite mode.

377
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
This G of KT spans from negative infinity to positive infinity.

378
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Basically, it describes the coupling between the micro-pillar cavity

379
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
and the external cavity modes.

380
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We think that we have only three equation of motions,

381
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but actually the third one is actually,

382
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,000
it's like infinite dimension of equation of, sorry,

383
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
of the modes that have very high dimensions.

384
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We see this in the denominators here, C of CK,

385
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and the summation of that going back into the micro-cavity.

386
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
As I mentioned before, what's the steps that we have?

387
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
First, we find the equilibrium point.

388
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Because we, so that's our showing here.

389
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
If C of C, if the, oh, shit, sorry.

390
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
If we design the initial conditions of CE, CG and CK

391
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
in this very specific ways,

392
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
we'll have them all being stationary.

393
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It's actually a stationary state,

394
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and they have its own oscillating frequencies,

395
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
minus GT, minus GT,

396
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and for this, for the state in the external cavity,

397
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:14,000
each of them, they rotate along this K axis at different rate.

398
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But this is actually very easy to imagine if it's,

399
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
so, okay, sorry.

400
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So if you see the expression for C of CK,

401
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
for the stationary states, this is a sinc function.

402
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
A sinc function is actually a Fourier transform

403
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
of a square function.

404
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So this is just a square,

405
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
a steady state in the external cavity length.

406
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's have the same optical intensity

407
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
if you imagine in this way.

408
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So the next step is obviously try to find the Jacobian.

409
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
For that, we apply small signal models.

410
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Again, this is a Jacobian of infinite dimensions.

411
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It's almost infinite dimensions.

412
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Of course, in simulations,

413
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'll be able to only trace down a few of them.

414
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Well, many of them actually.

415
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So by applying a small signal models,

416
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
we can find the Jacobians.

417
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
With the Jacobians,

418
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
we'll be able to calculate the eigenvalues.

419
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well, here we have make a small replacement

420
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
by just letting us to calculate the eigenvalues more easily.

421
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The next step is actually to calculate the eigenvalues itself.

422
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So from the result that we have,

423
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
we can write out the function of determinant of this Jacobian.

424
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Next, we can able to calculate the eigenvalues on the top.

425
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
So there are three different case.

426
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The first case is we have the optical frequency of our photons.

427
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So if the external cavity length match to multiples of the wavelength of the photons,

428
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
we'll have the Jacobian as a function of R,

429
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
which I forgot to write here.

430
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
R is you can imagine as a feedback rate.

431
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But R is actually the rate of decay,

432
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
of the decay rate over the coupling strength.

433
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So it's actually four gamma over G.

434
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Let me remind you and remind myself what's gamma and G is.

435
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So it's four, okay, sorry, four gamma over G.

436
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,000
That's how we characterize a good or a bad cavity.

437
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:35,000
So with that, we can plot all these eigenvalues.

438
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So the one on the, in case one, we have these conditions.

439
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We have, well, so they look very similar.

440
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But if you plot them in the same graph, they are different.

441
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So we can have, and this is the imaginary part of this Jacobian,

442
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,000
of the J tilde, which is, we care about this because J,

443
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:21,000
the eigenvalues of J tilde times C over L times the I,

444
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:31,000
imaginary part, will have the real eigenvalues of the J delta.

445
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So, okay, so basically what I'm trying to say is,

446
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
if we have eigenvalues in the,

447
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
for imaginary tilde or pi, this value being positive,

448
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:57,000
we'll have a stable system and vice versa, of course.

449
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The one on the bottom, this is the real part of the eigenvalues

450
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and the imaginary part of the eigenvalues,

451
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
but plotted as different value of R,

452
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
different value of these R values.

453
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Again, when we have eigenvalues in the upper half,

454
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:41,000
we have a stable and the ones in the bottom is unstable.

455
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
What I'm trying to do here is to see if this is stable,

456
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
then we're trying to see if this can work as a stabilizer.

457
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So if this has stabilizing effect for a state that's in superposition.

458
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Sorry, I think I should mention here.

459
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:14,000
As I briefly discussed in previous slides,

460
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
the coherent feedback are able to prepare the quantum states

461
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
in superposition states,

462
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
which is not accessible for measurement-based feedback loop.

463
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Okay, so this is typically how we draw,

464
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
we call this black sphere,

465
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
but typically this is characterized how,

466
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
what's the superposition of two states.

467
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:54,000
If it's here on the black sphere,

468
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
it's well superposition states.

469
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And then, so we chose different initial conditions

470
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and we see that they are trying to stabilizing itself.

471
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Well, the red curve is help you,

472
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
just to help to guide the eyes.

473
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:29,000
We see that this stabilizing or the rate that this probability is decaying

474
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
match to the positive parts of the eigenvalues.

475
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So this values actually match perfectly with this decay rate.

476
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So we see that this,

477
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and we see this, we call this bit error.

478
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Usually we want half probability of a state,

479
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
half probability for one state and half for the other.

480
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But most of the time when we cannot prepare them perfectly,

481
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
we have this bit error.

482
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:20,000
In this study, I'm showing you that this bit error can be stabilized as time goes.

483
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
This bit error could be stabilized.

484
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And the next is to study the non-linearity of the excitation state

485
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
or Fock state.

486
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Okay, anyway, it's called Fock state.

487
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Basically study how many photons are there in a quantum system.

488
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Because in here, I only study only one excited states.

489
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And the next step is obvious to study the different number of states.

490
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So at this point, I only have one single excitation and two excitation states.

491
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But good thing is we have the same Hamiltonians.

492
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So it is possible to write out the equation of motions as we did before

493
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
and to study the stability from there.

494
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But that hasn't been done.

495
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That's one of my future works.

496
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
The other thing is if this stabilize the phase error,

497
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:46,000
the phase error is demonstrated when all these initial states are aligned on the channel.

498
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And we see if the phase, so on the figure A,

499
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:04,000
this is showing they start in equal probability, but they have different phase.

500
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What's the dynamics of this initial states?

501
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
We see that it doesn't look like it's stabilizing

502
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:24,000
or it might have very slow stabilizing rate that's not shown here.

503
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yes, so we reached the conclusions.

504
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I show two different types of optical feedbacks.

505
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
First, I study the external cavity semiconductor lasers.

506
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And we show the voltage and the intensity bifurcations diagrams.

507
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
We are able to demonstrate one of the applications.

508
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It's called optical electronic oscillators for generating periodic and chaotic waveform.

509
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And then we can plot the phase portrait as we change the feedback strength,

510
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
which also haven't been done before.

511
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Then, yeah, I forgot to show the other slides.

512
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Then we move on to optical feedback in a single photon regimes.

513
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So we have very good results that match with other people's work.

514
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:41,000
We're able to show a coherent feedback of a single photon in meters.

515
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:59,000
We study the effect of external cavity length or the delay time as of the effect of the stabilizations.

516
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Next, we have studied nonlinearities for single photon emitters,

517
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
when we have maybe one or two photons at the same time.

518
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The next I show also show the stabilizing stability analysis for single excitation states.

519
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
We can improve the theoretical models that we have,

520
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
mostly in the two excitation states,

521
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and see how we can get equilibrium states in that case.

522
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And we're looking to study the stability analysis for two excitation states.

523
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And we want to see possibly,

524
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,000
well, we are hoping to see in two or more higher excitation numbers,

525
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
are we going to transition to quantum chaos,

526
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
or maybe it's always stable.

527
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Okay, thank you.

528
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Yes, that's all.

529
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That's an hour and more.

530
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Hi, everyone.

531
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Thank you, Jianyuan.

532
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Let me ask a question first.

533
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Sorry, everyone.

534
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Let me ask a question first.

535
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
This question may be a bit...

536
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Can you talk about the application of this?

537
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Because I think when you're talking,

538
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
you've been...

539
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Maybe I missed my feeling.

540
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You've been talking about how to stabilize it.

541
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
But what does it do?

542
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Do you know what I mean?

543
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Yes, I do.

544
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
What you want to ask is,

545
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
in quantum mechanics,

546
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
what are the benefits of stabilizing?

547
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Yes.

548
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
What are the benefits of quantum mechanics?

549
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
The first one is,

550
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:14,000
the way most people want to stabilize is this.

551
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The picture in the upper right corner.

552
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
You can stabilize it,

553
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
but you may...

554
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I'm not sure if you understand quantum mechanics.

555
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
If you want to stabilize...

556
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I don't understand.

557
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I don't understand.

558
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You can only stabilize it in 0 or 1 state.

559
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Hello?

560
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Hello, I'm listening.

561
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Okay.

562
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Usually, the state we need is called K-state.

563
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Or what is it called?

564
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
GHZ state.

565
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Anyway.

566
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Anyway, it wants to be in a superposition state.

567
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
In quantum mechanics,

568
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
a lot of things want to be in 0 or 1 superposition state.

569
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But if you use measurement-based,

570
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
you can't stabilize it.

571
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But now people say,

572
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
let's use coherent feedback.

573
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But we don't know why coherent feedback can stabilize it.

574
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Or what kind of parameter does coherent feedback need to be in

575
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
for it to be stabilized.

576
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I understand.

577
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Our goal is to make it in 0 or 1 superposition state.

578
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
This is 0 or 1 superposition state.

579
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yes.

580
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Okay, I understand.

581
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Does anyone have any questions?

582
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I also want to ask a low-level question.

583
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Everyone...

584
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Do you have a low-level question?

585
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
We need to stabilize it.

586
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
But if I remember correctly...

587
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
It's been a long time since I took this class,

588
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
so I don't really remember.

589
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
But if you use feedback,

590
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
control theory should be...

591
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Hello?

592
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Hello?

593
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Am I still online?

594
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Hello?

595
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Can you hear me?

596
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Use feedback to control theory.

597
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Yes.

598
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Feedback, control theory,

599
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
and then correct.

600
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Then get feedback and correct.

601
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But in quantum mechanics,

602
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
the so-called state should be...

603
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You can get that state right away.

604
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Is there a way to allow...

605
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
To correct, to keep correcting,

606
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
to get the final state we want?

607
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Because if it's in the calculation,

608
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
when we want something in a certain state,

609
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
shouldn't we want to get this state right away?

610
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I know...

611
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I know a little bit about control theory.

612
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But I know that in control theory,

613
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
there are a lot of...

614
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I know...

615
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I know a little bit about control theory.

616
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
But I know that in control theory,

617
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
it uses passive and active control.

618
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I remember in passive control...

619
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
In fact,

620
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
this should be considered

621
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
a kind of passive control.

622
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But because it's not...

623
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Because the point is,

624
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
like I said,

625
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
this coherent feedback,

626
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
its advantage is...

627
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Active...

628
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
You may not know this.

629
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
If this is active feedback,

630
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
it measures how much...

631
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It uses a PID loop.

632
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It uses a PID loop.

633
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Then add or subtract

634
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
how much you want

635
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
to make it

636
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
the state you want.

637
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
But in quantum mechanics,

638
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
basically,

639
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
what it can use is...

640
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
What it can use is limited.

641
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So it's actually more...

642
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
The coherent feedback here

643
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
is more like

644
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
passive feedback.

645
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
As long as you...

646
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
As long as you don't...

647
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
You don't have this measurement process.

648
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You can't say you're measuring

649
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
positive 0.1 or negative 0.1

650
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and then you feedback a negative 0.1 back.

651
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Because the point is,

652
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
if you do this measurement,

653
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
it will affect

654
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
the type of superposition in it.

655
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I think everyone

656
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
has heard of something like this.

657
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
If you do a measurement,

658
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
it will affect the state

659
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
of the type in it.

660
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
So...

661
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
It's not a measurement,

662
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
but there's feedback.

663
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And then I hope I can

664
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
reach a stabilized method.

665
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
This is what I've been

666
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
talking about in the second half.

667
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I see.

668
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Thank you.

669
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I have a question.

670
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Let me ask

671
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
the next question.

672
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
If...

673
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
If you can

674
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
increase the

675
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
stability now,

676
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
theoretically,

677
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
can you calculate

678
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
the same...

679
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
the same...

680
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I can hear you.

681
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
If...

682
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
If you can increase

683
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
the stability now,

684
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
can you infer that

685
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
the same time,

686
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
the calculation time,

687
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
or whatever unit it is,

688
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
how much certainty

689
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
can it increase?

690
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Because I don't really understand

691
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
content information.

692
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

693
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Increase the certainty.

694
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Because you're now

695
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
between 0 and 1,

696
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
right?

697
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
In the past,

698
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
you stabilized it at 0 and 1,

699
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
so now it's a certainty.

700
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Am I right?

701
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
No,

702
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
but here,

703
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
it's...

704
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Yeah.

705
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Let me think about

706
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
your question.

707
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Right.

708
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
But...

709
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Can you

710
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
repeat your question?

711
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Sorry.

712
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Maybe it's because I didn't

713
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
understand it correctly,

714
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
but when I was talking

715
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
with other people,

716
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
they said content information

717
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
has a nature

718
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
that you can't

719
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
calculate

720
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
exactly,

721
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
but you can get

722
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
a certain chance.

723
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Do you mean uncertainty?

724
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Right.

725
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
If I understand

726
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
what you said

727
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
correctly,

728
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
this thing,

729
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
they're talking about

730
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
how to measure

731
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
the final result.

732
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Because you

733
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
measured 10 times,

734
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and there are 7 times.

735
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Let's say there are 7 times.

736
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
If it's 1,

737
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
you think it's...

738
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
You'll write it as

739
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
density matrix,

740
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
and you think it's 0.7.

741
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But it's not true.

742
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
This thing is called

743
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
quantum tomography.

744
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's too detailed.

745
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I don't know how to explain it.

746
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Quantum tomography

747
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
uses maximum likelihood

748
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
method.

749
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
In fact, it's not

750
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
a mathematical number.

751
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Anyway, it has some methods

752
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
to measure

753
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
in quantum computation.

754
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
It's a very difficult

755
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
problem.

756
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But it's

757
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
different from what you asked.

758
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You have to ask

759
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
if its stabilization

760
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
can be reversed.

761
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I think it can.

762
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's actually very easy.

763
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
If you really

764
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
want to

765
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
realize it,

766
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
you can...

767
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Let me think which picture

768
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
is better. This one.

769
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You can measure...

770
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
You prepare a type,

771
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and how long

772
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
do you measure?

773
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
In fact, you just do a bunch of measurements

774
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
to see if it matches the service.

775
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I think it can

776
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
reverse the type.

777
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
In fact,

778
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
it can verify

779
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
if what I do

780
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
is correct.

781
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I hope it's correct.

782
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
But

783
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
it depends on

784
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
whether someone can do it.

785
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I think it can.

786
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
OK. Thank you.

787
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Hello.

788
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Is this Yan Yong?

789
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Who? Zhang Yong?

790
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Zhang Yong is not here.

791
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
OK.

792
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Zhang Yong

793
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
just joined

794
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
and then disappeared.

795
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I don't know what happened to him.

796
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
OK. Ignore him.

797
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
California.

798
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
He hasn't woken up yet.

799
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
California.

800
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I tried to check

801
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
if California has woken up.

802
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
California doesn't seem to have woken up.

803
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's Taiwanese anyway.

804
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Thank you.

805
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Actually,

806
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I just arrived in Taiwan

807
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
so I'm still awake.

808
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I just returned to Taiwan today.

809
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
What's your name?

810
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Zhuang Ying.

811
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
My name is Zhuang Biyue.

812
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Biyue.

813
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
OK. Where are you studying?

814
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I'm in

815
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
DC, George Washington.

816
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
George Washington University.

817
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Which one?

818
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
George Washington.

819
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
George Washington.

820
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
OK.

821
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I happened to be there

822
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
a while ago.

823
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
What are you studying?

824
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Mechanical Engineering.

825
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I've been watching a lot of

826
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
mechanical stuff lately.

827
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I watched Control Theory

828
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and I almost went crazy.

829
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Control Theory

830
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
is a very important...

831
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah.

832
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
When I was

833
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
calculating the

834
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
controllability equation,

835
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
and

836
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
studying those things,

837
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I think Control Theory is really interesting.

838
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yeah.

839
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I don't do control.

840
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I do fluid mechanics.

841
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So I did control

842
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
about 10 years ago.

843
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I know.

844
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I was thinking you should...

845
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah.

846
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I just found out

847
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
that Control Theory

848
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
has such a difficult problem.

849
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
It's really interesting in math.

850
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But I just

851
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
heard that

852
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I was on

853
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Quantum Computing a while ago.

854
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I remember he said

855
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
that now computers

856
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
are 1 and 0.

857
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Quantum Computing

858
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
means that 70% is 0

859
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
and 31% is 1.

860
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
It's a superposition.

861
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
That's right.

862
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Is it like

863
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Quantum Computing at

864
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Keio University in Japan?

865
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I don't think so.

866
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think it's from

867
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
a professor from

868
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
a university in the US.

869
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So you mean

870
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
to stabilize

871
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
a set of states

872
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
that are 1 and 0

873
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and 30% is 1.

874
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I mean I want to

875
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
produce this state

876
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
accurately.

877
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Is that what you mean?

878
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
That's right.

879
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
You're right.

880
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Because it has a superposition

881
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
of what percentage is what.

882
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
The first thing

883
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
in the feedback loop

884
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
is that if it's just

885
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
0 and 1,

886
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
it's easy to do the feedback loop.

887
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But if you make it

888
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
50% is 0

889
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and 50% is 1,

890
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
there's nothing you can do.

891
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Right?

892
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
It's measurement-based.

893
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
There's nothing you can do

894
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
if you measure it.

895
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
So superposition

896
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
is a new way

897
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
to stabilize

898
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
this thing.

899
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Stabilizing

900
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
quantum computing

901
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
requires a lot of

902
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
research.

903
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Because

904
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I don't know if you

905
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
learned about error correction

906
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
in quantum computing?

907
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
No, I just gave up after two weeks.

908
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Okay.

909
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Anyway, error correction

910
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
is a very difficult problem.

911
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Because you can't

912
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
do both sides.

913
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Because like

914
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
traditional computers,

915
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
it's easy to do error correction.

916
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
If you have a 1, you can

917
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
repeat it three times.

918
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
If you pass it

919
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
at the end,

920
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
if it becomes 101,

921
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
you know the middle is wrong.

922
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
But you can't do it like that.

923
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Because you can't have

924
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
non-cloning theory.

925
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So you can't do

926
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
the copying.

927
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
So you need

928
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
quantum error correction.

929
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It's a very big research.

930
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It has surface code,

931
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
color code,

932
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
super math.

933
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Yeah.

934
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I've seen some before.

935
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I think it's super difficult.

936
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah.

937
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
But I haven't finished yet.

938
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Error correction can only

939
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
correct

940
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
discrete errors.

941
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
But here,

942
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
what we need to do

943
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
is to correct

944
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
continuous errors.

945
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
It's not a difficult

946
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
thing to do.

947
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
So this thing can

948
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
do continuous stabilizing.

949
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
This thing.

950
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I can

951
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
continuously

952
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
stabilize it,

953
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
instead of

954
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
doing something

955
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
to stabilize it.

956
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Like this.

957
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Like you said,

958
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
quantum itself,

959
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
if I remember correctly,

960
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
can't be accurately measured.

961
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
No matter how you do

962
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
this experiment today,

963
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
you have to measure

964
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
to know what you get.

965
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Or like quantum computing,

966
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
the one who receives the signal

967
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
also needs to measure

968
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
to know what signal it receives.

969
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
You have to measure

970
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
to know if it

971
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
receives the wrong signal.

972
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Today, like you said,

973
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
it's very difficult to measure.

974
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Is there enough

975
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
technology

976
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
to apply

977
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
or is it still

978
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
lacking

979
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
in this area?

980
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
If...

981
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Your question should be...

982
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
There are two parts.

983
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
One is...

984
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Generally speaking,

985
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
readout...

986
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
The result of readout

987
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
can be done.

988
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
But if you use the result of readout

989
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
to reverse the state of superposition,

990
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
this is very difficult.

991
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So I can say

992
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
that these two parts should be discussed separately.

993
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Generally speaking,

994
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
simply put,

995
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
readout is very simple.

996
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I can't say that.

997
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It depends on your system.

998
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
If you use superposition,

999
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
or quantum dot,

1000
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
or ion trap,

1001
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
ion trap's readout is the simplest.

1002
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
The other two

1003
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
are a bit more difficult.

1004
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But in fact,

1005
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
everyone knows

1006
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
how to do it.

1007
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
But the result

1008
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
you measure

1009
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
is

1010
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
0 and 1.

1011
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
But if you want

1012
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
to calculate

1013
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
the original state,

1014
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
you may have to do it

1015
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
10 times,

1016
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
and 7 times is 0.

1017
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
But if 7 times is 0,

1018
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
you can't reverse it.

1019
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
The probability is 0.7

1020
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
and 0.3.

1021
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yes.

1022
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
This is...

1023
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Because it is...

1024
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And usually you don't measure

1025
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
one by one.

1026
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You don't just have a qubit.

1027
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Even if you have a qubit,

1028
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
it's not difficult.

1029
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
But you may need

1030
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
thousands of qubits.

1031
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
You have to do the measurement

1032
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
for each one.

1033
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And you have to do it

1034
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
enough times

1035
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
to have enough confidence

1036
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
that the result is right.

1037
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Then you have to

1038
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
measure

1039
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
the original state

1040
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
100,000 times

1041
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
or so.

1042
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Then you can reverse

1043
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
the original state.

1044
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
This is very difficult.

1045
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And there will be some errors.

1046
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
OK.

1047
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
The error

1048
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
is compared to the number of times

1049
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
you have to measure.

1050
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Anyway.

1051
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
OK. Thank you.

1052
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Do you have any questions?

1053
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Do you have any questions?

1054
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
If you don't have any questions,

1055
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
let's give a round of applause.

1056
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Thank you.

1057
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Thank you.

1058
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Come on. Come on.

1059
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Come on, Taiwan.

1060
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
OK.

1061
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
That's it.

1062
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
You can leave the line.

1063
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
OK. Bye.

1064
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Thank you.

1065
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Nice to meet you.

1066
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Nice to meet you.

1067
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I'll post the video

1068
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
in the blog.

1069
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Only the members can see it.

1070
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
If you have any questions,

1071
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
you can send them to me.

1072
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Or you can contact him directly.

1073
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Or you can leave a message.

1074
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
OK.

1075
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I'll check it out.

1076
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
If you want to add me

1077
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
to my Facebook,

1078
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
it's not Jianyuan Chang.

1079
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
It's Kat Chang.

1080
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Or you can check

1081
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
whether you can

1082
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
tag me in the blog

1083
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
or add me.

1084
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Yeah.

1085
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
It's more convenient for everyone to contact.

1086
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
OK.

1087
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And...

1088
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Sorry. I forgot.

1089
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Ping Yuan.

1090
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Bi Yuan.

1091
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Hello.

1092
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Hello.

1093
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
If you have any questions,

1094
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
we can discuss it.

1095
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
If you're interested in this,

1096
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I'll apply for a blog post.

1097
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I'm looking for a blog post

1098
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
about quantum computing.

1099
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
If you have any questions,

1100
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
you can ask me.

1101
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
OK.

1102
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I'm doing...

1103
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
It's not directly related,

1104
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
but I'm doing supercomputing.

1105
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It's about supercomputing.

1106
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So...

1107
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It's really hard

1108
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
to calculate the heat flow.

1109
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Yeah.

1110
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Basically, it's about money.

1111
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
In the future,

1112
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
quantum...

1113
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Sorry.

1114
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's my wedding photo.

1115
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'll cover it.

1116
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
There's a big one called

1117
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
quantum simulation.

1118
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I don't know if quantum simulation

1119
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
can simulate

1120
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
chemical molecules.

1121
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I don't know

1122
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
if other systems

1123
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
can simulate

1124
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
it in the future.

1125
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Yeah.

1126
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It's a big field.

1127
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
So...

1128
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
OK.

1129
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
OK.

1130
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Talk to you later.

1131
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Bye.
