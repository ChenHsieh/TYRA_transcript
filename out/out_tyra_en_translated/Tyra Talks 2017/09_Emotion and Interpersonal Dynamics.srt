1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi, everyone. We're going to have the fourth Q&A session this year.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're honored to have Zhang Yanping here to talk about positive emotions and human relations.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Zhang Yanping is a Ph.D. candidate at UNC-Chapel Hill.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He has been studying at UNC-Chapel Hill since 2013.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Prior to that, he obtained a Ph.D. and a master's degree in psychology at NTU.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:04,000
His research focuses on positive psychology, positive emotion, gratitude, self-transcendent emotion, well-being, cultural psychology, and moral psychology.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:18,000
His research includes emotional communication, interpersonal dynamics, Taiwanese indigenous psychology, prosocial behavior, political participation, and moral judgment.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:32,000
As you can see, Zhang Yanping's research focuses on social psychology and social participation.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Today, he's going to talk about emotional and interpersonal dynamics.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's welcome him.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you, everyone.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
First, I'd like to say I'm sorry.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I thought I'd be here next week.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So the content I'm going to talk about today is a little different from what I wrote for Zhang Yanping.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Wait a minute. I'll close the door.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was going to prepare a more general content next week.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to talk about a lot of projects that I've done before.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I'm going to put them all together and talk about a big direction and what to do next.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But I got the time wrong.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So I didn't prepare that.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So what I'm going to talk about today is one of the projects I was going to cover.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I'm going to talk about this project.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The bad thing is that I'm going to talk about it in more detail.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So if you have any technical questions, you can just ask.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The good thing is that I'm not going to talk about the studies I shared last spring.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So if you've heard of it, you won't repeat it.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is the first one. I'm sorry. I got the time wrong.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The second one.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The second one is when I was talking about my research interests.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It sounds like a lot of answers.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It sounds like independent things.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But in fact, it's like this.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Imagine.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm actually interested in how people communicate and understand each other.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What the other person wants to do.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Who is the other person?

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What is the other person thinking?

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Wait a minute.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In this process of interpersonal communication,

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In the past, people have been pointing out a lot.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That is to say, our speech and communication.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In fact, non-verbal communication is a big part of it.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And it's not just a big part.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In fact, it's a relatively large part.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Compared to verbal communication.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
For example, if I say hello to everyone today.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you very much for coming to my speech.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But from start to finish.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Then you must find it strange.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But in fact, that's a constant behavior.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I didn't even move.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You can just say that my hands are stiff.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But in fact, it's not.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Just that little action.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The whole process of communication has changed.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What I'm interested in is non-verbal communication.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Non-verbal communication is largely related to emotions.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If I'm angry, I'll just crack my teeth.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Even if I haven't hit you yet.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I also crack my teeth.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know if you've seen that.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There is a very famous photo of an Olympic gold medalist.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He once won a silver medal.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't remember his name.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Very famous recently.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Then his mouth is on one side of his mouth.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Because he's very ungrateful.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's actually a content performance.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Will it affect

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you're talking to your partner.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's like this.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A very ungrateful look.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There's going to be a problem with communication.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So what I'm interested in is

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Emotions in non-verbal communication.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
How does this have anything to do with moral psychology?

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Because it's simple.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because if I'm talking to my partner today.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Then show a very ungrateful look.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There will be a fight later.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There will be a fight.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's about morality.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's about who's right and who's wrong.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why do you think I shouldn't do this?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why should I listen to you?

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But I give you this ungrateful look.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You think this is morally wrong.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Where do you see this signal from?

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then next.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
For example, I walked on the street.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then there was a street friend.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He showed me some emotional non-verbal communication signals.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But then it will affect my judgment of his situation.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
For example, this guy deserves it.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He didn't work hard to get there.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Or do I think he must have been bullied.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So this society is not fair.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I have to help him.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So moral behavior or moral judgment

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And the next moral behavior

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's all in this kind of interpersonal communication.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's all in this kind of interaction.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So it's actually a line that keeps pulling down.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And then finally.

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm very interested in culture.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because that's what we're going to talk about today.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Culture greatly affects how we understand others.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Like this.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We'll talk about culture later.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I won't talk about it now.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Anyway, you can imagine it.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then I started.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Because I have two screens.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So if you leave a message, I can see it.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It won't affect my PowerPoint.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So if you have any questions, you can leave a message.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can also speak directly through the microphone.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It doesn't matter.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I should be able to see it.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, let's get started.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
First of all, thank you all for coming to listen to me today.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And it's under such late notice.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was interrupted just now.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you all.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In order to express my gratitude to everyone.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is what I used in my dissertation proposal defense.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So it's funny.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Maybe it's weird here.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's what I said at the time.

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In order to express my gratitude to everyone.

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Please let me kiss your feet.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This behavior.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Especially in Taiwan.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's very bizarre.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why would you do this?

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But in India.

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't know if you know.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
In India.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Kissing someone's feet is the highest expression.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Respect.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And gratitude.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Grateful for the help of these people.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And cultivation.

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And incense.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So this behavior is usually for.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's usually for the elders.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Or this monk.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This monk.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's what the monks do.

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of course, it's not limited to these people.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But it's usually like this.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This behavior looks very bizarre.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But in fact, in this part of the world.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
This is what everyone does.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And don't forget.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is not a small island in the Pacific Ocean.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then there are only a few hundred people.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is India.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There are hundreds of millions of people in India.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Very, very many.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So it's not a.

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So it's actually not a.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Very rare event.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But we don't know about these events.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't know.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So for us.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Grateful is to express gratitude.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Just say thank you.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hug.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This thing.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In the example just now.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It shows that.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is often not the case.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Before we start.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Before analyzing culture.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's talk about why.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So why do we need to study gratitude?

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We know that gratitude is a positive emotion.

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm going to talk about gratitude today.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Gratitude is a positive emotion.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When we feel grateful.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We feel very happy.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Warm.

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So he.

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Psychologically.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Comfortable.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And the study also shows.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Feel positive emotion.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Will make us.

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There are many benefits of mental health.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Come again.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
In addition to mental health.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Physical health.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The study also shows that.

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
When feeling positive emotion.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
All kinds of positive emotions.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Physical health will be better.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Not to mention gratitude.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because gratitude is usually between people.

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I thank a person.

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Then a person is good to me.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He gives me social support.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So I feel grateful.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Then I might return it later.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So give him social support.

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The study found that.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Social support.

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
For this.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mortality rate.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Will it hang anyway?

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Will people die?

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This prediction.

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Very high.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
How high is it?

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Higher than smoking.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then.

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let me see if I can.

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Find this information for everyone.

224
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Take a quick look.

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is a big one in the past.

226
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This review paper.

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Then he found that.

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Everyone can see me now.

229
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This powerpoint is affiliation.

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Or the one just now.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I can see it.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Affiliation, right?

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Very good.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
In the past, this study is.

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He did it like this.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Everyone can see this.

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There are a lot of bars here.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This bar.

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Is these items on the left.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
For mortality risk.

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Prediction.

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This effect size.

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If you don't know what effect size is.

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't care about it.

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The longer the prediction, the stronger the prediction.

247
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The less noise.

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The top.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This pile.

250
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Is a variety of different ways to measure social support.

251
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then social support.

252
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Or good quality.

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
High quality social relationship.

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
For the mortality rate.

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The prediction is very high.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you have good quality.

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
These.

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Quality relationship.

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Then.

260
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The mortality rate is relatively low.

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Prediction is stronger than smoking.

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And this smoking is not what.

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Pick two a day.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What is it?

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Less than 15.

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Everyone can see here.

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Less than 15.

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So this is a crazy pile.

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You.

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A crazy pile.

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You are not necessarily.

272
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Not necessarily dead.

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It will be faster than those who do not have social support.

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Social support is so important.

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Then there are below.

276
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But.

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Aren't they consistent?

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You have an error bar.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What is it called?

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They are not consistent.

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Your social relationship.

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
After adding the error bar.

283
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Within one sigma.

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Consistent with smoking.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can accept.

286
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You said alcohol consumption.

287
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But I don't think smoking is good.

288
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Smoking is right.

289
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is not wrong.

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is true.

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And this.

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You can see this.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The size of the error bar.

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In fact, it has a lot to do with the method of measurement.

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Because if you are today.

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Especially when you.

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If you ask about this smoking.

298
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Then you pick a few.

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This can be counted one by one.

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But how to measure the relationship quality.

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Is a very tricky question.

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So it will have three different categories.

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then there are several categories.

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The error bar is super big.

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Because it is obvious.

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The way of measuring is not very good.

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not accurate.

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But generally the idea is.

309
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Social support.

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
At least.

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
At least it is with.

312
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Smoking.

313
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Can't be distinguished.

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Just like this.

315
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Like you don't have friends.

316
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's like you smoke every day.

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, that's fine.

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's not bigger.

319
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But at least it can't.

320
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Not lower.

321
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And then alcohol.

322
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
In this place.

323
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Alcohol is a little lower.

324
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But it.

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It is still lower than social support.

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Then there is the flu vaccine.

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The flu vaccine is even lower.

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Physical activity is here.

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's lower.

330
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Then.

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay, that's it.

332
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
These are the more important ones.

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So.

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What is the point?

335
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The point is that social support.

336
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It is for.

337
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Mortality risk.

338
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The prediction is so strong.

339
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So we.

340
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I want to have a good relationship.

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
In the end.

342
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Wait a minute.

343
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I see someone.

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh.

345
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is the edge wrong?

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay.

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The edge is not wrong.

348
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The edge needs help.

349
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Need help.

350
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But we just want to talk about this.

351
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That is to say.

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There is no social support.

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
In fact, it is a very.

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A serious problem.

355
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So it's not just about teenagers.

356
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Teenage smoking is not good.

357
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's just that teenagers are excluded.

358
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He might die faster.

359
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Anyway, think about it.

360
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This is actually quite reasonable.

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This smoking.

362
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You still have smoking.

363
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But.

364
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
People who are excluded.

365
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's easy to commit suicide in the end.

366
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So this is really a serious problem.

367
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay, finally.

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This past research has been considered.

369
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's not research.

370
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is a philosopher.

371
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Many philosophers.

372
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Maybe not many.

373
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But there are a few important philosophers.

374
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They believe that.

375
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Gratitude is a very important emotion.

376
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Because it brings people together.

377
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He.

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It is the foundation of our modern society.

379
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Just social exchange.

380
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Or this.

381
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Rational exchange is not enough.

382
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So it's a bit like a lubricant.

383
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's why we need to study gratitude.

384
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But the problem is.

385
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Just like the example we just saw.

386
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We're not really sure.

387
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
How to express gratitude.

388
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Or what to do with gratitude.

389
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Because the cultural difference is so big.

390
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So in this project.

391
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm going to do this.

392
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The question is.

393
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Cultural variation in good expressions.

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Different cultures.

395
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
How to express.

396
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Express gratitude.

397
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And then.

398
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Especially I will focus on.

399
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The difference between the United States and Taiwan.

400
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I will explain later.

401
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Why the United States and Taiwan.

402
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Except.

403
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Of course there are some theoretical reasons.

404
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I will explain later.

405
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Another one is because.

406
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm in the United States.

407
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So it's easy for me to get American samples.

408
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Then I have connections in Taiwan.

409
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I get connections in Taiwan.

410
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is a.

411
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is a practical reason.

412
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll talk about this first.

413
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The theoretical reason.

414
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll talk about it later.

415
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
OK.

416
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Then it officially started.

417
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We've already spent half an hour.

418
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's really funny.

419
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Anyway.

420
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
OK.

421
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So what is gratitude?

422
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Gratitude.

423
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This emotion.

424
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We just.

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Define it a little bit.

426
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's a kind of.

427
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
When we receive help from others.

428
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Or goodwill.

429
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
When goodwill.

430
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Will feel a kind of.

431
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Positive.

432
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Happy.

433
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Joyful.

434
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Warm.

435
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This feeling.

436
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
This emotion.

437
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We.

438
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We call this feeling gratitude.

439
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Or say.

440
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We call this feeling gratitude.

441
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's usually not wrong.

442
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
As for whether.

443
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Only this feeling is called gratitude.

444
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We don't care about it now.

445
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't care about it now.

446
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In this place.

447
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Gratitude has several characteristics.

448
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Compared with other positive emotions.

449
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The first one is.

450
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's usually.

451
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In interpersonal relationships.

452
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Produced.

453
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Someone helped me.

454
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Give me a gift.

455
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Or.

456
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Say something nice to me.

457
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Or.

458
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Give me.

459
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Just.

460
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do something for me.

461
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Teach me something I don't know.

462
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I feel very grateful.

463
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is different from.

464
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Other positive emotions.

465
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But I'm happy today.

466
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't need anyone else.

467
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I feel great.

468
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is positive emotion.

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is joy.

470
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But this is not grateful.

471
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You won't because.

472
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm happy.

473
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Feel grateful.

474
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Usually not.

475
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We can discuss later.

476
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If you are happy.

477
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Feel grateful.

478
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why is that?

479
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think this question is very interesting.

480
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But basically.

481
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Gratefulness.

482
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Its characteristics are.

483
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Produced directly from interpersonal relationships.

484
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Usually.

485
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
In addition.

486
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It will have.

487
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Results in interpersonal relationships.

488
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Or effect.

489
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We receive a person.

490
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Gratefulness.

491
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We usually.

492
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Repay.

493
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Or at least say thank you.

494
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This thank you.

495
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Not in the air.

496
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Say it to another person.

497
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So.

498
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Gratefulness is a very interpersonal.

499
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Emotion.

500
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Relative to.

501
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Other positive emotions.

502
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So.

503
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This is.

504
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Later.

505
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
There is a.

506
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Because of these phenomena.

507
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
There is a theory.

508
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Called.

509
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Find.

510
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Find.

511
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Remind.

512
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And.

513
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Find.

514
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Theory.

515
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This theory says so.

516
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He said.

517
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Gratefulness.

518
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The reason why people.

519
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Have this emotion.

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is because.

521
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Gratefulness.

522
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's like this.

523
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Think about it.

524
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's like a light bulb.

525
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We usually wear a light bulb.

526
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Then.

527
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When.

528
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Someone is nice to me.

529
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I think this person.

530
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This person is a good.

531
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Social partner.

532
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This.

533
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I deserve to continue.

534
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
With him.

535
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This light will be like this.

536
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Will light up.

537
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Then remind me.

538
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This guy is a good guy.

539
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is gratefulness.

540
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The thing that lights up.

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is gratefulness.

542
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So he.

543
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Help us.

544
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Find.

545
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Good.

546
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Social partners.

547
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And.

548
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If.

549
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Next time.

550
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I meet this person.

551
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
My light bulb.

552
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Will be like this.

553
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Will light up again.

554
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Remind me.

555
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This guy was nice to me last time.

556
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So.

557
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I should repay him now.

558
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Or.

559
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I should pay attention to this person.

560
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Next.

561
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Make good friends with him.

562
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So.

563
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Can build social partners.

564
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This social relationship.

565
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So.

566
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He helped me.

567
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Find.

568
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And.

569
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000

So.

807
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
So.

808
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
So.

809
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
So.

So.

811
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
So.

812
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
So.

813
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120

So.

821
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120

So.

825
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
So.

826
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
So.

827
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
So.

828
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
So.

829
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
So.

830
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
So.

831
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
So.

832
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
So.

833
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
So.

834
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
So.

835
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
So.

836
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
So.

837
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
So.

838
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
So.

839
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
So.

840
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,920
This is.

841
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
he is very famous in recent research.

842
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
If you're interested in it, we can talk about it later.

843
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,120
But this is a concept.

844
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
This is collective culture.

845
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Everybody image of this dimensions are different.

846
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
So what's the result.

847
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
The result is.

848
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
If in to personalistic culture change.

849
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,120
We all think about change the role of society already and social norm.

850
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
It's easy.

851
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
It's allowed.

852
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Let them do it.

853
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
It's allowed.

854
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
But in extremism.

855
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Especially in extreme extremism.

856
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
It's very difficult.

857
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Let me give you an example.

858
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
You're in Japan.

859
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
If you want to quit the black society, you have to cut your finger, right?

860
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
You have to.

861
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
This is very serious.

862
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
There will be very serious consequences.

863
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
And usually the result is that you won't quit.

864
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Otherwise you will die.

865
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
So you actually didn't quit.

866
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Or you really cut a finger.

867
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Then your whole life changed.

868
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Ok.

869
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Then we put the culture into the emotion.

870
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
What's the result?

871
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
The result is.

872
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,120
In the left side of the personalistic culture.

873
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
It's easy to see.

874
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Everybody's emotional expression is a lot of big body movements.

875
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Then easy to see.

876
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
And I say it is easy to see.

877
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
It's literally easy to see.

878
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
You push that person far away.

879
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Then you see that person is far away.

880
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
He is saying hello to you and waving his hand.

881
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
It's literally easy to see.

882
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
But.

883
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
If it is.

884
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
This collective culture.

885
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Everyone's expression is relatively small.

886
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
That is, he may smile at you.

887
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Even the teeth did not show.

888
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
So if you are two meters away.

889
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
You just.

890
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
This face is.

891
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
It looks like a flat one.

892
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Won't move.

893
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
So why is that?

894
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Because.

895
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Back to that American.

896
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Back to that American.

897
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
The example of panic.

898
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Everyone is really two meters away.

899
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
You can't see.

900
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Then you express.

901
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Express.

902
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Sour.

903
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
But if it is.

904
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
If you.

905
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
On the right.

906
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
In Taiwan or Japan.

907
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
You have a very special.

908
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Fixed social position.

909
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
You don't even need to express.

910
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
You know what you want to do.

911
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Others know what you want to do.

912
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
You also know what others know what you want to do.

913
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
So why do you have to use emotions to communicate?

914
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
No need.

915
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
The most is to do a little adjustment.

916
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Then you just smile.

917
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
A smile is probably enough.

918
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
So the result is.

919
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
In addition to people.

920
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
There are different ways of expression.

921
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
We will also.

922
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,120
There are different ways of understanding other people's expressions.

923
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
In fact, this is.

924
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
This.

925
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
The other side of the board.

926
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
I don't need to explain.

927
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
It's easy to understand.

928
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
As a result, we call this thing.

929
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Emotional culture.

930
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
Every culture.

931
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Or every group of people.

932
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Because of their.

933
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
The structure of interpersonal relationships.

934
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
The structure of their natural relationships.

935
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Form a set.

936
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
A unique way of expression and understanding emotions.

937
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
It's called emotional culture.

938
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Emotional culture.

939
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Good.

940
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
So.

941
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
So we.

942
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
In this.

943
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
In my research.

944
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
In fact, what we are going to study is.

945
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
The difference in emotional culture.

946
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Then I will.

947
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
I will.

948
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Select the United States and Taiwan.

949
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
The reason is.

950
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I just told you.

951
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,120
The United States is a country with a very high percentage of individualism.

952
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
So he is.

953
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
One of the dimensions.

954
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Taiwan.

955
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Although not the highest.

956
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
But also.

957
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Among the three highest.

958
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
One of them.

959
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
South Korea.

960
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
South Korea, Japan, Taiwan.

961
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
One of them.

962
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Then.

963
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
So.

964
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
So.

965
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Select these two countries.

966
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
He is.

967
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
This kind of.

968
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
This is called.

969
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Select these two countries.

970
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Can increase us.

971
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
In fact, after the increase.

972
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
This finding.

973
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
This.

974
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
Generalizability.

975
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Interpretability.

976
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
It can also be used at a lower cost.

977
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Because we put.

978
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
This is equal to.

979
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
This contrast.

980
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Pull to the maximum.

981
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
We use the lowest cost.

982
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
See this effect.

983
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Good.

984
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
The next question is.

985
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
If you go to identify.

986
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
These two countries.

987
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
Then these two countries.

988
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
When expressing gratitude.

989
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
What kind of behavior will be used?

990
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
That has just been said.

991
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Individualism.

992
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
This kind of panic country.

993
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
They will form.

994
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Is big.

995
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
In theory.

996
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
They have to form big.

997
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Because big will be effective.

998
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Emotional expression.

999
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
And.

1000
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Generally.

1001
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
More.

1002
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Expressive.

1003
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Or more.

1004
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Observable.

1005
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
This.

1006
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Emotional expression.

1007
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,120
In the past.

1008
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
For gratitude.

1009
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
In the United States.

1010
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
At the same time.

1011
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Oh.

1012
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
When people feel grateful.

1013
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
In addition to saying thank you.

1014
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
This seems.

1015
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
There is no cultural difference.

1016
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
In addition.

1017
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Americans will.

1018
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Very inclined to.

1019
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Body contact.

1020
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Including.

1021
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
Hug.

1022
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Including.

1023
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Handshake.

1024
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Including kiss.

1025
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Including high five.

1026
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Or slap.

1027
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
And so on.

1028
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
In the past.

1029
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
I found that.

1030
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
If you are grateful.

1031
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Ask him what he wants to do.

1032
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
He will.

1033
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Come out.

1034
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
That's because it's.

1035
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Body.

1036
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Body interaction.

1037
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
He has bodily contact.

1038
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
So he will.

1039
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
In relation to.

1040
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
Just say thank you.

1041
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Or.

1042
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Say thank you.

1043
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
This.

1044
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
Is the sound.

1045
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
This.

1046
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Sound.

1047
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
This.

1048
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Communicate.

1049
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Communicate.

1050
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Channel.

1051
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
But if you add bodily contact.

1052
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
There will be one more.

1053
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
The channel.

1054
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
So.

1055
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
It's not easy.

1056
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
Oh.

1057
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Is.

1058
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
This is.

1059
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
This.

1060
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
This is why.

1061
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
A lot of emotional.

1062
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Reason.

1063
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
So.

1064
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Assuming that it will become here.

1065
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
The United States is relative to Taiwan.

1066
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Because of its cultural factors.

1067
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
So.

1068
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
When they express their gratitude.

1069
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
There should be more.

1070
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Body.

1071
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
Behavior.

1072
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Conversely.

1073
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
In fact, it is more special.

1074
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Not the other way around.

1075
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
But on the other hand.

1076
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
I think this is more special.

1077
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Is.

1078
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
So what is Taiwan going to do?

1079
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
To express.

1080
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
In this study.

1081
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
We put forward a.

1082
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Called.

1083
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
The other.

1084
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Question together.

1085
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
I am now reading.

1086
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
There is a question.

1087
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
You read it out.

1088
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Because we record.

1089
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Or do you let me read it out.

1090
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
You read it out.

1091
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
OK, I read it out.

1092
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
page change.

1093
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
I understand now.

1094
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Because of them.

1095
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
This question is like this.

1096
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Is it because they are a panic-type country?

1097
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
So raise extreme individualism.

1098
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Or because of the original

1099
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
People who want to panic.

1100
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
It was originally an individualistic feature.

1101
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
So I want to panic.

1102
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
OK, this one.

1103
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
I think it's a very good question.

1104
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I'll answer it later.

1105
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
Because this is not actually.

1106
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
This is actually not this project.

1107
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
The question to be discussed.

1108
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Right.

1109
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
In this project.

1110
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
They are a

1111
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Individualistic culture.

1112
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
In fact, it is a given.

1113
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Then this given.

1114
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
There is also a lot of data knowledge.

1115
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
So I don't want to discuss it now.

1116
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
Why did it become like this?

1117
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
So I don't want to answer the question now.

1118
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
But we'll talk about it later.

1119
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Discussion time.

1120
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Let's talk about this question.

1121
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
What happened to the culture?

1122
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
I think this question is very interesting.

1123
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Can I do this?

1124
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
OK, back to Taiwan.

1125
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,120
How do you express your gratitude to Taiwan?

1126
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
We found one.

1127
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
We went to

1128
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Translate some books.

1129
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Then I found an act.

1130
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Called self-improvement.

1131
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
English translated into self-improvement.

1132
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
But this is very strange.

1133
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
But his Chinese is actually called self-improvement.

1134
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Or self-cultivation.

1135
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
In fact, it is self-cultivation.

1136
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Or

1137
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Self-cultivation.

1138
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
Such a thing.

1139
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
The definition is like this.

1140
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Basically, if you are

1141
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
A good student.

1142
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Study hard.

1143
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
If it's a good kid.

1144
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,120
You have to respect your parents.

1145
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
Because these are your social responsibility.

1146
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
And social role.

1147
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Why is this behavior

1148
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
A possible way to express gratitude?

1149
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
Because

1150
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Big brother.

1151
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Why is it

1152
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
A possible way to express gratitude?

1153
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Because we said before.

1154
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Gratitude.

1155
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
The existence of this emotion.

1156
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
Because it can help

1157
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Promote interpersonal relations.

1158
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Then in a

1159
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Interpersonal relations.

1160
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
The structure is already stable.

1161
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
And it's almost a spoken place.

1162
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,120
How do you promote interpersonal relations?

1163
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
You can't.

1164
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120
You are not expected to build a new relationship.

1165
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
Or destroy a new relationship.

1166
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Or destroy an old relationship.

1167
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
So what you can do is maintenance.

1168
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
This is to let the relationship.

1169
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
In three.

1170
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
What can be done is to do maintenance.

1171
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Or do buy.

1172
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
No more buy.

1173
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
No more

1174
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Initiate or what.

1175
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
So this

1176
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Buy.

1177
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Can do is to put your

1178
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Position well.

1179
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Because past research has found that.

1180
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
In this.

1181
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
I actually.

1182
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
In our society.

1183
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
If you put

1184
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Own.

1185
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
This role.

1186
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Do it well.

1187
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Or when your responsibility is done.

1188
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Others will see it.

1189
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
The result that others can see is that he will come.

1190
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,120
Willing to invest in your relationship with you.

1191
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
And then.

1192
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Put your original

1193
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
This bonding.

1194
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Or bond.

1195
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Think it's important.

1196
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,120
So self-cultivation can actually help.

1197
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Relationship.

1198
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Stability.

1199
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
And maintenance.

1200
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,120
In our culture.

1201
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Give you an example.

1202
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
This is a big brother.

1203
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
What am I going to say?

1204
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
The window on his head.

1205
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Why tie a window in that place?

1206
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
Because this is his job.

1207
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
This is his job.

1208
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,120
His job.

1209
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
He's playing.

1210
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Most people can say.

1211
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
I must win.

1212
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
That's because I'm a player.

1213
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
I just want to win.

1214
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
I'm cool.

1215
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
This is not good.

1216
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,120
But everyone has.

1217
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
If there is.

1218
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
For.

1219
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
I think everyone is from Taiwan.

1220
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
So what does it mean to win?

1221
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Is.

1222
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
There should be a little feeling.

1223
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
That is to say.

1224
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Usually we are talking about winning.

1225
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,120
I am determined to win.

1226
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,120
When you do this thing well.

1227
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Usually this thing is our responsibility.

1228
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Then we.

1229
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
For the society.

1230
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
Or for us.

1231
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,120
The surrounding social face.

1232
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
Including parents.

1233
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Or the teacher.

1234
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
The mayor.

1235
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
There is a sense of responsibility.

1236
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
So I'm going to do this thing.

1237
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Give him a hard time.

1238
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Not just.

1239
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
It's cool to win.

1240
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
This is also.

1241
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
At the same time.

1242
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
This is what the big brother said.

1243
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
He said.

1244
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
I remember in a place.

1245
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
He said.

1246
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
He will work hard to play.

1247
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Because of fans.

1248
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Because of the coach.

1249
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Because of teammates.

1250
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Not just.

1251
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Because it's cool to win.

1252
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
So he is not.

1253
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
So he is a grateful expression.

1254
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
But his result.

1255
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
On the other hand.

1256
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
He wants to do his job well.

1257
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
And then.

1258
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
This is our data.

1259
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
I can talk a little bit first.

1260
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
That is to say.

1261
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Indeed.

1262
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
There are victims.

1263
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
When he feels grateful.

1264
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
He will.

1265
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
I will show up to work.

1266
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Hard every day.

1267
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
During practice.

1268
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
I don't know.

1269
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
Is this person an athlete?

1270
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Or what?

1271
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Because he wrote.

1272
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
Not very sure.

1273
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
But you can see.

1274
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
When you feel grateful.

1275
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
People really want to.

1276
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
Do your job well.

1277
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
So the assumption is.

1278
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
The assumption is.

1279
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
When grateful.

1280
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
In the United States.

1281
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
For Americans.

1282
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
They would like to.

1283
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Use physical contact.

1284
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
To express gratitude.

1285
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
In Taiwan.

1286
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
There will be more.

1287
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Want this.

1288
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Self-improvement impulse.

1289
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Is there a problem here?

1290
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
Is there a problem here?

1291
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Because I'm going to talk about the experiment later.

1292
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Very fast.

1293
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
Very short.

1294
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Later.

1295
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,120
3.

1296
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
2.

1297
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
1.

1298
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
No good.

1299
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
We continue.

1300
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
Good.

1301
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Good.

1302
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
There is a problem.

1303
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
There is a problem.

1304
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Please say.

1305
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
You can speak into the microphone.

1306
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
If this is easier.

1307
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
Can you hear me?

1308
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
Yes, I can hear you.

1309
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
In fact, it's good to speak into the microphone.

1310
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Because then we can record the voice directly.

1311
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
Don't have to repeat.

1312
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
There are others next to you.

1313
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Sorry.

1314
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,120
I want to ask.

1315
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
That self-contact.

1316
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
With that.

1317
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Self-improvement.

1318
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
These two.

1319
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
Outcome.

1320
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
There is no conflict.

1321
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Not two.

1322
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Conflict.

1323
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Things.

1324
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
That.

1325
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Why.

1326
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
It's possible.

1327
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
In fact, it will.

1328
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Two outcomes.

1329
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Is it mixed together?

1330
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
Oh.

1331
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
It's possible.

1332
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,120
It's possible.

1333
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
Oh.

1334
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
What you say is not confident.

1335
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Wait a minute.

1336
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
What are you not confident about?

1337
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
You say.

1338
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
He wants to have a physical contact.

1339
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
You can also want.

1340
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Self-improvement.

1341
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
Or.

1342
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
There is a kind of behavior.

1343
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
He is self-improvement at the same time.

1344
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
Self-contact.

1345
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Self-contact.

1346
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
For example.

1347
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
You say.

1348
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
When you say Americans.

1349
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
They are more.

1350
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
Feel.

1351
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
When there is a sense of gratitude.

1352
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,120
That.

1353
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Taiwanese.

1354
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
When he feels grateful.

1355
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
He wants.

1356
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Self-improvement.

1357
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
That.

1358
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
But.

1359
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Physical contact.

1360
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
With self-improvement.

1361
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
These two.

1362
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
There is no conflict.

1363
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,120
So is it possible.

1364
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
In fact, Americans.

1365
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
When they are grateful.

1366
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
In addition to wanting physical contact.

1367
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
I also want self-improvement.

1368
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Or.

1369
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Taiwanese.

1370
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Feel.

1371
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
When grateful.

1372
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Want self-improvement.

1373
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Then.

1374
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
But at the same time.

1375
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
I also want to do physical contact.

1376
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
Hey.

1377
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Okay.

1378
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Hey.

1379
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
I think.

1380
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
I think it's possible.

1381
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Both behaviors.

1382
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Are motivated.

1383
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Right.

1384
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Okay.

1385
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
But why do I think.

1386
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
So.

1387
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Let's talk about it.

1388
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Physical contact.

1389
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
In.

1390
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
Americans will be higher.

1391
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Because.

1392
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
Physical contact.

1393
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Is a big move.

1394
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
It is often used in.

1395
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Initiate.

1396
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
New relationship.

1397
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Because you want.

1398
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
From.

1399
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
Originally.

1400
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
Far.

1401
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,120
Social distance.

1402
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Become.

1403
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Literally.

1404
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
You can meet this person.

1405
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
But this.

1406
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Relationship.

1407
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Change.

1408
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
In a.

1409
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Relationship.

1410
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Is in the culture of painting.

1411
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
In fact, it is not easy to happen.

1412
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Not even.

1413
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
Not allowed.

1414
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Like you said.

1415
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
Thank you very much for your teacher.

1416
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
Then you go.

1417
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Kiss him.

1418
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,120
This.

1419
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,120
Isn't it weird?

1420
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
But.

1421
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
In.

1422
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
Physical contact.

1423
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
Is fluid.

1424
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Can.

1425
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
Be allowed to change.

1426
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
The place.

1427
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
The relationship between Zhenjing and the teacher.

1428
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,120
Maybe it can be allowed.

1429
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,120
So I.

1430
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,120
These two behaviors.

1431
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Is.

1432
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
When I assume.

1433
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,120
Independent assumption.

1434
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
That is to say.

1435
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Not a.

1436
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
But a.

1437
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Do you know what I mean?

1438
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
It's not a blow.

1439
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
That is to say.

1440
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
If your enemy.

1441
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
The other one will be high.

1442
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
But I assume the first one.

1443
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
This.

1444
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Physical contact.

1445
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,120
Then the United States will be higher than Taiwan.

1446
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Then the second is.

1447
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,120
Self intimacy.

1448
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
Taiwan will be higher than the United States.

1449
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
But it's not a.

1450
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
Relationship.

1451
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,120
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1452
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
I understand.

1453
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
Thank you.

1454
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
it is good.

1455
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Oh, by the way.

1456
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
And then.

1457
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,120
I didn't finish this just now.

1458
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Self intimacy in the United States.

1459
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,120
It's not supposed to be.

1460
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
I assume it's not very effective.

1461
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
Relatively ineffective.

1462
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Not being used.

1463
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
The reason is.

1464
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,120
Because it's too small.

1465
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
You're here.

1466
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
Kill yourself.

1467
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Do that.

1468
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
This behavior is very.

1469
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Obviously.

1470
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Not very.

1471
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Noticeable.

1472
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
The effect is not dirty.

1473
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,120
Especially in.

1474
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,120
People don't pay attention to others.

1475
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
What are you doing.

1476
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
When.

1477
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
So this effect is not dirty.

1478
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
This is not very.

1479
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
There is no.

1480
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Function.

1481
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
It's not functional.

1482
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Check these two.

1483
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
Two assumptions.

1484
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Oh, by the way.

1485
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
We chose these two assumptions.

1486
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Is deliberately.

1487
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,120
One high.

1488
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Another low.

1489
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Another high.

1490
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
This low.

1491
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Make that contrast.

1492
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
So it is.

1493
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Strategically selected.

1494
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,120
it is good.

1495
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
What about study1?

1496
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
We'll ask the recipient.

1497
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Write some first.

1498
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
He was helped.

1499
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Very happy.

1500
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Very grateful experience.

1501
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
And then.

1502
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,120
Ask him to do one.

1503
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,120
No relevant.

1504
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,120
Task.

1505
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
In this task.

1506
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
Please write something casually.

1507
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
He usually.

1508
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
In everyday life.

1509
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Will be used to express gratitude.

1510
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
He can write one to seven.

1511
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
He wrote it himself.

1512
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
See how many he wants to write.

1513
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
At least one.

1514
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,120
At most seven.

1515
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
But this is with the previous.

1516
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,120
The experience of writing is not related.

1517
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Come again.

1518
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
We asked him to go back.

1519
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
Uh.

1520
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
The previous writing experience.

1521
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
And then in front of the camera.

1522
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Record a passage.

1523
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,120
With.

1524
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
He felt.

1525
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
Let him feel grateful.

1526
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
This person.

1527
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,120
Express his gratitude.

1528
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
And.

1529
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,120
That instruction is to say.

1530
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,120
Let him.

1531
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,120
It's like interacting with this person.

1532
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
The same.

1533
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
And then this movie.

1534
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
It looks like this.

1535
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Like this.

1536
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
So.

1537
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Zha Yong said this movie.

1538
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
If I broadcast it.

1539
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
There will be a very serious lag.

1540
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,120
So I put this.

1541
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
This.

1542
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,120
The website is pasted in the dialogue window.

1543
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Then everyone went to click on it.

1544
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,120
Separately.

1545
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
Tell me after watching.

1546
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,120
It should be.

1547
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
Sorry.

1548
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:15,120
I made a mistake. I didn't cut this video.

1549
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,120
You only need to watch 1 minute and a half.

1550
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,120
1 minute should be enough.

1551
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,120
There's nothing after that.

1552
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,120
He doesn't know what to say.

1553
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:45,120
Sorry.

1554
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,120
I made a mistake.

1555
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,120
You only need to watch 1 minute and a half.

1556
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,120
1 minute should be enough.

1557
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,120
He doesn't know what to say.

1558
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,120
He doesn't know what to say.

1559
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,120
This is an example.

1560
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,120
This is an example.

1561
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,120
This is an example.

1562
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:08,120
This is an example.

1563
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:15,120
After all, he insists that his self-improvement is needed.

1564
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:21,120
Or when he has no one to support him, he argues withkh his facial expression.

1565
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:28,120
Or when he has no one to support him, he argues withkh his facial expression.

1566
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Self-improvement is a nonsense.

1567
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:40,120
This is the data we have collected.

1568
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:50,120
Next, we will ask some research assistants to grade these videos.

1569
00:45:50,120 --> 00:46:00,120
If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

1570
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:10,120
If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

1571
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:20,120
If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

1572
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:30,120
If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

1573
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:43,120
Lastly, if this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

1574
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:50,120
Lastly, if this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.

1575
00:46:50,120 --> 00:47:02,120
If this video has reciprocity, this video will get 1 point.

1576
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:17,120
If this video has reciprocity, this video will get 1 point.

1577
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:30,120
So we are going to compare the presence and absence of these videos.

1578
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,120
So we are going to compare the presence and absence of these videos.

1579
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,120
It's a Logistic Multi-Level Linear Model.

1580
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,120
It's a Logistic Multi-Level Linear Model.

1581
00:47:44,120 --> 00:48:02,120
In this video, we have written 1-7 different ways of expression.

1582
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:08,120
In this video, we have written 1-7 different ways of expression.

1583
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:27,120
Based on these, we can classify the body contact, self-improvement, reciprocity.

1584
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:36,120
Based on these, we can classify the body contact, self-improvement, reciprocity.

1585
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:43,120
There are two of them are self-improvement, and three of them are body contact.

1586
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:52,120
My self-improvement is 1 out of 3, so it's 33%.

1587
00:48:52,120 --> 00:49:03,120
My body contact is 50%, because it's 50% of my expression toolbox.

1588
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
Do you understand?

1589
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,120
So we can classify the data in this way.

1590
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:16,120
In this task, we have self-improvement, body contact, and reciprocity.

1591
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,120
We use uTest to analyze the data.

1592
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,120
You don't need to care about the test, it's just an analysis of the data.

1593
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,120
Let's see the result.

1594
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,120
In this result, there is a bar.

1595
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,120
This bar is the video data.

1596
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:43,120
The box above is the task data.

1597
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Do you know what p-value is?

1598
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,120
If you don't know, just say you don't know.

1599
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,120
3, 2, 1

1600
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Ok, everyone knows.

1601
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Let's say everyone knows what p-value is.

1602
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,120
In the body contact, the blue bar is America, and the red bar is Taiwan.

1603
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:24,120
I don't like the red bar is Taiwan, but I didn't think about it when I chose the color.

1604
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,120
The Americans also don't know why I don't like the red bar.

1605
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
Anyway, it's red.

1606
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:38,120
As you can see, the body contact is higher than Taiwan in general touch.

1607
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,120
You can't see the error bar here, but it's higher.

1608
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,120
The hug is also high.

1609
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:56,120
In the writing data, the Americans also mentioned more body contact-related methods.

1610
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,120
But this one is close, p-value is 0.055.

1611
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,120
Let's look at self-improvement.

1612
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,120
The results of self-improvement are also close, but now the direction is all the opposite.

1613
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:14,120
Taiwan is better at self-improvement than the U.S.

1614
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:20,120
I don't know how they do it, but at least they say they do it well.

1615
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:37,120
There are more videos explaining that self-improvement is a way of expression.

1616
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,120
In the writing data, the Americans also mentioned more self-improvement-related methods.

1617
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:50,120
Finally, there is no noticeable difference in reciprocity or reciprocating kindness.

1618
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:59,120
Even though the blue bar is higher, but there is no noticeable difference.

1619
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:05,120
The results support our assumption.

1620
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:12,120
Taiwan is better at self-improvement than the U.S.

1621
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,120
The U.S. uses more body contact.

1622
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,120
There is no noticeable difference in reciprocity.

1623
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:22,120
The background information of the victim is not important.

1624
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,120
The only thing I want to talk about is this.

1625
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,120
In this study,

1626
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:48,120
Taiwan is in NTSU, National Taiwan Sport University.

1627
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:57,120
The victim is in NTSU, and the U.S. is in UNC.

1628
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,120
This will cause a problem.

1629
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,120
I don't know if you can see my slide.

1630
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,120
The U.S. is in the U.S., and the Taiwanese are in Taiwan.

1631
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,120
This will cause a problem.

1632
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:14,120
This is because the two groups of people have different cultures, so they have different behaviors and preferences.

1633
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:20,120
Or because they were experimented in different places.

1634
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,120
Or because they were experimented in different places, so they have different languages.

1635
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:28,120
If the U.S. people can understand Chinese, they will also behave like Taiwanese.

1636
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,120
Or do the same in Taiwan.

1637
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,120
This is a confounding.

1638
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:41,120
In Study 2, a methodological change is that we collect information from Taiwanese in the U.S.

1639
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:47,120
We collect information from Taiwanese in the U.N.C.

1640
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:54,120
We use English, so there is no linguistic priming.

1641
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:02,120
We were asked by a reviewer, how do you know this has anything to do with gratitude?

1642
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,120
For example, if you ask a Taiwanese, what are you doing right now?

1643
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,120
You don't need any background information.

1644
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,120
You will see that Taiwanese are more self-improving.

1645
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,120
They are self-improving. They are studying and working all day.

1646
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,120
The U.S. people will report to the U.N.C. at any time.

1647
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,120
The reviewer will ask, how do you know this is not a baseline difference?

1648
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:29,120
How does this have anything to do with gratitude?

1649
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,120
Another example, when we are happy, we watch a comedy.

1650
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,120
It's funny. We bump into each other.

1651
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,120
Look at the NBA players.

1652
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,120
One shot, three points.

1653
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,120
They bump into each other.

1654
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,120
This has nothing to do with gratitude.

1655
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,120
I bumped into him.

1656
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,120
It's not his fault.

1657
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,120
Maybe he passed the ball to me.

1658
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,120
Not necessarily.

1659
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,120
So body contact doesn't have to happen in gratitude.

1660
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,120
There may be other positive emotions.

1661
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,120
On the other hand, is self-improvement possible in other positive emotions?

1662
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,120
It's possible.

1663
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,120
When I feel that I am more powerful, I am more capable.

1664
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,120
Am I theoretically more capable of self-improvement?

1665
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,120
It's possible.

1666
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,120
So self-improvement may not necessarily be gratitude.

1667
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,120
It's just a general positivity.

1668
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,120
This positivity indicates that I have more resources now to do this.

1669
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:29,120
Another thing we need to control in Study 2 is

1670
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,120
another positive emotion.

1671
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,120
We need to show that this difference

1672
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,120
is not entirely caused by gratitude,

1673
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,120
but gratitude has a special effect

1674
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,120
on the cultural difference.

1675
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,120
So we ask the reader

1676
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,120
when a stranger or a close other

1677
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,120
feels grateful

1678
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,120
or amused

1679
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,120
by our positive emotions.

1680
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,120
There are 4 conditions.

1681
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,120
2x2

1682
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,120
4 conditions

1683
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,120
The reader will answer 4 times

1684
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,120
in different combinations.

1685
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,120
The reader will ask

1686
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,120
if you want to thank this person

1687
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,120
verbally

1688
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,120
or touch that person

1689
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,120
for whom you feel thankful.

1690
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,120
This is body contact.

1691
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,120
Repay the person.

1692
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,120
This is reciprocity.

1693
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,120
Pay you forward means

1694
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,120
you are good to me,

1695
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,120
I am good to the third person.

1696
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,120
Socialize with the person.

1697
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,120
This is another thing that was mentioned in Study 1.

1698
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,120
He is good to me.

1699
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,120
I feel grateful.

1700
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,120
Let's go shopping with him tomorrow morning.

1701
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,120
In this behavior,

1702
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,120
shopping does not really do anything to this person.

1703
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,120
But this is a socialization behavior.

1704
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,120
Let's play together.

1705
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,120
We think this behavior cannot be

1706
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,120
because it does not

1707
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,120
have a direct benefit to the other person.

1708
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,120
So it cannot be reciprocity.

1709
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,120
He did not pay you forward because there is no third person.

1710
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,120
Will there be touch? I don't know.

1711
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,120
It's not verbally thanks.

1712
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,120
Verbal thanks means I will thank him.

1713
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,120
So he is isolated.

1714
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,120
Finally, improve yourself.

1715
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,120
This is self-improvement.

1716
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,120
So how many questions does the reader answer?

1717
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,120
2x2x123456

1718
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,120
Answer 24 questions.

1719
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,120
Finally,

1720
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,120
for each behavior,

1721
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,120
for each emotion,

1722
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,120
for each relationship,

1723
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,120
we ask two different questions.

1724
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,120
The first one is

1725
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,120
how likely you are

1726
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,120
to do this behavior.

1727
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,120
This is the likelihood

1728
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,120
and preference of their behavior.

1729
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,120
The other one is

1730
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,120
whether you want to do it or not.

1731
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,120
But generally, if someone does it,

1732
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,120
do you think this behavior is bizarre?

1733
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,120
Can you understand?

1734
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,120
This is the second question.

1735
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,120
Is it understandable?

1736
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,120
OK.

1737
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,120
What's the question?

1738
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,120
The reader did a lot of rating.

1739
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,120
3, 2, 1

1740
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,120
Let's assume there is no question.

1741
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,120
Let's look at the result.

1742
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,120
This analysis is tricky

1743
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,120
because we don't compare

1744
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,120
the scores of Taiwanese and Americans.

1745
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,120
In the past,

1746
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,120
I found that

1747
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,120
this kind of rating scale

1748
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,120
is problematic in cross-cultural research.

1749
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,120
Because some people

1750
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,120
such as Japanese, Taiwanese,

1751
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,120
and South Korean

1752
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,120
will deliberately avoid

1753
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,120
extreme scores.

1754
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,120
For example,

1755
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,120
if the score is 1 to 9,

1756
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,120
we will cut it off.

1757
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,120
If the score is 2 to 8,

1758
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,120
we will cut it off.

1759
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,120
No matter what the score is,

1760
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,120
we will cut it off.

1761
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,120
Why?

1762
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,120
Because

1763
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,120
if you think about

1764
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,120
the world of Tai Chi,

1765
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,120
or the so-called

1766
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,120
bias thinking,

1767
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,120
if I ask you

1768
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,120
if you think you are smart,

1769
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
you might say

1770
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,120
you think you are smart,

1771
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,120
but are you extremely smart?

1772
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,120
You might say no.

1773
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,120
Then you might think

1774
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,120
there are smart people in the world.

1775
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,120
But are you really stupid?

1776
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,120
Probably not.

1777
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,120
There are probably more stupid people in the world.

1778
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,120
So you go down to the bottom,

1779
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,120
but you don't see the bottom,

1780
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,120
and you go back.

1781
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,120
So in such a

1782
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,120
extremist culture,

1783
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,120
people tend to avoid extreme scores.

1784
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,120
Any score is.

1785
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,120
Any score is.

1786
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,120
Any score is.

1787
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,120
So we made a

1788
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,120
adjustment here.

1789
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,120
We standardize the scores

1790
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,120
of Taiwan and the US.

1791
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,120
We standardize the scores of Taiwan and the US.

1792
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,120
We only keep within cultural variation.

1793
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,120
Then we do

1794
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,120
the principal component analysis.

1795
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,120
the principal component analysis.

1796
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,120
No matter what you know,

1797
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,120
I don't need to explain.

1798
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,120
I don't need to explain.

1799
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,120
I will explain how to interpret the result later.

1800
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,120
Then we put these six

1801
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,120
behaviors

1802
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,120
in each culture.

1803
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,120
So the scores of each culture

1804
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,120
are standardized to 0.

1805
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,120
mean to 0, standard deviation to 1.

1806
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,120
mean to 0, standard deviation to 1.

1807
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,120
Then for these six scores, we run the principal component analysis.

1808
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,120
Then for these six scores, we run the principal component analysis.

1809
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,120
Then we found that

1810
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,120
these six scores

1811
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,120
can form two components.

1812
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,120
can form two components.

1813
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,120
With these two components,

1814
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,120
we can effectively summarize

1815
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,120
the variation of these six behaviors.

1816
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,120
the variation of these six behaviors.

1817
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,120
We named these two components

1818
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,120
We named these two components

1819
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,120
expression and affiliation.

1820
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,120
You will know why later.

1821
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,120
But let's talk about how to interpret the result.

1822
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,120
But let's talk about how to interpret the result.

1823
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,120
As you can see,

1824
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,120
there are six behaviors.

1825
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,120
there are six behaviors.

1826
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,120
The inner circle of the radar

1827
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,120
is negative 0.5 to 0.

1828
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,120
is negative 0.5 to 0.

1829
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,120
For example,

1830
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,120
if reciprocating kindness is 0,

1831
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,120
if reciprocating kindness is 0,

1832
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,120
it has nothing to do with the expression component.

1833
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,120
it has nothing to do with the expression component.

1834
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,120
If it is negative,

1835
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,120
it is completely negative.

1836
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,120
If the component is higher,

1837
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,120
the reciprocating kindness will be lower.

1838
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,120
The middle circle is 0 to 0.5.

1839
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,120
The middle circle is 0 to 0.5.

1840
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,120
The outer circle is 0.5 to 1.

1841
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,120
The outer circle is 0.5 to 1.

1842
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,120
It's a strong link.

1843
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,120
It's a strong link.

1844
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,120
There are six behaviors.

1845
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,120
There are six behaviors.

1846
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,120
The blue line is the same as the United States.

1847
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,120
The blue line is the same as the United States.

1848
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,120
For the United States,

1849
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,120
the expression component

1850
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,120
can summarize

1851
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,120
can summarize

1852
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,120
some behavior variations.

1853
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,120
The most is verbal acknowledgement.

1854
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,120
It's almost equal to verbal acknowledgement.

1855
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,120
Perfect correlation.

1856
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,120
There is also reciprocating kindness.

1857
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,120
There is also reciprocating kindness.

1858
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,120
These three behaviors

1859
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,120
can be used on the spot.

1860
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,120
can be used on the spot.

1861
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,120
Body contact

1862
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,120
has a high loading.

1863
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,120
For the Americans,

1864
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,120
for the Americans,

1865
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,120
for the Americans,

1866
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,120
the use of body contact

1867
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,120
is similar to verbal acknowledgement.

1868
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,120
is similar to verbal acknowledgement.

1869
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,120
is similar to verbal acknowledgement.

1870
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,120
Self-improvement is almost zero.

1871
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,120
Self-improvement is almost zero.

1872
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,120
But if you look at the results in Taiwan,

1873
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,120
But if you look at the results in Taiwan,

1874
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,120
verbal acknowledgement,

1875
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,120
reciprocating kindness,

1876
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,120
and pay you forward are all outside the circle.

1877
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,120
We will use these three behaviors

1878
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,120
to express gratitude.

1879
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,120
We all know in our lives.

1880
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,120
But body contact is now

1881
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,120
I remember this point 3.

1882
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,120
A very awkward position.

1883
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,120
A very awkward position.

1884
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,120
But at the same time,

1885
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,120
self-improvement has gone out.

1886
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,120
Self-improvement

1887
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,120
Self-improvement

1888
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,120
is similar to

1889
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,120
verbal acknowledgement,

1890
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,120
pay you forward,

1891
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,120
and reciprocating kindness.

1892
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,120
We see that

1893
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,120
these three behaviors

1894
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,120
verbal acknowledgement, pay you forward,

1895
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,120
and reciprocating kindness

1896
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,120
are not cultural differences.

1897
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,120
But

1898
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,120
But

1899
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,120
the two behaviors

1900
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,120
self-improvement and body contact

1901
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,120
the two behaviors

1902
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,120
are different.

1903
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,120
The two behaviors are different.

1904
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,120
This component is named

1905
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,120
expression

1906
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,120
because it is

1907
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,120
derived from verbal acknowledgement

1908
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,120
and reciprocating kindness.

1909
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,120
derived from verbal acknowledgement

1910
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,120
It is very expressive.

1911
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,120
On the other hand,

1912
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,120
the second component

1913
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,120
is socializing.

1914
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,120
It is more interactive.

1915
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,120
It is more interactive.

1916
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,120
It is more interactive.

1917
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,120
The two cultures are relatively high.

1918
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,120
The two cultures are relatively high.

1919
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,120
Interestingly,

1920
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,120
if the component 1

1921
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,120
if the component 1

1922
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,120
is not explained,

1923
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,120
it will be pushed here, including socializing.

1924
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,120
For both cultures, socializing is pushed here.

1925
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,120
For both cultures, socializing is pushed here.

1926
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,120
We call it affiliation.

1927
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,120
But for Americans,

1928
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,120
self-improvement is pushed here.

1929
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,120
Body contact is negative.

1930
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,120
Body contact is negative.

1931
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,120
For Taiwanese,

1932
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,120
For Taiwanese,

1933
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,120
self-improvement is not

1934
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,120
under the same category as socializing.

1935
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,120
self-improvement is not under the same category as socializing.

1936
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,120
But body contact is.

1937
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,120
You can imagine.

1938
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,120
You can imagine.

1939
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,120
You can imagine.

1940
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,120
You can imagine.

1941
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,120
When do we have contact with others?

1942
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,120
When do we have contact with others?

1943
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,120
Only in a long-term, intimate relationship.

1944
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,120
Only in a long-term, intimate relationship.

1945
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,120
But when can we do self-improvement?

1946
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,120
When can we do self-improvement?

1947
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,120
When it's time to do it.

1948
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,120
So it is expression.

1949
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,120
So it is expression.

1950
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,120
But affiliation-wise,

1951
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,120
body contact is the concept.

1952
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,120
But in contrast,

1953
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,120
body contact is the concept.

1954
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,120
body contact is the concept.

1955
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,120
What to do is your own business.

1956
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
But for long-term relationship,

1957
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,120
they will do self-improvement.

1958
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,120
they will do self-improvement.

1959
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,120
But it's not in the same context.

1960
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,120
But it's not in the same context.

1961
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,120
Last one.

1962
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,120
Last one.

1963
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,120
Last one.

1964
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,120
Excluding asking people in these two cultures,

1965
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,120
asking people in these two cultures,

1966
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,120
can you understand?

1967
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,120
If someone did it,

1968
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,120
if someone did it,

1969
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,120
It was not very well understood.

1970
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,120
The picture you see is the part of understanding.

1971
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,120
The picture you see is the part of understanding.

1972
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,120
There is little difference between the two cultures,

1973
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,120
Especially the expression,

1974
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,120
the Americans and Taiwanese

1975
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,120
almost overlap.

1976
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,120
This shows that Americans

1977
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,120
can understand what self-improvement is.

1978
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,120
It can be used to express gratitude.

1979
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,120
It can be used to express gratitude.

1980
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,120
Taiwan is OK.

1981
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,120
Taiwan is OK.

1982
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,120
But naturally,

1983
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,120
it's not that the two cultures can't understand each other.

1984
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,120
It's just that their behavior choices are different.

1985
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,120
It's just that their behavior choices are different.

1986
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,120
The implication of this is that

1987
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,120
the expression of gratitude

1988
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,120
The expression of gratitude

1989
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,120
is a conscious behavior.

1990
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,120
is a conscious behavior.

1991
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,120
In front of me,

1992
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,120
I can think of these options,

1993
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,120
and I consciously choose this

1994
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,120
and I consciously choose this

1995
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,120
because it fits my context

1996
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,120
or my culture or cultural context.

1997
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,120
or my cultural context.

1998
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,120
My options are only some.

1999
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,120
My options are only some.

2000
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,120
Only in my culture.

2001
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,120
Only in my culture.

2002
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,120
Let's summarize it.

2003
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,120
Verbal acknowledgment,

2004
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,120
reciprocal kindness, and paying you forward

2005
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,120
are the same in both cultures.

2006
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,120
But bodily contact

2007
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,120
But bodily contact

2008
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,120
Bye-bye.

2009
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,120
Bye-bye.

2010
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,120
Sky is gone.

2011
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,120
Sky is gone.

2012
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,120
Sky is gone.

2013
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,120
Sky is gone.

2014
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,120
In the US,

2015
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,120
bodily contact

2016
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
and these three universal behaviors

2017
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,120
and these three universal behaviors

2018
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,120
are tied together,

2019
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,120
but there is no self-improvement.

2020
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,120
On the other hand, in Taiwan,

2021
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,120
self-improvement is tied,

2022
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,120
but bodily contact is not.

2023
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,120
What is implication?

2024
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,120
What is implication?

2025
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,120
We call it universal.

2026
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,120
We call it universal.

2027
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,120
Obviously,

2028
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,120
emotions are expressed

2029
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,120
in different cultures.

2030
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,120
Is there anything

2031
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,120
in cross-cultural

2032
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,120
that is universal?

2033
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,120
that is universal?

2034
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,120
In our research,

2035
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,120
although the behavior is different,

2036
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,120
although the behavior is different,

2037
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,120
but the function,

2038
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,120
at least gratitude,

2039
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,120
is the same.

2040
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,120
It is to build or maintain relationships.

2041
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,120
Gratitude is used to support

2042
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,120
interpersonal relationships.

2043
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,120
Just because interpersonal relationships

2044
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,120
are in different cultures,

2045
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,120
in different structures,

2046
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,120
in different ways,

2047
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,120
so you have to fit the relational structure

2048
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,120
to use different relationships.

2049
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,120
So functional universal exists.

2050
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,120
If you keep this function

2051
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,120
in the second line,

2052
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,120
if you make this function

2053
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
a constant,

2054
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,120
then you have to adjust the behavior

2055
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,120
to fit the culture.

2056
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,120
That's what we want to say.

2057
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,120
Thank you.

2058
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,120
Any questions?

2059
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,120
Let me answer the question.

2060
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,120
Is it because the country is

2061
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,120
confused, so it develops extreme

2062
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,120
individualism, or

2063
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,120
is it because the people in the country

2064
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,120
have the characteristics of individualism?

2065
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,120
I think this question can be divided into

2066
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,120
two levels.

2067
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,120
The first is that

2068
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,120
they are such a country,

2069
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,120
so they develop such a culture.

2070
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,120
Then you dig up the culture,

2071
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,120
it may not be individualism,

2072
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,120
it may not be confusion.

2073
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,120
So is it the current situation

2074
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,120
that affects their culture,

2075
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,120
or is it the current culture

2076
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,120
that affects their current situation?

2077
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,120
Or is it a specific culture,

2078
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,120
or is it American culture?

2079
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,120
Is it because they are in a

2080
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,120
confused environment,

2081
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,120
or is it American culture?

2082
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,120
Is it a specific case,

2083
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,120
or is it a general culture?

2084
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,120
Let me make it simple.

2085
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,120
It's the United States.

2086
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,120
I think both exist in the United States.

2087
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,120
The history of the United States

2088
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,120
is about immigration.

2089
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,120
Immigration to a new continent.

2090
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,120
So it's a country

2091
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,120
that's in a state of confusion.

2092
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,120
In such a natural environment,

2093
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,120
as I just argued,

2094
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,120
you need to form

2095
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,120
a form of individualism

2096
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,120
and a way of

2097
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,120
living

2098
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,120
to create

2099
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,120
a new natural environment,

2100
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,120
a new continent.

2101
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,120
So it looks like

2102
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,120
it's possible for

2103
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,120
confusion to form individualism.

2104
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,120
But at the same time,

2105
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,120
why did Mayflower

2106
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,120
come to the United States in the first place?

2107
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,120
Because of religious reform.

2108
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,120
What is religious reform?

2109
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,120
It's when churches

2110
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,120
form a rigid

2111
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,120
social organization.

2112
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,120
They want to

2113
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,120
connect with God.

2114
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,120
Is this religious reform?

2115
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,120
No, it's not.

2116
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,120
Mayflower is the UK.

2117
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,120
But if we

2118
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,120
look at new religion reform

2119
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,120
it's a form of individualism.

2120
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,120
Individualism

2121
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,120
forces people to

2122
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,120
live in a state of confusion.

2123
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,120
That's where the UK came from.

2124
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,120
But what I'm talking about

2125
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,120
is American culture and natural environment.

2126
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,120
If you

2127
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,120
dig it up

2128
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,120
into an empty X,

2129
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,120
what would it be?

2130
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,120
If you dig it up into an empty X,

2131
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,120
what would it be?

2132
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,120
I think both are possible.

2133
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,120
Maybe

2134
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,120
we need more

2135
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,120
evidence to support it.

2136
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,120
But at least

2137
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,120
in East Asian culture,

2138
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,120
I think both

2139
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,120
are possible.

2140
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,120
A study found that

2141
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,120
in places where

2142
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,120
there's a flood,

2143
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,120
compared to

2144
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,120
wheat fields,

2145
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,120
it's easier to

2146
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,120
form collectivism.

2147
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,120
Why?

2148
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,120
Because you need to

2149
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,120
work with others.

2150
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,120
So natural environment

2151
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,120
creates culture.

2152
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,120
On the other hand,

2153
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,120
people who are

2154
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,120
used to collectivism

2155
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,120
will they

2156
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,120
enhance the environment?

2157
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,120
I think they will.

2158
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,120
It's simple.

2159
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,120
You can't

2160
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,120
just let it go.

2161
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,120
It's been happening in history.

2162
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,120
So

2163
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,120
I think the UK-UK relationship

2164
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,120
is also possible, at least in East Asian culture.

2165
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,120
But I can't say

2166
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,120
how far it can go.

2167
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,120
I've answered this question.

2168
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,120
Here's another question.

2169
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,120
There's a small question.

2170
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,120
Have you seen a similar research

2171
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,120
but in European culture?

2172
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,120
I'm curious

2173
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,120
if European culture is similar to

2174
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,120
American or Asian culture.

2175
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,120
Some European cultures

2176
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,120
are similar.

2177
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,120
I've seen

2178
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,120
a similar article.

2179
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,120
It's from the UK.

2180
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,120
The result

2181
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,120
is my interpretation.

2182
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,120
The UK's gratitude

2183
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,120
is stuck

2184
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,120
in the American way

2185
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,120
and the

2186
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,120
collectivism way.

2187
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,120
I think the article

2188
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,120
is funny.

2189
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,120
It's like

2190
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,120
all people see white people

2191
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,120
as the same race,

2192
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,120
but all research is about Americans.

2193
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,120
All people see

2194
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,120
Western culture as the same race,

2195
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,120
but it's all about Americans.

2196
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,120
He can't stand it

2197
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,120
because he's British.

2198
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,120
Fukuyama

2199
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,120
talks about

2200
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,120
trust between people

2201
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,120
as a

2202
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,120
social capital.

2203
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,120
Social capital is

2204
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,120
something that can be fulfilled.

2205
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,120
Let me put it this way.

2206
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,120
He thinks people's trust

2207
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,120
can be fulfilled.

2208
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
He's a

2209
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,120
Japanese-American.

2210
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,120
His first name is

2211
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,120
Francis.

2212
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,120
He's American.

2213
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,120
He has a strong Japanese identity.

2214
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,120
He thinks

2215
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,120
culture should be divided.

2216
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,120
He looks at Italy,

2217
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,120
Germany,

2218
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,120
France, South and North.

2219
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,120
He divides them.

2220
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,120
His argument is

2221
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,120
that

2222
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,120
he divides

2223
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,120
several different collectivism.

2224
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,120
At least he thinks

2225
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,120
Italy,

2226
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,120
South and

2227
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,120
Mexico,

2228
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,120
and some South American countries

2229
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,120
are collectivism.

2230
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,120
I don't know if you have

2231
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,120
friends in Mexico.

2232
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,120
Their family concept is anti-Semitism.

2233
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,120
It's like

2234
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,120
East Asian culture.

2235
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,120
They also have

2236
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,120
honor culture.

2237
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,120
If you insult

2238
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,120
my family,

2239
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,120
I'll kill you.

2240
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,120
If you insult my family,

2241
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,120
I'll kill you.

2242
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,120
But I have to kill you.

2243
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,120
You can see this

2244
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,120
in the UK

2245
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,120
and Mexico.

2246
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,120
That's right.

2247
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,120
Fashion Fury is like this.

2248
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,120
Everything is for family.

2249
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,120
When I was in class,

2250
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,120
I told my students

2251
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,120
that it's quite special.

2252
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,120
You're investigating

2253
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,120
a car thief.

2254
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,120
You can catch him.

2255
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,120
But you can't.

2256
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,120
He felt the strong family bond.

2257
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,120
So he

2258
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,120
stole a car.

2259
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,120
That's Fashion Fury.

2260
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,120
So

2261
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,120
there's

2262
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,120
another thing

2263
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,120
I want to say.

2264
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,120
We didn't

2265
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,120
push it

2266
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,120
to individualism

2267
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,120
and collectivism.

2268
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,120
When we talk about

2269
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,120
individualism, we're talking about

2270
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,120
America.

2271
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,120
Collectivism is like

2272
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,120
Taiwan, Japan, Korea.

2273
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,120
We don't know

2274
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,120
whether other countries

2275
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,120
can fit

2276
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,120
this

2277
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,120
dimensionalized

2278
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,120
distinction.

2279
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,120
So I'm careful

2280
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,120
comparing Taiwan and America.

2281
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,120
These two specific

2282
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,120
entities.

2283
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,120
We're not

2284
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,120
drawing two dots on a dimension.

2285
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,120
But when we draw,

2286
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
we still follow

2287
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,120
the past research.

2288
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,120
It's a limitation.

2289
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,120
Any other questions?

2290
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,120
Hello.

2291
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,120
Hello.

2292
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,120
You go first.

2293
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,120
The self-improvement

2294
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,120
you mentioned earlier.

2295
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,120
Is it

2296
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,120
a common

2297
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,120
professional term?

2298
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,120
Or

2299
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,120
is it special?

2300
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,120
It sounds

2301
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,120
like

2302
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,120
you're grateful

2303
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,120
for the self-improvement.

2304
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,120
It sounds like

2305
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,120
you want to do

2306
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,120
what you want

2307
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,120
according to your expectations.

2308
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,120
You want to satisfy

2309
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,120
your partner's expectations.

2310
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,120
But what I do

2311
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,120
when I satisfy

2312
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,120
my partner's expectations

2313
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,120
doesn't mean

2314
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,120
I'm improving something.

2315
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,120
Do you understand?

2316
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,120
I understand.

2317
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,120
In this case,

2318
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,120
your research still

2319
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,120
classified as self-improvement.

2320
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,120
But in fact,

2321
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,120
it's not improving anything.

2322
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,120
It's just satisfying

2323
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,120
your partner's expectations.

2324
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,120
That's what I mean.

2325
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,120
I agree.

2326
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,120
From this perspective,

2327
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,120
it's still

2328
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,120
satisfying your partner's expectations.

2329
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,120
It's like reciprocity.

2330
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,120
But interestingly,

2331
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,120
if we ask

2332
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,120
what you expect

2333
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,120
from your partner,

2334
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,120
you expect

2335
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,120
a better

2336
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,120
social role.

2337
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,120
For example,

2338
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,120
if my mom wants me to become

2339
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,120
a better student,

2340
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,120
or she wants me to repay her.

2341
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,120
There's a cultural difference

2342
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,120
in expectation.

2343
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,120
If you say

2344
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,120
you satisfy your partner's expectations,

2345
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,120
but we found

2346
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,120
cultural differences.

2347
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,120
You're just

2348
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,120
using the difference

2349
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,120
in expectation

2350
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,120
to explain.

2351
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,120
Otherwise,

2352
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,120
the result won't be there.

2353
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,120
I think

2354
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,120
your question is

2355
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,120
interesting and good.

2356
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,120
Because it shows

2357
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,120
that

2358
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,120
on the surface,

2359
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,120
there's a cultural difference

2360
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,120
in appreciation

2361
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,120
and universality.

2362
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,120
But

2363
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,120
we need to dig deeper.

2364
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,120
For example,

2365
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,120
you think the expectation is the same,

2366
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,120
but the result

2367
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,120
is different.

2368
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,120
I can accept that.

2369
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,120
Do you have an answer?

2370
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,120
Yes.

2371
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,120
There's an interesting point

2372
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,120
about expectation.

2373
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,120
I didn't expect that.

2374
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,120
I have another question.

2375
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,120
You said that

2376
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,120
appreciation can help

2377
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,120
interpersonal relationships.

2378
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,120
Am I right?

2379
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,120
Yes.

2380
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,120
When you talk about interpersonal relationships,

2381
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,120
you need to think about yourself

2382
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,120
and your partner.

2383
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,120
When I appreciate my partner,

2384
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,120
it's just a one-way relationship.

2385
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,120
It's not about

2386
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,120
how my partner reacts to my appreciation.

2387
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,120
If it's not about

2388
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,120
how my partner reacts to my appreciation,

2389
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,120
it's hard to talk about

2390
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,120
the impact of appreciation

2391
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,120
on interpersonal relationships.

2392
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,120
I only talked about one-way relationship.

2393
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,120
I didn't talk about

2394
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,120
how my partner reacts to my appreciation.

2395
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,120
I can't talk about

2396
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,120
how my relationship

2397
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,120
with my partner

2398
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,120
will improve

2399
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,120
after the whole process.

2400
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,120
If we need to think about

2401
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,120
how to improve

2402
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,120
interpersonal relationships,

2403
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,120
we need to think about

2404
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,120
how to improve

2405
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,120
our partner's reaction.

2406
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,120
How to design

2407
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,120
such a research?

2408
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,120
I think

2409
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,120
this is a

2410
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,120
good question.

2411
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,120
I think

2412
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,120
this is a good question.

2413
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,120
It sounds like

2414
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,120
it's a compliment.

2415
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,120
I think

2416
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,120
it's a good question.

2417
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,120
As I said before,

2418
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,120
I totally agree with you.

2419
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,120
As I said before,

2420
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,120
emotion culture

2421
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,120
has a set of

2422
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,120
ways of expression.

2423
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,120
In addition to a group of people

2424
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,120
who are used to this way of expression,

2425
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,120
at the same time,

2426
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,120
a group of people

2427
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,120
who can understand

2428
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,120
their partner's way of expression

2429
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,120
can achieve

2430
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,120
their goal.

2431
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,120
Otherwise, it's useless.

2432
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,120
So,

2433
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,120
in this project,

2434
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,120
in addition to the difference in expression,

2435
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,120
we also assume

2436
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,120
the difference in perception.

2437
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,120
As you said,

2438
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,120
people who receive appreciation

2439
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,120
can interpret it

2440
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,120
as expected,

2441
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,120
and turn this interpretation

2442
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,120
into

2443
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,120
a friendly signal

2444
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,120
to promote the relationship.

2445
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,120
We are doing this now.

2446
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,120
We are doing this now.

2447
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,120
This should not be

2448
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,120
an answer to your question.

2449
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,120
I just said I agree.

2450
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,120
We are doing this now.

2451
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,120
But I understand.

2452
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,120
As you said,

2453
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,120
when we study

2454
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,120
how a person expresses

2455
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,120
his appreciation,

2456
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,120
it also represents

2457
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,120
appreciation.

2458
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,120
I can understand.

2459
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,120
Thank you.

2460
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,120
Okay.

2461
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,120
Thank you, everyone.

2462
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,120
We are running out of time.

2463
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,120
But it was a great talk.

2464
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,120
Thank you for your questions.

2465
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,120
Thank you again to our speaker,

2466
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,120
Zhang Yanping.

2467
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,120
Thank you, everyone.

2468
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,120
Now, it's my turn to share the screen.

2469
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,120
Wait for me.

2470
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,120
Now,

2471
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,120
can you see

2472
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,120
my screen?

2473
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,120
Can you?

2474
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,120
I can see myself.

2475
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
So,

2476
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,120
you can see Zhang Yanping's website, right?

2477
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,120
