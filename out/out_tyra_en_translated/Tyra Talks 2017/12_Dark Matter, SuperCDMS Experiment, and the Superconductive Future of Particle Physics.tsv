0	2000	Okay
2000	4000	Oh
4000	6000	F
6000	8000	Oh, I forgot
8000	10000	Share
10000	12000	Share screen
12000	14000	Wow
22000	24000	Okay
26000	28000	Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today
28000	30000	is
30000	32000	Dark Matter Super CDMS
32000	34000	which is what I'm doing right now
34000	36000	and the Super Conductive Future
36000	38000	of Particle Physics
38000	40000	which is
40000	42000	what I'm doing right now
42000	44000	Okay, next page
44000	46000	The topic I'm going to talk about today
46000	48000	will be divided into two parts
48000	50000	The first part is
50000	52000	the physical part
52000	54000	I'm going to talk about Dark Matter
54000	56000	which is mainly
56000	58000	focused on
58000	60000	the direct detection
60000	62000	part of the experiment
62000	64000	What is its physics?
64000	66000	What is the current
66000	68000	state of the field?
68000	70000	What is everyone's goal? What are the difficulties?
70000	72000	How to do this experiment? How to measure this thing?
72000	74000	It should be more reliable
74000	76000	and more interesting
76000	78000	The second part will be my own work
78000	80000	which is quite R&D
80000	82000	People who are interested in
82000	84000	technology may be more interested
84000	86000	But it should be very related
86000	88000	Okay
88000	90000	My screen is a bit laggy
90000	92000	First of all, because we have already
92000	94000	introduced it before
94000	96000	What is
96000	98000	the basic example
98000	100000	of a
100000	102000	model and a theoretical basis
102000	104000	So I'm going to talk about it very quickly
104000	106000	So basically
106000	108000	Can you see my mouse?
108000	110000	Can you see my mouse?
110000	112000	Can you see it?
112000	114000	There are many basic examples
114000	116000	We think these basic examples
116000	118000	are the basic materials
118000	120000	we know
120000	122000	in the universe
122000	124000	But
124000	126000	because of some reasons
126000	128000	we think there are still things in the universe
128000	130000	that we don't know
130000	132000	We can't use this model to explain
132000	134000	But anyway, this is called Standard Model
134000	136000	It is the best description
136000	138000	If you are
138000	140000	interested in this
140000	142000	You can look it up on Wikipedia
142000	144000	There are six quarks
144000	146000	three leptons
146000	148000	neutrinos
148000	150000	and X
150000	152000	Okay
152000	154000	The point I want to talk about today
154000	156000	will focus on
156000	158000	the ones you can see on the screen
158000	160000	The red one is a mole
160000	162000	The blue one is a neutrino
162000	164000	Basically, this is
164000	166000	the most important example for us
166000	168000	Because honestly, in life
168000	170000	the most important thing is
170000	172000	the things you are interested in
172000	174000	the things you breathe
174000	176000	and the things that make up you
176000	178000	These are the only two
178000	180000	Okay
180000	182000	Then
182000	184000	Sorry, there are electrons
184000	186000	These are the three
186000	188000	There is another important one
188000	190000	The white ghost
190000	192000	It is called light
192000	194000	It sounds very mysterious
194000	196000	like a laser gun
196000	198000	So
198000	200000	these things
200000	202000	exchange light like baseball
202000	204000	and they will
204000	206000	reach the energy balance
206000	208000	Basically, the heat balance
208000	210000	After reaching the heat balance
210000	212000	everything will have a black hole
212000	214000	Okay
214000	216000	This is very important
216000	218000	Because my family often ask me
218000	220000	Is dark matter a black hole?
220000	222000	Actually, it is not
222000	224000	You will know why
224000	226000	It is very vague
226000	228000	This is the universe we usually see
228000	230000	When we look at it
230000	232000	the whole universe is black
232000	234000	Then you will say
234000	236000	Why do we think
236000	238000	everything is the matter we know
238000	240000	and it will exchange light
240000	242000	like a baseball
242000	244000	This is actually
244000	246000	the universe we see
246000	248000	with a good instrument
248000	250000	Like this
250000	252000	The whole universe is basically bright
252000	254000	The different colors
254000	256000	are basically the same as the black hole
256000	258000	It corresponds to different temperatures
258000	260000	Okay
260000	262000	You see the brightest one in the middle
262000	264000	It is the galactic plane
264000	266000	There are many planets
266000	268000	and a lot of energy
268000	270000	So there will be a lot of energy
270000	272000	Okay
272000	274000	My mouse
274000	276000	Okay, you see the back
276000	278000	This part is very red
278000	280000	The energy here is very low
280000	282000	It only has a foreground
282000	284000	It only has a background
284000	286000	The background is the whole background of the universe
286000	288000	It is very cold
288000	290000	It is only 3 degrees K
290000	292000	But basically it has a temperature
292000	294000	So we can still see it
294000	296000	Okay
296000	298000	This picture is basically
298000	300000	filled with colors
300000	302000	How can we say there is any dark matter
302000	304000	that we don't know
304000	306000	Let me see the next page
306000	308000	Because there was a very wise man
308000	310000	He said
310000	312000	Vader was seduced by
312000	314000	The dark side of the force
314000	316000	The dark side of the force
316000	318000	The force is what gives Jedi his power
318000	320000	It's an energy field
320000	322000	created by all living things
322000	324000	It surrounds us
324000	326000	It permits us
326000	328000	It binds the galaxy together
328000	330000	It sounds very confusing
330000	332000	I don't know what he is talking about
332000	334000	So I will focus on it
334000	336000	The dark side of the force
336000	338000	Behind the galaxy together
338000	340000	This sentence is probably
340000	342000	from 1976
342000	344000	So you can imagine
344000	346000	this is the era when we started to
346000	348000	be interested in dark matter
348000	350000	This statement is correct
350000	352000	We started to be interested in dark matter
352000	354000	Okay
354000	356000	Okay
356000	358000	Actually
358000	360000	What did Obeah Kenobi mean by this?
360000	362000	This means
362000	364000	There's a picture here
364000	366000	The brightest place is
366000	368000	the center of our galaxy
368000	370000	Then the horizontal axis
370000	372000	is the distance from the center of the galaxy to the outside
372000	374000	The vertical axis is
374000	376000	the particle
376000	378000	in that position
378000	380000	The speed of rotation around the center of the galaxy
380000	382000	Then you can see
382000	384000	the yellow data
384000	386000	The yellow data is
386000	388000	the stars over there
388000	390000	Okay, like the sun
390000	392000	So we can see those stars
392000	394000	are moving
394000	396000	Then we can see
396000	398000	the center of the yellow data
398000	400000	is the galaxy
400000	402000	That is
402000	404000	the size of the galaxy
404000	406000	300 years ago
406000	408000	Then we found
408000	410000	we can keep looking out
410000	412000	according to the
412000	414000	dark radiation
414000	416000	We can see the infrared
416000	418000	Then we can see
418000	420000	the blue hyperfine structure
420000	422000	The blue dot
422000	424000	is the light source
424000	426000	of the moon
426000	428000	You can keep pushing
428000	430000	to the outside
430000	432000	the position of 50,000 light years
432000	434000	It can be connected
434000	436000	This is what we know
436000	438000	the size of a galaxy
438000	440000	Okay
440000	442000	Then we can see
442000	444000	the speed of
444000	446000	the particles
446000	448000	we see
448000	450000	We can
450000	452000	There is a point
452000	454000	According to the theory of relativity
454000	456000	It is basically Newton's law
456000	458000	According to
458000	460000	the traditional law we know
460000	462000	We can guess
462000	464000	We just see the speed
464000	466000	We can guess
466000	468000	the speed of rotation
468000	470000	around the orbit
470000	472000	So we get
472000	474000	the following line
474000	476000	Okay
476000	478000	But actually
478000	480000	we observe
480000	482000	the speed of rotation is the line above
482000	484000	Okay
484000	486000	So
486000	488000	you will find
488000	490000	the speed of rotation
490000	492000	is the speed of the line above
492000	494000	The actual weight of the orbit
494000	496000	is much more than
496000	498000	what we can see
498000	500000	Okay
500000	502000	So we really can't see it
502000	504000	In the 1980s
504000	506000	That's because
506000	508000	our instrumentation is not good enough
508000	510000	We can't see anything
510000	512000	Okay
512000	514000	So there were some
514000	516000	disputes about dark matter
516000	518000	Then
518000	520000	in the 1980s and 1990s
520000	522000	we started to know
522000	524000	that everything we can see is almost right
524000	526000	So we started to think
526000	528000	whether the particles we know
528000	530000	can meet this nature
530000	532000	The answer is yes
532000	534000	There are three kinds of particles
534000	536000	called neutrons
536000	538000	There are three kinds of particles
538000	540000	called neutrons
540000	542000	They do have this nature
542000	544000	But the neutrons we know
544000	546000	This is the point
546000	548000	Some people think we don't know neutrons
548000	550000	The neutrons we already know
550000	552000	basically
552000	554000	have something to do
554000	556000	with the particles
556000	558000	we already know
558000	560000	Because particles and neutrons
560000	562000	have something to do with the ratio
562000	564000	When they change,
564000	566000	they will use it
566000	568000	So according to all the stars we observed
568000	570000	Those stars are all neutrons
570000	572000	We can infer
572000	574000	how many neutrons there are
574000	576000	Can it
576000	578000	cover
578000	580000	our missing mass budget
580000	582000	The answer is that it can't exceed 6%
582000	584000	It can't exceed 6%
584000	586000	Okay
586000	588000	So basically we think
588000	590000	it might be new physics
598000	600000	The answer is that it shouldn't, right?
602000	604000	Because the quality you see
604000	606000	is a virtual line
606000	608000	So if I have more
608000	610000	missing mass
610000	612000	I think it will fit the original data
614000	616000	So when you plot the upper line
616000	618000	How do you know
618000	620000	when you have more missing mass?
622000	624000	Let me write a book
634000	636000	Is it easier to plot like this?
636000	638000	Let's say the middle part is symmetric
638000	640000	We can think of it as the middle part
640000	642000	Oh
642000	644000	Oh
644000	646000	It's the
646000	648000	transverse speed
648000	650000	Yes
650000	652000	Oh no
652000	654000	It's the speed of rotation
654000	656000	So you can see
656000	658000	The real speed
658000	660000	is a few hundred
660000	662000	kilometers per second
662000	664000	So it's really slow
664000	666000	So basically
666000	668000	it's a neutron
668000	670000	It doesn't have to be close to the speed of light
670000	672000	Okay
672000	674000	This number is a bit important
674000	676000	Actually Darkmatter
676000	678000	has a lot of clues
678000	680000	I won't say it's evidence
680000	682000	So there are a lot of clues
682000	684000	This clue is actually
684000	686000	the most suspicious
686000	688000	It has a lot of reasons not to think like this
688000	690000	But Darkmatter has a lot of other
690000	692000	clues
692000	694000	If you are interested, you can ask
694000	696000	But basically this is the most important to us
696000	698000	Okay
698000	700000	Anyway
700000	702000	We need to have additional
702000	704000	quality to generate additional benefits
704000	706000	Or somehow
706000	708000	your theory needs to generate additional benefits
708000	710000	to explain this question
710000	712000	Do you have any questions for Darkmatter?
712000	714000	Okay
714000	716000	Then I'll jump straight to
716000	718000	This is an interesting article
718000	720000	I've seen recently
720000	722000	And I think
722000	724000	you should know better than me
724000	726000	Okay
750000	752000	Okay
752000	754000	You should know who this is
754000	756000	Yeah
756000	758000	This is the latest
758000	760000	CERN Courier
760000	762000	article
762000	764000	It's
764000	766000	I magnified the point
766000	768000	But I still have a citation
768000	770000	So I magnified the citation
770000	772000	It says
772000	774000	Let's see where to start
774000	776000	Okay
776000	778000	Let's see
778000	780000	It
780000	782000	Let's see
782000	784000	It should be here
784000	786000	It says
786000	788000	EPR pair
788000	790000	referred to
790000	792000	EPR pair
792000	794000	referred to ER Einstein Rosenbridge
794000	796000	and one part that connects the two parts of
796000	798000	the black hole geometry
798000	800000	This idea is
800000	802000	brought by many theorists
802000	804000	in particular
804000	806000	in the context of ADS-CFT
806000	808000	correspondence
808000	810000	Okay
810000	812000	Let's look back
812000	814000	The point is
814000	816000	The problem with this theory is
816000	818000	I think it's motivated by
818000	820000	what I just said
820000	822000	So it can work
822000	824000	in galaxy scale
824000	826000	But the problem is
826000	828000	it can't
828000	830000	or it's not good enough
830000	832000	in phenomenology
832000	834000	to work
834000	836000	to estimate
836000	838000	larger scale
838000	840000	For example,
840000	842000	what I just said is a galaxy
842000	844000	and it will have
844000	846000	a modified gravity effect
846000	848000	But the problem is
848000	850000	we have another observation
850000	852000	that if there are two galaxies
852000	854000	and these two galaxies
854000	856000	all have a
856000	858000	dark matter
858000	860000	and they contrast
860000	862000	we can see the interaction
862000	864000	of two matter-like things
864000	866000	dark matter and non-dark matter
866000	868000	This kind of local
868000	870000	and dynamic behavior
870000	872000	is not a good way to explain
872000	874000	What it's doing now is
874000	876000	if it's a whole universe
876000	878000	in the early universe
878000	880000	it will have a modified CMB
880000	882000	which is cosmic background radiation
882000	884000	Can it work?
884000	886000	Okay
886000	888000	I actually made up another part
888000	890000	How would
890000	892000	emergent gravity affect
892000	894000	the physics?
894000	896000	Someone asked me
896000	898000	There are many different explanations
898000	900000	such as extra dimension
900000	902000	EREPR
902000	904000	or modified gravity
904000	906000	Modified Newtonian Dynamics
906000	908000	It's a standard name
908000	910000	But why do we want to do dark matter?
910000	912000	I think the reason is simple
912000	914000	because dark matter can be done
914000	916000	Even if you
916000	918000	don't think it's a good
918000	920000	theory
920000	922000	But it's important
922000	924000	to prove it
924000	926000	That's why we're doing this
926000	928000	I would say it's hard to do
928000	930000	But someone is thinking
930000	932000	For example, microgravity
932000	934000	or some light experiments
934000	936000	Well
936000	938000	Jingjie
938000	940000	I think you know better than me
940000	942000	So I don't know much
942000	944000	Can there be special
944000	946000	kind of
946000	948000	That's what he meant
948000	950000	Right?
952000	954000	So I just imagined
954000	956000	If there is an extra dimension
956000	958000	Contact
958000	960000	Then your
960000	962000	3 plus 1
962000	964000	will be equal to
964000	966000	the size of
966000	968000	the contact white space
968000	970000	So if you
970000	972000	make it bigger or smaller
972000	974000	it's more likely to be
974000	976000	stronger than outside
976000	978000	But it's related to
978000	980000	the size of
980000	982000	the compactified dimension
982000	984000	Right?
984000	986000	If the size is not
986000	988000	a constant
988000	990000	or here is this big
990000	992000	or here is this big
992000	994000	Then it means that in different places
994000	996000	the size will be different
996000	998000	I think it's possible
998000	1000000	Jingjie, I don't know
1000000	1002000	how they do it
1002000	1004000	But the point is
1004000	1006000	That's what he said
1006000	1008000	Then
1008000	1010000	I think I'll just jump back
1010000	1012000	from here
1016000	1018000	Where did I talk about?
1020000	1022000	OK
1022000	1024000	Actually, the more interesting thing is
1024000	1026000	that
1026000	1028000	if anyone is interested in
1028000	1030000	other kinds of
1030000	1032000	prediction
1032000	1034000	Right?
1036000	1038000	There are all kinds of observations
1038000	1040000	So
1040000	1042000	we just talked about
1042000	1044000	the missing mass
1044000	1046000	So
1046000	1048000	what you see now
1048000	1050000	is our Milky Way
1050000	1052000	This is what we think is the Milky Way
1052000	1054000	The Milky Way we see
1054000	1056000	Then next to it, I help you zoom in
1056000	1058000	That's our solar system
1058000	1060000	Then we go around the sun
1060000	1062000	So the Earth is in the third one
1062000	1064000	OK
1064000	1066000	Why is this important?
1066000	1068000	Because we do experiments on the Earth
1068000	1070000	So you know why it's important
1070000	1072000	The picture in the upper left corner
1072000	1074000	is to say that this is not a special phenomenon
1074000	1076000	That is to say
1076000	1078000	only our Milky Way Galaxy has
1078000	1080000	Because a lot of people thought
1080000	1082000	you would observe this
1082000	1084000	Is it because we are in the Milky Way?
1084000	1086000	So we are in the Milky Way
1086000	1088000	The Milky Way is not in the center
1088000	1090000	It's on the side
1090000	1092000	And then you have to correct it
1092000	1094000	It's like you've been going around
1094000	1096000	A constant change
1096000	1098000	OK
1098000	1100000	Is there a problem with this experiment?
1100000	1102000	But this thing
1102000	1104000	is basically a
1104000	1106000	A whole observation
1106000	1108000	in the 1970s
1108000	1110000	completely broken
1110000	1112000	Vera Rubin
1112000	1114000	This person later won the Presidential Prize
1114000	1116000	He observed a lot of galaxies
1116000	1118000	There are such phenomena
1118000	1120000	So what you see in the upper left corner
1120000	1122000	is what I said
1122000	1124000	The speed of the rotation
1124000	1126000	It's really flat
1126000	1128000	But if you
1128000	1130000	r² gm² is equal to r²mv²
1130000	1132000	In fact, it should be
1132000	1134000	Is it the opposite of once r?
1134000	1136000	It will keep going down
1136000	1138000	Equals once
1138000	1140000	v² will be the opposite of r
1140000	1142000	v² will be the opposite of r
1142000	1144000	So we really think
1144000	1146000	What should the universe look like?
1146000	1148000	It should look like this
1148000	1150000	It's a little bit laggy
1150000	1152000	There is a halo
1152000	1154000	Something like a light cloud
1154000	1156000	OK, so this thing is called Dark Matter Halo
1156000	1158000	And then we're in that
1158000	1160000	So we've been constantly
1160000	1162000	in Dark Matter Halo
1162000	1164000	Movement is being soaked in
1164000	1166000	It feels like you're being soaked in
1166000	1168000	I have a question
1168000	1170000	That is to say
1170000	1172000	How big is the curve?
1172000	1174000	How big is the scale?
1174000	1176000	The effect will come out slowly
1176000	1178000	Because you're looking at a galaxy scale
1178000	1180000	For example, the scale of the solar system
1180000	1182000	Or the scale of the galaxy
1182000	1184000	It will have a similar curve
1184000	1186000	When you draw it out
1186000	1188000	Is it the same?
1188000	1190000	I forgot to put that thing
1190000	1192000	This is very interesting
1192000	1194000	You can ask a question
1194000	1196000	How long does it take for us to go around the sun?
1196000	1198000	One year, right?
1198000	1200000	How long does it take for us to go around the galaxy?
1200000	1202000	How long does it take for us to go around the galaxy?
1202000	1204000	OK, basically
1204000	1206000	There's no life
1206000	1208000	Can feel the difference
1208000	1210000	So you can imagine
1210000	1212000	We are in a
1212000	1214000	In the center of the galaxy
1214000	1216000	The origin of the coordinate
1216000	1218000	Around the sun
1218000	1220000	Local rotation
1220000	1222000	Can you?
1222000	1224000	So basically in this Dark Matter Halo
1224000	1226000	We are actually in a fixed position
1226000	1228000	In that very local place
1228000	1230000	Keep turning
1230000	1232000	So what do you get in the end?
1232000	1234000	You will get
1234000	1236000	If you measure the local
1236000	1238000	The speed of the Halo
1238000	1240000	I mean
1240000	1242000	Dark Matter
1242000	1244000	Wait a minute
1244000	1246000	You just asked about the speed of the planet
1246000	1248000	OK
1248000	1250000	Let me tell you
1250000	1252000	The earth itself
1252000	1254000	The speed of rotation around the sun
1254000	1256000	This measurement
1256000	1258000	OK
1258000	1260000	So actually someone found something very interesting
1260000	1262000	It should be proposed
1262000	1264000	A very interesting concept
1264000	1266000	Because we are
1266000	1268000	Compared to our life
1268000	1270000	And the time scale we use
1270000	1272000	We are in the Dark Matter Halo
1272000	1274000	The solar system is basically fixed in the Dark Matter Halo
1274000	1276000	You see that point is not moving
1276000	1278000	Your whole life will not change
1278000	1280000	A pixel on the earth
1280000	1282000	But the earth has been around
1282000	1284000	So it means
1284000	1286000	Our solar system is sitting in a
1286000	1288000	Constant Dark Matter Week
1288000	1290000	A Dark Matter Wind
1290000	1292000	Keep moving in the same direction
1292000	1294000	Then we have half a year
1294000	1296000	It's clockwise
1296000	1298000	Half a year is counterclockwise
1298000	1300000	Half a year is counterclockwise
1300000	1302000	This is called Dark Matter Annual Modulation
1302000	1304000	It can be a
1304000	1306000	Probing Dark Matter
1306000	1308000	As a particle
1308000	1310000	A very important phenomenon
1310000	1312000	About ten years ago
1312000	1314000	Someone planned to test it
1314000	1316000	And then there was no way
1316000	1318000	To reproduce the experiment
1318000	1320000	Do you know this?
1320000	1322000	In addition to
1322000	1324000	The scale of the solar system
1324000	1326000	It's a little bit bigger
1326000	1328000	But smaller than the galaxy
1328000	1330000	But smaller than the galaxy
1330000	1332000	See
1332000	1334000	Because there are a lot of stars in the galaxy
1334000	1336000	Is a lot of
1336000	1338000	Constellations
1338000	1340000	I don't know
1340000	1342000	I don't know
1342000	1344000	Because usually we
1344000	1346000	We are
1346000	1348000	Anyway, everyone is talking about
1348000	1350000	What clues are there in Dark Matter
1350000	1352000	Just use a few scales
1352000	1354000	Galaxy
1354000	1356000	It's a bunch of galaxies
1356000	1358000	It's called Megastructure
1358000	1360000	And then there's the whole universe
1360000	1362000	There are about four
1362000	1364000	Will there be a star group in the middle?
1364000	1366000	I don't know
1366000	1368000	I don't know
1368000	1370000	I don't know
1370000	1372000	I don't know
1372000	1374000	Next one
1374000	1376000	But
1376000	1378000	I have the doll above
1378000	1380000	That is
1380000	1382000	So
1382000	1384000	Then we think it's weird
1384000	1386000	Since we are sitting on the whole earth
1386000	1388000	Including ourselves
1388000	1390000	Do you feel like you're being blown by the wind?
1390000	1392000	Have you been hit all the time?
1392000	1394000	Is there a ghost behind you?
1394000	1396000	No
1396000	1398000	So a very popular theory
1398000	1400000	Is
1400000	1402000	We are all surrounded by
1402000	1404000	Dark Matter
1404000	1406000	OK
1406000	1408000	It's like we're all surrounded by air
1408000	1410000	But they basically don't
1410000	1412000	Pass their momentum to us
1412000	1414000	It won't interact with us
1414000	1416000	OK
1416000	1418000	This is smaller than air
1418000	1420000	Because air is actually
1420000	1422000	I don't feel the interaction
1422000	1424000	Dark Matter's basic theory is that
1424000	1426000	The next two are the substances we already know
1426000	1428000	And then they interact with each other
1428000	1430000	In the form of throwing balls
1430000	1432000	So they can pass
1432000	1434000	Momentum energy
1434000	1436000	That's what we know
1436000	1438000	And then it's all dark matter
1438000	1440000	But Dark Matter has no way to catch the ball
1440000	1442000	Just stand there and watch
1442000	1444000	Of course
1444000	1446000	But it has gravity
1446000	1448000	Right
1448000	1450000	So we put one over there
1450000	1452000	A gravity pole
1452000	1454000	It's the only thing that can interact with us
1454000	1456000	It's pulling us
1456000	1458000	So we can
1458000	1460000	Basically, this is the only thing we can
1460000	1462000	See the reason for the rotational curve
1462000	1464000	OK
1464000	1466000	Right, because it has a gravitational interaction with us
1466000	1468000	Can this be
1468000	1470000	Localized?
1470000	1472000	Let's say we have a
1472000	1474000	Dark Matter density
1474000	1476000	Let's say it's 0.5
1476000	1478000	Will it enhance
1478000	1480000	The gravitational interaction between the substances?
1480000	1482000	How do we interact with each other?
1482000	1484000	Oh, yeah, that's what I just said
1484000	1486000	Microgravity
1486000	1488000	This thing is very interesting
1488000	1490000	You either measure a very large scale
1490000	1492000	Why?
1492000	1494000	Because you can have a very large group of Dark Matter
1494000	1496000	You can measure a lot of pull
1496000	1498000	This approach will become
1498000	1500000	There is a kind of
1500000	1502000	What is it called?
1502000	1504000	Lensing
1504000	1506000	In fact, we can use
1506000	1508000	Baryonic Matter to do
1508000	1510000	But a lot of people are doing
1510000	1512000	There is a galaxy far away
1512000	1514000	Then
1514000	1516000	He also has a Dark Matter Halo
1516000	1518000	And then there's something behind him
1518000	1520000	So we can see what's behind him
1520000	1522000	Then we can see
1522000	1524000	The effect of this galaxy's lensing
1524000	1526000	Can we go
1526000	1528000	So this lens
1528000	1530000	How heavy is it?
1530000	1532000	Then we can see how bright this lens is
1532000	1534000	So we can guess
1534000	1536000	How heavy it is
1536000	1538000	I don't know why I'm doing astronomy
1538000	1540000	I don't know how to talk about Baryonic Matter
1540000	1542000	Standard Model of Matter
1542000	1544000	How heavy it is
1544000	1546000	This is a way
1546000	1548000	There are a lot of these measurements
1548000	1550000	Measurement and
1550000	1552000	Is it in line with the SNOKER?
1552000	1554000	In line with
1554000	1556000	But it's a mass
1556000	1558000	Because if you measure it like this, it's a mass, right?
1558000	1560000	Because you're looking at a very far
1560000	1562000	A very far galaxy as a mirror
1562000	1564000	And then there's another group of people
1564000	1566000	What they're doing now is
1566000	1568000	That's what you said
1568000	1570000	Can I do it on Earth?
1570000	1572000	For example, I'm on the table
1572000	1574000	I know how heavy this apple is
1574000	1576000	How heavy that banana is
1576000	1578000	But if there's Dark Matter in the middle
1578000	1580000	How much should he change
1580000	1582000	The problem with this is that you can put
1582000	1584000	All experiments are controlled very accurately
1584000	1586000	But their signal is very small
1586000	1588000	Because things are very light
1588000	1590000	So it's hard to do
1590000	1592000	If you do this
1592000	1594000	Will be a completely different
1594000	1596000	For Theory
1596000	1598000	But this is
1598000	1600000	This is more like what you're talking about
1602000	1604000	We know this
1610000	1612000	Oh yeah
1612000	1614000	So
1614000	1616000	The problem here is
1616000	1618000	How big is your sensitivity
1618000	1620000	You have to compare
1620000	1622000	Because if we measure big G now
1622000	1624000	It should all be observed from the sky
1624000	1626000	Just look at the big
1626000	1628000	I don't know
1628000	1630000	I don't know
1630000	1632000	What are they doing now
1632000	1634000	But someone is doing it
1634000	1636000	This is actually a very interesting experiment for me
1636000	1638000	But I think it's been five or ten years
1638000	1640000	Should be very
1640000	1642000	Test performance
1642000	1644000	There will be no
1644000	1646000	I have a question
1650000	1652000	Oh, this is a
1652000	1654000	A completely different idea
1654000	1656000	There is that you want to talk about
1656000	1658000	Just talk about manufacturing
1658000	1660000	That LHC wants to do this
1660000	1662000	I'll talk about it later
1668000	1670000	Theoretically, right?
1670000	1672000	It's just a
1672000	1674000	If it's a pile of matter and then there's mass
1674000	1676000	Yes, it can be theoretically
1676000	1678000	But I don't think it's measured
1678000	1680000	Because your weight is very small
1680000	1682000	So it's hard to measure
1682000	1684000	So now the big difference is
1684000	1686000	Of course, there's more mass
1686000	1688000	But I'm not sure
1688000	1690000	No one knows what it is
1690000	1692000	But
1692000	1694000	What you can imagine is that you can modify
1694000	1696000	You originally used to do the assumption
1696000	1698000	That is, if Newton's law is right
1698000	1700000	That is, there is less matter
1700000	1702000	Or Newton's law
1702000	1704000	Or relativism is not so right
1704000	1706000	Then you have to modify that
1706000	1708000	Anyway, either case
1708000	1710000	You have to think of a theory
1710000	1712000	What we're doing is to treat it as
1712000	1714000	Particle
1714000	1716000	Yes, it's a particle
1716000	1718000	And then the only thing it does is
1718000	1720000	Okay, this is what I'm talking about
1720000	1722000	So he's standing there
1722000	1724000	And then he doesn't do anything, does he?
1724000	1726000	So our assumption now is that
1726000	1728000	Dark matter doesn't interact
1728000	1730000	This sentence is right
1730000	1732000	If you talk to astronomers
1732000	1734000	In all of our roles
1734000	1736000	Dark matter will never work with you
1736000	1738000	What are you doing?
1738000	1740000	OK
1740000	1742000	But what is our hope?
1742000	1744000	Our hope is
1744000	1746000	Next page
1746000	1748000	Next page
1748000	1750000	It's a very, very, very
1750000	1752000	Small chance
1752000	1754000	It's actually going to be with us
1754000	1756000	This red
1756000	1758000	I don't know if it's straight or neutral
1758000	1760000	Anyway, it's with our normal matter
1760000	1762000	Interaction
1762000	1764000	But what are its conditions?
1764000	1766000	Its condition is to be small
1766000	1768000	So rare that it's seen as
1768000	1770000	Consistent with non-interacting
1770000	1772000	In all previous experiments
1772000	1774000	That is to say
1774000	1776000	You want this opportunity to be small
1776000	1778000	Um
1778000	1780000	In all previous experiments
1780000	1782000	It looks like it doesn't work
1782000	1784000	But you'll think
1784000	1786000	It's already so small
1786000	1788000	Why do you have to assume it
1788000	1790000	There are other reasons
1790000	1792000	Because we are
1792000	1794000	Directly start
1794000	1796000	Directly
1796000	1798000	Um
1798000	1800000	We have a lot of other examples
1800000	1802000	The theory of physics
1802000	1804000	He predicted that there would be new examples
1804000	1806000	OK
1806000	1808000	It's not just what we know now
1808000	1810000	Then these new examples
1810000	1812000	With
1812000	1814000	Even their bigger and more complete
1814000	1816000	In theory, we know that part
1816000	1818000	The interaction is very weak
1818000	1820000	Um
1820000	1822000	Weak to all the other
1822000	1824000	It looks like it's
1824000	1826000	No interaction
1826000	1828000	But it's not completely non-interactive
1828000	1830000	This is the point
1830000	1832000	And then it's more important
1832000	1834000	That value
1834000	1836000	Is what we should be able to measure
1836000	1838000	As long as we design a
1838000	1840000	Dedicated experiment
1840000	1842000	Um
1842000	1844000	Because
1844000	1846000	In fact, we can't measure it
1846000	1848000	It's not that it doesn't interact
1848000	1850000	But we don't have a very sensitive way to measure it
1850000	1852000	So we always thought it was completely non-interactive
1852000	1854000	But in fact it is not
1854000	1856000	Then if we measure it today
1856000	1858000	In what we think it should interact with us
1858000	1860000	This sensitive detector
1860000	1862000	There is still no interaction
1862000	1864000	Then we can rule out the old theory
1864000	1866000	Which we did many times
1866000	1868000	I'll talk about it later
1868000	1870000	What is the current situation
1870000	1872000	The current situation is
1872000	1874000	The earth is over there
1874000	1876000	Red is our experiment
1876000	1878000	We cover it on the earth
1878000	1880000	Then we are in the dark matter
1880000	1882000	So as the center of the coordinate
1882000	1884000	Dark matter has been hitting us
1884000	1886000	Then we hope that many
1886000	1888000	One will hit our detector
1888000	1890000	And then hit the detector
1890000	1892000	The situation is actually quite serious
1892000	1894000	It's like you hit the ball
1894000	1896000	Come in and out
1896000	1898000	Then he put a little bit
1898000	1900000	The kinetic energy is passed to the detector
1900000	1902000	Then we have to measure this little kinetic energy
1904000	1906000	Ok
1906000	1908000	This is what we have to do
1908000	1910000	How do we actually do it
1912000	1914000	Ok, let's start slowly
1914000	1916000	That is to say our project
1916000	1918000	This is not our project
1918000	1920000	But I want to talk about it first
1920000	1922000	The two most popular methods on the earth
1922000	1924000	Then I want to
1924000	1926000	In our work
1926000	1928000	Why do we think this is better
1928000	1930000	This is the first method
1930000	1932000	It's called Time Projection Chamber
1934000	1936000	The red line is dark matter
1936000	1938000	Dark matter comes in many times
1938000	1940000	There was one time he hit the bucket
1942000	1944000	Detector material in the basket
1944000	1946000	Then like hitting the ball
1946000	1948000	Then go out
1948000	1950000	Then he passed the energy to the line like a caterpillar
1950000	1952000	What is that line
1952000	1954000	Inside the bucket
1954000	1956000	Is our so-called
1956000	1958000	Target Matter
1958000	1960000	Usually I don't know what matter is
1960000	1962000	Anyway, it's Target Matter
1962000	1964000	Then he passed a little energy
1964000	1966000	This kind of material
1966000	1968000	The atomic box of this element
1968000	1970000	Then the atomic box
1970000	1972000	After recoiling some energy
1972000	1974000	Pass this energy to him
1974000	1976000	The electrons on the track
1976000	1978000	The electrons will move
1978000	1980000	Then it will drop
1980000	1982000	Then it's the yellow line of the caterpillar
1982000	1984000	OK
1984000	1986000	Then this flash of light
1986000	1988000	Will spread out
1988000	1990000	Will be above and below
1990000	1992000	PMT
1992000	1994000	PMT is called Photon Multiplier Tube
1994000	1996000	Basically it is very sensitive
1996000	1998000	Light sensor
1998000	2000000	You can measure that light
2000000	2002000	Then I just said
2002000	2004000	He hit it
2004000	2006000	Then pass the absorbed energy to the electrons and drop it
2006000	2008000	Then you know that the moon
2008000	2010000	The light coming out is a fixed color
2010000	2012000	Is a fixed energy
2012000	2014000	So you look at the energy of this color
2014000	2016000	How strong it means
2016000	2018000	How many electrons are there
2018000	2020000	Then you can reverse
2020000	2022000	How much energy did he eat
2022000	2024000	OK
2024000	2026000	This is
2026000	2028000	The first signal
2028000	2030000	Then the second signal is what I just said
2034000	2036000	He will have an electron moon
2036000	2038000	Then the moon of the electron
2038000	2040000	In addition to this kind of falling
2040000	2042000	It will have a certain ratio
2042000	2044000	OK
2044000	2046000	What about these electrons
2046000	2048000	He is in this vertical direction
2048000	2050000	Put a very, very strong power plant
2050000	2052000	Is that I wrote there
2052000	2054000	It's probably thousands of volts per centimeter
2054000	2056000	So one you look at the following picture
2056000	2058000	One person is so big
2058000	2060000	The vertical direction of the barrel is probably tens of thousands of volts
2060000	2062000	He used this very strong power plant
2062000	2064000	The electron is pulled all the way to the bottom
2064000	2066000	Just drag it all the way
2066000	2068000	Drag it all the way to the top
2068000	2070000	There is a virtual caterpillar above
2070000	2072000	OK, that virtual caterpillar hit the detector
2072000	2074000	He has a secondary signal
2074000	2076000	So there is such a method
2076000	2078000	Can you
2078000	2080000	Then because he was pulled up
2080000	2082000	Speed ​​is a fixed speed
2082000	2084000	It's probably a fixed speed
2084000	2086000	Is the electron in
2086000	2088000	Drifting speed
2088000	2090000	So you count that
2090000	2092000	Flash, flash is basically a moment
2092000	2094000	Just a flash and you'll see
2094000	2096000	To the speed of the electron
2096000	2098000	The time difference in the middle
2098000	2100000	Can you reverse the distance
2100000	2102000	OK, you know what I mean
2102000	2104000	Then if you have a row of electrons being drifted
2104000	2106000	Then the distance to each one is different
2106000	2108000	You reverse the whole thing and you get a track
2108000	2110000	Then through this track
2110000	2112000	You can vary
2112000	2114000	Roughly
2114000	2116000	Different
2116000	2118000	Hit your example
2118000	2120000	Distinguish whether we already know
2120000	2122000	The particle hit us
2122000	2124000	Or his behavior is consistent
2124000	2126000	We should have expectations for us
2126000	2128000	This is called Time Projection Chamber
2128000	2130000	What about his question
2130000	2132000	OK, let's talk about his advantages
2132000	2134000	His advantage is
2134000	2136000	That material is usually
2136000	2138000	Liquified
2138000	2140000	What
2140000	2142000	That
2142000	2144000	Xenon
2144000	2146000	Or
2146000	2148000	Where is it
2148000	2150000	Argon
2150000	2152000	It's these two kinds of gas
2152000	2154000	So it's actually a very heavy element
2154000	2156000	Then we
2156000	2158000	What about the elements that we know are heavy
2158000	2160000	It's a bit like
2160000	2162000	If you hit a heavy thing today
2162000	2164000	Hit the air molecules with you
2164000	2166000	Then the air molecules will get more
2166000	2168000	Energy or heavy things
2168000	2170000	It should be heavy
2170000	2172000	So if you hit it today
2172000	2174000	Hit a heavier atomic box
2174000	2176000	Then you can leave more energy
2176000	2178000	Then we know that the energy is equal to the square of M
2178000	2180000	The square of the atomic box
2180000	2182000	So their signal is very big
2182000	2184000	And they are actually easy to scale up
2184000	2186000	Why scale up is important
2186000	2188000	Because basically there is
2188000	2190000	How many Doppler Meters pass through your detector
2190000	2192000	How big is it with your detector
2192000	2194000	How many atomic boxes are there
2194000	2196000	So if you have a two-time detector
2196000	2198000	Basically you
2198000	2200000	The rate of the expected signal should be twice
2200000	2202000	They are easy to put a lot of
2202000	2204000	Super high voltage
2204000	2206000	It sounds crazy
2206000	2208000	But it's actually easy
2208000	2210000	Basically
2210000	2212000	To summarize
2212000	2214000	State-of-the-art optimization
2214000	2216000	Of a widely used
2216000	2218000	Iron geophysics technology
2218000	2220000	Invented in the 70s
2220000	2222000	OK
2222000	2224000	State-of-the-art optimization
2224000	2226000	This very widely used
2226000	2228000	What are the benefits
2228000	2230000	They can scale up very quickly
2230000	2232000	They know what problems they will encounter
2232000	2234000	So currently their approach is
2234000	2236000	The most sensitive
2236000	2238000	In terms of event rate
2238000	2240000	OK
2240000	2242000	The second one
2246000	2248000	Another one is Solid State Detector
2248000	2250000	Why is this thing
2250000	2252000	Let me talk about it
2252000	2254000	What you see on the picture now
2254000	2256000	The part I enlarged
2256000	2258000	That little metal box
2258000	2260000	Inside the metal box
2260000	2262000	It's the carton next to it
2262000	2264000	The blue thing
2264000	2266000	Is a solid state detector
2266000	2268000	Its principle is actually the same as
2268000	2270000	The etheric detector
2270000	2272000	You go in and hit it
2272000	2274000	Then give it energy
2274000	2276000	Energy makes it flash
2276000	2278000	OK, and then the flash
2278000	2280000	What about the light
2280000	2282000	Can it pop out
2282000	2284000	And then the top and bottom of this picture
2284000	2286000	That label
2286000	2288000	It's called TES
2288000	2290000	TES is
2290000	2292000	We know the most sensitive detector on Earth
2292000	2294000	What is it
2294000	2296000	It's called Transition Edge Sensor
2296000	2298000	I'll talk about it later
2298000	2300000	OK
2300000	2302000	It's very sensitive
2302000	2304000	And then
2304000	2306000	In addition to this signal
2306000	2308000	You can also get another signal
2308000	2310000	It's a deposit
2310000	2312000	It's basically heat
2312000	2314000	It's heat in the crystal
2314000	2316000	If you think about it
2316000	2318000	Then the heat will be passed out
2318000	2320000	But he put the whole box
2320000	2322000	It's empty
2322000	2324000	Nothing
2324000	2326000	So heat can't be passed out
2326000	2328000	Heat stays inside
2328000	2330000	OK
2330000	2332000	The only track that can be passed out
2332000	2334000	It's the top and bottom
2334000	2336000	It has two caterpillar wires
2336000	2338000	It will pass to heat bath
2338000	2340000	So you can eat all these heat
2340000	2342000	Then measure the heat
2342000	2344000	Then you
2344000	2346000	Correlate these two signals
2346000	2348000	You can identify
2348000	2350000	What hit us
2350000	2352000	Is it a particle we know
2352000	2354000	Or a particle we don't know
2354000	2356000	OK
2356000	2358000	What's the benefit
2358000	2360000	This kind of solid state detector
2360000	2362000	Can be operated under cryogenic temperature
2362000	2364000	For exquisite energy resolution
2364000	2366000	With ultra-low noise
2366000	2368000	But
2368000	2370000	What does it mean
2370000	2372000	OK
2372000	2374000	It can have a lot of
2374000	2376000	Very special phenomena
2376000	2378000	Our collaborators
2378000	2380000	In Berkeley
2380000	2382000	In different laboratories
2382000	2384000	That is to say
2384000	2386000	This kind of thing can play a lot of magic
2386000	2388000	Recoil threshold depends on material property
2388000	2390000	You can invent
2390000	2392000	Very exotic material
2392000	2394000	Then let them eat
2394000	2396000	This
2396000	2398000	After hitting the ball
2398000	2400000	Then how to give it to you
2400000	2402000	Then you measure
2402000	2404000	OK
2404000	2406000	I know that Chicago University is now leading
2406000	2408000	They are doing CCD
2408000	2410000	To put it bluntly
2410000	2412000	The CCD chip in your camera
2412000	2414000	Take it to Dark Matter
2414000	2416000	After hitting it, it will leave the electrode
2416000	2418000	Then walk a small line
2418000	2420000	Different particles walk that line
2420000	2422000	The behavior will be different
2422000	2424000	So you can be very, very
2424000	2426000	Accurate judgment
2426000	2428000	What kind of material
2428000	2430000	What kind of particle
2430000	2432000	Then there is the superconductor
2432000	2434000	I will talk a lot about this later
2434000	2436000	Because we are doing superconductor
2436000	2438000	It is also a very sensitive material
2438000	2440000	What is graphene
2440000	2442000	What is special about graphene
2442000	2444000	Its conductivity
2444000	2446000	Is
2446000	2448000	Not all the same
2448000	2450000	It's the same in every direction
2450000	2452000	Like your
2452000	2454000	Your guide is basically like this
2454000	2456000	Graphene
2456000	2458000	It is on the same plane
2458000	2460000	The conductivity of six directions is zero
2460000	2462000	Then
2462000	2464000	It's not zero in the other six directions
2464000	2466000	Or it is
2466000	2468000	Six-fold symmetry
2468000	2470000	It's very interesting
2470000	2472000	When your particle comes in
2472000	2474000	If it runs in the direction of that no electrode
2474000	2476000	Run
2476000	2478000	It can be as small as possible
2478000	2480000	I can pull it
2480000	2482000	I should just say
2482000	2484000	But there is a place
2484000	2486000	It's even weirder
2486000	2488000	It's superfluid
2488000	2490000	It's very sensitive
2490000	2492000	Then there is
2492000	2494000	It's Fermi arc
2494000	2496000	This is what we did in Caltech
2496000	2498000	This thing
2498000	2500000	It's basically in a certain direction
2500000	2502000	That
2502000	2504000	It's also zero
2504000	2506000	You can imagine these things
2506000	2508000	They are all very super
2508000	2510000	But the problem is
2510000	2512000	You are the subject of research
2512000	2514000	Instead of using it to study other people
2514000	2516000	So every moment
2516000	2518000	It's very, very expensive
2518000	2520000	OK
2520000	2522000	But why is this thing interesting
2522000	2524000	I'll tell you later
2524000	2526000	Its dilemma is
2526000	2528000	Harder to scale up without meeting new challenges
2528000	2530000	While maintaining your budget and sensitivity
2530000	2532000	This is very
2532000	2534000	You know the biggest experimental background
2534000	2536000	Is sensitivity
2536000	2538000	No, it's your budget
2538000	2540000	OK
2540000	2542000	So I just finished
2542000	2544000	Time Projection Chamber
2544000	2546000	And Solid State Detector
2546000	2548000	This is a monoplot
2548000	2550000	It's the whole field
2550000	2552000	The current state
2552000	2554000	The arc
2554000	2556000	Is your assumption
2556000	2558000	The quality of dark matter
2558000	2560000	Why do I say assumption
2560000	2562000	Because no one measured it
2562000	2564000	If you measure it, you know where it can be drawn
2564000	2566000	You assume
2566000	2568000	How heavy is the dark matter that can't be measured
2568000	2570000	OK
2570000	2572000	Then you know
2572000	2574000	How heavy is your dark matter particle
2574000	2576000	Then you know your dark matter halo
2576000	2578000	We stand in that halo
2578000	2580000	How heavy is the dark matter total
2580000	2582000	So you know
2582000	2584000	How many
2584000	2586000	Particle in terms of number
2586000	2588000	The flux has been flowing through you
2588000	2590000	Then you can't measure it again
2590000	2592000	Then you can know that the chance of interaction with me
2592000	2594000	Can't be greater than how much
2594000	2596000	So the arc is the chance of interaction
2596000	2598000	Then every line you see
2600000	2602000	Is the upper limit of that opportunity
2602000	2604000	That is
2604000	2606000	The interaction between dark matter and detector
2606000	2608000	The chance must be less than that line
2608000	2610000	If it's higher than that line
2610000	2612000	We should measure it
2612000	2614000	This is the logic of the picture
2614000	2616000	So it actually has two directions
2616000	2618000	One direction is you
2618000	2620000	We're going to make the detector bigger and bigger
2620000	2622000	Like the Time Projection Chamber
2622000	2624000	Then you can expect more events
2624000	2626000	If it's going to be measured
2626000	2628000	So if you can't measure it, you can keep the line down
2628000	2630000	It means that the higher the sensitivity
2630000	2632000	You still can't measure
2632000	2634000	Then the other one is you
2634000	2636000	You can measure the smaller and smaller
2636000	2638000	Energy
2638000	2640000	Then can you know that
2640000	2642000	Because very light particles hit you
2642000	2644000	The energy left is very small
2644000	2646000	Then can you go to the left of this picture
2646000	2648000	To draw that line
2648000	2650000	Because you know
2650000	2652000	You can measure this kind of energy
2652000	2654000	But you didn't measure it
2654000	2656000	Then you can put it there
2656000	2658000	That limit
2658000	2660000	This part is the solid state
2660000	2662000	It's right there
2662000	2664000	This is the main direction of this field
2664000	2666000	Everyone wants to push down
2666000	2668000	To make the detector bigger
2668000	2670000	But if you want to go to the right
2670000	2672000	If you push left
2672000	2674000	You need a better detector
2674000	2676000	That's right
2676000	2678000	What if you go to the right
2678000	2680000	Ok
2680000	2682000	To the right is like this
2682000	2684000	Why do we want to do a dedicated experiment
2684000	2686000	To measure dark matter
2686000	2688000	Because we actually have a very very
2688000	2690000	Strong machine
2690000	2692000	We have been using
2692000	2694000	It's a big magnet
2694000	2696000	When they built it
2696000	2698000	In addition to looking for the exposure
2698000	2700000	They actually want to find
2700000	2702000	The most important thing I think
2702000	2704000	I think it's fair to say
2704000	2706000	The example of superposition theory
2706000	2708000	The example of superposition theory
2708000	2710000	It used to be the best for dark matter
2710000	2712000	The most anticipated thing to happen
2712000	2714000	Their goal
2714000	2716000	Basically around TEV
2716000	2718000	Or sub-TEV
2718000	2720000	So that's where I put the picture
2722000	2724000	Then you will ask
2724000	2726000	Do we want to measure them now
2726000	2728000	The answer is that LHC has not been able to measure
2728000	2730000	And it has exceeded
2730000	2732000	The earliest version
2732000	2734000	The original superposition theory
2734000	2736000	That is to say, we have basically
2736000	2738000	The original superposition theory
2738000	2740000	So there are a lot of superposition theories now
2740000	2742000	It's just looking at its original superposition theory
2742000	2744000	According to our continuous measurement
2744000	2746000	They think it's a
2746000	2748000	Superposition theory should have
2748000	2750000	What new phenomenon
2750000	2752000	Look at this thing
2752000	2754000	So basically
2754000	2756000	You keep going down
2756000	2758000	To measure
2758000	2760000	Superposition theory
2760000	2762000	Is it wrong?
2762000	2764000	But he can't measure
2764000	2766000	It's already weird
2766000	2768000	If you are interested
2768000	2770000	You can ask me
2770000	2772000	So now Susie's
2772000	2774000	The expectations are probably all on this map
2774000	2776000	You will be surprised
2776000	2778000	Because almost all of them are in the places we have entered
2778000	2780000	So now a lot of new theories
2780000	2782000	Come out
2782000	2784000	If it's not a superposition theory
2784000	2786000	It's another one we've never thought of
2786000	2788000	The dark side
2788000	2790000	It's like you know
2790000	2792000	The dark side
2792000	2794000	We can't see it
2794000	2796000	But it's very, very weak
2796000	2798000	It interacts with the world we see
2798000	2800000	But it's a completely stand-alone
2800000	2802000	Dark world
2802000	2804000	It can have very light particles
2804000	2806000	Then we have to have
2806000	2808000	Very new technology
2808000	2810000	Go to the left of this picture
2810000	2812000	So this is our goal
2812000	2814000	Then you can see above
2814000	2816000	In the SSD frame
2816000	2818000	The four lines on the left
2818000	2820000	That's basically what we experimented with
2820000	2822000	Four different operations
2822000	2824000	So we are the most leading in this place
2824000	2826000	Then we are going to propose the next technology
2826000	2828000	Push us down again
2828000	2830000	No, push it to the left
2830000	2832000	Sorry
2832000	2834000	So this should be
2834000	2836000	OK, this is the last page
2836000	2838000	So the first part everyone has
2838000	2840000	Any questions?
2840000	2842000	I know
2842000	2844000	Dark Matter
2844000	2846000	It has its own interaction
2846000	2848000	This is
2848000	2850000	Ok
2850000	2852000	This is our most popular theory now
2852000	2854000	Called
2854000	2856000	Let's talk about popular
2856000	2858000	This is a piece of cake
2858000	2860000	Anyway, everyone is the most
2860000	2862000	The theory that people are pursuing in the experiment is
2862000	2864000	It's weakly interacting
2864000	2866000	Massive particle
2866000	2868000	Weakly is not in terms of
2868000	2870000	Interact with us
2870000	2872000	Interact with anything
2872000	2874000	Including themselves
2874000	2876000	So WIMP is very weak
2876000	2878000	But in fact
2878000	2880000	It should be said that Dark Matter does not have to be very weak
2880000	2882000	Like that
2882000	2884000	The latest paper published by He Shu-yu is SIMP
2884000	2886000	What is SIMP
2886000	2888000	Strongly
2888000	2890000	He can strongly interact with himself
2890000	2892000	What is the problem with strongly interacting with yourself?
2892000	2894000	If he can
2894000	2896000	Strongly interact with himself
2896000	2898000	It's true
2898000	2900000	They may have something
2900000	2902000	They have their own
2902000	2904000	Or whatever
2904000	2906000	They can condense into very small objects
2906000	2908000	This very small object
2908000	2910000	It will
2910000	2912000	Run this
2912000	2914000	What is this called
2914000	2916000	This kind of super super
2916000	2918000	This kind of simulation
2918000	2920000	They run this
2920000	2922000	Galaxy Evolution
2922000	2924000	If you let Dark Matter and Dark Matter
2924000	2926000	Strongly interact
2926000	2928000	They will condense into very small objects
2928000	2930000	Very fast
2930000	2932000	It can't form here
2932000	2934000	Then
2934000	2936000	Become our Dark Matter
2936000	2938000	It will become
2938000	2940000	Dark Matter Planet
2940000	2942000	Something like that
2942000	2944000	I thought it would turn into a planet
2944000	2946000	As long as there is gravitational force
2946000	2948000	Because this is related to the time of Evolution
2948000	2950000	Because your
2950000	2952000	You know how strong the gravitational force is
2952000	2954000	It can condense
2954000	2956000	There is a process
2956000	2958000	But it can condense very quickly
2958000	2960000	I think I missed one thing
2960000	2962000	Astronomers now
2962000	2964000	Their perception
2964000	2966000	Is like this
2966000	2968000	At the beginning of the universe
2968000	2970000	Things are very
2970000	2972000	Average distribution in the universe
2972000	2974000	Some places
2974000	2976000	A little bit more
2976000	2978000	Then
2978000	2980000	Dark Matter is a little bit more over there
2980000	2982000	They all come together
2982000	2984000	Then it's Dark Matter Halo
2984000	2986000	Then this Halo
2986000	2988000	To produce a local gravity
2988000	2990000	We already know
2990000	2992000	Drag it over
2992000	2994000	Become a current structure
2994000	2996000	So if this process
2996000	2998000	Time speed
2998000	3000000	If there is a change
3000000	3002000	For example, it condenses very quickly
3002000	3004000	A very small one
3004000	3006000	Then it will not be able to form
3006000	3008000	What we already know
3008000	3010000	Or the density of the galaxy
3010000	3012000	In the universe
3012000	3014000	So I really want to ask the question is
3014000	3016000	Will Dark Matter be used in the future?
3016000	3018000	Oh, there is such a theory
3018000	3020000	and so
3020000	3022000	Black hole is not a big concept
3022000	3024000	Because the black hole is just based on gravity
3024000	3026000	So
3026000	3028000	Black hole is still very strong
3028000	3030000	You will find
3032000	3034000	You can't see
3034000	3036000	Matter
3037000	3039000	This is being done
3039000	3041000	but I
3041000	3043000	I have no idea
3047000	3049000	It sounds reasonable
3049000	3051000	But in fact, someone is doing this
3051000	3053000	Someone is doing one thing
3053000	3055000	He can let
3055000	3057000	Dark Matter is over there
3057000	3059000	Then he said
3059000	3061000	Dark Matter and Dark Matter
3061000	3063000	Even if it doesn't work with us
3063000	3065000	You will be with yourself
3066000	3068000	Let's say he will
3068000	3070000	This is the theory
3070000	3072000	After he annihilated
3072000	3074000	He can
3074000	3076000	It becomes a pair production
3076000	3078000	What else
3078000	3080000	But because there are many
3080000	3082000	And very tight
3082000	3084000	So even Dark Matter coupled to Standard Model
3084000	3086000	The chance is small
3086000	3088000	It will still have
3088000	3090000	Very high
3090000	3092000	Event rate
3092000	3094000	For example, Gamma Gamma
3095000	3097000	So they are looking at that kind of
3097000	3099000	A lot of quality
3099000	3101000	For example, we think our
3101000	3103000	Our own
3103000	3105000	The center of the Milky Way is a super-heavy black hole
3105000	3107000	That
3107000	3109000	That's a hot spot
3109000	3111000	It's a lot of time looking over there
3111000	3113000	And then look over there
3113000	3115000	Gamma Ray
3115000	3117000	Whether it's Spectrum or Ray
3117000	3119000	Is there any
3119000	3121000	Beyond us
3121000	3123000	Normal Matter
3124000	3126000	Then you can say over there
3126000	3128000	Effectively there is a Dark Matter
3128000	3130000	Black hole
3130000	3132000	But this kind of experiment is also difficult to do
3132000	3134000	Because you know that the black hole itself is a very
3134000	3136000	Violent environment
3136000	3138000	So it's equal to
3138000	3140000	Even if you see a lot of Gamma Ray
3140000	3142000	You can blame it all on your model
3142000	3144000	Why didn't you run well
3144000	3146000	So they have a lot of uncertainty
3146000	3148000	But there are always people
3148000	3150000	Because they are so old
3150000	3152000	You can say it's a pile of Dark Matter
3152000	3154000	Black hole
3154000	3156000	And then there's Parallelization
3156000	3158000	Then it becomes Gamma Gamma
3158000	3160000	Then
3160000	3162000	But there is one
3162000	3164000	In Dark Matter
3164000	3166000	Self-interaction has a
3166000	3168000	Upper bound and lower bound
3168000	3170000	There are several upper bound and lower bound
3170000	3172000	If it's too weakly interact
3172000	3174000	It won't form a black hole
3174000	3176000	Then you have no way
3176000	3178000	Either
3178000	3180000	Is to become
3180000	3182000	A galaxy where the black hole forms
3182000	3184000	Or
3184000	3186000	If it's too strong
3186000	3188000	It will quickly become Dark Planet
3188000	3190000	Dark Planet
3190000	3192000	You can expect
3192000	3194000	If there is a Dark Planet in a certain place
3194000	3196000	There will be a Dark Galaxy
3196000	3198000	This thing is done by someone
3198000	3200000	But it can't be done
3200000	3202000	Like an experiment called AMS
3202000	3204000	The earliest
3204000	3206000	The purpose is to find
3206000	3208000	Dark World
3208000	3210000	Can't find it
3210000	3212000	So it has a bound
3212000	3214000	So they are now
3214000	3216000	You can still tune
3216000	3218000	But
3218000	3220000	There is a boundary
3220000	3222000	I think
3222000	3224000	Dark Matter strongly interacting
3224000	3226000	Principle will cause
3226000	3228000	If there is a black hole
3228000	3230000	The black hole will be colored by various modes
3230000	3232000	If
3232000	3234000	Dark Matter strongly interacting
3234000	3236000	I think only half of the people
3236000	3238000	There should be Dark Matter
3238000	3240000	Then you will find
3240000	3242000	If there is no way to measure
3242000	3244000	Anyway
3244000	3246000	Can you find
3248000	3250000	Yes
3250000	3252000	This can be done
3254000	3256000	You said this black radiation
3256000	3258000	I know what you mean
3262000	3264000	So what you are talking about now
3264000	3266000	Black radiation is talking about
3266000	3268000	Object black radiation
3268000	3270000	Instead of the whole universe
3270000	3272000	I don't know
3272000	3274000	I don't know
3274000	3276000	I don't know if it can be done
3276000	3278000	But it sounds like it can be done
3278000	3280000	Because I don't know
3280000	3282000	How to observe
3282000	3284000	Things in the sky
3284000	3286000	Yes
3286000	3288000	That's it
3288000	3290000	Any questions
3290000	3292000	Next
3292000	3294000	Technical
3294000	3296000	Then
3296000	3298000	4 minutes
3298000	3300000	OK
3300000	3302000	So what are we doing
3302000	3304000	Didn't I just say we do Solid State Detector
3304000	3306000	So what you see now is a crystal
3306000	3308000	OK
3308000	3310000	This is a crystal we know
3310000	3312000	Then
3312000	3314000	What about the two folding lines
3314000	3316000	Is Incoming Particle
3316000	3318000	Then knock and run out
3318000	3320000	Then the small one on the track
3320000	3322000	That's the electron
3322000	3324000	We know that Dark Matter will not have
3324000	3326000	Electric charge
3326000	3328000	Electric charge
3328000	3330000	But not electric charge
3330000	3332000	Because if it has electric charge
3332000	3334000	It will work with light
3334000	3336000	So you see that knock
3336000	3338000	The electron on the side
3338000	3340000	That must be the particle we know
3340000	3342000	And it's a charged particle
3342000	3344000	So we look forward to Dark Matter
3344000	3346000	What should happen
3346000	3348000	You can knock the electron in the middle
3348000	3350000	Oh, yeah, but you look at the size
3350000	3352000	It's easier to know
3352000	3354000	So this is a two-scale picture
3354000	3356000	You know, one is super-invincible
3356000	3358000	Basically there is no electron
3358000	3360000	So we basically assume
3360000	3362000	As long as it knocks the electron
3362000	3364000	It must not be Dark Matter
3364000	3366000	So we put a piece of crystal
3366000	3368000	Over there and let it knock
3368000	3370000	And then we're going to measure this
3370000	3372000	This
3372000	3374000	This energy
3374000	3376000	What do we know
3376000	3378000	What kind of crystal do humans grow the most
3378000	3380000	Do you know
3380000	3382000	Julia
3382000	3384000	Julia
3384000	3386000	acid
3386000	3388000	Of course not
3388000	3390000	That's what you grow the most
3390000	3392000	It's not what humans grow the most
3392000	3394000	The answer is that the crystal that humans grow the most
3394000	3396000	It's called a fine crystal
3396000	3398000	How can Taiwanese make a mistake?
3398000	3400000	It's weird.
3400000	3402000	And the cost is very low
3402000	3404000	How to grow very clean
3404000	3406000	So our approach is to grow
3406000	3408000	We are
3408000	3410000	I don't know how to say
3410000	3412000	Fine crystal
3412000	3414000	And Germanium
3414000	3416000	It's the next one
3416000	3418000	These two are actually very good at growing, so the cost is very low
3418000	3420000	We can grow very big and very clean
3420000	3422000	And then after knocking it
3422000	3424000	Did I just say
3424000	3426000	The first one I just did as an example
3426000	3428000	It will leave
3428000	3430000	This
3430000	3432000	Ionization will produce light, right?
3432000	3434000	But the light of ionization
3434000	3436000	How much is the energy of ionization?
3436000	3438000	Do you know
3438000	3440000	It's EV
3440000	3442000	Right?
3442000	3444000	If you have a concept of electronics
3444000	3446000	For example, hydrogen is 13.6 EV
3446000	3448000	If it's a heavier atom
3448000	3450000	Because the electrons are placed further
3450000	3452000	So the pull will be smaller
3452000	3454000	So it's less than 10
3454000	3456000	Less than 10 EV
3456000	3458000	If it
3458000	3460000	The energy left is really small
3460000	3462000	If it's less than 10 EV
3462000	3464000	Can we measure it?
3464000	3466000	It won't stay
3466000	3468000	Because it can't even eat the energy of the most basic unit
3468000	3470000	What will it do
3470000	3472000	It will become one that keeps shaking
3472000	3474000	It won't knock things away
3474000	3476000	It will keep vibrating over there
3476000	3478000	When it vibrates, it becomes a kind of vacuum
3478000	3480000	We know that vacuum
3480000	3482000	It can actually be translated into a very fancy word
3482000	3484000	It's called Fona, which is actually hot vacuum
3484000	3486000	We can measure this hot vacuum
3486000	3488000	Our goal is to measure this hot vacuum
3488000	3490000	So measuring this hot vacuum
3490000	3492000	Immediately put our threshold
3492000	3494000	From EV-ish
3494000	3496000	Down to mini-EV
3496000	3498000	Because the basic mode of a vacuum
3498000	3500000	Is its frequency
3500000	3502000	Multiplied by Brownian frequency
3502000	3504000	Is its unit, its energy
3504000	3506000	It's very small, it's mini-EV
3506000	3508000	So we immediately
3508000	3510000	From our detection threshold
3510000	3512000	From the crystal itself
3512000	3514000	EV becomes
3514000	3516000	Our
3516000	3518000	Can be used to measure
3518000	3520000	The threshold of this Fona detector
3520000	3522000	This thing has become
3522000	3524000	It's not a limit at all
3526000	3528000	Then we will do another thing
3528000	3530000	When it has
3530000	3532000	We give it a very, very strong electric field
3534000	3536000	Across this crystal
3536000	3538000	So it has a little bit of
3538000	3540000	Electrode-eating energy
3540000	3542000	It will be pulled away violently
3542000	3544000	Then pulled all the way to the top
3544000	3546000	Just like the TPC you just saw
3546000	3548000	So basically we are doing TPC in the crystal
3548000	3550000	But we are not liquid
3550000	3552000	We are not solid
3552000	3554000	So this electron is being pulled all the way
3554000	3556000	It's not a fluid process
3556000	3558000	It's crazy to hit people all the way
3558000	3560000	So it's crazy to hit people
3560000	3562000	It will produce a bigger signal
3562000	3564000	More Fona
3564000	3566000	So it's a bit like an Amplifier process
3566000	3568000	So we use this method
3568000	3570000	Can put
3570000	3572000	Very small amount of signal becomes very large
3572000	3574000	Now the question is
3574000	3576000	How do we measure it?
3578000	3580000	What is this for?
3580000	3582000	We know that the ultraviolet
3582000	3584000	It has a change in temperature
3584000	3586000	Above this temperature, it is normal
3586000	3588000	Under this temperature, it is ultraviolet
3588000	3590000	It's basically like a leap
3590000	3592000	The same process
3594000	3596000	OK
3596000	3598000	This is a very simple concept
3598000	3600000	The picture you see now
3600000	3602000	Is a very carefully engineered
3602000	3604000	Material for ultraviolet
3604000	3606000	So you can see the slope
3606000	3608000	Otherwise, it looks like a hammer line
3608000	3610000	If you put your ultraviolet
3610000	3612000	Just control the temperature
3612000	3614000	The detector is in that place
3614000	3616000	It becomes normal as soon as it eats energy
3616000	3618000	Then the energy is dissipated by the heat
3618000	3620000	Fall off immediately
3620000	3622000	Basically it is very sensitive
3622000	3624000	This is what we are using now
3624000	3626000	This technology
3626000	3628000	What is its problem?
3628000	3630000	Its problem is
3630000	3632000	If you want to put a lot of
3632000	3634000	Detectors today
3634000	3636000	On the surface of your big crystal
3636000	3638000	You can't
3638000	3640000	The surface of the detector
3640000	3642000	There will be no temperature gradient
3642000	3644000	Right?
3644000	3646000	You probably have half
3646000	3648000	It continues to be too hot
3648000	3650000	Half of it is normal
3650000	3652000	Then the other half is too cold
3652000	3654000	It doesn't have any sensitivity
3654000	3656000	Because it falls in this
3656000	3658000	It falls in this
3658000	3660000	This area
3660000	3662000	It won't produce this signal
3662000	3664000	For you to measure
3664000	3666000	But this is really a
3666000	3668000	I can only say now
3668000	3670000	Available technology state of art
3670000	3672000	So we spent a lot of
3672000	3674000	A lot of energy to use it
3674000	3676000	Then adjust it to be usable
3676000	3678000	This principle is like this
3678000	3680000	it is good
3680000	3682000	Actually
3682000	3684000	What will it look like?
3684000	3686000	You see the picture in the upper right corner
3686000	3688000	That big piece is ours
3688000	3690000	Our
3690000	3692000	That
3692000	3694000	Wafer, you can say it is a wafer
3694000	3696000	Actually it is a crystal
3696000	3698000	It is not a semiconductor
3698000	3700000	We operate it at 30 mK
3700000	3702000	So it is electricity
3702000	3704000	It is a source
3704000	3706000	It is not a semiconductor
3706000	3708000	Then its thickness
3708000	3710000	It's not our super thin
3710000	3712000	But it has to be 20 inches
3712000	3714000	We are 3 inches
3714000	3716000	But it grew a big piece
3716000	3718000	The thickness is 3 cm
3718000	3720000	Then we are above
3720000	3722000	In the way of light
3722000	3724000	Put this TES
3724000	3726000	That's a lot of little ones
3726000	3728000	Then enlarge it
3728000	3730000	This one next to it
3730000	3732000	You can see it
3732000	3734000	It has one, two, three, four
3734000	3736000	Then there are eight
3736000	3738000	Like a fan
3738000	3740000	Then the black at the end of the fan
3740000	3742000	It is TES itself
3742000	3744000	But why TES is so small
3744000	3746000	Because the problem is
3746000	3748000	TES does not want
3748000	3750000	It has a large
3750000	3752000	Temperature gradient
3752000	3754000	So you have to
3754000	3756000	TES itself is very small
3756000	3758000	Then you have to make another
3758000	3760000	A big piece
3760000	3762000	Phonon absorber
3762000	3764000	Put the heat in
3764000	3766000	Then send it all to a very
3766000	3768000	Small TES
3768000	3770000	It is very
3770000	3772000	So from the side
3772000	3774000	Pink
3774000	3776000	The pink part is our crystal
3776000	3778000	Our wafer
3778000	3780000	After sucking up
3780000	3782000	TES
3782000	3784000	This process is actually very complicated
3784000	3786000	And the cost is very high
3786000	3788000	But this is not the most complicated part
3788000	3790000	The most complicated part is that its signal is still super small
3790000	3792000	It's so small that we can't
3792000	3794000	Just measure DC
3794000	3796000	Isn't there a bias?
3796000	3798000	The answer is no, we can't measure
3798000	3800000	So we have to use another one
3800000	3802000	It's also a very high-tech thing
3802000	3804000	High-tech
3804000	3806000	It's expensive, it's called Squid
3806000	3808000	Squid here
3808000	3810000	Then Squid
3810000	3812000	The principle of this thing is that it can be measured to a very, very
3812000	3814000	Small magnetic field
3814000	3816000	But the magnetic field is only in
3816000	3818000	Oscillating field
3818000	3820000	So you become
3820000	3822000	We want to put our TES
3822000	3824000	I circle it up and then connect an AC
3824000	3826000	Current
3826000	3828000	Then cross a
3828000	3830000	Magnetic field
3830000	3832000	Then the magnetic field will produce a magnetic field
3832000	3834000	For Squid
3834000	3836000	But we want to say
3836000	3838000	Our TES is not heated
3838000	3840000	Then it becomes useless
3840000	3842000	We want it to be pulled back to its original temperature
3842000	3844000	So
3844000	3846000	There is one next to it
3846000	3848000	This
3848000	3850000	The circuit
3850000	3852000	If today's TES is bigger
3852000	3854000	The current flowing through it
3854000	3856000	Will become smaller because the current flowing through the next door
3856000	3858000	Will become bigger
3858000	3860000	So its self-current heating will become smaller
3860000	3862000	But you continue to put it in a
3862000	3864000	Cooling power
3864000	3866000	Inside the refrigerator
3866000	3868000	Its temperature will be pulled down
3868000	3870000	So this is very complicated
3870000	3872000	Then couple to Squid
3872000	3874000	Then go up and use Amplifier to magnify it
3874000	3876000	So our TES
3876000	3878000	Looks like this
3878000	3880000	What you see
3880000	3882000	The one next to it is the size of a person
3882000	3884000	You can understand
3884000	3886000	Middle
3886000	3888000	This little one by one
3888000	3890000	Each one is the picture on the right
3890000	3892000	The lower half of the picture on the right
3892000	3894000	Six boxes
3894000	3896000	Is the box you just saw
3896000	3898000	Then there are 31
3898000	3900000	So there are 31 times 6, 186 pieces
3900000	3902000	This crystal
3902000	3904000	Is in such a big experiment
3904000	3906000	Then
3906000	3908000	We call it Tower
3908000	3910000	It's full of complicated and expensive
3910000	3912000	Circuit
3912000	3914000	Then we put it in Canada's
3914000	3916000	Snow Lab, 2 kilometers underground
3916000	3918000	If you are interested, you can ask me why
3918000	3920000	Underground
3920000	3922000	Then Future
3922000	3924000	This is a summary
3924000	3926000	Focus on low mass
3926000	3928000	Then we
3928000	3930000	We hope it is very low threshold
3930000	3932000	There is no way to make single
3932000	3934000	A small elliptical TES becomes very sensitive
3934000	3936000	So we want to put that
3936000	3938000	A lot of puzzles
3938000	3940000	Connect it into a big piece
3940000	3942000	Then use a single readout
3942000	3944000	Let it become a
3944000	3946000	Pixel, so a pixel is so big
3946000	3948000	Actually, we only have 12 pixels
3948000	3950000	It means that the fluctuation is averaged
3950000	3952000	it is good
3952000	3954000	What is his problem? His problem is
3954000	3956000	Obviously our Reconstruct
3956000	3958000	The location of the collision
3958000	3960000	The location resolution is very bad
3960000	3962000	Right?
3962000	3964000	So I want to speed up
3964000	3966000	Speed up
3966000	3968000	Then my projection does not speed up
3968000	3970000	Then this is
3970000	3972000	Different electronics need to be frozen at different temperatures
3972000	3974000	So we still have a super super expensive refrigerator
3974000	3976000	To control this temperature, then it is very wasteful
3976000	3978000	it is good
3978000	3980000	So what are we going to do?
3980000	3982000	What you see now is a prototype detector
3982000	3984000	I will talk about it quickly because it is basically
3984000	3986000	Can't
3986000	3988000	I don't want to talk about it
3988000	3990000	You see every dot
3990000	3992000	It's all a single pixel
3992000	3994000	OK
3994000	3996000	What about this pixel?
3996000	3998000	You can see a line here
3998000	4000000	This line goes up like this
4000000	4002000	Then down
4002000	4004000	Then go up again
4004000	4006000	Then come down again
4006000	4008000	Read out all the signals of each dot
4008000	4010000	it is good
4010000	4012000	Then it is all single pixel
4012000	4014000	It is not connected into a pixel
4014000	4016000	And
4016000	4018000	It doesn't need cryogenic electronics at all
4018000	4020000	Its signal can be measured directly
4020000	4022000	What is the reason?
4022000	4024000	The reason is that we use superconductors
4024000	4026000	Superconductors have no resistance
4026000	4028000	But the superconductor has a resistance
4028000	4030000	Why?
4030000	4032000	Because we know our
4032000	4034000	Charge carrier
4034000	4036000	It is masked
4036000	4038000	You are in normal electricity
4038000	4040000	What is it?
4040000	4042000	Inside the conductor
4042000	4044000	It is an effective mask
4044000	4046000	Because it is in a
4046000	4048000	Electrode inside the lattice
4048000	4050000	It is a cooper pair inside the superconductor
4050000	4052000	It is the same
4052000	4054000	There is a mask
4054000	4056000	Then there will be a circuit
4056000	4058000	So let's measure this circuit
4058000	4060000	What is the best way to measure the circuit?
4060000	4062000	You say that good
4062000	4064000	Then I will scan the whole frequency
4064000	4066000	Then let's see the speed of its drop
4066000	4068000	I know its slope
4068000	4070000	I know how big the circuit is
4070000	4072000	The smartest way
4072000	4074000	Is to make an oscillator
4074000	4076000	You help it with a capacitor
4076000	4078000	Then it becomes like this
4078000	4080000	OK
4080000	4082000	So you have a circuit
4082000	4084000	Then you can use the incoming energy
4084000	4086000	The example here is light
4086000	4088000	But we are copper to phonon
4088000	4090000	Then break it
4090000	4092000	Break its cooper pair
4092000	4094000	It changed its circuit
4094000	4096000	After changing its circuit
4096000	4098000	The oscillating frequency of this oscillator
4098000	4100000	So its oscillating frequency
4100000	4102000	Here will move
4102000	4104000	Move away
4104000	4106000	From the side of this move
4106000	4108000	We know how much it has been broken
4108000	4110000	Then we know the cooper pair
4110000	4112000	So we know
4112000	4114000	How much energy do we need
4114000	4116000	So what do you actually see?
4116000	4118000	You put it on
4118000	4120000	Network analyzer
4120000	4122000	You see a lot of peaks standing here
4122000	4124000	Like a comb
4124000	4126000	This is not in the time domain
4126000	4128000	Then the frequency domain
4128000	4130000	If a pixel is hit
4130000	4132000	It will move to the side
4132000	4134000	Then the real device
4134000	4136000	It's broken again
4136000	4138000	It looks like this
4138000	4140000	A cable goes in
4140000	4142000	It's a waveguide
4142000	4144000	If you don't hit on
4144000	4146000	Those resonant frequency
4146000	4148000	It's basically a one in one out
4148000	4150000	No problem
4150000	4152000	But hit on resonant frequency
4152000	4154000	There will be a very big drop
4154000	4156000	So it's a waveguide
4156000	4158000	You can read all the pixels
4158000	4160000	So basically
4160000	4162000	On the CDMX crystal you just saw
4162000	4164000	12 pixels, we can make it 1000
4164000	4166000	No problem
4166000	4168000	Summarize
4168000	4170000	This effect
4170000	4172000	This is our current status
4172000	4174000	It sounds easy
4174000	4176000	We just make a number
4176000	4178000	Then we have 1000 pixels
4178000	4180000	There is no problem
4180000	4182000	What is the problem?
4182000	4184000	What we do now
4184000	4186000	Looks like this
4186000	4188000	Resonance is very small
4188000	4190000	Resonance is about 2dB
4190000	4192000	Resonance
4192000	4194000	But our waveguide
4194000	4196000	It's very, very bad
4196000	4198000	20dB drop
4198000	4200000	Continuous
4200000	4202000	We can make the waveguide
4202000	4204000	Looks like this
4204000	4206000	The waveguide is about minus 5dB
4206000	4208000	But our
4208000	4210000	Resonance is only about 1dB
4210000	4212000	Anyway, it's all super bad
4212000	4214000	Ok
4216000	4218000	Then finally talk about what we want to do
4218000	4220000	That is
4220000	4222000	We know different superconductors
4222000	4224000	The binding energy of the cooper pair inside
4224000	4226000	Different
4226000	4228000	Then we know again
4228000	4230000	Uh
4230000	4232000	What is our phonon energy
4232000	4234000	So if we choose
4234000	4236000	Cooper pair binding energy
4236000	4238000	Greater than
4238000	4240000	That phonon energy
4240000	4242000	Phonon hits the cooper pair
4242000	4244000	It won't absorb, it will spit it back
4244000	4246000	Because it can't break the smallest unit
4246000	4248000	So
4248000	4250000	If we put our waveguide
4250000	4252000	Made of that kind of material
4252000	4254000	But our detector is called KIT
4254000	4256000	Kinetic Inductance Detector
4256000	4258000	Made of material that can be broken
4258000	4260000	Our 100% energy will
4260000	4262000	Absorbed in the pixel
4262000	4264000	So our resolution
4264000	4266000	Should be very large
4266000	4268000	High
4268000	4270000	That's it
4270000	4272000	A little over time
4280000	4282000	Actually, I said R&D, but I didn't say it
4286000	4288000	Someone over there is talking
4288000	4290000	I'm sorry
4296000	4298000	My wife told me to go grocery shopping
4302000	4304000	Will this be recorded?
4304000	4306000	Will be recorded
4306000	4308000	It should be recorded
4308000	4310000	It doesn't matter
4314000	4316000	Let's go
4318000	4320000	Resolution
4320000	4322000	Resolution
4322000	4324000	Resolution
4324000	4326000	Resolution
4326000	4328000	Resolution
4328000	4330000	Resolution
4330000	4332000	Resolution
4332000	4334000	Resolution
4334000	4336000	This question is actually like this
4336000	4338000	The first one is you want to put your
4338000	4340000	Resonance Q factor
4340000	4342000	Because the larger your Q factor
4342000	4344000	The more dots you have to scan
4344000	4346000	Otherwise you won't see it
4346000	4348000	Scan your Q factor
4348000	4350000	How big
4350000	4352000	What is the basis? How do you decide that?
4352000	4354000	Instinctively
4354000	4356000	Just make the Q factor super big
4356000	4358000	Because if it's super big, it means
4358000	4360000	It doesn't have a problem with its own detection resolution
4360000	4362000	But because you
4362000	4364000	Knocked into the crystal
4364000	4366000	Phonon
4366000	4368000	Phonon will
4368000	4370000	It's just a shockwave, right?
4370000	4372000	It has a
4372000	4374000	You know the shockwave divided by the size of the crystal
4374000	4376000	It's probably the time it floats to the surface
4376000	4378000	So its wave shape
4378000	4380000	There's probably one
4382000	4384000	There's one
4384000	4386000	There's one in the frequency
4386000	4388000	There's a main band
4388000	4390000	Today you want it to be coupled
4390000	4392000	To a certain
4392000	4394000	Resonance
4394000	4396000	Actually you have to do
4396000	4398000	Conversion
4398000	4400000	Convert to
4400000	4402000	The width of the baseband is
4402000	4404000	Equal to your bandwidth
4404000	4406000	So your
4406000	4408000	Resolution actually depends on
4408000	4410000	How big your crystal is
4410000	4412000	So we actually
4412000	4414000	Don't want it to be big
4414000	4416000	It can't be too big
4416000	4418000	Otherwise we will miss the phonon
4418000	4420000	That's probably
4420000	4422000	10 to the power of 4
4422000	4424000	10 to the power of 4
4424000	4426000	And then we see how many pixels to put
4426000	4428000	And then between each pixel
4428000	4430000	In order to keep it out of the way
4430000	4432000	You have to look at its spacing
4432000	4434000	How wide
4434000	4436000	Then add this up and you can push
4436000	4438000	Your whole
4438000	4440000	Dynamic range
4440000	4442000	You have to measure a few points
4442000	4444000	And then how fast
4444000	4446000	Of course it has something to do with DAQ
4450000	4452000	I have a question
4452000	4454000	You said a
4454000	4456000	You said a
4456000	4458000	What does it mean
4458000	4460000	Actually
4460000	4462000	Waveguide is a very fancy word
4462000	4464000	But it's actually a wire
4464000	4466000	The wire is actually waveguide
4466000	4468000	When you appreciate this thing, you feel that the wire is super powerful
4468000	4470000	Just good
4470000	4472000	I go back to that page
4474000	4476000	This picture
4478000	4480000	You put the one next to it
4480000	4482000	The Tai Chi picture is all gone
4482000	4484000	There's a wire, isn't there
4484000	4486000	And then there's a bucket here
4486000	4488000	Each bucket is a pixel
4488000	4490000	And then that pixel
4492000	4494000	It's a
4494000	4496000	LC circuit
4496000	4498000	You can think of it as
4498000	4500000	It's a resonator
4500000	4502000	It's a very, very narrow band
4502000	4504000	Bandpass
4504000	4506000	And it's super bandpass
4506000	4508000	That is to say, when your frequency
4508000	4510000	Just fall in
4510000	4512000	That
4512000	4514000	The frequency
4514000	4516000	Your signal will not flow from the beginning
4516000	4518000	To the end
4518000	4520000	You will flow from the beginning to this side
4520000	4522000	And then you just turn it all the way down
4522000	4524000	OK, so
4524000	4526000	What about this picture
4526000	4528000	You can think of this picture as
4528000	4530000	The signal you take out
4530000	4532000	The signal you put in
4532000	4534000	So
4534000	4536000	This line is 1.0
4536000	4538000	That is to say, there is no hit
4538000	4540000	When the resonator
4540000	4542000	How much in, how much out
4542000	4544000	What I'm talking about now is an ideal situation
4544000	4546000	But it's not an ideal situation
4546000	4548000	But when it goes in
4548000	4550000	The frequency it goes in
4550000	4552000	It just happens to be from this
4552000	4554000	It will show up all the way down
4554000	4556000	So this will go straight
4556000	4558000	To the bottom
4558000	4560000	Theoretically, it should be super 5DD
4560000	4562000	So it will become a number
4562000	4564000	Basically, that's it
4564000	4566000	Is this number picture a one-shot
4566000	4568000	Or does it always have a frequency
4568000	4570000	Or is it always
4570000	4572000	You can think of me sending a frequency
4572000	4574000	And then send a frequency
4574000	4576000	This is a way to do it
4576000	4578000	But another way is like this
4578000	4580000	Is that you send a signal in
4580000	4582000	And then the signal that comes out
4582000	4584000	Do a Fourier transform
4584000	4586000	So you have to send in all the frequencies at once
4586000	4588000	So the AC next to you
4588000	4590000	Is to send in all the frequencies
4592000	4594000	Yes, but it will be slower
4594000	4596000	It should be said that its resolution is lower
4596000	4598000	Sorry, it's not slower, it's lower
4598000	4600000	So we usually
4600000	4602000	Take the detector
4602000	4604000	And then do this once
4604000	4606000	See all the numbers
4606000	4608000	Where is that one by one
4608000	4610000	And then we send a lot of
4610000	4612000	Those tones
4612000	4614000	Do you know what I mean
4614000	4616000	So we actually
4616000	4618000	Just delete a lot of
4618000	4620000	The bottom of the flat line
4620000	4622000	So our DAQ will be much faster
4622000	4624000	But yes, that's probably it
4624000	4626000	It has its problems
4626000	4628000	That's it
4628000	4630000	At least for people
4630000	4632000	It's a one-shot time for people
4632000	4634000	I can hear you
4634000	4636000	I'm Zhang Jianping
4638000	4640000	You're Zhang Jianping
4640000	4642000	What else
4642000	4644000	Are you sleeping
4644000	4646000	What's the problem
4646000	4648000	That's it
4648000	4650000	I think you've been talking about it
4650000	4652000	It seems that basically everyone is
4652000	4654000	Mostly from the hardware
4654000	4656000	To
4656000	4658000	To change
4658000	4660000	Have you ever thought about this
4660000	4662000	In fact, you can
4662000	4664000	The software part of the statistics
4664000	4666000	Can do a little help
4666000	4668000	Because I feel like you're in the front
4668000	4670000	The chamber
4670000	4672000	It's a more continuous way
4672000	4674000	It's a continuous one
4674000	4676000	But it still has to knock things
4676000	4678000	But it's more continuous
4678000	4680000	But when you get to the back
4680000	4682000	When it becomes the transition edge
4682000	4684000	It's like
4684000	4686000	We want to measure a person
4686000	4688000	How perverted he is
4688000	4690000	Give him a perverted meter
4690000	4692000	Assuming continuous
4692000	4694000	But to see if he's going to kill
4694000	4696000	It becomes a one-off
4696000	4698000	Do you know what I'm talking about
4698000	4700000	Wait a minute
4700000	4702000	Do you know that speaking will be recorded
4702000	4704000	It doesn't matter
4704000	4706000	I'm not talking about it today
4708000	4710000	Anyway
4710000	4712000	So your curve will become
4712000	4714000	This should not be called long linear
4714000	4716000	But this is the
4716000	4718000	Line of logistic regression
4718000	4720000	So in fact
4720000	4722000	It's a one-off
4724000	4726000	You spend a continuous line
4726000	4728000	One or one straight line
4728000	4730000	In the middle
4730000	4732000	Then I see you feed him
4732000	4734000	It's just looking at his results
4734000	4736000	But actually if you put it
4736000	4738000	Because your problem now is
4738000	4740000	My feeling is
4740000	4742000	Because Dark Matter is a
4742000	4744000	It's more of a sample study
4744000	4746000	Because your signal is rare
4746000	4748000	If I'm not mistaken
4750000	4752000	There are some
4752000	4754000	Processing sample
4754000	4756000	Information
4756000	4758000	Can increase sensitivity
4758000	4760000	With the accuracy of the time
4760000	4762000	Including if you use some
4762000	4764000	Like bootstrapping
4764000	4766000	Or use some
4766000	4768000	Regularization
4768000	4770000	To
4770000	4772000	Regularize his signal
4772000	4774000	It's actually
4774000	4776000	Bayesian method
4776000	4778000	You can increase
4778000	4780000	Artificially increase its accuracy
4780000	4782000	Although it sounds weird
4782000	4784000	Because you actually
4784000	4786000	It's not really seeing anything
4786000	4788000	No, it's not weird
4788000	4790000	You know what I want to use
4790000	4792000	But it doesn't seem to work
4792000	4794000	Do you know
4794000	4796000	It can be used
4796000	4798000	I'm here
4798000	4800000	Because the question is a bit long
4800000	4802000	So
4802000	4804000	I repeat it again
4804000	4806000	So the problem with the sample
4806000	4808000	In addition to talking a lot of dirty words in the middle
4808000	4810000	Because there are not many
4810000	4812000	His problem is like this
4812000	4814000	That is to say, we are now doing detector
4814000	4816000	Then measured
4816000	4818000	If you don't measure it, you don't measure it
4818000	4820000	But can we use
4820000	4822000	Software method
4822000	4824000	Our
4824000	4826000	General
4826000	4828000	Experimental sensitivity
4828000	4830000	Is that what you mean?
4830000	4832000	Correct
4832000	4834000	The answer is yes
4834000	4836000	And when you have
4836000	4838000	One or two hundred people doing an experiment
4838000	4840000	This part will have one hundred people
4840000	4842000	Do something like this
4842000	4844000	Ok
4844000	4846000	Why are we
4846000	4848000	Now focus on this part
4848000	4850000	There is actually a very interesting reason
4850000	4852000	When you start doing dark matter
4852000	4854000	You will find out
4854000	4856000	The environment you live in
4856000	4858000	The air you breathe
4858000	4860000	The pen you use is super invincible
4860000	4862000	Very radioactive
4862000	4864000	OK
4864000	4866000	So the problem is
4866000	4868000	We can now
4868000	4870000	Measure the signal
4870000	4872000	Then use the software you just said
4872000	4874000	To correct it
4874000	4876000	Whether it is correct
4876000	4878000	His true location
4878000	4880000	True energy
4880000	4882000	But we eventually
4882000	4884000	There will be a problem
4884000	4886000	We want to be very clear
4886000	4888000	Confidence level is very high
4888000	4890000	This is my detector
4890000	4892000	Radioactivity
4892000	4894000	Or the real dark matter
4894000	4896000	Then we
4896000	4898000	Now found
4898000	4900000	The most important
4900000	4902000	To distinguish this
4902000	4904000	The difference is
4904000	4906000	Even if it is a neutral particle
4906000	4908000	As long as it is
4908000	4910000	The particle we know
4910000	4912000	The depth of his special detector
4912000	4914000	It must be lighter than dark matter
4914000	4916000	why
4916000	4918000	Because his interaction must be bigger
4918000	4920000	So he was blocked earlier
4920000	4922000	So we are very, very
4922000	4924000	To know exactly
4924000	4926000	Where is he really hitting
4926000	4928000	Then we just
4928000	4930000	Buy a super expensive crystal
4930000	4932000	Then he is one-half outside
4932000	4934000	The signal over there
4934000	4936000	Don't use
4936000	4938000	It's a waste of money
4938000	4940000	So we want to be very, very good
4940000	4942000	Location resolution
4942000	4944000	Location resolution
4944000	4946000	The most important thing we are now
4946000	4948000	The biggest limit is
4948000	4950000	We have six pixels on one side
4950000	4952000	What do you want
4952000	4954000	So our limit is not
4954000	4956000	The reconstruction of our software
4956000	4958000	Not good
4958000	4960000	Your detection is basically
4960000	4962000	The biggest limitation
4962000	4964000	Our software
4964000	4966000	Video
4966000	4968000	Talk about this
4968000	4970000	I don't want to talk about the content
4970000	4972000	You can see the picture
4972000	4974000	The star next to it hasn't come out yet
4978000	4980000	The star next to it
4980000	4982000	The blue part
4982000	4984000	Is in one of them
4984000	4986000	Surface detector
4986000	4988000	The red part is in another
4988000	4990000	Surface detector
4990000	4992000	I just said
4992000	4994000	There are six pixels on one side
4994000	4996000	So there are twelve
4996000	4998000	The six pixels are actually arranged
4998000	5000000	A triangle like this
5000000	5002000	Plus one in the middle
5002000	5004000	Then there are two rings on the outside
5004000	5006000	If there are two rings on the outside
5006000	5008000	He has measured any signal
5008000	5010000	We think he is on the surface
5010000	5012000	We just threw it away
5012000	5014000	So you didn't see it here
5014000	5016000	And then in the middle
5016000	5018000	But there are a lot of triangles
5018000	5020000	You can see
5020000	5022000	If that size is six
5022000	5024000	If it's three inches
5024000	5026000	The width is actually super wide
5026000	5028000	So the resolution is super bad
5028000	5030000	If you want to do this
5030000	5032000	You either have to dig
5032000	5034000	To the very edge
5034000	5036000	Let you go
5036000	5038000	This thing is
5038000	5040000	We know the particle
5040000	5042000	Or we have to find the particle
5042000	5044000	The confidence level is very low
5044000	5046000	Or you have to dig a lot
5046000	5048000	Either way is not the most efficient way
5048000	5050000	So we have to do this on the hardware
5050000	5052000	It's the most you're right
5052000	5054000	It's true that it's true on the software
5054000	5056000	But it's relative
5056000	5058000	Change the hardware directly
5058000	5060000	His effectiveness
5060000	5062000	Too much difference
5062000	5064000	But you're right
5064000	5066000	Do you have any questions?
5066000	5068000	I just turned off the microphone
5068000	5070000	So speak slower
5076000	5078000	I'll ask you again
5078000	5080000	You just
5080000	5082000	The new design
5082000	5084000	Is to use
5084000	5086000	Six L and C
5086000	5088000	Then it looks like
5088000	5090000	You can do 40 on the hardware
5090000	5092000	Then you just said that
5092000	5094000	You can't do too high
5094000	5096000	Then you need to consider
5096000	5098000	His loss
5098000	5100000	That is to say, he changed to this
5100000	5102000	Super early
5102000	5104000	It's broken
5104000	5106000	Ok
5106000	5108000	Good question
5108000	5110000	The answer is
5110000	5112000	This is the problem of TES
5112000	5114000	Not our problem
5114000	5116000	Why?
5116000	5118000	Because TES
5118000	5120000	He just needs to operate near TC
5120000	5122000	So there is a little bit
5122000	5124000	Local heat accumulation
5124000	5126000	Will have a big impact on the function of the detector
5126000	5128000	But what we want
5128000	5130000	Turn on kinetic inductance
5130000	5132000	The more the better
5132000	5134000	So
5134000	5136000	TC is 1K, 2K material
5136000	5138000	We freeze it to 20mK
5138000	5140000	This way
5140000	5142000	Our kinetic inductance is very large
5142000	5144000	And
5144000	5146000	Thermal fluctuation
5146000	5148000	There is no impact
5148000	5150000	So this is one of the advantages of TES
5150000	5152000	But yes
5152000	5154000	This is the problem of TES
5162000	5164000	Any other questions?
5168000	5170000	If not
5170000	5172000	Thank you
