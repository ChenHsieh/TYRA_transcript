00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Let's start recording.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Okay.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Okay, I got it. Thank you.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Let's start.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Yanping.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm your host today.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
But I'll probably talk for a while

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
and then I'll be gone.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Because my wife's waist is twisted

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
to the point where she can't hold the baby.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
So...

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm going to have an emergency meeting later.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
So today,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
let's welcome Hanxi to share

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
with us...

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
He's the only one who has a webcam

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
so he's Hanxi.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
He's going to share

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
with us about the

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
law related to

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
public safety.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Because

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Hanxi...

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Is Hanxi right?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yes, that's right.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
My Chinese isn't very good.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Hanxi used to

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
study law.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
But then he went to the police station

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
to study...

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
He studied for a while

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
in Yang Ming's police station.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Then he came back to study law.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
His major is

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
the law related to

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
public safety.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Hanxi will share the details with us later.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
No problem.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
We're happy to have Hanxi here today

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
because he's probably our first law student.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Also, he's probably our first...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I guess,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
pure humanist.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
So we're happy that we can finally

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
expand to a more complete

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
academic field.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
There are people in all fields.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Without further ado,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
let's give a round of applause to welcome Hanxi.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm the only one in charge of filming.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Because

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
today's guest is not alone.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Today's guest is not alone.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Let me briefly introduce myself.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm a friend of Yuhui.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Let's get to know each other.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Why is my microphone

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
turned off all of a sudden?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
It's like

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
a small roundtable.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It's like a chat.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
It's not a formal report.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Since we have the opportunity,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
let's get to know each other.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm not sure

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
which school you're from.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So let's...

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Let me introduce myself.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Let me introduce myself.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I'm from UNC.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm from Beka.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm majoring in social psychology.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Who's next?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Hello.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Hi.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Let me introduce myself first.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm from DC.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm George Washington.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm majoring in mechanical engineering.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm majoring in

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
high-performance computing.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
It's related to supercomputers.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
It's related to supercomputers.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm doing an internship

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
in Tennessee.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
So you're not in DC.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I'll be back in September.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I'll be back in September.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Cool.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
So your name is

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Zhuang Ping...

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Bi Yue.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Zhuang Bi Yue.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Bi Yue Xuan Hua.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Let's switch to Caltech.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
We have two people here.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm Zhuang Ye You.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm working in Caltech

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
and NASA JPL.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm working on dark matter experiments.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm Yu Zhe Jing.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
You can call me Zhe.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm studying in Taiwan University.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm studying in Taiwan University.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm working in Caltech.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I used to work in chemical engineering.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm working in environmental engineering.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
That's cool.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
That's cool.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
So there's one more person.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
He left a comment

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
in the chat room.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Oh, okay.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
He's studying geography.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
He's studying geography.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
What field is he studying?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Geography is pretty broad.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It ranges from biology to natural science.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm pretty interested in this.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So we're going to

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
chat with Zhuang.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Physical Geography.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Okay.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
You've been to Charleston.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Okay.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm going to start.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm going to hand over my video.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm going to hand over my video.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Okay.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Hello, everyone.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm at Georgetown

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
studying law.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
If you have any questions,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
feel free to ask.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You can see my screen.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I think you can hear me.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
If you have any questions,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
feel free to ask.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm happy to share

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
my research topic with you.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I'm at Georgetown Law School.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm at Georgetown Law School.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It's a big classroom.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
The signal here is very good.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I'm preparing this topic

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
about obesity

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and soda tax.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm preparing this topic

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
about obesity

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
and soda tax.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I'm preparing this topic

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
about obesity

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
and soda tax.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm happy to share

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
my research topic

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
with you.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
As for this topic,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
as for this topic,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I've seen your research background

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
and your interest.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
and your interest.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
You are a Law student,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
after my research.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
You have a reputation

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
as an authority

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
in social science

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
You have a reputation as an authority

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
in social science

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
in social science

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
and with the social issue.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
and with the social issue.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I am not sure

06:56.000 --> 06:58.240
If we are too

06:58.240 --> 07:00.000
boring or too hard Louise.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I am not sure

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
is a good

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
introduction.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Well

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Briefly is a bit

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
complicated because

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Actually I have

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
been to many schools

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
and by the way

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
this is the 5th

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
University of Charleston

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
So there are

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
my field

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
On the one hand, I was born with a legal background

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
as you all know

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I studied law

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
and then became a lawyer

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I was born with a legal background and trained

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I also studied law

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
and now I am studying law

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
On the other hand, I have

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
a different background

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
from other law students

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
in my work experience

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
and medical background

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
How to say

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
My first

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
political work

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I put a small picture here

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
My first political work

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
was in Seattle

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
ICHS

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
International Community Health Service

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
International Community Health Service

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
hospital work

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
At that time, I was in UW

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
2007

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
After graduating from the University of Charleston

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I went there to work

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
This is my first political work

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Because I was a lawyer in Taiwan before

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I haven't worked in Taiwan

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
That was my first political work

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
For a lawyer in Taiwan

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I worked in a hospital

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I think this is a very surprising thing

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Anyway

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
So that year

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
to some extent

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I got interested in medical law

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
and then

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
jumped out

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
When I returned to Taiwan

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I tried to keep it as relevant as possible

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So I continued to specialize in medical law

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
in the field of public health law

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
So can everyone hear me?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Because I found this

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
quite strange

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I can't hear everyone's voice

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
We can hear you

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Welcome everyone to speak at any time

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Otherwise

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It's my first time to find this kind of self-talk

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
It feels strange

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You can't see anyone

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
It's like practicing a speech

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I can hear you

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I can hear you

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Will it be better if I turn it on?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
If you don't mind

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I feel like I can see your face

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Because I'm not wearing clothes right now

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So I don't want to see

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So I don't want to see

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
But other people who are wearing clothes can turn it on

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Other people who are wearing clothes can turn it on

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
If there is an answer, we will turn it on

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Okay, no problem, thank you

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Can we turn on the video?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Can we turn on the video?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Yes, you can turn off the sound

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Yes, you can turn off the sound

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
At least there is a video

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
It feels better to talk to a real person

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
It feels better to talk to a real person

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Okay, thank you

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
To put it simply

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm basically a lawyer

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I went to Taiwan to study law

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
But I'm interested in public health law

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So I chose this topic

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
OK, I'm probably

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
It's 6.20 right now

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It's actually quite simple

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
My presentation is divided into three parts

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
The first one is introduction

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I want to introduce the background of this research

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Why did we choose sugar?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Why did we choose soda

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And the intervention of public health

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And the intervention of public health

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
The second one

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I reported a case study

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
One of the things I studied was the case of Sodatex

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
One of the things I studied was the case of Sodatex

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Finally, I hope to leave some time for discussion

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Finally, I hope to leave some time for discussion

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
About Sodatex

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Because Caltech should be in LA

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Because Caltech should be in LA

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So if there are students from

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
So if there are students from

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
San Francisco or Berkeley

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
They are really

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Within the scope of the use of Sodatex

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Because there is Sodatex in the city

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
May feel better

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But this is a trend

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
So all cities in the United States

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
are moving in this direction

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So maybe you will have this problem

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
So maybe you will have this problem

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I have talked to the LA public health officials

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I have talked to the LA public health officials

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
So it may not be in the short term

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
But this proposal has always existed

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It is possible

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
After the discussion

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
After the discussion

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
After the discussion

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
There must be pros and cons

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
There must be pros and cons

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
There must be pros and cons

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So I will use my time

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
So I will use my time

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
What is the concept of Sodatex?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
So I will use my time

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Isn't there any in California?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Isn't there any in California?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
People in California

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
People in California

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
People in California

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Are using cities as units

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Are using cities as units

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
To increase the Sodatex

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
To increase the Sodatex

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Most correct names are

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
more accurate translation is

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
more accurate translation is

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
it is except this Salestex

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
it is except this Salestex

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
it is in addition to a SodaTex

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
it is the at the top

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
more than now

12:57.000 --> 12:58.060
700

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
This trend continues

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
more and more places

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
plus tax

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
plus tax

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
When buying fuel

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
it is more expensive

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
like buying cigarettes and drinking alcohol

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
The tax on it has a higher price

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
The tax on it has a higher price

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Not exactly

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
extent

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Not exactly

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
not exactly

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I don't know if you will talk about it later

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I don't know if you will talk about it later

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I just want to ask

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Does the tax cover

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
hand shake drinks

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
like bubble milk tea

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
For now

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
for bubble milk

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
This is a good question

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Because most of it

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
in tax

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
is made

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
the finished product

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
But

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
if it is a

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
freshly made drink

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
freshly made juice

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
It doesn't look like it

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
But I can

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I think it is not included in terms of definition

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
But I can check again

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
This is a good question

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Especially in Taiwan

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
If you want to pass

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Does this hand shake drink include

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I think it is not included in terms of definition

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
But I can help you confirm this

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I can check again

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Thank you

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
We will cut it into three parts

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
We will cut it into three parts

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I will do the introduction part first

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I will do the introduction part first

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I want to tell you

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Why we choose sugar

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Why we choose soda

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
This is a trend

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
This is a trend

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You may have noticed

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
But if you use Google

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
But if you use Google

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
This is what I did yesterday

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
This is what I did yesterday

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I went to Google

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I went to Google

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000

This week

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
You may have seen this

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
They are

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Nuts Bar

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Energy Bar

15:39.000 --> 15:53.640
They

15:53.640 --> 15:59.640
have 45485 pounds of sugar

15:59.640 --> 16:01.640
This is equivalent to

16:01.640 --> 16:03.640
every 5 minutes

16:03.640 --> 16:05.640
all children in the US

16:05.640 --> 16:07.640

5 minutes of sugar consumption

16:17.640 --> 16:19.640
Private companies

16:19.640 --> 16:21.640
do this

16:21.640 --> 16:23.640
to promote

16:23.640 --> 16:25.640
their products

16:25.640 --> 16:27.640
They want to promote their products

16:27.640 --> 16:29.640
They have a new product

16:29.640 --> 16:31.640
which is

16:31.640 --> 16:33.640
fruit bar

16:33.640 --> 16:35.640
They call it D-tar

16:35.640 --> 16:37.640
This company is very interesting

16:37.640 --> 16:39.640
I don't know if you have bought their products

16:39.640 --> 16:41.640
If you look at their products

16:41.640 --> 16:43.640
you will see the word healthy

16:43.640 --> 16:45.640
This company

16:45.640 --> 16:47.640
used the word healthy

16:47.640 --> 16:49.640
on the packaging

16:49.640 --> 16:51.640
