00:00.000 --> 00:20.500
So after I graduated from university, I think I did an RA, if I remember correctly, at Professor Chen's place, right?

00:20.500 --> 00:26.500
I did it for a year or two

00:27.500 --> 00:34.500
After that, I went to Canada's McMaster to study for my PhD

00:34.500 --> 00:40.500
When I was studying for my PhD, one of the tutors was Dr. Trenner

00:40.500 --> 00:47.500
He was doing a course on music perception and intuition

00:47.500 --> 00:55.500
If you're interested, you can ask him why he chose to do music

00:55.500 --> 00:58.500
or intuition and cognition

00:58.500 --> 01:04.500
I don't know much about intuition, but my impression is that

01:04.500 --> 01:08.500
doing visual psychology takes up a large portion of the work

01:08.500 --> 01:12.500
So why did I decide to do intuition? I think it's interesting

01:16.500 --> 01:20.500
I don't know, it's just my guess

01:20.500 --> 01:24.500
Yongyi has a website, you can go check it out, it's really scary

01:24.500 --> 01:28.500
The publications are as long as ghosts

01:28.500 --> 01:33.500
Other than the publications, there's also awards and media coverage

01:33.500 --> 01:35.500
I think that's really cool

01:35.500 --> 01:38.500
I hope one day I can tell my parents that I'm a journalist

01:38.500 --> 01:44.500
Without further ado, let's welcome Yongyi to share his research with us

01:45.500 --> 01:50.500
I'll turn off my mic so you can hear me

01:50.500 --> 01:53.500
Can you hear me now?

01:53.500 --> 01:55.500
I think it's okay

01:55.500 --> 01:58.500
I'm a little shy

01:58.500 --> 02:00.500
I don't even know if I have to give a score

02:00.500 --> 02:03.500
Today is July 8th, I'm guessing my highest score is 87

02:03.500 --> 02:05.500
I can't go any higher

02:05.500 --> 02:07.500
That's about it

02:07.500 --> 02:09.500
I can predict the results

02:10.500 --> 02:14.500
You have to turn on the audio so you can hear the laughter

02:14.500 --> 02:17.500
I don't think there's any feedback

02:17.500 --> 02:19.500
I think we need feedback

02:19.500 --> 02:21.500
Forget it

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500
It's pretty funny

02:23.500 --> 02:26.500
I'm being encouraged, I'm indeed a person who studies truth psychology

02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
It's different

02:28.500 --> 02:31.500
I'm probably just making things up

02:32.500 --> 02:36.500
I'm not really interested in hearing

02:36.500 --> 02:39.500
There's no deep reason

02:39.500 --> 02:42.500
First of all, I'm very interested in music

02:42.500 --> 02:45.500
I only found out later that most people do visual research

02:45.500 --> 02:47.500
Most people talk about intuition

02:47.500 --> 02:50.500
It's directly implied that it's visual research

02:50.500 --> 02:52.500
I only found out later

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
If you're doing hearing research

02:54.500 --> 02:56.500
You have to say it's particularly famous for auditory

02:56.500 --> 02:58.500
Otherwise people will get it wrong

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
It's pretty interesting

03:00.500 --> 03:03.500
I think there are some phenomena in hearing

03:03.500 --> 03:07.500
It's different when it comes to other senses

03:07.500 --> 03:11.500
There are some special problems to deal with

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
I think that's what makes hearing interesting

03:13.500 --> 03:15.500
It's a special place

03:15.500 --> 03:19.500
Okay, let's get into my presentation

03:19.500 --> 03:22.500
I'm going to start studying how to share my screen

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
Okay, while you're studying

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
Let me tell you

03:29.500 --> 03:32.500
Just in case there's feedback

03:32.500 --> 03:34.500
Let me turn off the microphone

03:34.500 --> 03:37.500
If you have anything you want to say

03:37.500 --> 03:40.500
You can type it in

03:40.500 --> 03:43.500
You can also speak

03:43.500 --> 03:44.500
Okay

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
Okay

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
Let's go

03:47.500 --> 03:49.500
Okay

03:49.500 --> 03:54.500
My PhD research topic is

03:54.500 --> 03:58.500
It's very vague

03:58.500 --> 04:00.500
Dynamic Auditory Communication

04:00.500 --> 04:02.500
It's vague

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
It's about how to change your hearing

04:04.500 --> 04:07.500
In a dynamic situation

04:07.500 --> 04:10.500
How to change your hearing

04:10.500 --> 04:13.500
In a dynamic situation

04:13.500 --> 04:15.500
This includes

04:15.500 --> 04:17.500
For example, you're listening to me now

04:17.500 --> 04:19.500
All my voices change at any time

04:19.500 --> 04:21.500
For example, every time I make a sound

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
There's a millisecond

04:22.500 --> 04:24.500
And then it disappears

04:24.500 --> 04:25.500
Or listening to music

04:25.500 --> 04:27.500
It's kind of like that

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
And then

04:28.500 --> 04:31.500
And what I want to share today is

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
My experiment

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
From a traditional laboratory

04:34.500 --> 04:35.500
Psychological laboratory

04:35.500 --> 04:37.500
And then do it

04:37.500 --> 04:39.500
More complicated

04:39.500 --> 04:41.500
We think it's closer to the real

04:41.500 --> 04:42.500
Interaction

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
Under the environment of human interaction

04:44.500 --> 04:45.500
That is

04:45.500 --> 04:48.500
From a small laboratory to a large laboratory

04:48.500 --> 04:49.500
Between each other

04:49.500 --> 04:51.500
There are some research methods

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
Needs to be adjusted

04:53.500 --> 04:56.500
And then I just want to explain today

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
Take our research as an example

04:58.500 --> 05:01.500
How do we do this

05:01.500 --> 05:02.500
So my sub-topic is

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
How do psychologists do research

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
And there is a step-by-step explanation

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
Explain

05:07.500 --> 05:09.500
What are the problems we encounter

05:09.500 --> 05:10.500
And then

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
We think

05:11.500 --> 05:12.500
In our situation

05:12.500 --> 05:13.500
How do we solve it

05:13.500 --> 05:14.500
And then

05:14.500 --> 05:15.500
By the way

05:15.500 --> 05:16.500
Just

05:16.500 --> 05:17.500
Just

05:17.500 --> 05:18.500
Please help everyone

05:18.500 --> 05:20.500
The place is

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
September

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
Taiwan's Science and Music Magazine

05:23.500 --> 05:24.500
There will be a

05:24.500 --> 05:27.500
A special special issue of music psychology

05:27.500 --> 05:28.500
And then

05:30.500 --> 05:31.500
I want to put this

05:31.500 --> 05:32.500
Related research

05:32.500 --> 05:33.500
It's a draft

05:33.500 --> 05:34.500
Go over there

05:34.500 --> 05:35.500
As a

05:35.500 --> 05:36.500
A small topic

05:36.500 --> 05:37.500
Just share it

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
Just as a science book

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
Share it to readers in Taiwan

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
Then I didn't write it myself

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
The experience of doing a science book article

05:45.500 --> 05:46.500
Then if I hope

05:46.500 --> 05:47.500
That is to say

05:48.500 --> 05:50.500
I hope to make today's speech

05:50.500 --> 05:51.500
Into different fields

05:51.500 --> 05:52.500
People interested in science

05:52.500 --> 05:53.500
Can probably

05:53.500 --> 05:54.500
Psychologists

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
How do we do research

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
Especially in

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
How do we do research

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
In such a special situation

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
If you think

05:59.500 --> 06:00.500
On the content

06:00.500 --> 06:01.500
Or how to explain

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
How can it be adjusted better

06:03.500 --> 06:04.500
That is

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
I hope you can tell me

06:06.500 --> 06:07.500
Then

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
I will

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
I'm going to take the exam in two weeks

06:10.500 --> 06:11.500
So thank you very much

06:11.500 --> 06:13.500
If there is any help

06:13.500 --> 06:14.500
OK

06:14.500 --> 06:15.500
it is good

06:15.500 --> 06:17.500
The nonsense should be over

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
First of all, I want to say

06:19.500 --> 06:21.500
Hearing has many domains

06:21.500 --> 06:22.500
Like for example

06:22.500 --> 06:24.500
You can know if the pitch is high or low

06:24.500 --> 06:26.500
What I want to focus on today is

06:26.500 --> 06:27.500
Focus on time

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
For hearing

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
Is a very important thing

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
In fact, time is for many senses

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
And the reaction is very important

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
For hearing

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
I think it is especially critical

06:37.500 --> 06:38.500
Why

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
If you record my voice

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
Then take it to

06:41.500 --> 06:42.500
In the software of the computer

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
Open it

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
Look at its radio

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
Its radio

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
It looks like

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
Almost like this

06:47.500 --> 06:48.500
Then you can of course

06:48.500 --> 06:49.500
Decode

06:49.500 --> 06:50.500
That is to say

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
What is my voice

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
Then

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
Our hearing is

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
We have to put it together

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
To become a meaningful sentence

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
Ah

06:58.500 --> 06:59.500
But it's hard for hearing

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
That is to say

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
Every message

07:01.500 --> 07:04.500
The time it appears is so short

07:04.500 --> 07:05.500
And

07:05.500 --> 07:07.500
It won't appear again

07:07.500 --> 07:08.500
Ah

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
Human beings have lived for so long

07:09.500 --> 07:10.500
History

07:10.500 --> 07:11.500
The history of human communication

07:11.500 --> 07:12.500
Before the recorder was invented

07:12.500 --> 07:13.500
We have no chance

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
Listen again

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
What happened before

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
How is it

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
So human hearing

07:18.500 --> 07:19.500
A big problem

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
That is to say

07:20.500 --> 07:22.500
We have to be able to catch it quickly

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
Ah

07:23.500 --> 07:24.500
This message is displayed at any time

07:24.500 --> 07:26.500
And then accurately

07:26.500 --> 07:27.500
Awareness

07:27.500 --> 07:28.500
Feel it accurately

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
The content of this

07:29.500 --> 07:30.500
Then

07:30.500 --> 07:31.500
And another

07:31.500 --> 07:32.500
More demanding is

07:32.500 --> 07:33.500
That is

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
We are not just aware of this

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
And we have to

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
Make a quick response

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
For example

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
When you have a conversation with others

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
What are you hearing

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
You will be able to understand immediately

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
Then immediately

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
Be able to react

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
Then this skill

07:45.500 --> 07:46.500
When quarreling

07:46.500 --> 07:47.500
It's particularly important

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
Because if you slow down

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
If you slow down

07:49.500 --> 07:50.500
You lost the quarrel

07:50.500 --> 07:51.500
It's very

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
It's important to speak

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
Right

07:53.500 --> 07:54.500
So you see

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
Human beings are like this

07:55.500 --> 07:56.500
No, I'm kidding

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
That

07:57.500 --> 07:58.500
Not only in conversation

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
In another situation

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
For example, you are listening to music

08:00.500 --> 08:01.500
Ah

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
And for example, you are with

08:03.500 --> 08:04.500
You sing with others

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
Ah

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
Sing together

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
That

08:07.500 --> 08:09.500
I can't just listen to other people's music

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
Listen to this

08:10.500 --> 08:11.500
I'm going to

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
Sing my part

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
Because you are like this

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
No matter how fast your processing speed is

08:15.500 --> 08:17.500
There must be a time difference inside

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
That

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Ah

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
So

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
In fact, in many cases of hearing

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
We think it is

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
He keeps

08:24.500 --> 08:25.500
Keep predicting

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
What's going to happen next

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
Then let people

08:29.500 --> 08:30.500
Always

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
Let your intuition

08:31.500 --> 08:32.500
Let your nervous response

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Always in a

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
In a well-prepared situation

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
Then you can

08:35.500 --> 08:37.500
Precise intuition to this matter

08:37.500 --> 08:38.500
And then

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
Quickly prepared

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
To make the next reaction

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
So I think hearing is on time

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
Ah

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
In fact, compared to other sensory domains

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
Is

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
More demanding

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
This is

08:50.500 --> 08:51.500
My task

08:51.500 --> 08:53.500
So I think time is very important to hearing

08:53.500 --> 08:54.500
Ok

08:54.500 --> 08:55.500
If you have any questions

08:55.500 --> 08:56.500
You can interrupt me in the middle

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
Then if there is no problem

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
I will continue

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Then

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
By the way because I

09:00.500 --> 09:01.500
Now

09:01.500 --> 09:03.500
I share the screen

09:03.500 --> 09:04.500
So if everyone

09:04.500 --> 09:05.500
If you leave a message in the chat

09:05.500 --> 09:07.500
I should not be able to see it now

09:07.500 --> 09:08.500
So everyone can

09:08.500 --> 09:09.500
Just turn on the microphone

09:09.500 --> 09:11.500
It has nothing to do with me

09:11.500 --> 09:12.500
Ok

09:12.500 --> 09:13.500
Ah

09:13.500 --> 09:14.500
I have a question

09:14.500 --> 09:15.500
Ok

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
Please say

09:17.500 --> 09:18.500
The

09:18.500 --> 09:21.500
The M-I-N-G-E-R above the waveform

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
What is that?

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
Oh, that's just an example I found on the Internet

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
I don't know what that is

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
Sorry

09:29.500 --> 09:30.500
Ok

09:30.500 --> 09:31.500
Ok, thank you

09:32.500 --> 09:34.500
It should be a project title

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
Yes

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
It looks like this

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
But I don't know

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
I haven't searched either

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
Alright

09:43.500 --> 09:44.500
Maybe it's doing something

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
Voice

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
Voice of the computer

09:46.500 --> 09:49.500
Some of the projects handled by the visual

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
I don't know

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
Sorry

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
Then I will talk about it first

09:53.500 --> 09:55.500
In traditional psychology and neuroscience

09:55.500 --> 09:58.500
How do we do this kind of research in the lab

09:58.500 --> 09:59.500
If we want to know

09:59.500 --> 10:00.500
What is the importance of time for hearing

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
How do we do research

10:02.500 --> 10:03.500
For example

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
I

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
I will

10:05.500 --> 10:08.500
Design a series of hearing with a computer

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
A series of hearing that opens at any time

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
Then for example

10:11.500 --> 10:12.500
Then for example

10:12.500 --> 10:13.500
I can

10:13.500 --> 10:14.500
A kind of audio file

10:14.500 --> 10:15.500
I put it

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
Every note

10:16.500 --> 10:17.500
Bop, bop, bop

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
All time

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
Every bop, bop, bop

10:20.500 --> 10:21.500
Between each tone

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
Its time is fixed

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
The same length

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
For example, it's 500 milliseconds

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
So this way you

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
It sounds like a decoder

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
Then you can keep going

10:33.500 --> 10:34.500
So this

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
This is a very regular time

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
Then you can have a

10:37.500 --> 10:39.500
An irregular time

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
For example, it's

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
Between your pain and pain

10:41.500 --> 10:42.500
Can be

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
For example

10:43.500 --> 10:44.500
Random 250 milliseconds

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
Between 750 milliseconds

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
So it might sound like this

10:46.500 --> 10:49.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

10:49.500 --> 10:50.500
Just

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
You don't know at all

10:51.500 --> 10:52.500
You

10:52.500 --> 10:54.500
When will the next pain appear

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500
And then

10:55.500 --> 10:57.500
In this different

10:57.500 --> 10:58.500
Under the circumstances

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
We can

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
Require the audience to do some

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
Intuitive answer

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
For example, we can make

11:05.500 --> 11:07.500
Some of them have sounds

11:07.500 --> 11:08.500
Most of these sounds

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
Most of them are exactly the same

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
There are some sounds

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
Maybe we'll just make it

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
It's a little bit higher or a little bit lower

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
We're on the frequency domain

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
To make some adjustments

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
And then the audience

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
Just

11:19.500 --> 11:20.500
To participate in the experiment

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
The college student has to listen to that sound

11:22.500 --> 11:23.500
If he hears a higher pitch

11:23.500 --> 11:24.500
He'll press a button

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
If you hear a lower pitch

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
Just press a button

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
It sounds like

11:27.500 --> 11:29.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

11:29.500 --> 11:31.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
You have to listen to the higher pitch

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
You have to react

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
And then the other

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Under the circumstances of irregular time

11:36.500 --> 11:38.500
You can also do this kind of manipulation

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
And then we can go and see

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
For example

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
Under the circumstances of regular time

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
The correct rate of his answer

11:43.500 --> 11:44.500
It's going to be higher

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
Under the circumstances of irregular time

11:46.500 --> 11:47.500
Then we can

11:47.500 --> 11:48.500
Psychologists usually say

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
Oh, that's the regular time

11:50.500 --> 11:52.500
It can help you

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
Have a better sense

11:53.500 --> 11:55.500
Because you're better

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
Because your accuracy is higher

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
You can have a more accurate answer

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
In this case

12:02.500 --> 12:03.500
We can also do some

12:03.500 --> 12:05.500
Neuroscientific measurements

12:05.500 --> 12:08.500
For example, I can measure people's brainwaves

12:08.500 --> 12:10.500
This is a memory map

12:10.500 --> 12:12.500
It's because of the nervous response of the brain

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
The nervous response of the brain

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
It's all about the nerve

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
It's all about the neurotransmitter

12:16.500 --> 12:17.500
To do the reaction

12:17.500 --> 12:18.500
Then we can put those

12:18.500 --> 12:20.500
For example, the ECG map

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
Or the sensors for measuring muscle position

12:22.500 --> 12:23.500
We'll put it on the scalp

12:24.500 --> 12:25.500
That's because of the nerve response

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
It's going to be that wave signal

12:27.500 --> 12:28.500
It's going to come out

12:28.500 --> 12:30.500
So we can put it on the surface of the scalp

12:30.500 --> 12:31.500
Record this signal

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
That's what we call it

12:32.500 --> 12:35.500
The signal of the brainwaves

12:35.500 --> 12:37.500
Then we can do some corresponding analysis

12:37.500 --> 12:39.500
We can see that the brainwaves are

12:39.500 --> 12:42.500
How to capture the regularity of this time

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
And then for example

12:43.500 --> 12:45.500
Let's do some complicated processing

12:45.500 --> 12:46.500
And then we'll get

12:46.500 --> 12:47.500
Something like this

12:47.500 --> 12:48.500
The answer is

12:48.500 --> 12:50.500
We'll find out, for example

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
The brainwave

12:51.500 --> 12:54.500
It's going to adjust the speed of its vibration

12:54.500 --> 12:56.500
It's the same as the external stimulus

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
And then we just have to catch this

12:58.500 --> 12:59.500
In the brain

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
Imagine the nerve in the brain

13:00.500 --> 13:01.500
It's like a decoder

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
It's going to be able to accurately capture

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
How to produce the next second

13:05.500 --> 13:07.500
That's the traditional neuroscience

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
Or psychologically

13:08.500 --> 13:10.500
We're going to do this

13:10.500 --> 13:12.500
A study of orientation

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
But this study is actually quite

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
OK, please go ahead

13:16.500 --> 13:18.500
That's your time

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
That's the frequency

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
That cycle

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
How short can it be

13:24.500 --> 13:26.500
You mean the cycle of my voice

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
Or the cycle of the brainwaves

13:28.500 --> 13:30.500
The cycle of the voice

13:30.500 --> 13:32.500
And then there's the brainwaves

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
You're going to adjust it

13:33.500 --> 13:35.500
If it's the same as your external

13:35.500 --> 13:37.500
Does it have a limit

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
This is a good question

13:40.500 --> 13:42.500
Usually humans can catch the beat

13:42.500 --> 13:46.500
The shortest is the shortest between pain and pain

13:46.500 --> 13:47.500
It's 200 milliseconds

13:48.500 --> 13:50.500
I can't sing so fast

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
It's about the same speed

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
More than 200 milliseconds

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
You probably think

13:55.500 --> 13:57.500
It's almost a continuous sound

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
That's the slowest

13:58.500 --> 14:00.500
It's the longest between pain and pain

14:00.500 --> 14:04.500
It can be as long as 1,200 milliseconds

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
1.2 seconds

14:05.500 --> 14:07.500
After that

14:07.500 --> 14:09.500
You'll feel like every sound is independent

14:09.500 --> 14:12.500
You don't think it's a continuous rhythm

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
You just can't

14:13.500 --> 14:15.500
Know the pattern

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
What's interesting is that the brainwaves

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
Can only catch up

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
Such a speed range

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
It's slower than this

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
Or faster than this

14:24.500 --> 14:26.500
There's no way

14:26.500 --> 14:28.500
As for what causes what

14:28.500 --> 14:29.500
I don't know

14:29.500 --> 14:31.500
It's because the brain can't move so fast

14:31.500 --> 14:32.500
Move so slow

14:32.500 --> 14:33.500
To make us instinctively

14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
Can't catch up so fast

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Such a slow speed

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
I don't know

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
I can only say

14:37.500 --> 14:40.500
This is what we have now

14:41.500 --> 14:42.500
Thank you

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
Hello

14:44.500 --> 14:46.500
So I'd like to ask

14:46.500 --> 14:48.500
When you do this experiment

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
Do you have to eliminate

14:49.500 --> 14:52.500
Other noise interference?

14:52.500 --> 14:53.500
That's right

14:53.500 --> 14:55.500
We do this kind of experiment

14:55.500 --> 14:56.500
Because we want to be clean

14:56.500 --> 14:58.500
So we do it in the soundproof room

14:58.500 --> 15:00.500
And then we'll use headphones

15:00.500 --> 15:02.500
That is, we'll use those

15:02.500 --> 15:03.500
More special headphones

15:03.500 --> 15:05.500
Just send the sound

15:05.500 --> 15:06.500
Into the ear

15:06.500 --> 15:08.500
And it's very close

15:08.500 --> 15:09.500
The more inside, the better

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
And then the sound is transmitted

15:11.500 --> 15:12.500
It's all very clean

15:12.500 --> 15:13.500
I just want to reduce

15:13.500 --> 15:15.500
External interference

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
That's right

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
So when you say

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
The so-called hearing

15:18.500 --> 15:20.500
It means

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
Human beings

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
We can really

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
The sound we hear

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
Or include that

15:25.500 --> 15:26.500
Include that

15:26.500 --> 15:27.500
The frequency we can't hear

15:27.500 --> 15:29.500
It's also in the hearing

15:29.500 --> 15:31.500
For example, ultrasonic waves or

15:31.500 --> 15:33.500
Very low frequency

15:33.500 --> 15:34.500
That kind

15:34.500 --> 15:36.500
That kind of hearing

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
That kind

15:37.500 --> 15:38.500
That's what you're asking

15:38.500 --> 15:39.500
That is to say

15:39.500 --> 15:40.500
Physical stimulation

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
Does it stimulate psychological feelings?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.500
That's what we say

15:44.500 --> 15:46.500
Will ask questions like this

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
Of course

15:47.500 --> 15:48.500
Of course there are people

15:48.500 --> 15:49.500
Study such a question

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
That is to say

15:50.500 --> 15:51.500
Where is the limit of human hearing?

15:51.500 --> 15:52.500
Then you can see

15:52.500 --> 15:54.500
Where is the limit of frequency?

15:54.500 --> 15:55.500
But this is not me

15:55.500 --> 15:56.500
Today

15:56.500 --> 15:59.500
Is the main part of the discussion

15:59.500 --> 16:01.500
Maybe we'll wait

16:01.500 --> 16:04.500
Discuss again later

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500
Like this

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
I don't know if it's like this

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
Or just

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
You can discuss it casually

16:08.500 --> 16:09.500
No no no

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
Because of me

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
I'm more curious

16:11.500 --> 16:12.500
When you say you want to eradicate

16:12.500 --> 16:13.500
That interference

16:13.500 --> 16:15.500
When noise interference

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500
That's how you eradicate that kind

16:17.500 --> 16:18.500
We don't know at all

16:18.500 --> 16:20.500
The kind of interference we hear

16:20.500 --> 16:22.500
For example, like ultrasonic waves

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
You are in that

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
What is that called

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
There is no noise at all

16:26.500 --> 16:27.500
That kind of interference

16:27.500 --> 16:28.500
In that kind of experimental environment

16:28.500 --> 16:30.500
You can't guarantee

16:30.500 --> 16:33.500
He won't be affected by the outside world

16:33.500 --> 16:34.500
OK OK OK

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
Then I know

16:36.500 --> 16:38.500
Of course we

16:38.500 --> 16:40.500
What we do is

16:40.500 --> 16:41.500
We already know

16:41.500 --> 16:43.500
Human hearing frequency range

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
It's about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
In the frequency range of this Hz

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
We

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
In fact, in the experimental environment

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Can still measure

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
In the case of measurement

16:53.500 --> 16:55.500
We will make a comparison

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
As for ultrasonic waves

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
We generally think it's human

16:59.500 --> 17:01.500
Physically, you can't hear it

17:01.500 --> 17:03.500
So

17:03.500 --> 17:05.500
So we don't care about his control

17:05.500 --> 17:07.500
So for example

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
There is an ultrasonic wave in the lab

17:08.500 --> 17:11.500
The sound of the ultrasonic wave

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
Or that kind of very, very, very high frequency

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
We don't care

17:15.500 --> 17:17.500
So it's based on an assumption

17:17.500 --> 17:19.500
Those things won't cause

17:19.500 --> 17:21.500
It won't cause too much interference to humans

17:21.500 --> 17:23.500
Yes, it really won't

17:23.500 --> 17:24.500
And the other thing is

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
In the case of our experiments

17:26.500 --> 17:27.500
We don't say

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
One condition is to make a trial

17:29.500 --> 17:31.500
Of course we will do hundreds of trials

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
Thousands of trials

17:32.500 --> 17:33.500
Even if there is an effect

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
As long as it is with your experiment

17:35.500 --> 17:37.500
The program set by the computer

17:37.500 --> 17:39.500
If it's not related to each other

17:39.500 --> 17:41.500
Then the effect we observe

17:41.500 --> 17:44.500
These external effects

17:44.500 --> 17:46.500
It should be reduced a lot

17:46.500 --> 17:48.500
OK, thank you

17:48.500 --> 17:50.500
Then

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
Hey, copy it

17:51.500 --> 17:52.500
That is to say

17:52.500 --> 17:54.500
What about this POP process

17:54.500 --> 17:56.500
Of course you can decide for yourself

17:56.500 --> 17:58.500
See if you want to say

17:58.500 --> 18:00.500
To accept the middle question

18:00.500 --> 18:01.500
Or ask at the end

18:01.500 --> 18:02.500
Or open the discussion directly

18:02.500 --> 18:03.500
You can decide

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
Then but

18:04.500 --> 18:05.500
That is

18:05.500 --> 18:06.500
We

18:06.500 --> 18:08.500
The prediction is that you can

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
You can talk for about an hour

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
And then

18:11.500 --> 18:14.500
There will probably be a 20-minute discussion

18:14.500 --> 18:15.500
Ah

18:15.500 --> 18:16.500
That's it

18:16.500 --> 18:17.500
As for you

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
Cut it in half

18:18.500 --> 18:19.500
Or mixed together

18:19.500 --> 18:20.500
How do you decide

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
Just decide for yourself

18:21.500 --> 18:22.500
OK OK OK

18:22.500 --> 18:23.500
OK

18:23.500 --> 18:24.500
Let me tell you first

18:24.500 --> 18:26.500
I actually didn't prepare a lot of POP

18:26.500 --> 18:28.500
I only prepared about 18 pages

18:28.500 --> 18:29.500
So

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
So the topic part will be finished in a moment

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
if

18:32.500 --> 18:33.500
Um

18:33.500 --> 18:34.500
Some related topics

18:34.500 --> 18:36.500
Of course I'm sorry

18:36.500 --> 18:37.500
I just didn't know

18:37.500 --> 18:38.500
What's your problem

18:38.500 --> 18:41.500
If it's related to listening or other music

18:41.500 --> 18:43.500
We can wait until then to discuss

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
If this is related to the topic I'm talking about

18:45.500 --> 18:46.500
Of course we'll put it up

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
Discussed at the scene

18:47.500 --> 18:48.500
Sorry I just didn't know

18:48.500 --> 18:49.500
Your question

18:49.500 --> 18:51.500
With this

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
What I'm talking about now

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
What are the links

18:53.500 --> 18:56.500
OK

18:56.500 --> 18:57.500
OK

18:57.500 --> 18:58.500
That

18:58.500 --> 18:59.500
But

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
OK, I'll keep going

19:01.500 --> 19:04.500
I think the biggest problem in doing laboratory research

19:04.500 --> 19:05.500
That is to say

19:05.500 --> 19:06.500
If we want to understand

19:06.500 --> 19:07.500
Between people

19:07.500 --> 19:08.500
How to use it normally

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
For example, interact with listening messages

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
But in fact, the time law and the time law

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
These two messages

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
I experiment

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
I make this kind of message in the computer

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
It doesn't exist in the natural world

19:18.500 --> 19:19.500
You naturally

19:19.500 --> 19:20.500
You won't hear one

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
It's as accurate as a decoder

19:22.500 --> 19:23.500
You won't hear one

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
It's a completely random message

19:25.500 --> 19:26.500
You usually hear

19:26.500 --> 19:27.500
A little regular

19:27.500 --> 19:29.500
But there is no such regular message

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
If I do research like this

19:31.500 --> 19:32.500
In the end for understanding

19:32.500 --> 19:33.500
My human

19:33.500 --> 19:35.500
What is the real ability to help

19:35.500 --> 19:38.500
In fact, sometimes it is a bit biased

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
So

19:40.500 --> 19:42.500
In fact, there is a very interesting paper

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
Just released recently

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
It's called Neuroscience Needs Behavior

19:45.500 --> 19:47.500
If you are related

19:47.500 --> 19:48.500
Philosophy

19:48.500 --> 19:50.500
If you are interested in scientific philosophy

19:50.500 --> 19:52.500
I highly recommend this paper

19:52.500 --> 19:53.500
Then I will use it first

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
A few pictures inside

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
To talk about

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
This research

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
The limitations of laboratory research

19:57.500 --> 19:58.500
Generally, we want to know

19:58.500 --> 20:00.500
Research can be said

20:00.500 --> 20:03.500
For example, the neural pattern of the human brain

20:03.500 --> 20:06.500
What is the relationship between natural behavior

20:06.500 --> 20:08.500
Then you can take the neural pattern

20:08.500 --> 20:09.500
As

20:09.500 --> 20:10.500
For example, the psychological journey

20:10.500 --> 20:11.500
Psychological journey

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
Psychological inner journey

20:13.500 --> 20:15.500
This is what we want to know

20:15.500 --> 20:16.500
That one

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
A better designed ideal experiment is

20:18.500 --> 20:20.500
We can control

20:20.500 --> 20:22.500
We know which part of the psychological journey

20:22.500 --> 20:23.500
Or neural reaction

20:23.500 --> 20:26.500
Corresponding to some of our natural behaviors

20:26.500 --> 20:27.500
We can have one-to-one

20:27.500 --> 20:29.500
Is a one-to-one correspondence

20:29.500 --> 20:31.500
Or a simpler correspondence

20:31.500 --> 20:33.500
But like the experiment we just did

20:33.500 --> 20:34.500
In fact, the experiment just now

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
Is the experiment I did

20:36.500 --> 20:37.500
I did it myself

20:37.500 --> 20:38.500
Um

20:38.500 --> 20:39.500
We

20:39.500 --> 20:41.500
I actually designed an experiment

20:41.500 --> 20:42.500
Human

20:42.500 --> 20:43.500
In general

20:43.500 --> 20:45.500
A situation that would not happen at all

20:45.500 --> 20:48.500
Then we are studying his neural reaction

20:48.500 --> 20:49.500
Although we can know

20:49.500 --> 20:51.500
The relationship between these

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
But we can't answer directly

20:53.500 --> 20:55.500
What is human nature

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
How

20:56.500 --> 20:57.500
We can't answer

20:57.500 --> 20:59.500
Human natural reaction

20:59.500 --> 21:01.500
So what we know is that some humans

21:01.500 --> 21:03.500
Supernormal ability

21:03.500 --> 21:04.500
It's beyond his usual ability

21:04.500 --> 21:05.500
but

21:05.500 --> 21:07.500
Our main research topic

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
In fact, there is no direct understanding

21:09.500 --> 21:10.500
This is what I think the lab is studying

21:10.500 --> 21:12.500
Some big limitations

21:12.500 --> 21:14.500
Especially in other areas

21:14.500 --> 21:15.500
There is such a situation

21:15.500 --> 21:16.500
For example

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
If you want to manipulate social interaction

21:18.500 --> 21:19.500
You are in a very small lab

21:19.500 --> 21:20.500
Basically can't do this

21:20.500 --> 21:21.500
Because our lab

21:21.500 --> 21:23.500
It basically looks like this

21:23.500 --> 21:24.500
Just one person

21:24.500 --> 21:26.500
Sitting in a small partition

21:26.500 --> 21:27.500
Because we have to

21:27.500 --> 21:28.500
Like I just said

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
Must control all external stimuli

21:30.500 --> 21:31.500
So

21:31.500 --> 21:32.500
Usually just sit in there alone

21:32.500 --> 21:33.500
In a very quiet situation

21:33.500 --> 21:35.500
Interact with the computer

21:35.500 --> 21:37.500
And at the same time because

21:37.500 --> 21:38.500
Uh

21:38.500 --> 21:40.500
The relationship between our measuring tools

21:40.500 --> 21:41.500
For example, that

21:41.500 --> 21:42.500
Uh that

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
That side brain wave

21:44.500 --> 21:45.500
That line

21:45.500 --> 21:46.500
Long-term relationship

21:46.500 --> 21:47.500
He can only sit there

21:47.500 --> 21:48.500
He can't do anything

21:48.500 --> 21:49.500
He can only use two fingers

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
Do the reaction

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
So this is actually

21:51.500 --> 21:52.500
It's a very unnatural situation

21:52.500 --> 21:53.500
That's some

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
Traditional lab environment

21:55.500 --> 21:57.500
Some restrictions given

21:57.500 --> 21:58.500
OK

21:58.500 --> 21:59.500
And here

21:59.500 --> 22:00.500
Everyone agrees

22:00.500 --> 22:02.500
In fact, there are quite a lot of restrictions

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
Then I

22:05.500 --> 22:06.500
What I want to say is

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
Then we

22:07.500 --> 22:09.500
In our lab

22:09.500 --> 22:11.500
How do we try to go

22:11.500 --> 22:12.500
Uh

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
Extend to solve such a barrier

22:15.500 --> 22:16.500
Uh

22:16.500 --> 22:17.500
What I want to say first is

22:17.500 --> 22:18.500
Music

22:18.500 --> 22:20.500
It can be a good research tool

22:20.500 --> 22:22.500
It can be a research tool

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
As a

22:23.500 --> 22:24.500
Uh

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
To help study human mind activity

22:26.500 --> 22:27.500
And neural reaction

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
He

22:28.500 --> 22:29.500
Uh

22:29.500 --> 22:31.500
There are some good ways

22:31.500 --> 22:32.500
For example

22:32.500 --> 22:33.500
I can keep

22:33.500 --> 22:35.500
There is a good experiment

22:35.500 --> 22:36.500
For example

22:36.500 --> 22:37.500
I today

22:37.500 --> 22:39.500
For example, look at this A picture on the left

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
I can ask the subject

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
Ask someone to come in

22:42.500 --> 22:44.500
Then I'll give him a recorder

22:44.500 --> 22:45.500
I asked him

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
Press the key of the piano

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
Then the speed of pressing is exactly the same as the recorder

22:49.500 --> 22:51.500
That's a good one

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
A control experiment

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
And then

22:53.500 --> 22:54.500
I can put this

22:54.500 --> 22:56.500
The conditions I control are getting more and more relaxed

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
For example

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
I can ask the computer to produce a recorder

22:59.500 --> 23:00.500
But this recorder is

23:00.500 --> 23:02.500
As you press the key

23:02.500 --> 23:03.500
Then he will go

23:03.500 --> 23:04.500
Follow your speed

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
To change his own rhythm

23:06.500 --> 23:07.500
Uh

23:07.500 --> 23:08.500
Or you can say

23:08.500 --> 23:09.500
Let two people play together

23:09.500 --> 23:10.500
Multiple people play

23:10.500 --> 23:12.500
Even when there are multiple people playing

23:12.500 --> 23:13.500
You and the audience

23:13.500 --> 23:14.500
Listening at the same time

23:14.500 --> 23:15.500
That

23:15.500 --> 23:17.500
Moving more and more to the right side of the spectrum

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
That's what we're talking about

23:18.500 --> 23:20.500
Ecological interaction

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
Ecological validity

23:22.500 --> 23:24.500
That is to say, what you are studying

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
Is able to correspond to human beings

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
In the case of real life

23:28.500 --> 23:29.500
The right side is

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
We feel

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
More like real life

23:32.500 --> 23:33.500
Because when you play music

23:33.500 --> 23:34.500
You will also have an audience listening

23:34.500 --> 23:35.500
This can be understood

23:35.500 --> 23:37.500
But on the right side of the spectrum

23:37.500 --> 23:38.500
In fact, your time control

23:38.500 --> 23:39.500
It's getting worse and worse

23:39.500 --> 23:41.500
For example, when a group of people play music

23:41.500 --> 23:43.500
If they decide together

23:43.500 --> 23:44.500
Speed up or slow down

23:44.500 --> 23:45.500
What do you want

23:45.500 --> 23:46.500
This is not for you

23:46.500 --> 23:48.500
The experimenter can decide in advance

23:48.500 --> 23:50.500
The information you get in the end

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
It will be difficult for you to explain

23:52.500 --> 23:54.500
That music

23:54.500 --> 23:55.500
Can be a good tool

23:55.500 --> 23:56.500
Just because he can

23:56.500 --> 23:59.500
Get some kind of balance in the middle

23:59.500 --> 24:01.500
For example, when the two of them interact

24:01.500 --> 24:03.500
They may not be random

24:03.500 --> 24:05.500
Play the music they want

24:05.500 --> 24:06.500
I can give him

24:06.500 --> 24:07.500
Uh, music score

24:07.500 --> 24:09.500
Uh, ask them to play the music score

24:09.500 --> 24:10.500
And if they have

24:10.500 --> 24:11.500
If you play the music score

24:11.500 --> 24:12.500
If they play something wrong

24:12.500 --> 24:13.500
In fact, we can

24:13.500 --> 24:14.500
Record afterwards

24:14.500 --> 24:16.500
To find out about this

24:16.500 --> 24:17.500
So we can know

24:17.500 --> 24:18.500
What did he do wrong

24:18.500 --> 24:19.500
I also know

24:19.500 --> 24:20.500
What is the correct answer

24:20.500 --> 24:21.500
And we can set

24:21.500 --> 24:22.500
That is to say

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
What is the rhythm he wants to play

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
So we still have some control

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
But even under these conditions

24:27.500 --> 24:29.500
Their activities

24:29.500 --> 24:30.500
Still very close

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
An activity of human real behavior

24:32.500 --> 24:33.500
So we think music can be

24:33.500 --> 24:35.500
A good tool to study

24:35.500 --> 24:37.500
Uh, uh, human interaction

24:37.500 --> 24:39.500
That is, hearing communication

24:39.500 --> 24:41.500
And it can be balanced

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
That is, experimental control

24:43.500 --> 24:44.500
And ecological efficiency

24:44.500 --> 24:46.500
These two big questions

24:46.500 --> 24:48.500
And another advantage of music is

24:48.500 --> 24:49.500
Say

24:49.500 --> 24:50.500
Uh

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
You said music is a good research tool

24:52.500 --> 24:53.500
The reason is

24:53.500 --> 24:55.500
It sounds like it's because he can be

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
That is, he can have this

24:57.500 --> 24:59.500
From experimental control

24:59.500 --> 25:01.500
To ecological interaction

25:01.500 --> 25:02.500
The whole spectrum

25:02.500 --> 25:03.500
But then you think

25:03.500 --> 25:04.500
What kind of research tool

25:04.500 --> 25:06.500
There is no such feature

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
Uh

25:08.500 --> 25:10.500
What kind of research tool

25:10.500 --> 25:11.500
Language

25:11.500 --> 25:12.500
Isn't that right

25:12.500 --> 25:13.500
Language

25:13.500 --> 25:14.500
Language also has

25:14.500 --> 25:15.500
Yeah

25:15.500 --> 25:16.500
So I think I don't really understand

25:16.500 --> 25:17.500
That's why he's a special

25:17.500 --> 25:18.500
Good research tool

25:18.500 --> 25:19.500
I didn't say he was particularly good

25:19.500 --> 25:21.500
I said he could be a good research tool

25:21.500 --> 25:22.500
OK

25:22.500 --> 25:23.500
Good

25:23.500 --> 25:25.500
So did I get it right this time

25:25.500 --> 25:26.500
What you mean is

25:26.500 --> 25:28.500
He can span the whole spectrum

25:28.500 --> 25:29.500
He can be a

25:29.500 --> 25:30.500
He can span the whole spectrum

25:30.500 --> 25:31.500
That language is of course

25:31.500 --> 25:33.500
You can communicate with the computer

25:33.500 --> 25:34.500
Language

25:34.500 --> 25:35.500
Or the language between people

25:35.500 --> 25:36.500
Communicate with others

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
Yes, language is also a good research tool

25:38.500 --> 25:39.500
My language

25:39.500 --> 25:40.500
There is a difficulty in neuroscience

25:40.500 --> 25:42.500
Because when you want to speak

25:42.500 --> 25:43.500
Mouth to move

25:43.500 --> 25:44.500
And then actually

25:44.500 --> 25:47.500
It's a bit difficult to measure the signal

25:47.500 --> 25:49.500
Of course, this is an externalization

25:49.500 --> 25:50.500
But I think language is also a

25:50.500 --> 25:52.500
Uh, it's a pretty good tool

25:52.500 --> 25:54.500
Okay, got it

25:54.500 --> 25:55.500
I didn't say music is the best

25:55.500 --> 25:56.500
I just said he was one of them

25:56.500 --> 25:57.500
And then

25:57.500 --> 25:59.500
And the other good thing about music is

25:59.500 --> 26:00.500
He

26:00.500 --> 26:02.500
Even if it's a special event

26:02.500 --> 26:04.500
But actually in each

26:04.500 --> 26:06.500
There are music activities in all cultures

26:06.500 --> 26:07.500
And humans actually

26:07.500 --> 26:09.500
Spend a lot of resources

26:09.500 --> 26:10.500
In music activities

26:10.500 --> 26:11.500
A lot of time and resources

26:11.500 --> 26:12.500
In music activities

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
So, uh, we think

26:14.500 --> 26:15.500
Research on music activities

26:15.500 --> 26:16.500
In fact, it can also be

26:16.500 --> 26:18.500
Uh, it's a reflection of a human being

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
A very basic behavior

26:20.500 --> 26:24.500
With a capability

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
OK

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
So

26:26.500 --> 26:29.500
So you say music is a good research tool

26:29.500 --> 26:30.500
It means

26:30.500 --> 26:32.500
For example, you want to measure his brain

26:32.500 --> 26:33.500
How does the brain work

26:33.500 --> 26:35.500
You just play music for them

26:35.500 --> 26:37.500
Is it similar to this

26:37.500 --> 26:39.500
Is this a research method

26:39.500 --> 26:40.500
Uh, play music for them

26:40.500 --> 26:41.500
Or let them

26:41.500 --> 26:43.500
Let them play music

26:43.500 --> 26:44.500
So that means

26:44.500 --> 26:45.500
You can have a

26:45.500 --> 26:46.500
A spectrum

26:46.500 --> 26:48.500
You can go from the far left

26:48.500 --> 26:49.500
Play music for them

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
I've already designed this music in advance

26:51.500 --> 26:53.500
It extends all the way to the far right

26:53.500 --> 26:54.500
For example, you can

26:54.500 --> 26:55.500
Interact with the music

26:55.500 --> 26:56.500
For example, if you want to listen to karaoke

26:56.500 --> 26:57.500
OK

26:57.500 --> 26:58.500
Or if there's no music

26:58.500 --> 27:01.500
It's just two people playing music together

27:01.500 --> 27:03.500
Oh, good

27:03.500 --> 27:04.500
I have a question

27:04.500 --> 27:05.500
OK

27:05.500 --> 27:06.500
I have a simple question

27:06.500 --> 27:07.500
It's like this

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
Uh, because it says here

27:08.500 --> 27:10.500
We may start from here

27:10.500 --> 27:11.500
More and more

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
More and more about music

27:12.500 --> 27:13.500
As a research tool

27:13.500 --> 27:14.500
This thing

27:14.500 --> 27:15.500
So I want to clarify

27:15.500 --> 27:16.500
A simple question

27:16.500 --> 27:17.500
That is

27:17.500 --> 27:18.500
What we are discussing now is

27:18.500 --> 27:20.500
Sound is a good research tool

27:20.500 --> 27:22.500
Or music is a certain kind

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
There is a specific

27:24.500 --> 27:25.500
Subset

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
In the sound thing

27:27.500 --> 27:28.500
Or do we have to discuss

27:28.500 --> 27:30.500
Sound is a research tool

27:31.500 --> 27:33.500
Uh

27:33.500 --> 27:35.500
I would say it's music

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
Because

27:37.500 --> 27:38.500
Um

27:38.500 --> 27:40.500
If I talk about sound

27:40.500 --> 27:41.500
It's just a definition

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
Because

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
Because of the sound

27:46.500 --> 27:47.500
Um

27:50.500 --> 27:52.500
Can you talk about your question again

27:53.500 --> 27:55.500
Yeah, so my question is actually

27:55.500 --> 27:57.500
You're talking about music

27:57.500 --> 27:59.500
A good research tool

27:59.500 --> 28:00.500
What kind of sound

28:00.500 --> 28:01.500
Don't you think it's

28:01.500 --> 28:02.500
You want to use it as

28:02.500 --> 28:03.500
The definition of music

28:03.500 --> 28:04.500
Research tool

28:04.500 --> 28:05.500
Oh, I understand

28:05.500 --> 28:07.500
Oh, um

28:07.500 --> 28:08.500
Yeah

28:08.500 --> 28:09.500
Uh

28:09.500 --> 28:11.500
I forgot to say that

28:11.500 --> 28:12.500
In fact, in traditional

28:12.500 --> 28:13.500
Research on hearing

28:13.500 --> 28:14.500
We will use

28:14.500 --> 28:16.500
Computer synthesis

28:16.500 --> 28:18.500
That's a very

28:18.500 --> 28:19.500
It's like you pick up the phone

28:19.500 --> 28:20.500
To hear that kind of sound

28:20.500 --> 28:21.500
Or more than that

28:21.500 --> 28:23.500
A lot of noise

28:23.500 --> 28:24.500
And these things

28:24.500 --> 28:25.500
I'm all of us

28:25.500 --> 28:27.500
Basic hearing

28:27.500 --> 28:28.500
Uh

28:28.500 --> 28:29.500
The material used

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
But in general

28:31.500 --> 28:33.500
We don't use that kind of material

28:33.500 --> 28:34.500
And then we

28:34.500 --> 28:35.500
And

28:35.500 --> 28:36.500
In addition, that is to say

28:36.500 --> 28:38.500
When we study hearing

28:38.500 --> 28:39.500
We often present a

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
A completely unchanged sound

28:41.500 --> 28:42.500
A completely correct

28:42.500 --> 28:44.500
For example, show it for a second

28:44.500 --> 28:45.500
But in the case of nature

28:45.500 --> 28:46.500
All the sounds

28:46.500 --> 28:47.500
It's probably the first time

28:47.500 --> 28:48.500
It's gone

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
It won't have the same stimulus

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
Repeat repeat

28:51.500 --> 28:52.500
It's been extended to a second

28:52.500 --> 28:53.500
So long

28:55.500 --> 28:56.500
And music

28:56.500 --> 28:57.500
It has another component

28:57.500 --> 28:58.500
That is to say it has

28:58.500 --> 28:59.500
Uh

28:59.500 --> 29:00.500
More social interaction

29:00.500 --> 29:01.500
Component

29:01.500 --> 29:02.500
It's not just about making a sound

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
It's not just about making it

29:04.500 --> 29:05.500
Uh

29:05.500 --> 29:06.500
I'll just knock on the table today

29:06.500 --> 29:07.500
Make a sound

29:07.500 --> 29:08.500
But it's that people will

29:08.500 --> 29:09.500
According to your voice

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
And then he has a response

29:11.500 --> 29:13.500
And then he makes a new action

29:18.500 --> 29:19.500
Did that answer the question

29:20.500 --> 29:21.500
There are

29:21.500 --> 29:22.500
Thank you

29:22.500 --> 29:23.500
OK OK OK

29:23.500 --> 29:24.500
OK

29:24.500 --> 29:27.500
Everyone's questions are very good

29:27.500 --> 29:28.500
That

29:28.500 --> 29:29.500
Um

29:29.500 --> 29:30.500
In our research example

29:30.500 --> 29:31.500
That is to say

29:31.500 --> 29:32.500
We want to understand

29:32.500 --> 29:33.500
Using music

29:33.500 --> 29:35.500
Play as a

29:35.500 --> 29:36.500
Model example

29:36.500 --> 29:38.500
Is a social interaction model

29:38.500 --> 29:40.500
How do we measure cooperation

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
And then we have to understand

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
Is the relationship between the leader and the follower

29:43.500 --> 29:44.500
And then we have to

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
What direction to go

29:46.500 --> 29:48.500
To do this research

29:48.500 --> 29:49.500
Ah, this photo is

29:49.500 --> 29:50.500
A photo of our lab

29:50.500 --> 29:51.500
And then I just found

29:51.500 --> 29:53.500
We had a short film before the lab

29:53.500 --> 29:54.500
OK

29:54.500 --> 29:55.500
Show it to everyone

29:55.500 --> 29:57.500
I hope everyone can hear the sound

29:57.500 --> 30:00.500
Uh, there's a two and a half minute introduction

30:23.500 --> 30:25.500
Adrian Fung and his colleagues

30:25.500 --> 30:27.500
Are fitted with specially designed

30:27.500 --> 30:29.500
Caps and sensors

30:29.500 --> 30:30.500
Put them in the front of your shirt

30:30.500 --> 30:32.500
And wired to monitors

30:32.500 --> 30:34.500
That measure their brain activity

30:34.500 --> 30:35.500
And heart rate

30:35.500 --> 30:36.500
Motion capture cameras

30:36.500 --> 30:38.500
Record their movements too

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
Researchers are studying

30:40.500 --> 30:42.500
How the musicians communicate

30:42.500 --> 30:44.500
With each other during a performance

30:44.500 --> 30:46.500
Without using a single word

30:46.500 --> 30:48.500
How do they use movements

30:48.500 --> 30:50.500
What gestures do the musicians make

30:50.500 --> 30:52.500
That make it possible for them to

30:52.500 --> 30:54.500
Communicate with each other

30:55.500 --> 30:58.500
And to communicate with members of the audience

30:58.500 --> 31:00.500
They're all wired up too

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
To study how they respond

31:02.500 --> 31:04.500
Physically and emotionally

31:04.500 --> 31:06.500
To the performers on stage

31:06.500 --> 31:07.500
What's great about this

31:07.500 --> 31:08.500
Is it affords us

31:08.500 --> 31:09.500
The ability to see

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
How effective we are as communicators

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
The theater is state-of-the-art technology

31:14.500 --> 31:16.500
Including a sound system

31:16.500 --> 31:18.500
With incredible acoustics

31:18.500 --> 31:20.500
Here with just a tap on a tablet

31:21.500 --> 31:23.500
I'll make it extremely reverberant in here

31:23.500 --> 31:25.500
Sort of like a cathedral

31:29.500 --> 31:31.500
The room is transformed

31:31.500 --> 31:33.500
A cool feature that serves

31:33.500 --> 31:35.500
A wider, more scientific purpose

31:35.500 --> 31:37.500
One that could help researchers

31:37.500 --> 31:39.500
Design a better hearing aid

31:39.500 --> 31:41.500
For the hearing impaired

31:41.500 --> 31:43.500
So, ratting

31:43.500 --> 31:45.500
Background noise is coming out of all the speakers

31:45.500 --> 31:47.500
It's a multi-channel surround mix

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
And then we could test

31:49.500 --> 31:52.500
How well does a person with a hearing aid

31:52.500 --> 31:54.500
Comprehend speech

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
That's presented to them

31:55.500 --> 31:57.500
In an environment like this

31:57.500 --> 31:59.500
Instead of in the quiet room

32:01.500 --> 32:02.500
But for now

32:02.500 --> 32:04.500
Most of the research is focused on music

32:04.500 --> 32:06.500
And its therapeutic powers

32:06.500 --> 32:08.500
Researchers hope their findings

32:08.500 --> 32:10.500
Will uncover how some rhythms

32:10.500 --> 32:12.500
Might help an autistic child

32:12.500 --> 32:14.500
Or why a musical beat

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
Can improve the gait of a patient

32:16.500 --> 32:18.500
With Parkinson's disease

32:18.500 --> 32:20.500
To understand

32:20.500 --> 32:22.500
What's going on in the brain

32:22.500 --> 32:24.500
We need to know how it's done

32:24.500 --> 32:25.500
In typical populations

32:25.500 --> 32:27.500
Once we understand that

32:27.500 --> 32:29.500
And we know that music

32:29.500 --> 32:31.500
Can help people with Parkinson's

32:31.500 --> 32:33.500
Or we know that music has an effect

32:33.500 --> 32:35.500
On children with autism

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
We can start to understand

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
The deep reasons for that

32:39.500 --> 32:41.500
And we can perfect

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
The therapies that we give these people

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
And add to mounting evidence

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
That music is good medicine

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
For the brain

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500

45:12.600 --> 45:14.600
Cass Rose, Cobain

45:14.600 --> 45:34.600
Cass Rose, Cobain

45:35.600 --> 45:39.600
But this is only an obvious effect in non-seeing.

45:39.600 --> 45:41.600
So it represents visual experience,

45:41.600 --> 45:44.600
which may create some noise,

45:44.600 --> 45:48.600
which makes it more difficult not to be followed,

45:48.600 --> 45:50.600
not to be affected by followers.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.600
Of course, this needs to be replicated.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.600
This is a small difference.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.600
Or did you analyze the interaction?

45:56.600 --> 45:58.600
Did you find it?

45:58.600 --> 46:00.600
Sorry, I don't want to talk about it.

46:00.600 --> 46:04.600
So there's no difference between the two white bars

46:04.600 --> 46:06.600
and the two dark gray bars.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.600
Is there a difference?

46:08.600 --> 46:10.600
Did you analyze it?

46:10.600 --> 46:12.600
No, I looked at all the interactions.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.600
Okay, thanks.

46:14.600 --> 46:16.600
You're welcome.

46:16.600 --> 46:20.600
We actually replicated this,

46:20.600 --> 46:24.600
but the difference between the two dark gray bars

46:24.600 --> 46:28.600
and the FF didn't show up in the replication.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.600
That's a shame.

46:30.600 --> 46:34.600
So we didn't explain much in the paper.

46:34.600 --> 46:38.600
I don't know why.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.600
But we found that

46:40.600 --> 46:44.600
the body movement can reflect the direction of information transmission.

46:44.600 --> 46:47.600
But it's not very interesting.

46:47.600 --> 46:49.600
What does this have to do with playing music?

46:49.600 --> 46:51.600
It's just a bunch of people moving around in the studio.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.600
It's just who moves first and who moves last.

46:53.600 --> 46:57.600
After they played each song,

46:57.600 --> 47:00.600
we asked the musicians to use a quantity table

47:00.600 --> 47:03.600
to evaluate how well they played.

47:03.600 --> 47:06.600
We asked them to evaluate three items.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.600
What is the overall quality of the performance?

47:08.600 --> 47:10.600
1 to 5 points.

47:10.600 --> 47:13.600
Is the synchronization of time synchronized?

47:13.600 --> 47:16.600
Is there a difference in the difficulty of cooperation?

47:16.600 --> 47:23.600
Then we compared it with the quantity of Granger Casualty.

47:24.600 --> 47:29.600
We found that the X axis is very good,

47:29.600 --> 47:30.600
the right side is very good,

47:30.600 --> 47:32.600
and the left side is very bad.

47:32.600 --> 47:33.600
The Y axis is...

47:33.600 --> 47:34.600
I wrote Casual Density.

47:34.600 --> 47:37.600
Basically, it's the total amount of information exchanged

47:37.600 --> 47:39.600
by the whole system.

47:39.600 --> 47:42.600
We found that the quality of the performance

47:42.600 --> 47:46.600
and the quantity of Casual Density and the amount of information exchange

47:46.600 --> 47:50.600
and the coupling of body movements are related.

47:50.600 --> 47:53.600
The synchronization of time is also related.

47:53.600 --> 47:56.600
However, in the second time replication,

47:56.600 --> 47:58.600
only the overall quality of the performance is related.

47:58.600 --> 48:02.600
In other words, the amount of information transfer...

48:02.600 --> 48:06.600
The body movement does not only reflect the direction of information transfer.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.600
The amount of information transfer

48:08.600 --> 48:12.600
seems to reflect the quality of cooperation.

48:12.600 --> 48:16.600
To sum up, what did we learn?

48:16.600 --> 48:19.600
We learned that in multi-person cooperation,

48:19.600 --> 48:23.600
we can observe the direction of information transfer from body movements.

48:23.600 --> 48:27.600
Even if this is a homework based on hearing and action,

48:27.600 --> 48:30.600
it seems that it is also an important communication channel

48:30.600 --> 48:33.600
whether you can see each other visually or not.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.600
The overall amount of information flow

48:35.600 --> 48:39.600
and the amount of information activity obtained by measuring body movements

48:39.600 --> 48:41.600
can reflect the quality of cooperation.

48:41.600 --> 48:45.600
In fact, these three points...

48:45.600 --> 48:47.600
For everyone, if you don't do research,

48:47.600 --> 48:48.600
you can probably guess the result.

48:48.600 --> 48:51.600
We think the biggest value is that

48:51.600 --> 48:54.600
we provide a low-threshold research method.

48:54.600 --> 48:57.600
You don't have to observe in our lab.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.600
You can observe in any natural situation.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.600
You can observe each other's body movements

49:02.600 --> 49:05.600
through imaging analysis.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.600
You may be able to observe the group behavior

49:07.600 --> 49:09.600
between people in natural situations.

49:09.600 --> 49:12.600
We just prove that this effect exists

49:12.600 --> 49:15.600
in a well-controlled lab.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.600
It should be an effective index.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.600
I think that

49:19.600 --> 49:22.600
if the following researchers want to study

49:22.600 --> 49:24.600
complex social behaviors,

49:24.600 --> 49:29.600
at least they have a tool to use.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.600
I have a question.

49:31.600 --> 49:32.600
I'm sorry.

49:32.600 --> 49:37.600
I don't quite understand the second and third points.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.600
I thought the result is that

49:40.600 --> 49:42.600
if they are facing each other,

49:42.600 --> 49:44.600
they can't see each other.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.600
The result is still the same.

49:46.600 --> 49:47.600
Yes, it is.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.600
But the effect is weaker.

49:50.600 --> 49:53.600
There is a main effect.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.600
Simple main effect is that

49:55.600 --> 50:00.600
in the direction of leader to follower,

50:00.600 --> 50:04.600
you can see each other much better than you can't see each other.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.600
I see.

50:06.600 --> 50:09.600
But the effect is still the same on both sides.

50:09.600 --> 50:13.600
This is my question for the third point.

50:13.600 --> 50:17.600
What is the direction of causal relationship?

50:17.600 --> 50:19.600
For example,

50:19.600 --> 50:21.600
is the communication channel

50:21.600 --> 50:23.600
caused by musical communication

50:23.600 --> 50:26.600
to cause the following of your body movement?

50:26.600 --> 50:29.600
Or is it the movement of your body

50:29.600 --> 50:32.600
that causes the improvement of music?

50:32.600 --> 50:33.600
I don't know.

50:33.600 --> 50:36.600
Because if you can't see your body sway

50:36.600 --> 50:37.600
or follow each other,

50:37.600 --> 50:40.600
it doesn't mean visual communication.

50:40.600 --> 50:43.600
It is the natural body reaction

50:43.600 --> 50:47.600
caused by the essence of hearing or music.

50:47.600 --> 50:48.600
So it is a side effect,

50:48.600 --> 50:50.600
not a real cause.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.600
I didn't say it is a cause.

50:52.600 --> 50:55.600
I just said it is a reaction indicator.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.600
It is a measurement indicator.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.600
I said it is

50:59.600 --> 51:01.600
when we play music,

51:01.600 --> 51:03.600
our body does this movement,

51:03.600 --> 51:04.600
but we still do it.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.600
This information seems to reflect

51:06.600 --> 51:09.600
the direction of information transmission

51:09.600 --> 51:11.600
and the quality of cooperation.

51:11.600 --> 51:15.600
So you don't think it is functional.

51:15.600 --> 51:16.600
You don't think it has a function.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.600
It is just an indicator.

51:18.600 --> 51:21.600
It is just a measurement indicator.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.600
I am conservative.

51:23.600 --> 51:24.600
I am conservative.

51:24.600 --> 51:25.600
I think I don't know.

51:25.600 --> 51:26.600
I just said

51:26.600 --> 51:29.600
I can't prove it is functional yet.

51:29.600 --> 51:31.600
In my research,

51:31.600 --> 51:34.600
some people block the whole person

51:34.600 --> 51:36.600
and measure the time difference

51:36.600 --> 51:38.600
between each other's buttons.

51:38.600 --> 51:39.600
When all the buttons are blocked,

51:39.600 --> 51:41.600
the time difference between the buttons

51:41.600 --> 51:43.600
will be affected.

51:43.600 --> 51:46.600
But I think

51:46.600 --> 51:48.600
the conclusion is

51:48.600 --> 51:50.600
in my research,

51:50.600 --> 51:51.600
I can only say

51:51.600 --> 51:53.600
the result can be reflected.

51:53.600 --> 51:55.600
Maybe it is just a related indicator.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.600
But is the function

51:56.600 --> 51:58.600
a part of communication itself?

51:58.600 --> 52:00.600
Is it a part of seeing

52:00.600 --> 52:02.600
other people's body movements?

52:02.600 --> 52:03.600
I don't know.

52:03.600 --> 52:04.600
Because like you said,

52:04.600 --> 52:05.600
even if you can't see,

52:05.600 --> 52:07.600
the body movements have this effect.

52:07.600 --> 52:08.600
Got it.

52:08.600 --> 52:10.600
Thank you.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.600
I have another question for Zhang Ting.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.600
But it is not directly

52:15.600 --> 52:17.600
about your research itself.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.600
We want something interesting

52:19.600 --> 52:21.600
from your research.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.600
If we look at Baha,

52:23.600 --> 52:25.600
you just emphasized that

52:25.600 --> 52:26.600
the four characters

52:26.600 --> 52:28.600
are relatively...

52:28.600 --> 52:29.600
What is it called?

52:29.600 --> 52:31.600
The responsibilities are more or less equal.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.600
So you can randomly assign

52:33.600 --> 52:34.600
who you are.

52:34.600 --> 52:35.600
But if we change it to

52:35.600 --> 52:36.600
four-part jazz,

52:36.600 --> 52:38.600
the kind of music with strong characters,

52:38.600 --> 52:40.600
do you expect that

52:40.600 --> 52:42.600
the effect size will be very strong?

52:42.600 --> 52:43.600
Or will they break down?

52:43.600 --> 52:44.600
They can't play

52:44.600 --> 52:45.600
because they don't know

52:45.600 --> 52:46.600
who they are.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.600
If you don't assign,

52:47.600 --> 52:48.600
who will lead?

52:48.600 --> 52:49.600
I know.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.600
This is our...

52:53.600 --> 52:55.600
Actually, we did it.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.600
I didn't put it here today.

52:56.600 --> 52:57.600
But this is Experiment 2.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.600
In the case of Experiment 2,

52:58.600 --> 53:00.600
we don't have that kind of jazz.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.600
We want them to play

53:04.600 --> 53:05.600
Mozart's music.

53:05.600 --> 53:07.600
If you look at Mozart's music,

53:07.600 --> 53:08.600
if you look at the score,

53:08.600 --> 53:09.600
all the melodies

53:09.600 --> 53:10.600
are in the first violin.

53:10.600 --> 53:11.600
The other parts

53:11.600 --> 53:13.600
are just beats.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.600
But we still do

53:14.600 --> 53:15.600
the same manipulation.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.600
Even if the cello

53:16.600 --> 53:17.600
is just playing beats,

53:17.600 --> 53:19.600
you still have to lead the violin

53:19.600 --> 53:20.600
to play its music.

53:20.600 --> 53:21.600
So this is basically

53:21.600 --> 53:22.600
the same manipulation

53:22.600 --> 53:23.600
as you think.

53:23.600 --> 53:24.600
It's all the same.

53:24.600 --> 53:25.600
The result is...

53:25.600 --> 53:27.600
I go back to the previous slide.

53:28.600 --> 53:29.600
This is the replication

53:29.600 --> 53:30.600
I just talked about.

53:30.600 --> 53:31.600
We still have

53:31.600 --> 53:33.600
the three lines above.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.600
The three lines below are gone.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.600
So we're in a task.

53:40.600 --> 53:43.600
It's an unbalanced starting point.

53:43.600 --> 53:44.600
We're going to do manipulation.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.600
We still see the above effects.

53:46.600 --> 53:47.600
But it's actually

53:47.600 --> 53:49.600
a lot weaker overall.

53:49.600 --> 53:51.600
And then we measure

53:51.600 --> 53:53.600
the strength of the

53:53.600 --> 53:55.600
grandiosity between each other

53:55.600 --> 53:57.600
in the case of the bass line.

53:57.600 --> 53:58.600
We found that

53:58.600 --> 54:00.600
in the case of playing Mozart's music,

54:00.600 --> 54:02.600
the bass line is more uneven.

54:02.600 --> 54:03.600
In the case of playing Bach,

54:03.600 --> 54:05.600
the bass line is even.

54:05.600 --> 54:06.600
So it does have

54:06.600 --> 54:08.600
the effect of the bass line.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.600
This effect actually

54:10.600 --> 54:12.600
shows that this is functional.

54:12.600 --> 54:13.600
Because in the case of non-syncing,

54:13.600 --> 54:15.600
when the music itself

54:15.600 --> 54:17.600
doesn't have this message,

54:17.600 --> 54:18.600
when the music itself

54:18.600 --> 54:19.600
has an obvious bias,

54:19.600 --> 54:20.600
it's hard for you to have

54:20.600 --> 54:21.600
this effect.

54:21.600 --> 54:22.600
For example,

54:22.600 --> 54:23.600
in the case of playing the cello,

54:23.600 --> 54:24.600
if you don't see it,

54:24.600 --> 54:26.600
your body swing is not connected.

54:26.600 --> 54:29.600
But when you see it,

54:29.600 --> 54:31.600
it still has an effect.

54:31.600 --> 54:35.600
It means it's causally linked.

54:35.600 --> 54:36.600
Wait a minute.

54:36.600 --> 54:37.600
I suddenly feel like

54:37.600 --> 54:38.600
I'm talking illogically.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.600
Because although the body...

54:40.600 --> 54:42.600
But we didn't...

54:42.600 --> 54:43.600
But the music itself

54:43.600 --> 54:46.600
is actually explained.

54:46.600 --> 54:49.600
I think it's a little hard

54:50.600 --> 54:52.600
I think even if there is such a difference,

54:52.600 --> 54:55.600
it's just possible.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.600
But to answer that question directly,

54:57.600 --> 54:58.600
for example,

54:58.600 --> 55:00.600
if I tie the musician to the chair

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
so that he can't move,

55:01.600 --> 55:03.600
let's see what the effect of their performance is.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.600
This is a more direct manipulation.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.600
Do you agree with me?

55:09.600 --> 55:10.600
I don't know. I can't figure it out.

55:10.600 --> 55:11.600
I have to think about it again.

55:13.600 --> 55:14.600
That is to say,

55:14.600 --> 55:15.600
I can't move your body today.

55:15.600 --> 55:16.600
Let's see if your performance quality

55:16.600 --> 55:18.600
will be reduced.

55:19.600 --> 55:20.600
Obviously,

55:20.600 --> 55:21.600
there will be a lot of confounders.

55:21.600 --> 55:22.600
You can't do that.

55:22.600 --> 55:25.600
But I'm still thinking about

55:25.600 --> 55:27.600
the lack of evidence just now.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.600
It seems that it can only prove that

55:29.600 --> 55:30.600
you still find that

55:30.600 --> 55:32.600
the reaction between the body

55:32.600 --> 55:34.600
is causally linked.

55:34.600 --> 55:37.600
It's the connection between the follower and the leader.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.600
But the causality of this connection

55:38.600 --> 55:40.600
does not represent the causality

55:40.600 --> 55:41.600
between the performance of music

55:41.600 --> 55:43.600
and the body sway.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.600
So it's not a good evidence.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.600
Do you mean that?

55:46.600 --> 55:47.600
I'm a little confused.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.600
I'm confused, too.

55:50.600 --> 55:51.600
Forget it.

55:52.600 --> 55:53.600
When we were writing the paper,

55:53.600 --> 55:55.600
different authors were thinking about it.

55:55.600 --> 55:56.600
Some authors directly argued that

55:56.600 --> 55:58.600
body sway is communication.

55:59.600 --> 56:00.600
But...

56:00.600 --> 56:02.600
I don't think you have that evidence.

56:02.600 --> 56:04.600
I think the evidence is direct.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.600
I just said that I was a little bit safe.

56:06.600 --> 56:07.600
Then in the discussion,

56:07.600 --> 56:08.600
I said it might be like this.

56:08.600 --> 56:09.600
But I don't know.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.600
I think there are indeed

56:11.600 --> 56:13.600
two causes and conditions for discussion.

56:13.600 --> 56:14.600
One is that

56:14.600 --> 56:15.600
the body sway of the leader

56:15.600 --> 56:17.600
leads to the body sway of the follower.

56:17.600 --> 56:19.600
This is the analysis you are doing now.

56:19.600 --> 56:21.600
As long as the bar on your left is higher,

56:21.600 --> 56:23.600
it means that the causality exists.

56:23.600 --> 56:24.600
But...

56:25.600 --> 56:26.600
But...

56:26.600 --> 56:27.600
You go first.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.600
But the other cause is

56:30.600 --> 56:32.600
the connection between the music

56:32.600 --> 56:35.600
and the body sway.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.600
Is body sway

56:36.600 --> 56:40.600
the connection between the music itself?

56:40.600 --> 56:41.600
Yes.

56:41.600 --> 56:42.600
OK.

56:42.600 --> 56:43.600
The first point is

56:43.600 --> 56:45.600
about grunge causality.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.600
I guess many listeners may know that

56:47.600 --> 56:49.600
it is actually argued that

56:49.600 --> 56:51.600
causality is a big problem.

56:51.600 --> 56:52.600
Mathematically,

56:52.600 --> 56:53.600
causality is a big problem?

56:53.600 --> 56:54.600
Yes.

56:54.600 --> 56:55.600
Mathematically,

56:55.600 --> 56:56.600
it can only say that

56:56.600 --> 56:58.600
the amount of information transfer.

56:58.600 --> 57:00.600
Is there really a cause?

57:00.600 --> 57:02.600
There must be some other situations.

57:02.600 --> 57:03.600
For example,

57:03.600 --> 57:04.600
I have to sample

57:04.600 --> 57:06.600
the whole universe

57:06.600 --> 57:08.600
to make it possible.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.600
In some cases,

57:10.600 --> 57:12.600
it is conservative.

57:12.600 --> 57:13.600
Mathematically,

57:13.600 --> 57:14.600
I can only say

57:14.600 --> 57:15.600
A predict B.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.600
I can't say A cause B.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.600
In this example,

57:18.600 --> 57:20.600
you can say causality.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.600
Because it is the difference in time.

57:22.600 --> 57:23.600
This information

57:23.600 --> 57:25.600
leads to this information change.

57:25.600 --> 57:26.600
What other factors

57:26.600 --> 57:27.600
in body sway

57:27.600 --> 57:28.600
will lead to this change?

57:28.600 --> 57:29.600
Maybe music

57:29.600 --> 57:31.600
has a third reason.

57:31.600 --> 57:32.600
In short,

57:32.600 --> 57:34.600
I think the alternative is limited.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.600
There is no possibility.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.600
These alternatives

57:37.600 --> 57:38.600
sound

57:38.600 --> 57:39.600
not very

57:39.600 --> 57:41.600
compelling.

57:41.600 --> 57:42.600
So I think

57:42.600 --> 57:44.600
even if it is a little risky,

57:44.600 --> 57:45.600
you can still argue

57:45.600 --> 57:47.600
that this is a causal relationship.

57:47.600 --> 57:48.600
On the other hand,

57:48.600 --> 57:49.600
what you really care about

57:49.600 --> 57:51.600
is the body movement reaction.

57:51.600 --> 57:52.600
Is this information

57:52.600 --> 57:53.600
transmitted

57:53.600 --> 57:55.600
by music communication itself?

57:55.600 --> 57:56.600
Does it cause

57:56.600 --> 57:57.600
better music quality?

57:57.600 --> 57:58.600
Does it cause

57:58.600 --> 57:59.600
better communication?

57:59.600 --> 58:00.600
But

58:00.600 --> 58:01.600
I don't think

58:01.600 --> 58:03.600
there is a causal relationship.

58:03.600 --> 58:04.600
I think

58:04.600 --> 58:06.600
there is a causal relationship.

58:06.600 --> 58:07.600
But this seems

58:07.600 --> 58:08.600
to need other evidence.

58:08.600 --> 58:09.600
Yes.

58:13.600 --> 58:15.600
I am conservative.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.600
I think you are conservative.

58:20.600 --> 58:21.600
My bubble is gone.

58:21.600 --> 58:22.600
So everyone is welcome

58:22.600 --> 58:23.600
to discuss freely.

58:23.600 --> 58:25.600
It doesn't matter if it is three-dimensional.

58:25.600 --> 58:26.600
I would like to ask

58:26.600 --> 58:27.600
this experiment

58:27.600 --> 58:29.600
that you are talking about now.

58:29.600 --> 58:30.600
For example,

58:30.600 --> 58:31.600
how many groups

58:31.600 --> 58:32.600
do you need

58:33.600 --> 58:34.600
or how many musicians

58:34.600 --> 58:35.600
do you need

58:35.600 --> 58:36.600
to be able to

58:36.600 --> 58:37.600
get a

58:37.600 --> 58:38.600
less

58:38.600 --> 58:39.600
influenced

58:39.600 --> 58:40.600
culture

58:40.600 --> 58:41.600
or training

58:41.600 --> 58:43.600
from the performers?

58:46.600 --> 58:47.600
I think

58:47.600 --> 58:48.600
this question

58:48.600 --> 58:49.600
is very good.

58:49.600 --> 58:50.600
I think

58:50.600 --> 58:51.600
this is the weakness

58:51.600 --> 58:52.600
of this study.

58:52.600 --> 58:53.600
First of all,

58:53.600 --> 58:54.600
we are looking for

58:54.600 --> 58:56.600
very high-level musicians.

58:56.600 --> 58:57.600
You have to pay a lot of money

58:57.600 --> 58:59.600
to buy a concert hall

58:59.600 --> 59:00.600
for them to come.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.600
Because of the financial constraints,

59:05.600 --> 59:06.600
we found two groups.

59:06.600 --> 59:07.600
We found two groups.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.600
In terms of statistics,

59:09.600 --> 59:11.600
we think it is better to say

59:11.600 --> 59:13.600
that these are

59:13.600 --> 59:15.600
called within-subject comparison.

59:15.600 --> 59:16.600
That is to say,

59:16.600 --> 59:17.600
compare yourself with yourself.

59:17.600 --> 59:18.600
That is to say,

59:18.600 --> 59:19.600
how much stronger

59:19.600 --> 59:20.600
this effect is

59:20.600 --> 59:21.600
compared to

59:21.600 --> 59:22.600
yourself as a follower.

59:22.600 --> 59:23.600
So even if

59:23.600 --> 59:25.600
the sample we take

59:25.600 --> 59:26.600
is very limited,

59:26.600 --> 59:27.600
that is,

59:27.600 --> 59:28.600
two groups of musicians,

59:28.600 --> 59:29.600
a total of eight people.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.600
But within each person,

59:31.600 --> 59:32.600
the direction of their effect

59:32.600 --> 59:34.600
is the same.

59:34.600 --> 59:35.600
Is it possible that

59:35.600 --> 59:36.600
I took some

59:36.600 --> 59:38.600
very biased samples?

59:38.600 --> 59:39.600
For example,

59:39.600 --> 59:40.600
these musicians

59:40.600 --> 59:41.600
do not represent all humans.

59:41.600 --> 59:42.600
It is possible.

59:42.600 --> 59:43.600
This is the weakness of this study.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.600
I don't know

59:45.600 --> 59:47.600
how representative this is.

59:47.600 --> 59:48.600
I can only say

59:48.600 --> 59:49.600
that from other

59:49.600 --> 59:50.600
currently known studies,

59:50.600 --> 59:52.600
the representativeness of musicians

59:52.600 --> 59:53.600
and normal humans

59:53.600 --> 59:54.600
is actually

59:54.600 --> 59:55.600
similar.

59:55.600 --> 59:56.600
It can represent

59:56.600 --> 59:57.600
ordinary humans.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.600
Other cultures

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600
also have a problem

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600
with representativeness.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600
At present,

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.600
it is also said that

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600
representativeness is still OK.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
It's just that

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600
I don't have direct evidence

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.600
to say that

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.600
this effect

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.600
can represent

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.600
the effect of all humans.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.600
I don't know.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.600
Is it conservative?

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.600
It's OK.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.600
I have a question.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.600
OK.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.600
You ask first.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600
You finish first.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.600
It's OK.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600
The next question

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.600
has nothing to do with this.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.600
You can continue

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600
to ask other questions.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600
OK.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600
I have a question.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600
At the beginning,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600
you mentioned quarreling.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600
But quarreling

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600
doesn't seem to be sung.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.600
It's spoken.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.600
So I want to know

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600
that it can also be sung.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600
It's weird.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600
So the question I want to ask

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.600
is that

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.600
your research results

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600
are already here.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.600
How much do you think

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.600
it can allow us to predict

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600
or provide us

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600
with knowledge

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.600
about language communication

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.600
and interaction?

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.600
What kind of implications

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600
will there be?

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.600
If there are some weaknesses

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.600
that can't be inferred,

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.600
what research

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.600
do you need to make up for

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.600
in terms of speech?

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600
OK.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.600
First of all,

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.600
most of the research

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600
on body movements

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600
and body shaking

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600
is done

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600
in the context of speech.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600
But they do it

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600
in a small lab.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600
There are usually two people.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.600
They use relevant methods

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600
to see how similar

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.600
the information is.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.600
There are other studies

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600
that show

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.600
that the psychological process

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.600
used in music performance

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.600
and speech

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600
are very similar.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.600
In terms of music,

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600
we also observed

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600
a similar effect

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600
in body movements.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.600
Of course,

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.600
it's not exactly the same.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600
It's extended,

01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600
but the effect

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.600
is the same.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.600
Although there is no direct evidence,

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600
I think

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600
the effect

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.600
should be the same

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.600
in terms of speech.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.600
That's my guess.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.600
OK, thank you.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.600
I have a related question.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600
Can I interrupt you?

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600
Do you have a number?

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.600
Someone said he had a question.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.600
I'm afraid I'll keep interrupting.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.600
I asked too many questions.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.600
You just said language.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.600
In fact,

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600
I think

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.600
more broadly,

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.600
do you think

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.600
these are all

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600
the phenomenon of hearing?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.600
Or is it actually

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600
a wider perception

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.600
or even a mental operation?

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.600
Or is it

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600
a specific phenomenon

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.600
of hearing?

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.600
For example,

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.600
in science,

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.600
regularity

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.600
determines

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.600
how you

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.600
can anticipate

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600
how to

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600
process

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600
cognitive information.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.600
Obviously,

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.600
this also works

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.600
visually.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600
Next,

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600
is the communication

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600
of music collaborators

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.600
really limited to

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.600
the performance of music?

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.600
Or is it

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.600
all about

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.600
cooperation?

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.600
All the cooperation,

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600
like the example

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600
you just gave,

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600
do they all

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600
have the same phenomenon?

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600
Does the sway of the body

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600
also affect it?

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600
Or is there

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600
a more general mechanism?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600
For example,

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600
is there any

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600
synchronization

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600
that helps

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600
communication?

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.600
Can you remind me

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.600
what the first part

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.600
is?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600
I think

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.600
these are all examples.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.600
The main question is

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600
do you think

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600
this is a domain-specific

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.600
phenomenon

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.600
or

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.600
a wider

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.600
mental operation

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.600
principle?

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600
I don't think

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600
there is a standard answer.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600
I'm just curious.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600
OK.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600
I'm curious.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600
According to

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.600
other studies,

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600
in fact,

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.600
we found

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.600
that

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600
time synchronization

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600
is still

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600
a bit different

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600
from hearing

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600
and vision.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.600
For example,

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.600
the sense of rhythm

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.600
of vision

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600
is actually

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600
quite difficult

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.600
to produce

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.600
compared to hearing.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.600
The accuracy of

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.600
tracking time

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.600
does not seem

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.600
to be as high

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.600
as the results

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600
of the study.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600
But some people

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600
have succeeded.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.600
Vision still has

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600
this effect.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.600
But

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600
what I mean is

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600
that it may not be

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.600
the same.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.600
The domain of hearing

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600
is obviously

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.600
frequency and time.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.600
But

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.600
in vision,

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.600
it will be

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.600
space and

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600
location.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.600
Yes, space and location.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600
Translated,

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.600
it becomes

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600
statistical learning.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600
If there is a

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600
fixed pattern,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600
I can't speak Chinese.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600
If there is a

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600
fixed pattern

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600
that appears

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600
repeatedly,

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600
your processing

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600
will be faster,

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.600
better,

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.600
and more accurate.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.600
Do you think

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.600
this is a similar phenomenon?

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.600
Or is there

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.600
a specialized

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.600
process

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.600
in the brain

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600
to process

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600
different areas?

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.600
OK.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.600
I think

01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.600
the special process

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600
is because

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600
time is

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600
one-dimensional.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.600
Although

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600
it is a

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.600
single-direction

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.600
dimension,

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.600
you are always

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.600
going to the future

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600
to make guesses.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600
This is

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.600
different from

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.600
the visual

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600
pattern.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.600
For example,

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600
if I give you

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600
a very regular

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.600
pattern,

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.600
this pattern

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.600
is not the same.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.600
But it must be

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600
future-oriented.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.600
So,

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.600
based on your

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600
existing information,

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.600
you keep guessing

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.600
what the

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.600
future information

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.600
is.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600
In fact,

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600
it is

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600
online processing.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600
So,

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.600
I think

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.600
these details

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600
make time

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600
different from

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600
other senses

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.600
when it

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.600
comes to

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.600
hearing.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.600
Because the information

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.600
is opened

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.600
at any time.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.600
Let me give you

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.600
an example.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.600
In the visual phenomenon,

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.600
there is also

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.600
a temporal

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.600
anticipation

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.600
phenomenon.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600
For example,

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600
you should

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600
know

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600
this experiment.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600
It is

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600
a combination

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.600
of three

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600
random

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600
sounds.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600
What is

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600
this experiment?

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600
This is the

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.600
first experiment

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.600
in learning

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.600
language.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600
For example,

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600
there are

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.600
nine possible

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.600
notes.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.600
There are

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.600
three notes

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.600
that are

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600
always

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600
connected.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600
Three notes

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.600
are always

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.600
in pairs.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600
These phrases

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600
can be

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.600
randomly

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.600
combined.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.600
This phenomenon

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.600
is hearing.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.600
In fact,

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.600
if you

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.600
do the same

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600
experiment

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.600
with visual stimulation,

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.600
all the results

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.600
are the same.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600
So,

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600
this is

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600
an online

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
processing

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600
that affects

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.600
your

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.600
intuition

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600
in the

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600
visual phenomenon.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.600
I know.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.600
In each

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.600
special case,

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.600
some cases

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.600
are replicated.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.600
But in many cases,

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.600
visually,

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600
it is difficult

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.600
to do it.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.600
For example,

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600
the effect of

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600
rhythm.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.600
Temporal

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.600
grouping.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.600
I know you

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.600
have done it

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.600
once in the

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.600
lab,

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.600
but

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600
you can see

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.600
that many people

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.600
failed.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600
It doesn't matter.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600
I know.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.600
I have done

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.600
multi-sensory.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.600
I know it is

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600
difficult.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600
It is very

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600
simple.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.600
You just need to

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.600
show 4 notes,

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.600
5 notes,

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.600
and people will

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.600
know.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.600
So,

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600
you mean

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600
there are

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600
domain-specific

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600
parts.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600
Temporal

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600
regularity

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600
is a

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.600
domain-specific

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.600
part.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.600
What do you

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.600
think is

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.600
the difference

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.600
between

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600
hearing

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600
and visual

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.600
regularity?

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.600
I think

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.600
the effect

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.600
is the same,

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.600
but the

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600
processing

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600
is different.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600
In

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.600
primary

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600
auditory

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600
cortex,

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.600
there is

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600
temporal

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.600
coding.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.600
In

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.600
visual cortex,

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.600
it is

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.600
where

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600
domain.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.600
I don't

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600
know.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.600
It takes

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.600
a long time

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.600
to

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.600
process

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600
the information.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.600
Is it

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600
because

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.600
hearing

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.600
mechanism

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.600
makes it

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.600
noisy?

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.600
For example,

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.600
hearing

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.600
and visual

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.600
are

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:09.600
basically

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.600
different.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.600
Okay.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.600
I've been standing here

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:13.600
for too long.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.600
Let me

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600
guess.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.600
Is it okay?

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.600
I'm done.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.600
Please go ahead.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.600
I read

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.600
an article

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.600
that said

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.600
if...

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.600
It's from

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.600
Sexy.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.600
It said

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.600
if the

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.600
trigger

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.600
is

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.600
language

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.600
or

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.600
sound,

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.600
that is,

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.600
hearing,

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.600
the trigger

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.600
is

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.600
the

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.600
subject's

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600
abstract

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600
image.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.600
It's

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.600
about

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.600
describing

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.600
the material

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.600
in a

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.600
more abstract

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.600
and

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.600
far-reaching

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.600
way

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.600
compared to

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.600
visual materials.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.600
I don't know

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.600
if

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.600
it's

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.600
similar

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.600
to

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.600
processing

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.600
or

01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.600
listening to

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.600
music.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.600
If

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600
it's

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.600
similar

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600
to

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600
listening

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.600
to

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600
music,

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600
I think

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600
it's

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.600
similar.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.600
If

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600
it's

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600
similar,

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600
I think

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600
it's

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.600
similar.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600
Is it

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.600
similar?

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.600
I'm

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.600
not sure.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.600
I think

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.600
it's

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.600
similar.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.600
It's

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.600
similar.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.600
Okay.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.600
So

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600
I

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600
don't

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600
know

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.600
all the

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.600
details

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.600
about

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.600
the

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.600
song.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600
I

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.600
don't

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.600
know.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600
I

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.600
really don't

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.600
know.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.600
Hello.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600
Are

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600
you

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.600
calling me?

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600
I'm done.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600
I'm done.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.600
I just

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.600
said I

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.600
don't

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600
know.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.600
Sorry.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.600
Did I

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600
disconnect?

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.600
Okay.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.600
Does

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.600
anyone

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.600
else have

01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.600
any

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.600
questions?

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.600
Someone

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.600
is

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600
asking

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.600
questions.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.600
Can

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.600
I

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.600
ask

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.600
a question?

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.600
Okay.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.600
Please.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.600
I'm

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.600
thinking

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.600
that

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.600
if

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.600
you

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.600
tell

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.600
the

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.600
musicians

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.600
that

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600
you

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.600
have

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.600
three

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.600
people

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.600
following

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.600
you

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.600
and

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.600
one

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.600
is

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.600
the

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.600
leader,

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.600
will

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.600
they

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.600
fight?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600
Yes.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600
We

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.600
actually

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.600
did this

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600
experiment.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.600
Our

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.600
condition

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.600
is

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.600
Beach,

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600
I'm

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600
the

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.600
leader.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.600
But

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.600
we

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.600
originally

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.600
thought

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.600
that

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.600
in your

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.600
leadership

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.600
assignment,

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.600
if there

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.600
is

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.600
a

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.600
conflict,

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.600
how

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.600
can we

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.600
solve

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.600
the

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.600
conflict?

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:03.600
We

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.600
originally

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.600
wanted to

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.600
see this

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.600
situation.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.600
But

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600
the result of

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.600
the experiment

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.600
is that

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.600
we found

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.600
that only

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.600
when

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.600
everyone

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.600
can see

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.600
each other

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.600
and

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.600
everyone

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:20.600
is assigned

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.600
as

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.600
followers,

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.600
can we

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600
solve

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.600
this

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.600
conflict

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.600
smoothly.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.600
At

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600
that

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.600
time,

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600
we

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.600
thought

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.600
that

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.600
if

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.600
everyone

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.600
is

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.600
the

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.600
leader,

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.600
or

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.600
can't

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.600
see each

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.600
other,

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.600
they

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.600
can't

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.600
solve

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.600
the

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.600
conflict.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.600
So

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.600
we

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.600
called it

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600
Beach,

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.600
I'm

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600
the

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.600
leader.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.600
Have

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.600
you ever

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.600
tried

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.600
to solve

01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.600
the

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.600
conflict?

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600
We

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600
thought that

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.600
if

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600
everyone

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600
can see

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.600
each other

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.600
and

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.600
no one

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.600
is the

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.600
leader,

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.600
they can

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600
solve

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.600
the

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.600
conflict

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.600
smoothly.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.600
But

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.600
only in

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600
Bach's

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600
music,

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.600
if

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600
the

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.600
bassline

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600
is

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.600
unbalanced,

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.600
this

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.600
effect

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600
can't

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.600
be

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.600
achieved.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600
We

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.600
also asked

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.600
them to

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.600
guess who

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.600
is the

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.600
leader.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.600
We

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.600
forced them

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.600
to choose

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.600
the other

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.600
three,

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.600
but

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.600
they

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.600
were

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.600
so good

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.600
that

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.600
they

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.600
wrote

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600
NO

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600
LEADER

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600
on

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.600
the

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.600
answer sheet.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.600
So

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.600
this

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.600
part

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600
is

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.600
not

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.600
clear.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.600
And

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.600
we

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.600
tried to

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.600
avoid

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.600
the

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.600
conflict

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600
when

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.600
everyone

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.600
is the

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.600
leader.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.600
We

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.600
played the

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600
beat

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.600
two seconds

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.600
before

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.600
their

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.600
performance,

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.600
and

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.600
we

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.600
removed

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.600
the

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.600
beat

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.600
before

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.600
their

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.600

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.600
So

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.600
this

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.600
part is

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.600

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.600

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.600
We

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.600
also

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.600
asked

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.600
them to

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.600

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.600
We

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.600
forced them

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.600
to

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.600

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.600

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.600

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600
they

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.600
