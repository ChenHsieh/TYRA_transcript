00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello everyone, I'm the host for today, Zhang Yanyong, and we're going to have our 21st Terra Talk.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Today's speaker is Xu Liyan.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Xu Liyan and I have known each other for almost two years.

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
It's really interesting because we're at Caltech, and Xu Liyan is studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
In 2016, we had a year-long visit to Caltech and IPAC.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
At that time, we met Xu Liyan.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Xu Liyan happens to be a senior in the Department of Physics at Caltech, but he was studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Did I say that correctly?

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm from the Department of Physics.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh, you're from the Department of Physics.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
But you're studying astronomy at Manoa University.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
My advisor is from Manoa University.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I see.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
It's interesting because he's from Hawaii, and they were surfing.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
I was surfing, so we became good friends.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Of course, his main job is still doing astronomy observation research in Hawaii.

01:10.000 --> 01:19.000
After returning from Caltech, in 2017, he recently obtained a Ph.D. degree, so he is a new doctor.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Liyan's research is mainly galaxy observation.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
In his doctoral career, he is going to talk to us about this big topic today.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
He published 34 papers, but today he will focus on the latest one.

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
If you are interested in learning more about the previous papers, you can contact him directly.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Without further ado, let's welcome Liyan to give us his speech.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I'll mute myself.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
I'd like to remind everyone to mute your microphone when you speak.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Thank you.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
You can start.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Okay, I'll start.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
If you have any questions, please mute your microphone.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm afraid people won't understand.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, sorry.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
We forgot something.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
We need to clap.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
We need to mute our microphone when we clap.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay, you can start.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay, thank you.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
As you can see, my title is Characterizing Faint Sub-millimeter Galaxies with Posture Lensing.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
If you don't read astronomy, you can only understand Characterizing, Faint, and Width.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I'll explain what they mean.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
In short, I'm studying a galaxy called Sub-millimeter Galaxy.

02:52.000 --> 03:02.000
The wavelength detected by this galaxy is called Sub-millimeter.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
Sub-millimeter is shorter than millimeter.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Millimeter is in kilometers.

03:10.000 --> 03:22.000
Traditionally, people use 850 micrometers to study Sub-millimeter Galaxy.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Now I'll explain why I'm studying this galaxy and what I'm studying.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Okay.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Why do we study this galaxy?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
It's related to the evolution of the universe.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
You can google the history of the universe.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
You'll see a similar picture.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
The age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Maybe you've heard of it.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
It started from the Big Bang.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
The history of the universe is shown here.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
It started from the Big Bang.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Then there was a period of time called Inflation.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
At that time, the temperature of the universe was still very high.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It was all gaseous gas.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Until the temperature dropped to the ground.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
The gaseous electrons in the universe were recombined with the gaseous atoms.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
They became neutral gas atoms.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
From then on, light can start to run freely in the universe.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Before that, any light would be scattered by those gaseous electrons.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
From then on, light can run freely in the universe.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
At that time, the universe was scattered by those gaseous electrons.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Okay.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
But the temperature of the universe was still very high.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
After the temperature dropped to the ground.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
The temperature of the gaseous atoms dropped to the ground.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
The temperature of the universe was still very high.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Before that, there was the so-called Dark Age.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Basically, in the Big Bang, Inflation, and Cosmic Microwave Background.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
During this period, I think that this part of history is a matter of physicists.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
The theory of explosion is a matter of physicists.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
This is a very physical thing.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
And Big Bang.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
From the beginning of the formation of the galaxy.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
After the first galaxy was formed.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
This part can be done by astronomers.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Astronomers can do this part.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I said that the temperature of the universe.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Because the universe is constantly expanding.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The temperature slowly drops.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And these gaseous atoms.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
It can be further combined into gaseous atoms.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Okay, gaseous atoms.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
If the temperature is cool enough.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
After gravity collapses.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It will form a star.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Then the star will...

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Everyone should have heard of the star.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Just like our sun.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It produces the reaction of fusion.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
So it will shine.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Then it will generate energy.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Okay.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Then the star will not be produced one by one.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
They are produced in groups.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
That is to form the so-called galaxy.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
The galaxy is...

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
A galaxy is basically more than a billion of stars.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Okay.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It is a system of galaxies.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
So from this time on.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
After the beginning of the galaxy.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
It is to produce a lot of galaxies.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
The universe produces more and more galaxies.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Okay.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Then we study...

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
I mean this part.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
I am studying the so-called...

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Galaxy formation and evolution.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
The formation and evolution of galaxies.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
That is very important.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I want to study...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
The star formation.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
The history of star formation.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
That is the so-called cosmic star formation history.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
We want to use...

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
That is to say.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
From the first star to now.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
The evolution of the universe.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
You have to understand the evolution of the universe.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
One of them.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
You have to understand.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
It is very important.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
How to say.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
One of the important factors.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Is the star formation.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Because.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
If you look at astronomy.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
No matter what you are studying.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
No matter you are studying.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
The evolution of the galaxy.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Galaxy formation and evolution.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Or you want to study.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
The stars.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
For example, our solar system.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Or study the comet.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
The asteroid.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
In the universe.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
No matter what kind of weather you study.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It must be related to the comet.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Related to the stars.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Because you have the star.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
After you have the star formation.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
After you have the star formation.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
These stars.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Merge together.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Becomes a galaxy.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So it is related to the galaxy.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Then you.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Comet.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Comet system.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Like our solar system.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
After the comet is formed.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Then.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Some dust around the comet.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Slowly formed a comet.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Then the comet goes around the comet.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Like the comet.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Nebula.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
This is also.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
So.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
You can say.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Astronomy.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
No matter what you are studying.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I say astronomy.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
If it is.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
The physics of cosmology.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
It doesn't count.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Astronomy.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Basically.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Whatever you do.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
No matter what you do.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Will be related to.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Star formation.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
So the history of star formation.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Star formation history.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
So it is a very important.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
If you want to understand this universe.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
This is a very important thing.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
OK.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Then.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I believe I have.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Convinced everyone.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Star formation history.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Is a very important thing.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
But.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Star formation history.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
When we do research.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Found.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
This picture on the left.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Is the so-called.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I put the star formation history.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
This thing.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Brighten it.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Then this place.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
This axis on the left is called.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Star formation rate.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Density.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Star formation rate.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Is the star formation rate.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Then you can imagine.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Star formation rate.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Is every year.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Its unit is.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Ah.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Ah.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Star formation rate.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Divided by.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Time.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Then its unit is basically.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Every year.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Basically every year.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Can produce.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
How much.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Solar mass.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
This.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
This unit is.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Solar mass.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Is solar mass.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
So this part is called.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Star formation rate.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Then if you are in volume.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
So it's star formation rate.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Then in unit volume.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Then this is.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
NPC is a.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Ah.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
The distance unit of astronomy.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Then.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Don't.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Don't care how it comes.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Then it is a distance unit.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Then three dimensions.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
So this part is.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Ah.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
The orbit is green.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
In unit volume.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
So it's called star formation rate.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Density.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Horizontal.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
This is look back time.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
So the more to the right is the longer.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
OK.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Then this look back time.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Can be corresponded to the so-called.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Redshift.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Called redshift.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Ah.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Then this.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
I will explain it later.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Because this is.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
For people who don't study astronomy.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Should not know what this is.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
OK.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
But you can.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I can tell you now.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
The more to the right is.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Ah.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
The earlier.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
The universe.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
That.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Zero.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
This place is now.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
OK.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
So the time travel is from the right to the left.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Not from the left to the right.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
OK.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Then this picture is basically a.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Star formation.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
History picture.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Then you want to.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Measure this picture.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Ah.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
You.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
We.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Ah.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Will find.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
There are two.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
There are basically.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
There are two kinds of observations.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Is very important.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
That is.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Ah.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
When we used to.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Probably in the 90s.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
When.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
The end of the 90s.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
We have some.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Ah.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Ah.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Ah.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Satellite.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Ah.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
That is the space telescope.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
We go to measure.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
The whole universe.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Background radiation.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
That.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
There are different wavelengths.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Background radiation.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
That.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Then I mentioned.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Cosmic microwave background.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Cosmic microwave background.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
That is.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
CMB.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Here.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Ah.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Then this.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Is the intensity of light.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Then.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Horizontal.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Is the wavelength.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
So this is basically.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Light wave.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
That.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
CMB.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Probably in this place.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Then we will find.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
There are two components in this universe.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
CMB does not count.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
There are two.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Very important components.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
One is called.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Cosmic optical background.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It is visible light.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Background.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Then the other part.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
It is called.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Cosmic infrared background.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
It is the background of infrared.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Then we found.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
These two.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Background.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Their amount.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Is almost.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Almost.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
What does this tell us?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Because in this universe.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Horizontal.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
They will emit.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Ah.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Polar light.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Visible light.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Or near infrared light.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
That.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Horizontal.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Directly emitted light.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Basically.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
This is the component.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Optical background.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
OK.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
But.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
This.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Universe.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
The.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Horizontal.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
In this universe.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Star formation.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
OK.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
About half.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
It is not.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
We can.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Directly observe.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
It is called.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Dusty star formation.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
What does it mean?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
That is.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
When you.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
A.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Area.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
When a lot of stars are produced.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Then.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
A lot of new stars.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Huge stars.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
They.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Soon.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Will fall.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Then become.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
The so-called supernova.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Supernova.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Then.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
These.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
These huge stars.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
They produce.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
They are.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
A lot of heavy elements.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Then.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
By the end of the year.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
It becomes a supernova.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Will explode.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Then.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Will put these heavy elements.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
That is.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
That is.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Talk about this.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Space in the universe.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Then.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
These heavy elements.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Some of these heavy elements.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
For example.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Carbon.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
These things.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
They will form.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Star dust.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
That is.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Dust.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
That.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Dust particles.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
That is.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Like dust.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Floating.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
In space.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
That.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Dust.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Will be.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Directly emit light.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Oh.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
These straight.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Horizontal.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
That.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Light is.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
External light.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
The visible light.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Near infrared.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Is the near infrared light.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
These dusts.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Will be.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
These.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Parts of the light.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Absorbed.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Then.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
From our perspective.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
From the observer's point of view.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
That is to say.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
It'll block him.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Block that part of the light.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
But after it's blocked.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
The energy is residual.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
After it's absorbed.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
He will.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Radiate again.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Recharge.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
These energies.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
About half.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Will be.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
These dusts.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Absorbed.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
So we call.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Dusty star formation.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Or.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Dust.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Hidden star formation.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Or.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Dust obscured star formation.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Anyway.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
The point is.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
These star formations.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Will be.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Dust.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
To.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
To.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
To be.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Obscured by these dusts.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Then.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
They absorb the energy.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Then emit infrared light.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Oh.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
That is to say.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
You have to understand.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
The star formation of this universe.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
You have to understand.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
These two different.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
You can directly observe.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
The other is.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
You can't directly observe.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Then.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
These.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
You can't directly observe.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
You have to.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
In a longer wavelength.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
To observe.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
That is.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Far infrared light.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Or.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Sub-millimeter.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Or even.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Millimeter.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Millimeter.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
This.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Kilometer.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
I just said.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Sub-millimeter.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Is.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Less than a kilometer.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Wavelength.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
OK.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
OK.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
So.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Simply.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Simply.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Follow-on.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
In this universe.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
There is a large part.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Star formation.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Is.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Blocked by dust.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Then.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
You want to understand.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
That part.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Star formation.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
You can only observe.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
This wavelength.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Longer wavelength.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
OK.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Then.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I just said.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I mentioned.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
This is called.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Redshift.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
This thing.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Then I will explain.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
What is.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Redshift.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Then.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Redshift.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Simply speaking.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
If you have studied physics.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
You should know.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
The effect of Duplo.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
When.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
When you.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
This thing.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Uh.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
This wave.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
If it goes away from you.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
When.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
The wavelength you receive.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Will be stretched.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Or.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Simply speaking.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
It's frequency.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Change.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Uh.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Frequency.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Change.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Uh.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Short.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Or long.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Frequency.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Change.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Uh.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Slower.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Then.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Then.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
If something.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Is close to you.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Then.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Its wavelength.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Will.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Will.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Uh.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Short.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Or.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Frequency.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Uh.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Change.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
So.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
You hear.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
The ambulance.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
For example.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
If it's close to you.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Its sound.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Will change.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
The pitch will be higher.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
The pitch of the ambulance.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Will change.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Uh.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
The pitch.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Will be lower.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Okay.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
The wave.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Also has this Duplo effect.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Okay.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Then.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
When we observe.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
The object.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
In the universe.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Uh.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Uh.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Uh.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Uh.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Uh.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Uh.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Uh.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Uh.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Uh.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Uh.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Uh.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Uh.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Uh.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Uh.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Uh.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Uh.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Uh.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Uh.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
When you feel a pulse.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Uh.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
It's short.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Very short.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Uh.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Uh.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Uh.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
When you get.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Uh.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
It's short.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Yes.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000

20:26.140 --> 20:28.140

20:28.140 --> 20:30.140

20:30.140 --> 20:32.140
Red

20:32.140 --> 20:34.140
Red

20:34.140 --> 20:36.140
Red

20:36.140 --> 20:38.140
The most common unit of distance is light year

20:38.140 --> 20:40.140
But

20:40.140 --> 20:42.140
Basically light year is a

20:42.140 --> 20:44.140
Astronomers

20:44.140 --> 20:46.140
use it

20:46.140 --> 20:48.140
to do science education

20:48.140 --> 20:50.140
and talk to the general public

20:50.140 --> 20:52.140
Astronomers almost never use light year

20:52.140 --> 20:54.140
This unit

20:54.140 --> 20:56.140
Astronomers will use

20:56.140 --> 20:58.140
Distance unit may use

20:58.140 --> 21:00.140
Part second

21:00.140 --> 21:02.140
But if it is

21:02.140 --> 21:04.140
Like my research department

21:04.140 --> 21:06.140
We will not use distance unit

21:06.140 --> 21:08.140
We will use relationship unit

21:08.140 --> 21:10.140
Why?

21:10.140 --> 21:12.140
Because when you reach a large

21:12.140 --> 21:14.140
dimension

21:14.140 --> 21:16.140
The so-called distance

21:16.140 --> 21:18.140
is no longer an objective fact

21:18.140 --> 21:20.140
The so-called distance

21:20.140 --> 21:22.140
is no longer an objective fact

21:22.140 --> 21:24.140
For example, I am standing here

21:24.140 --> 21:26.140
and another person is standing here

21:26.140 --> 21:28.140
The so-called distance

21:28.140 --> 21:30.140
We are both

21:30.140 --> 21:32.140
in the same time and space

21:32.140 --> 21:34.140
We measure the distance

21:34.140 --> 21:36.140
It is an objective fact

21:36.140 --> 21:38.140
But when you discuss the entire

21:38.140 --> 21:40.140
universe

21:40.140 --> 21:42.140
The size of the universe

21:42.140 --> 21:44.140
When the distance is very far

21:44.140 --> 21:46.140
The so-called distance

21:46.140 --> 21:48.140
must be defined

21:48.140 --> 21:50.140
The distance is no longer an objective fact

21:50.140 --> 21:52.140
There are different definitions

21:52.140 --> 21:54.140
of distance

21:54.140 --> 21:56.140
Why define it?

21:56.140 --> 21:58.140
Because our universe is constantly expanding

21:58.140 --> 22:00.140
So it is a very complicated

22:00.140 --> 22:04.140
And it involves the evolution of our universe

22:04.140 --> 22:06.140
I don't have time to talk about it today

22:06.140 --> 22:08.140
To put it simply

22:08.140 --> 22:10.140
The picture on my right

22:10.140 --> 22:12.140
The picture on my right

22:12.140 --> 22:14.140
Is the relationship between distance and redshift

22:14.140 --> 22:16.140
The picture on my right

22:16.140 --> 22:18.140
Is the distance in Giga light year

22:18.140 --> 22:20.140
Giga light year is

22:20.140 --> 22:22.140
Giga is billions

22:22.140 --> 22:24.140
So the light year is billions

22:24.140 --> 22:26.140
Or

22:26.140 --> 22:28.140
Age in Giga year

22:28.140 --> 22:30.140
There is a lookback time

22:30.140 --> 22:32.140
This curve is the time

22:32.140 --> 22:34.140
When we

22:34.140 --> 22:36.140
Redshift to the right

22:36.140 --> 22:38.140
How long ago we saw

22:38.140 --> 22:40.140
This is called lookback time

22:40.140 --> 22:42.140
The other is called luminosity distance

22:42.140 --> 22:44.140
Angular diameter distance

22:44.140 --> 22:46.140
Line of cycle movement distance

22:46.140 --> 22:48.140
And Naive Hubble distance

22:48.140 --> 22:50.140
These are all distances

22:50.140 --> 22:52.140
That is the distance under different definitions

22:52.140 --> 22:54.140
In conclusion

22:54.140 --> 22:56.140
I won't talk about these distances today

22:56.140 --> 22:58.140
How they are defined

22:58.140 --> 23:00.140
And what they can do

23:00.140 --> 23:02.140
But in conclusion

23:02.140 --> 23:04.140
We can directly measure the distance

23:04.140 --> 23:06.140
Is this luminosity and angular diameter

23:06.140 --> 23:08.140
These two distances

23:08.140 --> 23:10.140
But I won't talk about it in detail

23:10.140 --> 23:12.140
But I won't talk about it in detail

23:12.140 --> 23:14.140
To put it simply

23:14.140 --> 23:16.140
The conclusion is

23:16.140 --> 23:18.140
It is not very convenient to use distance

23:18.140 --> 23:20.140
Because you are talking about the distance

23:20.140 --> 23:22.140
And these distances

23:22.140 --> 23:24.140
The relationship between distance and redshift

23:24.140 --> 23:26.140
Is linear

23:26.140 --> 23:28.140
Even the angular diameter distance is strange

23:28.140 --> 23:30.140
To

23:30.140 --> 23:32.140
Redshift 1 or more

23:32.140 --> 23:34.140
It is decreasing

23:34.140 --> 23:36.140
So it is not very convenient to use distance

23:36.140 --> 23:38.140
It is not a convenient variable

23:38.140 --> 23:40.140
So usually when studying cosmology

23:40.140 --> 23:42.140
Or galaxy evolution

23:42.140 --> 23:44.140
We use redshift

23:44.140 --> 23:46.140
As our distance

23:46.140 --> 23:48.140
So we often say

23:48.140 --> 23:50.140
How much redshift is your galaxy

23:50.140 --> 23:52.140
Basically, the larger the redshift

23:52.140 --> 23:54.140
Ok

23:54.140 --> 23:56.140
Sorry

23:56.140 --> 23:58.140
Can you hear me?

23:58.140 --> 24:00.140
Yes

24:00.140 --> 24:02.140
I have a question

24:02.140 --> 24:04.140
You have to calculate the original wavelength

24:04.140 --> 24:06.140
In addition to the redshift

24:06.140 --> 24:08.140
How do you know the original wavelength?

24:08.140 --> 24:10.140
The next step is to talk about it

24:10.140 --> 24:12.140
Basically

24:12.140 --> 24:14.140
Redshift is a very important variable

24:14.140 --> 24:16.140
Redshift is a very important variable

24:16.140 --> 24:18.140
Redshift is a very important variable

24:18.140 --> 24:20.140
Redshift is a very important variable

24:20.140 --> 24:22.140
Otherwise

24:22.140 --> 24:24.140
If there is no redshift

24:24.140 --> 24:26.140
When you do some modeling

24:26.140 --> 24:28.140
You only have a free parameter

24:28.140 --> 24:30.140
So we need

24:30.140 --> 24:32.140
Do a lot of

24:32.140 --> 24:34.140
Measurement and modeling

24:34.140 --> 24:36.140
We hope we will know

24:36.140 --> 24:38.140
Redshift

24:38.140 --> 24:40.140
How to measure redshift

24:40.140 --> 24:42.140
Basically observe the wavelength

24:42.140 --> 24:44.140
Divide by its original wavelength

24:44.140 --> 24:46.140
And subtract 1

24:46.140 --> 24:48.140
I want to emphasize that

24:48.140 --> 24:50.140
Measurement of redshift is very important

24:50.140 --> 24:52.140
Basically it is optical

24:52.140 --> 24:54.140
Whether you are

24:54.140 --> 24:56.140
Studying the star or galaxy

24:56.140 --> 24:58.140
They are all similar

24:58.140 --> 25:00.140
You use optical

25:00.140 --> 25:02.140
Optical theory

25:02.140 --> 25:04.140
Optical theory is usually visible light

25:04.140 --> 25:06.140
Or near infrared

25:06.140 --> 25:08.140
Ok

25:08.140 --> 25:10.140
Usually you use a large telescope

25:10.140 --> 25:12.140
We have two modes of observation

25:12.140 --> 25:14.140
Visible light telescope

25:14.140 --> 25:16.140
Or near infrared

25:16.140 --> 25:18.140
One is called imaging

25:18.140 --> 25:20.140
Imaging

25:20.140 --> 25:22.140
You can imagine

25:22.140 --> 25:24.140
It is taking pictures

25:24.140 --> 25:26.140
It is directly taking images

25:26.140 --> 25:28.140
The other mode is called spectroscopy

25:28.140 --> 25:30.140
The other mode is called spectroscopy

25:30.140 --> 25:32.140
Basically it uses

25:32.140 --> 25:34.140
The concept of light in physics

25:34.140 --> 25:36.140
You observe a star

25:36.140 --> 25:38.140
You observe a star

25:38.140 --> 25:40.140
After the light passes through the telescope

25:40.140 --> 25:42.140
After the light passes through the telescope

25:42.140 --> 25:44.140
After the light passes through the telescope

25:44.140 --> 25:46.140
Finally

25:52.140 --> 25:54.140
There will be diffraction

25:56.140 --> 25:58.140
We can measure the intensity of light

25:58.140 --> 26:00.140
As a function of wave length

26:00.140 --> 26:02.140
Ok

26:02.140 --> 26:04.140
How do we measure redshift

26:04.140 --> 26:06.140
We know

26:06.140 --> 26:08.140
Today's sky

26:08.140 --> 26:10.140
Whether star or galaxy

26:10.140 --> 26:12.140
We know

26:12.140 --> 26:14.140
What should the original spectrum look like

26:14.140 --> 26:16.140
Redshift equals to 0

26:16.140 --> 26:18.140
So we need to know

26:18.140 --> 26:20.140
But this is not difficult

26:20.140 --> 26:22.140
Because a lot of these things

26:22.140 --> 26:24.140
There will be a lot of absorption lines

26:24.140 --> 26:26.140
Or radiation

26:26.140 --> 26:28.140
Absorption line

26:28.140 --> 26:30.140
Or emission line

26:30.140 --> 26:32.140
Hα

26:32.140 --> 26:34.140
Oxygen

26:34.140 --> 26:36.140
These things

26:36.140 --> 26:38.140
Basically, after listening to the study for a long time

26:38.140 --> 26:40.140
We must have a galaxy

26:40.140 --> 26:42.140
There must be a model

26:42.140 --> 26:44.140
And these

26:44.140 --> 26:46.140
Emission line

26:46.140 --> 26:48.140
Or absorption line

26:48.140 --> 26:50.140
How much is it?

26:50.140 --> 26:52.140
Because we are on earth

26:52.140 --> 26:54.140
We can do it in the chemical lab

26:54.140 --> 26:56.140
We can know

26:56.140 --> 26:58.140
These absorption lines and emission lines

26:58.140 --> 27:00.140
Their wavelength

27:00.140 --> 27:02.140
Without redshift

27:02.140 --> 27:04.140
How much

27:04.140 --> 27:06.140
Let's say today

27:06.140 --> 27:08.140
Two galaxy spectrum

27:08.140 --> 27:10.140
We found this

27:10.140 --> 27:12.140
We have these spectrum

27:12.140 --> 27:14.140
We all know

27:14.140 --> 27:16.140
How much it should be when there is no redshift

27:16.140 --> 27:18.140
Then we can know their ratio

27:18.140 --> 27:20.140
The ratio from here to here

27:20.140 --> 27:22.140
Then we can measure

27:22.140 --> 27:24.140
The redshift of this galaxy

27:26.140 --> 27:28.140
Is there a problem here?

27:28.140 --> 27:30.140
If not, I will continue to talk about the next part

27:34.140 --> 27:36.140
Basically, the redshift event

27:36.140 --> 27:38.140
It is the concept of redshift

27:38.140 --> 27:40.140
Now back to my topic

27:40.140 --> 27:42.140
Why do I study the sub-millimeter galaxy?

27:44.140 --> 27:46.140
I just mentioned

27:46.140 --> 27:48.140
Because there are two kinds of star formation in the universe

27:48.140 --> 27:50.140
One is that we can directly observe

27:50.140 --> 27:52.140
Visible light can be directly observed

27:52.140 --> 27:54.140
The other half is

27:54.140 --> 27:56.140
Will be absorbed by dust

27:56.140 --> 27:58.140
Radiation

27:58.140 --> 28:00.140
That part

28:00.140 --> 28:02.140
Can only be observed

28:02.140 --> 28:04.140
In the far infrared or sub-millimeter

28:04.140 --> 28:06.140
Sub-millimeter

28:08.140 --> 28:10.140
The observation of sub-millimeter

28:10.140 --> 28:12.140
There is another point

28:12.140 --> 28:14.140
The so-called negative k-correction

28:14.140 --> 28:16.140
Now I will explain

28:16.140 --> 28:18.140
What is negative k-correction

28:18.140 --> 28:20.140
I just said

28:20.140 --> 28:22.140
There is a redshift in our universe

28:22.140 --> 28:24.140
So I drew a graph on the left

28:26.140 --> 28:28.140
This graph is a very typical

28:30.140 --> 28:32.140
Star formation galaxy

28:32.140 --> 28:34.140
There is a galaxy

28:34.140 --> 28:36.140
It is a very dusty galaxy

28:36.140 --> 28:38.140
It has a lot of star dust

28:38.140 --> 28:40.140
So the light of the star

28:40.140 --> 28:42.140
Will be absorbed by the dust

28:42.140 --> 28:44.140
Then put it in the far infrared

28:44.140 --> 28:46.140
Basically this part

28:48.140 --> 28:50.140
The smooth part

28:50.140 --> 28:52.140
Is the far infrared light

28:52.140 --> 28:54.140
The far infrared light emitted by dust

28:54.140 --> 28:56.140
The left side

28:58.140 --> 29:00.140
This is the star

29:00.140 --> 29:02.140
And this part

29:02.140 --> 29:04.140
What is hot

29:08.140 --> 29:10.140
I said I put the far infrared light

29:10.140 --> 29:12.140
This part is colder

29:14.140 --> 29:16.140
Right part

29:16.140 --> 29:18.140
This is radio

29:18.140 --> 29:20.140
This is a synchrotron radiation

29:24.140 --> 29:26.140
If he is consumed by the paralleloscope

29:26.140 --> 29:28.140
The paralleloscope rotates

29:28.140 --> 29:30.140
Then release

29:30.140 --> 29:32.140
Synchrotron Radiation

29:32.140 --> 29:34.140
I forgot the Chinese name of Synchrotron Radiation

29:34.140 --> 29:36.140
But it releases radiation

29:36.140 --> 29:38.140
Its light wave is here

29:38.140 --> 29:40.140
Anyway

29:40.140 --> 29:42.140
Then I did this thing

29:42.140 --> 29:44.140
I put a light wave

29:44.140 --> 29:46.140
Redshift

29:46.140 --> 29:48.140
From 0.5 to 10

29:48.140 --> 29:50.140
As I said just now

29:50.140 --> 29:52.140
Redshift is what causes the wavelength to change

29:52.140 --> 29:54.140
But it is not very far

29:54.140 --> 29:56.140
As I said just now

29:56.140 --> 29:58.140
It is 1 plus z

29:58.140 --> 30:00.140
OK

30:00.140 --> 30:02.140
So your wavelength

30:02.140 --> 30:04.140
You observe the wavelength

30:04.140 --> 30:06.140
The original wavelength is 1 plus z

30:06.140 --> 30:08.140
So you can imagine

30:08.140 --> 30:10.140
When you have a galaxy

30:10.140 --> 30:12.140
If you can move it freely

30:12.140 --> 30:14.140
If you want to move it further and further

30:14.140 --> 30:16.140
What I see

30:16.140 --> 30:18.140
The light wave will get fatter and fatter

30:18.140 --> 30:20.140
It's not just moving

30:20.140 --> 30:22.140
It's getting fatter and fatter

30:22.140 --> 30:24.140
Because it is 1 plus z

30:24.140 --> 30:26.140
There are two effects

30:26.140 --> 30:28.140
First, when you move it further and further

30:28.140 --> 30:30.140
Its light wave will get fatter and fatter

30:30.140 --> 30:32.140
But the second thing is the so-called inverse square law

30:32.140 --> 30:34.140
When you move a star

30:34.140 --> 30:36.140
Or a galaxy

30:36.140 --> 30:38.140
If you move it further and further

30:38.140 --> 30:40.140
Naturally, what we observe is getting darker and darker

30:40.140 --> 30:42.140
It's the same as the square

30:42.140 --> 30:44.140
So you see

30:44.140 --> 30:46.140
When you move to a higher and higher Redshift

30:46.140 --> 30:48.140
Its overall normalization

30:48.140 --> 30:50.140
It's getting lower and lower

30:50.140 --> 30:52.140
Because it gets darker and darker

30:52.140 --> 30:54.140
But the other effect is

30:54.140 --> 30:56.140
You move it to the right more and more

30:56.140 --> 30:58.140
Then there will be a very interesting phenomenon

30:58.140 --> 31:00.140
Just because

31:00.140 --> 31:02.140
The light wave formed by cold dust

31:02.140 --> 31:04.140
It's like this curve

31:04.140 --> 31:06.140
Then we observe

31:06.140 --> 31:08.140
Millimeters

31:08.140 --> 31:10.140
Or millimeters

31:10.140 --> 31:12.140
When we observe the wavelength

31:12.140 --> 31:14.140
We found

31:14.140 --> 31:16.140
A dusty galaxy

31:16.140 --> 31:18.140
When you move it further and further

31:18.140 --> 31:20.140
We observe

31:20.140 --> 31:22.140
We observe

31:22.140 --> 31:24.140
The flux

31:24.140 --> 31:26.140
Almost unchanged

31:26.140 --> 31:28.140
Almost unchanged

31:28.140 --> 31:30.140
Why?

31:30.140 --> 31:32.140
Because of two effects

31:32.140 --> 31:34.140
The first effect is

31:34.140 --> 31:36.140
When you move it further and further

31:36.140 --> 31:38.140
It will naturally get fatter and fatter

31:38.140 --> 31:40.140
But the other effect is

31:40.140 --> 31:42.140
You move the light wave to the right

31:42.140 --> 31:44.140
So what we observe is getting closer and closer

31:44.140 --> 31:46.140
More and more to the right

31:46.140 --> 31:48.140
We observe

31:48.140 --> 31:50.140
Like this galaxy

31:50.140 --> 31:52.140
We observe

31:52.140 --> 31:54.140
These two effects

31:54.140 --> 31:56.140
To a certain extent, it's a little offset

31:56.140 --> 31:58.140
So this effect is called

31:58.140 --> 32:00.140
Because of Redshift

32:00.140 --> 32:02.140
Cause you

32:02.140 --> 32:04.140
Offset the effect of distance

32:04.140 --> 32:06.140
This effect is called Negative K Correction

32:06.140 --> 32:08.140
There is actually another

32:08.140 --> 32:10.140
Positive K Correction

32:10.140 --> 32:12.140
Positive K Correction is

32:12.140 --> 32:14.140
For example, if you observe

32:14.140 --> 32:16.140
If you observe the radio

32:16.140 --> 32:18.140
When you move it further and further

32:18.140 --> 32:20.140
In addition to

32:20.140 --> 32:22.140
The further the distance

32:22.140 --> 32:24.140
The further the distance

32:24.140 --> 32:26.140
The further the brightness

32:26.140 --> 32:28.140
When you move the light wave to the right

32:28.140 --> 32:30.140
It will also make you

32:30.140 --> 32:32.140
Make your brightness lower

32:32.140 --> 32:34.140
So this is called Positive K Correction

32:34.140 --> 32:36.140
Both of its effects

32:36.140 --> 32:38.140
Cause your brightness to be lower

32:38.140 --> 32:40.140
Negative K Correction

32:40.140 --> 32:42.140
Redshift

32:42.140 --> 32:44.140
The further the distance

32:44.140 --> 32:46.140
The further the distance

32:46.140 --> 32:48.140
The effect is opposite

32:48.140 --> 32:50.140
It's a little bit

32:50.140 --> 32:52.140
So it's called Negative K Correction

32:52.140 --> 32:54.140
And then when we observe

32:54.140 --> 32:56.140
Often in the

32:56.140 --> 32:58.140
About one millimeter

32:58.140 --> 33:00.140
These two effects are almost offset

33:00.140 --> 33:02.140
So you observe

33:02.140 --> 33:04.140
Hello, I have a question

33:04.140 --> 33:06.140
Yes

33:06.140 --> 33:08.140
Please ask

33:08.140 --> 33:10.140
My question is

33:10.140 --> 33:12.140
If you say

33:12.140 --> 33:14.140
If you say

33:14.140 --> 33:16.140
The emission of dust

33:16.140 --> 33:18.140
Is because its energy is

33:18.140 --> 33:20.140
Absorbed by dust

33:20.140 --> 33:22.140
After that, the dust releases energy

33:22.140 --> 33:24.140
So it's actually a bit like

33:24.140 --> 33:26.140
Thermal Equilibrium

33:26.140 --> 33:28.140
Blackbody Radiation

33:28.140 --> 33:30.140
It's not a perfect blackbody

33:30.140 --> 33:32.140
It's called Modified Blackbody

33:32.140 --> 33:34.140
Hello

33:34.140 --> 33:36.140
Hello, can you hear me?

33:36.140 --> 33:38.140
It's not a perfect blackbody

33:38.140 --> 33:40.140
It's a blackbody radiation

33:40.140 --> 33:42.140
But

33:42.140 --> 33:44.140
So it's basically thermal radiation

33:44.140 --> 33:46.140
Right?

33:46.140 --> 33:48.140
It's called Modified

33:48.140 --> 33:50.140
But its spectrum to some extent

33:50.140 --> 33:52.140
Corresponds to temperature, right?

33:52.140 --> 33:54.140
Yes, that's what I just said

33:54.140 --> 33:56.140
This is very smooth

33:56.140 --> 33:58.140
Then I have a question

33:58.140 --> 34:00.140
Why is the temperature of different galaxies

34:00.140 --> 34:02.140
The same

34:02.140 --> 34:04.140
It will be different

34:04.140 --> 34:06.140
Why is the temperature the same?

34:06.140 --> 34:08.140
Different

34:08.140 --> 34:10.140
Hello

34:14.140 --> 34:16.140
Hello

34:16.140 --> 34:18.140
I can hear you

34:18.140 --> 34:20.140
I can hear you

34:20.140 --> 34:22.140
It won't be the same

34:22.140 --> 34:24.140
I can hear you

34:24.140 --> 34:26.140
So the temperature is different

34:26.140 --> 34:28.140
I can hear you

34:28.140 --> 34:30.140
This part

34:30.140 --> 34:32.140
This part is the so-called

34:32.140 --> 34:34.140
Thermal dust

34:34.140 --> 34:36.140
When the temperature is different

34:36.140 --> 34:38.140
Its shape will be slightly different

34:40.140 --> 34:42.140
Hello

34:42.140 --> 34:44.140
Can you hear me?

34:46.140 --> 34:48.140
I can't hear you

34:48.140 --> 34:50.140
OK

34:50.140 --> 34:52.140
But you have to assume

34:52.140 --> 34:54.140
This point will never run away

34:54.140 --> 34:56.140
Can you hear me?

34:56.140 --> 34:58.140
Yes

34:58.140 --> 35:00.140
It's broken

35:00.140 --> 35:02.140
It's broken

35:02.140 --> 35:04.140
What?

35:04.140 --> 35:06.140
You have to assume this point

35:08.140 --> 35:10.140
It's broken

35:10.140 --> 35:12.140
I

35:12.140 --> 35:14.140
Basically

35:14.140 --> 35:16.140
You probably want to say

35:16.140 --> 35:18.140
If their spectrum is different

35:18.140 --> 35:20.140
It won't be so good

35:20.140 --> 35:22.140
But it should be

35:22.140 --> 35:24.140
The example I am giving now is just a typical example

35:24.140 --> 35:26.140
OK

35:26.140 --> 35:28.140
But the typical example is like this

35:28.140 --> 35:30.140
Then when your temperature is different

35:30.140 --> 35:32.140
Its shape will be slightly different

35:32.140 --> 35:34.140
But it won't be so bad

35:34.140 --> 35:36.140
They are basically similar

35:36.140 --> 35:38.140
But the temperature is different

35:38.140 --> 35:40.140
The shape is slightly different

35:40.140 --> 35:42.140
Then they all have a similar effect

35:42.140 --> 35:44.140
I just said

35:44.140 --> 35:46.140
It's not 100% perfect

35:46.140 --> 35:48.140
It's just about

35:48.140 --> 35:50.140
Does this explain your question?

35:56.140 --> 35:58.140
Yes

35:58.140 --> 36:00.140
It's not perfect

36:00.140 --> 36:02.140
Thank you

36:02.140 --> 36:04.140
The example I am giving now is just a typical example

36:04.140 --> 36:06.140
The example I am giving now is just a typical example

36:06.140 --> 36:08.140
But different Galaxy's spectrum will definitely be different

36:08.140 --> 36:10.140
But they all have a similar effect

36:10.140 --> 36:12.140
But they all have a similar effect

36:12.140 --> 36:14.140
But it's not perfect

36:14.140 --> 36:16.140
OK

36:16.140 --> 36:18.140
I will continue

36:18.140 --> 36:20.140
OK

36:20.140 --> 36:22.140
I will draw this effect on the right

36:22.140 --> 36:24.140
I will draw this effect on the right

36:24.140 --> 36:26.140
This is what we observe

36:26.140 --> 36:28.140
This Galaxy is called Redshift

36:28.140 --> 36:30.140
This is Redshift

36:30.140 --> 36:32.140
This is the intensity of light

36:32.140 --> 36:34.140
Then the different color curves here

36:34.140 --> 36:36.140
Then the different color curves here

36:36.140 --> 36:38.140
It corresponds to different observations

36:38.140 --> 36:40.140
It corresponds to different observations

36:40.140 --> 36:42.140
So like here

36:42.140 --> 36:44.140
0.8 microns

36:44.140 --> 36:46.140
0.8 microns

36:46.140 --> 36:48.140
0.8 microns

36:48.140 --> 36:50.140
It's about 800 nanometers

36:50.140 --> 36:52.140
800 nanometers is red light

36:52.140 --> 36:54.140
OK

36:54.140 --> 36:56.140
It's positive

36:56.140 --> 36:58.140
OK

36:58.140 --> 37:00.140
It's positive

37:00.140 --> 37:02.140
OK

37:02.140 --> 37:04.140
OK

37:04.140 --> 37:06.140
OK

37:06.140 --> 37:08.140
OK

37:08.140 --> 37:10.140
OK

37:10.140 --> 37:12.140
OK

37:12.140 --> 37:14.140
OK

37:14.140 --> 37:16.140
OK

37:16.140 --> 37:18.140
OK

37:18.140 --> 37:20.140
OK

37:20.140 --> 37:22.140
OK

37:22.140 --> 37:24.140
OK

37:24.140 --> 37:26.140
OK

37:26.140 --> 37:28.140
OK

37:28.140 --> 37:30.140
It's positive

37:30.140 --> 37:32.140
It's positive

37:32.140 --> 37:34.140
OK

37:34.140 --> 37:36.140
0.8 microns

37:36.140 --> 37:38.140
0.8 microns

37:38.140 --> 37:40.140
No difference

37:44.140 --> 37:46.140
0.8 microns

37:46.140 --> 37:48.140
0.8 microns

37:48.140 --> 37:50.140
0.8 microns

37:50.140 --> 37:52.140
Here is 500

37:52.140 --> 37:54.140
500 micrometers

37:54.140 --> 37:56.140
450 micrometers

37:56.140 --> 37:58.140
About

37:58.140 --> 38:00.140
About 850 and 1 mm

38:00.140 --> 38:02.140
These wavelengths

38:02.140 --> 38:04.140
Are near here

38:04.140 --> 38:06.140
Almost flat

38:06.140 --> 38:08.140
OK

38:08.140 --> 38:10.140
So

38:10.140 --> 38:12.140
The conclusion is

38:12.140 --> 38:14.140
When the wavelength you observe is

38:14.140 --> 38:16.140
Sub-millimeter or millimeter

38:16.140 --> 38:18.140
You have a good effect

38:18.140 --> 38:20.140
No matter how far you move

38:20.140 --> 38:22.140
The brightness you observe

38:22.140 --> 38:24.140
Almost unchanged

38:24.140 --> 38:26.140
So with this effect

38:26.140 --> 38:28.140
You can use it to detect

38:28.140 --> 38:30.140
Detect

38:30.140 --> 38:32.140
Very high redshift galaxy

38:32.140 --> 38:34.140
Very far galaxy

38:34.140 --> 38:36.140
Very early galaxy in the universe

38:36.140 --> 38:38.140
If you use a more traditional

38:38.140 --> 38:40.140
Visible wavelength

38:40.140 --> 38:42.140
You will find that its brightness drops very quickly

38:42.140 --> 38:44.140
So of course, your distant galaxy is very dark

38:44.140 --> 38:46.140
It's not easy to observe

38:46.140 --> 38:48.140
If you use radio

38:48.140 --> 38:50.140
Radio is wireless radio

38:50.140 --> 38:52.140
If you use wireless radio to observe

38:52.140 --> 38:54.140
You will still see this picture

38:54.140 --> 38:56.140
It also drops very quickly

38:56.140 --> 38:58.140
So it's the same for distant galaxies

38:58.140 --> 39:00.140
It's very hard to observe

39:00.140 --> 39:02.140
If you want to observe

39:02.140 --> 39:04.140
You have to do a long exposure

39:04.140 --> 39:06.140
Observation is very deep

39:06.140 --> 39:08.140
The deeper you are, the farther you can observe

39:08.140 --> 39:10.140
But sub-millimeter or millimeter

39:10.140 --> 39:12.140
This is almost flat

39:12.140 --> 39:14.140
So you can use this technique

39:14.140 --> 39:16.140
To detect

39:16.140 --> 39:18.140
Compared to visible light or radio

39:18.140 --> 39:20.140
It's much easier

39:20.140 --> 39:22.140
Much easier

39:22.140 --> 39:24.140
To observe these distant galaxies

39:24.140 --> 39:26.140
This is why sub-millimeter is very important

39:30.140 --> 39:32.140
I'm going to talk about

39:32.140 --> 39:34.140
Now the point is

39:34.140 --> 39:36.140
What I'm studying is called sub-millimeter galaxies

39:36.140 --> 39:38.140
In the 1990s

39:40.140 --> 39:42.140
Kearny used

39:42.140 --> 39:44.140
Sub-millimeter

39:44.140 --> 39:46.140
Telescope

39:46.140 --> 39:48.140
It's a telescope

39:48.140 --> 39:50.140
Called JCMD

39:50.140 --> 39:52.140
I will have a photo later

39:52.140 --> 39:54.140
To shoot a famous field in the sky

39:54.140 --> 39:56.140
Called Hubble Deep Field

39:56.140 --> 39:58.140
Because this field

39:58.140 --> 40:00.140
They used Hubble telescope

40:00.140 --> 40:02.140
To shoot a very deep image

40:02.140 --> 40:04.140
This is the image taken by Hubble telescope

40:04.140 --> 40:06.140
Visible light image

40:06.140 --> 40:08.140
Then they used JCMD

40:08.140 --> 40:10.140
To shoot the same area

40:10.140 --> 40:12.140
This

40:12.140 --> 40:14.140
The image on the right

40:14.140 --> 40:16.140
Is a sub-millimeter image

40:16.140 --> 40:18.140
With JCMD

40:18.140 --> 40:20.140
There is a bright spot here

40:20.140 --> 40:22.140
There may be a bright spot here

40:22.140 --> 40:24.140
This is a

40:24.140 --> 40:26.140
Sub-millimeter source

40:28.140 --> 40:30.140
Before JCMD

40:30.140 --> 40:32.140
We only use some

40:32.140 --> 40:34.140
Space telescope to measure the background

40:34.140 --> 40:36.140
We can measure

40:36.140 --> 40:38.140
Sub-millimeter

40:38.140 --> 40:40.140
But we don't

40:40.140 --> 40:42.140
Understand

40:42.140 --> 40:44.140
What source is this background

40:44.140 --> 40:46.140
From

40:46.140 --> 40:48.140
With JCMD

40:48.140 --> 40:50.140
Resolve the background

40:50.140 --> 40:52.140
Into individual sources

40:52.140 --> 40:54.140
We can see the individual sub-millimeter

40:54.140 --> 40:56.140
I just talked about

40:56.140 --> 40:58.140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

40:58.140 --> 41:00.140
Sub-millimeter galaxies are basically dusty

41:00.140 --> 41:02.140
They are very

41:02.140 --> 41:04.140
Intense

41:04.140 --> 41:06.140
Star formation

41:06.140 --> 41:08.140
Very intense

41:08.140 --> 41:10.140
Very intense

41:10.140 --> 41:12.140
Very intense

41:12.140 --> 41:14.140
Starburst gas

41:14.140 --> 41:16.140
Why is the sub-millimeter

41:16.140 --> 41:18.140
Very bright

41:18.140 --> 41:20.140
Originally

41:20.140 --> 41:22.140
If it is red

41:22.140 --> 41:24.140
If we have a dusty galaxy

41:24.140 --> 41:26.140
Its peak

41:26.140 --> 41:28.140
About

41:28.140 --> 41:30.140
Its wavelength

41:30.140 --> 41:32.140
About 100 micrometer

41:32.140 --> 41:34.140
But when you move to

41:34.140 --> 41:36.140
When redshift is above 1

41:36.140 --> 41:38.140
When the distance of your galaxy

41:38.140 --> 41:40.140
Is above redshift 1

41:40.140 --> 41:42.140
Its peak may move to

41:42.140 --> 41:44.140
About millimeter

41:44.140 --> 41:46.140
Or sub-millimeter

41:46.140 --> 41:48.140
Why is it

41:48.140 --> 41:50.140
Very bright

41:50.140 --> 41:52.140
Its original wavelength

41:52.140 --> 41:54.140
Is about 100 micrometer

41:54.140 --> 41:56.140
100 micrometer is

41:56.140 --> 41:58.140
In astronomy

41:58.140 --> 42:00.140
This wavelength is called distant infrared

42:00.140 --> 42:02.140
Distant infrared

42:02.140 --> 42:04.140
Because it is

42:04.140 --> 42:06.140
Above redshift 1

42:06.140 --> 42:08.140
When we observe it

42:08.140 --> 42:10.140
The wavelength we observe

42:10.140 --> 42:12.140
Is below

42:12.140 --> 42:14.140
Sub-millimeter and millimeter

42:14.140 --> 42:16.140
Wavelength

42:16.140 --> 42:18.140
Ok

42:18.140 --> 42:20.140
This sub-millimeter galaxy

42:20.140 --> 42:22.140
Is a very dusty starburst galaxy

42:22.140 --> 42:24.140
It is usually difficult

42:24.140 --> 42:26.140
It is written here

42:26.140 --> 42:28.140
It is difficult to observe in visible wavelengths

42:28.140 --> 42:30.140
Or so-called rest frame UV

42:30.140 --> 42:32.140
These visible wavelengths

42:32.140 --> 42:34.140
For these distant information

42:34.140 --> 42:36.140
When it is emitted

42:36.140 --> 42:38.140
When it is emitted

42:38.140 --> 42:40.140
When the light is emitted

42:40.140 --> 42:42.140
It is a rest frame UV

42:42.140 --> 42:44.140
When we observe

42:44.140 --> 42:46.140
It is redshift visible

42:46.140 --> 42:48.140
So we observe it as visible light

42:48.140 --> 42:50.140
But when it is emitted

42:50.140 --> 42:52.140
It is actually UV

42:52.140 --> 42:54.140
These sub-millimeter galaxies

42:54.140 --> 42:56.140
Because it is very dusty

42:56.140 --> 42:58.140
Basically their UV

42:58.140 --> 43:00.140
Often absorbed by dust

43:00.140 --> 43:02.140
So in visible wavelengths

43:02.140 --> 43:04.140
You often can't see them

43:04.140 --> 43:06.140
Can't observe them

43:06.140 --> 43:08.140
When it is sub-millimeter wavelength

43:08.140 --> 43:10.140
You will find

43:10.140 --> 43:12.140
A very bright source

43:12.140 --> 43:14.140
Ok

43:14.140 --> 43:16.140
I will continue

43:16.140 --> 43:18.140
How to observe these

43:18.140 --> 43:20.140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

43:20.140 --> 43:22.140
As I said

43:22.140 --> 43:24.140
In the 90s, they used JCMP

43:24.140 --> 43:26.140
To find these sub-millimeter galaxies

43:26.140 --> 43:28.140
This kind of telescope is called single-dash

43:28.140 --> 43:30.140
It only has one antenna

43:30.140 --> 43:32.140
Telescope

43:32.140 --> 43:34.140
Ok

43:34.140 --> 43:36.140
Basically using this kind of single-dash

43:36.140 --> 43:38.140
To scan our sky

43:38.140 --> 43:40.140
Is the most effective way to find these sub-millimeter galaxies

43:40.140 --> 43:42.140
I will introduce later

43:42.140 --> 43:44.140
Another technique

43:44.140 --> 43:46.140
Interferometry

43:46.140 --> 43:48.140
Interferometry

43:48.140 --> 43:50.140
I will talk about it later

43:50.140 --> 43:52.140
This kind of single-dash

43:52.140 --> 43:54.140
I will talk about the conclusion first

43:54.140 --> 43:56.140
The conclusion is

43:56.140 --> 43:58.140
It is the most effective way

43:58.140 --> 44:00.140
To scan the sky

44:00.140 --> 44:02.140
To find these sources

44:02.140 --> 44:04.140
It has a problem

44:04.140 --> 44:06.140
Its resolution is very low

44:06.140 --> 44:08.140
Why?

44:08.140 --> 44:10.140
Basically

44:10.140 --> 44:12.140
The image we took

44:12.140 --> 44:14.140
The image we took

44:14.140 --> 44:16.140
The image we took

44:16.140 --> 44:18.140
Is proportional to the wavelength

44:18.140 --> 44:20.140
And is proportional to the size of the telescope

44:20.140 --> 44:22.140
This is basically

44:22.140 --> 44:24.140
It comes from physical light

44:24.140 --> 44:26.140
It comes from light

44:26.140 --> 44:28.140
If you have studied light

44:28.140 --> 44:30.140
You should be familiar with this

44:30.140 --> 44:32.140
So today we observe

44:32.140 --> 44:34.140
Sub-millimeter or far-infrared

44:34.140 --> 44:36.140
Or radio

44:36.140 --> 44:38.140
These are relatively long wavelengths

44:38.140 --> 44:40.140
On the contrary, if you observe visible light

44:40.140 --> 44:42.140
Or UV

44:42.140 --> 44:44.140
Those are relatively short wavelengths

44:44.140 --> 44:46.140
These long wavelengths

44:46.140 --> 44:48.140
This lambda is very large

44:48.140 --> 44:50.140
So the image resolution

44:50.140 --> 44:52.140
Will be worse

44:52.140 --> 44:54.140
If you want to make your image resolution

44:54.140 --> 44:56.140
A little better

44:56.140 --> 44:58.140
You have to build a bigger telescope

44:58.140 --> 45:00.140
Let your diameter

45:00.140 --> 45:02.140
Build a bigger telescope

45:02.140 --> 45:04.140
I will talk about this later

45:04.140 --> 45:06.140
Talk more

45:06.140 --> 45:08.140
This kind of single-dash telescope

45:08.140 --> 45:10.140
Because the wavelength is long

45:10.140 --> 45:12.140
So its resolution is very low

45:12.140 --> 45:14.140
So it has two problems

45:14.140 --> 45:16.140
The first is that if the resolution is very low

45:16.140 --> 45:18.140
You observe a source

45:18.140 --> 45:20.140
Then when you want to go to other wavelengths

45:20.140 --> 45:22.140
To find it in other wavelengths

45:22.140 --> 45:24.140
The corresponding point

45:24.140 --> 45:26.140
Is the counterpart

45:26.140 --> 45:28.140
You don't know where it is

45:28.140 --> 45:30.140
Because its resolution is too bad

45:30.140 --> 45:32.140
So you have to

45:32.140 --> 45:34.140
You don't know where its precise position is

45:34.140 --> 45:36.140
If you want to know its precise position

45:36.140 --> 45:38.140
You need to use interference

45:38.140 --> 45:40.140
Do further observation

45:40.140 --> 45:42.140
OK, my next slide

45:42.140 --> 45:44.140
Will talk about what interference is

45:44.140 --> 45:46.140
Like this picture

45:46.140 --> 45:48.140
This is the result

45:48.140 --> 45:50.140
The source observed by JCMP

45:50.140 --> 45:52.140
Maybe it's a big one

45:52.140 --> 45:54.140
Sorry, I don't have a picture here

45:54.140 --> 45:56.140
A big one

45:56.140 --> 45:58.140
You can't get it

45:58.140 --> 46:00.140
Where is the precise position

46:00.140 --> 46:02.140
But after the observation of the interference

46:02.140 --> 46:04.140
You can get it

46:04.140 --> 46:06.140
A higher resolution image

46:06.140 --> 46:08.140
Then you can accurately measure its position

46:08.140 --> 46:10.140
After measuring its position

46:10.140 --> 46:12.140
You go to other wavelengths

46:12.140 --> 46:14.140
For example, this is the image of Hubble telescope

46:14.140 --> 46:16.140
Then you go to other wavelengths

46:16.140 --> 46:18.140
To find its corresponding counterpart

46:18.140 --> 46:20.140
Or not

46:20.140 --> 46:22.140
This is the first problem

46:22.140 --> 46:24.140
Its resolution is too bad

46:24.140 --> 46:26.140
So you have to use interference

46:26.140 --> 46:28.140
The second problem is called confusion limit

46:28.140 --> 46:30.140
Basically, it is also caused by low resolution

46:30.140 --> 46:32.140
Because your resolution is bad

46:32.140 --> 46:34.140
When your resolution is bad

46:34.140 --> 46:36.140
In our universe

46:36.140 --> 46:38.140
Whether you are exploring the stars

46:38.140 --> 46:40.140
Or stars

46:40.140 --> 46:42.140
In this universe

46:42.140 --> 46:44.140
Dark things

46:44.140 --> 46:46.140
More than bright things

46:46.140 --> 46:48.140
There may be a power law

46:48.140 --> 46:50.140
Here

46:50.140 --> 46:52.140
Then when you

46:52.140 --> 46:54.140
There are more dark things

46:54.140 --> 46:56.140
It means that these darker subliminal galaxies

46:56.140 --> 46:58.140
The density

46:58.140 --> 47:00.140
The density in the sky

47:00.140 --> 47:02.140
Is greater than those brighter subliminal galaxies

47:02.140 --> 47:04.140
Is greater than those brighter subliminal galaxies

47:04.140 --> 47:06.140
The meaning of confusion limit

47:06.140 --> 47:08.140
When you observe

47:08.140 --> 47:10.140
When the resolution is very low

47:10.140 --> 47:12.140
Then when you

47:12.140 --> 47:14.140
If there are a lot of

47:14.140 --> 47:16.140
Darker subliminal galaxies

47:16.140 --> 47:18.140
Because they are a lot

47:18.140 --> 47:20.140
Because they are a lot

47:20.140 --> 47:22.140
Then they will all come together

47:22.140 --> 47:24.140
Then they will all come together

47:24.140 --> 47:26.140
Come together and become one

47:26.140 --> 47:28.140
In other words, you observe one

47:28.140 --> 47:30.140
A very bright source

47:30.140 --> 47:32.140
In fact, it may be a lot of dark

47:32.140 --> 47:34.140
Darker subliminal galaxies

47:34.140 --> 47:36.140
Darker subliminal galaxies

47:36.140 --> 47:38.140
Because your resolution is too bad

47:38.140 --> 47:40.140
So you see a lot

47:40.140 --> 47:42.140
So this will cause something called

47:42.140 --> 47:44.140
Confusion limit

47:44.140 --> 47:46.140
Because the resolution of your telescope is bad

47:46.140 --> 47:48.140
So you can't observe

47:48.140 --> 47:50.140
You will have a limit

47:50.140 --> 47:52.140
A star that is darker than this limit

47:52.140 --> 47:54.140
You can't directly observe

47:54.140 --> 47:56.140
Because the stars that are darker than this limit

47:56.140 --> 47:58.140
They are a lot

47:58.140 --> 48:00.140
Because of your low resolution

48:00.140 --> 48:02.140
All blend together

48:02.140 --> 48:04.140
OK

48:04.140 --> 48:06.140
So this limit will cause

48:06.140 --> 48:08.140
Observe a subliminal galaxy

48:08.140 --> 48:10.140
It has a limit

48:10.140 --> 48:12.140
Its brightness is like this

48:12.140 --> 48:14.140
Too many Jansky at 850 microns

48:14.140 --> 48:16.140
I won't explain today

48:16.140 --> 48:18.140
What unit is this mini Jansky

48:18.140 --> 48:20.140
Anyway, it is a unit of brightness

48:20.140 --> 48:22.140
OK

48:22.140 --> 48:24.140
This brightness can be converted to

48:24.140 --> 48:26.140
Its absolute brightness

48:26.140 --> 48:28.140
Called luminosity

48:28.140 --> 48:30.140
About 10 to 12 squares

48:30.140 --> 48:32.140
Solar luminosity

48:32.140 --> 48:34.140
Solar luminosity is the brightness of the sun

48:34.140 --> 48:36.140
So this limit

48:36.140 --> 48:38.140
It corresponds to 10 to 12 squares

48:38.140 --> 48:40.140
The brightness of the sun

48:40.140 --> 48:42.140
This kind of star is called

48:42.140 --> 48:44.140
Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy

48:44.140 --> 48:46.140
It is very very bright

48:46.140 --> 48:48.140
Dusty Galaxy

48:48.140 --> 48:50.140
In other words, we use JCMP

48:50.140 --> 48:52.140
Or use this kind of single dish

48:52.140 --> 48:54.140
The source we can detect

48:54.140 --> 48:56.140
It is very very very bright

48:56.140 --> 48:58.140
Then we can't detect

48:58.140 --> 49:00.140
Darker

49:00.140 --> 49:02.140
This is its problem

49:02.140 --> 49:04.140
OK, I will explain later

49:04.140 --> 49:06.140
My thesis

49:06.140 --> 49:08.140
How to solve this problem

49:08.140 --> 49:10.140
Now I will explain the interference cloud

49:12.140 --> 49:14.140
What is the interference cloud

49:14.140 --> 49:16.140
I just said

49:16.140 --> 49:18.140
Resolution you observe

49:18.140 --> 49:20.140
It is proportional to wavelength

49:20.140 --> 49:22.140
Resolution of the telescope

49:22.140 --> 49:24.140
So you want

49:24.140 --> 49:26.140
Resolution is very bad

49:26.140 --> 49:28.140
If we want to improve our resolution

49:28.140 --> 49:30.140
Then we build a bigger telescope

49:30.140 --> 49:32.140
Let D

49:36.140 --> 49:38.140
But this is the problem

49:38.140 --> 49:40.140
You have to build a very big telescope

49:40.140 --> 49:42.140
Or a very big antenna

49:42.140 --> 49:44.140
Because we are a long-wave field

49:44.140 --> 49:46.140
In fact, our telescope is the so-called antenna

49:46.140 --> 49:48.140
Just like this

49:48.140 --> 49:50.140
I think I just drew it

49:50.140 --> 49:52.140
It is an antenna

49:52.140 --> 49:54.140
Then we have to build a very big

49:54.140 --> 49:56.140
Gigantic antenna

49:56.140 --> 49:58.140
It is very very expensive

49:58.140 --> 50:00.140
So this thing

50:00.140 --> 50:02.140
It is not economic

50:02.140 --> 50:04.140
So how to solve it

50:04.140 --> 50:06.140
It is the so-called interference cloud

50:06.140 --> 50:08.140
Interference cloud means

50:08.140 --> 50:10.140
We don't build a super big antenna

50:10.140 --> 50:12.140
We build a lot of small antennas

50:12.140 --> 50:14.140
Like the picture of my background

50:14.140 --> 50:16.140
We build multiple small antennas

50:16.140 --> 50:18.140
Then

50:18.140 --> 50:20.140
We accept the signal

50:20.140 --> 50:22.140
Make a cross correlation

50:22.140 --> 50:24.140
This technology is called

50:24.140 --> 50:26.140
Interference cloud

50:26.140 --> 50:28.140
Then

50:28.140 --> 50:30.140
It is a bit like

50:30.140 --> 50:32.140
When you put a lot of small antennas

50:32.140 --> 50:34.140
Then spread it

50:34.140 --> 50:36.140
Spread it on the ground

50:36.140 --> 50:38.140
It is a bit like

50:38.140 --> 50:40.140
You have a big telescope

50:40.140 --> 50:42.140
But not so perfect

50:42.140 --> 50:44.140
It has a lot

50:44.140 --> 50:46.140
When you deal with images

50:46.140 --> 50:48.140
It has a lot of complicated details

50:48.140 --> 50:50.140
I won't talk about these

50:50.140 --> 50:52.140
But basically what you can do is

50:52.140 --> 50:54.140
When you spread a lot of small antennas

50:54.140 --> 50:56.140
The resolution can be similar to

50:56.140 --> 50:58.140
A big telescope

50:58.140 --> 51:00.140
It is equivalent to increasing the low

51:00.140 --> 51:02.140
So you can get a

51:02.140 --> 51:04.140
Higher resolution image

51:04.140 --> 51:06.140
So I gave an example here

51:06.140 --> 51:08.140
Then this side

51:08.140 --> 51:10.140
This picture is

51:10.140 --> 51:12.140
I used JCMP

51:12.140 --> 51:14.140
I took a picture

51:14.140 --> 51:16.140
A very wide image

51:16.140 --> 51:18.140
Then there is a bright spot inside

51:18.140 --> 51:20.140
Is a

51:20.140 --> 51:22.140
Submarine source

51:22.140 --> 51:24.140
Zoom in

51:24.140 --> 51:26.140
Then

51:26.140 --> 51:28.140
Why is it called SCUBA-2?

51:28.140 --> 51:30.140
Because we use JCMP

51:30.140 --> 51:32.140
Observe the camera

51:32.140 --> 51:34.140
Of the submarine galaxy

51:34.140 --> 51:36.140
That camera

51:36.140 --> 51:38.140
Is called SCUBA-2

51:38.140 --> 51:40.140
Then we observe

51:40.140 --> 51:42.140
Then we need to use interference cloud

51:42.140 --> 51:44.140
The background pattern

51:44.140 --> 51:46.140
This interference cloud is very famous

51:46.140 --> 51:48.140
ELMA telescope

51:48.140 --> 51:50.140
ELMA is built in Chile

51:50.140 --> 51:52.140
It is the most powerful

51:52.140 --> 51:54.140
Interference cloud in the world

51:54.140 --> 51:56.140
Then it observes the submarine

51:56.140 --> 51:58.140
Then you use ELMA

51:58.140 --> 52:00.140
Observe this sky

52:00.140 --> 52:02.140
In fact, this example is just right

52:02.140 --> 52:04.140
This is not

52:04.140 --> 52:06.140
Like this picture is

52:06.140 --> 52:08.140
Observed by my group

52:08.140 --> 52:10.140
But ELMA is observed by other groups

52:10.140 --> 52:12.140
Then they just observe this area

52:12.140 --> 52:14.140
Then this red dot is equivalent to

52:14.140 --> 52:16.140
It corresponds to the same

52:16.140 --> 52:18.140
SCUBA-2 image

52:18.140 --> 52:20.140
This is the center of the source

52:20.140 --> 52:22.140
Then we have ELMA observation

52:22.140 --> 52:24.140
We get a much higher resolution image

52:24.140 --> 52:26.140
Just found this one

52:26.140 --> 52:28.140
In fact, it is three

52:28.140 --> 52:30.140
Submarine galaxies

52:30.140 --> 52:32.140
Then because our resolution is very poor

52:32.140 --> 52:34.140
Put them together

52:34.140 --> 52:36.140
OK

52:36.140 --> 52:38.140
OK

52:38.140 --> 52:40.140
Someone may ask you

52:40.140 --> 52:42.140
Why don't you use interference cloud

52:42.140 --> 52:44.140
Just observe

52:44.140 --> 52:46.140
Right

52:46.140 --> 52:48.140
Why use

52:48.140 --> 52:50.140
I just said

52:50.140 --> 52:52.140
SCUBA-2

52:52.140 --> 52:54.140
The reason is

52:54.140 --> 52:56.140
There are two

52:56.140 --> 52:58.140
Interference cloud observation

52:58.140 --> 53:00.140
Compared to

53:00.140 --> 53:02.140
SCUBA-2

53:02.140 --> 53:04.140
Their observation is

53:04.140 --> 53:06.140
Observationally a lot more expensive

53:06.140 --> 53:08.140
The cost is higher

53:08.140 --> 53:10.140
OK

53:10.140 --> 53:12.140
Then the field of view is different

53:12.140 --> 53:14.140
The field of view is

53:14.140 --> 53:16.140
It can be

53:16.140 --> 53:18.140
Includes

53:18.140 --> 53:20.140
The size of the area is different

53:20.140 --> 53:22.140
I use SCUBA-2 today

53:22.140 --> 53:24.140
I use JCMP's SCUBA-2 camera

53:24.140 --> 53:26.140
I can observe

53:26.140 --> 53:28.140
I can observe such a large area at a time

53:28.140 --> 53:30.140
OK

53:30.140 --> 53:32.140
But if I use interference cloud

53:32.140 --> 53:34.140
Interference cloud

53:34.140 --> 53:36.140
Not for this thing

53:36.140 --> 53:38.140
Interference cloud is suitable for

53:38.140 --> 53:40.140
Observe individual sources

53:40.140 --> 53:42.140
Then it can only observe a small area at a time

53:42.140 --> 53:44.140
That is to say

53:44.140 --> 53:46.140
SCUBA-2 and interference cloud

53:46.140 --> 53:48.140
These two things

53:48.140 --> 53:50.140
Their purpose is different

53:50.140 --> 53:52.140
So why do I say

53:52.140 --> 53:54.140
SCUBA-2 is the most efficient way

53:54.140 --> 53:56.140
Because SCUBA-2

53:56.140 --> 53:58.140
Although the resolution is poor

53:58.140 --> 54:00.140
But it is

54:00.140 --> 54:02.140
It can have a relatively large

54:02.140 --> 54:04.140
Observation area

54:04.140 --> 54:06.140
So it can be effective

54:06.140 --> 54:08.140
To scan the entire sky

54:08.140 --> 54:10.140
Scan a large area

54:10.140 --> 54:12.140
OK

54:12.140 --> 54:14.140
So it is still the most effective

54:14.140 --> 54:16.140
To scan a large area

54:16.140 --> 54:18.140
Then find the source

54:18.140 --> 54:20.140
Then when we find these individual sources

54:20.140 --> 54:22.140
We use interference cloud

54:22.140 --> 54:24.140
To separate

54:24.140 --> 54:26.140
We use interference cloud

54:26.140 --> 54:28.140
To follow up

54:28.140 --> 54:30.140
Then get it

54:30.140 --> 54:32.140
Higher resolution

54:32.140 --> 54:34.140
This is the effective way of observation

54:34.140 --> 54:36.140
So basically the two of them

54:36.140 --> 54:38.140
The purpose is not the same

54:38.140 --> 54:40.140
Because it can only scan a small area at a time

54:40.140 --> 54:42.140
So if you want to scan a large area

54:42.140 --> 54:44.140
You have to observe

54:44.140 --> 54:46.140
Observe here, observe there

54:46.140 --> 54:48.140
Do a lot

54:48.140 --> 54:50.140
To the sky

54:50.140 --> 54:52.140
To a lot of different areas

54:52.140 --> 54:54.140
Then there is a way to put it together

54:54.140 --> 54:56.140
Such a large area

54:56.140 --> 54:58.140
This is very inefficient

54:58.140 --> 55:00.140
OK

55:00.140 --> 55:02.140
Speaking of this

55:02.140 --> 55:04.140
Do you have any questions

55:04.140 --> 55:06.140
I have a question

55:06.140 --> 55:08.140
You just said

55:08.140 --> 55:10.140
Interference cloud basically uses a lot of

55:10.140 --> 55:12.140
Small

55:12.140 --> 55:14.140
What is it called in Chinese?

55:14.140 --> 55:16.140
antenna

55:16.140 --> 55:18.140
antenna

55:18.140 --> 55:20.140
These antennas must be

55:20.140 --> 55:22.140
Gathered at the same point

55:22.140 --> 55:24.140
Or distributed well

55:24.140 --> 55:26.140
Even a few hundred miles

55:26.140 --> 55:28.140
Can also be distributed well

55:28.140 --> 55:30.140
Like my picture

55:30.140 --> 55:32.140
Usually interference cloud

55:32.140 --> 55:34.140
It has different configurations

55:34.140 --> 55:36.140
Will follow you

55:36.140 --> 55:38.140
The purpose observed by astronomers

55:38.140 --> 55:40.140
To adjust its configuration

55:40.140 --> 55:42.140
Usually you want to hear

55:42.140 --> 55:44.140
What is the so-called extended configuration

55:44.140 --> 55:46.140
Compact configuration

55:46.140 --> 55:48.140
Subcompact

55:48.140 --> 55:50.140
That means they have

55:50.140 --> 55:52.140
Spread it widely

55:52.140 --> 55:54.140
So it can be moved

55:54.140 --> 55:56.140
Yes, it can be moved

55:56.140 --> 55:58.140
Basically, the wider you spread

55:58.140 --> 56:00.140
Your resolution will be better

56:00.140 --> 56:02.140
Because the wider you spread

56:02.140 --> 56:04.140
Effectively

56:06.140 --> 56:08.140
The farther they are

56:08.140 --> 56:10.140
It's like you build a very large network

56:10.140 --> 56:12.140
Let you have low increase

56:12.140 --> 56:14.140
The wider you spread

56:14.140 --> 56:16.140
Your resolution is higher

56:16.140 --> 56:18.140
It is possible

56:18.140 --> 56:20.140
Different countries

56:20.140 --> 56:22.140
Antennas can also be formed

56:22.140 --> 56:24.140
Such a set

56:24.140 --> 56:26.140
Because this has been done for a long time

56:26.140 --> 56:28.140
This has been done for a long time

56:28.140 --> 56:30.140
Is

56:30.140 --> 56:32.140
Different wavelengths

56:32.140 --> 56:34.140
Like this

56:34.140 --> 56:36.140
A long time ago

56:36.140 --> 56:38.140
VLBI

56:38.140 --> 56:40.140
Very Large Baseline Intergalactic

56:40.140 --> 56:42.140
It

56:42.140 --> 56:44.140
But its wavelength is not

56:44.140 --> 56:46.140
The wavelength we are discussing today

56:46.140 --> 56:48.140
I believe that

56:48.140 --> 56:50.140
If I remember correctly, it should be longer

56:50.140 --> 56:52.140
That VLBI

56:52.140 --> 56:54.140
It's all over the world

56:54.140 --> 56:56.140
The antenna

56:56.140 --> 56:58.140
I remember the United States

56:58.140 --> 57:00.140
There is one in Arizona

57:00.140 --> 57:02.140
There is one in Hawaii

57:02.140 --> 57:04.140
A little more east

57:04.140 --> 57:06.140
I forgot

57:06.140 --> 57:08.140
Then it's all over the world

57:08.140 --> 57:10.140
So its baseline

57:10.140 --> 57:12.140
So the baseline

57:12.140 --> 57:14.140
I forgot to say

57:14.140 --> 57:16.140
Interferometry will talk about the name of the baseline

57:16.140 --> 57:18.140
Baseline is basically the distance between the antenna and the antenna

57:18.140 --> 57:20.140
The VLBI I just said

57:20.140 --> 57:22.140
Its baseline is very long

57:22.140 --> 57:24.140
Because it is equivalent to

57:24.140 --> 57:26.140
The size of the whole earth

57:26.140 --> 57:28.140
Baseline

57:28.140 --> 57:30.140
So it can do very high resolution

57:30.140 --> 57:32.140
A kind of observation

57:34.140 --> 57:36.140
Thank you

57:40.140 --> 57:42.140
So I just said

57:42.140 --> 57:44.140
Our single dish

57:44.140 --> 57:46.140
There are two questions

57:46.140 --> 57:48.140
The first one is that my resolution is very poor

57:48.140 --> 57:50.140
So I'm going to use interferometry

57:50.140 --> 57:52.140
To do more follow-up observations

57:52.140 --> 57:54.140
The other question is that I just said

57:54.140 --> 57:56.140
There will also be a detection limit

57:58.140 --> 58:00.140
How do I solve this?

58:00.140 --> 58:02.140
This is what my thesis is doing

58:02.140 --> 58:04.140
How do I solve this problem?

58:04.140 --> 58:06.140
Is to use so-called gravity

58:06.140 --> 58:08.140
OK

58:08.140 --> 58:10.140
I don't know how many of these listeners are studying physics

58:10.140 --> 58:12.140
If you are not studying physics

58:12.140 --> 58:14.140
You may have heard of it for the first time

58:14.140 --> 58:16.140
The so-called gravity is Einstein's relativity

58:16.140 --> 58:18.140
That is to say

58:18.140 --> 58:20.140
If there is gravity, it will cause time-space distortion

58:20.140 --> 58:22.140
Time-space distortion

58:22.140 --> 58:24.140
Time-space distortion will cause

58:24.140 --> 58:26.140
When the light passes through a gravitational field

58:26.140 --> 58:28.140
It will turn

58:28.140 --> 58:30.140
So it's like a透鏡

58:30.140 --> 58:32.140
Like a 突透鏡

58:32.140 --> 58:34.140
Have you ever played 突透鏡 when you were a kid?

58:34.140 --> 58:36.140
突透鏡 can gather light

58:36.140 --> 58:38.140
You can gather the light of the sun

58:38.140 --> 58:40.140
And then you can burn a paper on the ground

58:40.140 --> 58:42.140
So 突透鏡 has the effect of gathering light

58:42.140 --> 58:44.140
Or you can say

58:44.140 --> 58:46.140
It can make something darker

58:46.140 --> 58:48.140
After passing through your 突透鏡

58:48.140 --> 58:50.140
It looks brighter

58:50.140 --> 58:52.140
So

58:52.140 --> 58:54.140
Gravity can have this effect

58:54.140 --> 58:56.140
Because it can gather light

58:56.140 --> 58:58.140
So we often use gravity in astronomy

58:58.140 --> 59:00.140
To study very distant stars

59:00.140 --> 59:02.140
Very distant stars

59:02.140 --> 59:04.140
When you

59:04.140 --> 59:06.140
Suppose we observe a very distant galaxy here

59:06.140 --> 59:08.140
We are here

59:08.140 --> 59:10.140
But then just assume we are here

59:12.140 --> 59:14.140
There is a galaxy cluster in the middle of the light path

59:14.140 --> 59:16.140
Galaxy cluster

59:16.140 --> 59:18.140
Galaxy cluster is a lot of galaxies

59:18.140 --> 59:20.140
They are clustered together

59:20.140 --> 59:22.140
Galaxy cluster is

59:22.140 --> 59:24.140
In this universe

59:24.140 --> 59:26.140
It is the

59:26.140 --> 59:28.140
The largest

59:28.140 --> 59:30.140
Bound system

59:30.140 --> 59:32.140
Gravitationally bound system

59:32.140 --> 59:34.140
The quality of the galaxy

59:34.140 --> 59:36.140
Usually 10 to 14

59:36.140 --> 59:38.140
15

59:38.140 --> 59:40.140
Because its quality is very, very large

59:40.140 --> 59:42.140
So the galaxy must have

59:42.140 --> 59:44.140
Very strong gravity

59:44.140 --> 59:46.140
So they

59:46.140 --> 59:48.140
Can be used as a 突透鏡

59:48.140 --> 59:50.140
So these backgrounds

59:50.140 --> 59:52.140
These distant galaxies will be

59:52.140 --> 59:54.140
The galaxy cluster

59:54.140 --> 59:56.140
After having this focus

59:56.140 --> 59:58.140
It will become brighter

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.140
So

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.140
Astronomers often use this technique

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.140
To observe very distant stars

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.140
Because very distant stars

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.140
Of course they will be darker

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:10.140
Because it's too far

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.140
But with the help of gravity

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.140
We can observe a brighter brightness

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.140
So it helps us

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:18.140
To study the early universe

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.140
OK

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.140
Hubble telescope

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.140
In the past few years

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.140
There was a program called FrontierField

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.140
FrontierField program

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.140
It picked

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.140
Six very bright galaxies

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.140
These six

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.140
Then

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.140
The Hubble telescope took pictures of these six galaxies

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.140
Very, very deep image

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.140
So there will be

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.140
A very beautiful visible image

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.140
So

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.140
The purpose of this FrontierField program

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.140
Is

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.140
To study very distant stars

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.140
It uses

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.140
The galaxy cluster as a focus

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.140
To study distant stars

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:00.140
So

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.140
In this picture

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.140
Let me show you

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.140
Like this

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.140
It's the galaxy cluster

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.140
The focus of the galaxy

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.140
But

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.140
There is a line here

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.140
These are all

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.140
After gravity

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.140
Distance star

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.140
In English, it's Lensed

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.140
They have been gravitated

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.140
Lensed

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.140
Distant star

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.140
If you are a physicist

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.140
You may have heard of Einstein ring

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.140
These are the so-called Einstein ring

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.140
Because it's a distant star

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.140
Then

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.140
After it's gravitated

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.140
We see it

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.140
Then we will see

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.140
A ring

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.140
The same

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.140
The shape

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.140
It's because it's a very distant star

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.140
After gravity

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.140
Okay

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.140
This is Hubble

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.140
FrontierField program

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.140
But what am I observing today?

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.140
I'm the girl up there

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.140
I'm the same

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.140
Because of this Hubble

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.140
This program

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.140
So my thesis is

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.140
I used my JCMP telescope

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.140
JCMP telescope has a scuba tube camera

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.140
Then I also went to shoot

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.140
A lot of galaxies

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.140
We shot a total of nine galaxies

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.140
Then include five FrontierField

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.140
That is

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.140
These five

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.140
Except for this

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.140
These five we shot

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.140
Why don't we shoot this?

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.140
Because of its coordinate

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.140
This galaxy is too difficult to make

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.140
It's too difficult to make in the sky

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.140
But our JCMP

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.140
It's in Hawaii and it's in the North Pole

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.140
So it can't shoot this

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.140
So we only shoot these five

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.140
So I said including five FrontierField

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:52.140
So

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.140
We use the effect of gravity

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.140
So we use the effect of gravity

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.140
We do sub-millimeter observation

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.140
So I just said this question

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.140
TooManyGenski

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:06.140
This limit problem can be solved

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.140
Why? Because if we have the effect of gravity

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.140
We observed

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.140
The limit of the observation brightness

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.140
It's still TooManyGenski

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:16.140
But these

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.140
TooManyGenski

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.140
It was actually darker

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.140
It is today

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.140
After the effect of gravity

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.140
After the effect of gravity

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.140
But in fact we see

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.140
Better than this limit

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.140
Darker than this limit

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.140
Sub-millimeter Galaxy

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.140
That is to say, we use the effect of gravity

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.140
We can observe

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.140
Darker than the brightness of 10

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.140
These Galaxy

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.140
OK

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.140
Then there is

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.140
Today we use sub-millimeter

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.140
Observe these

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.140
There is another benefit

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.140
That is

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.140
If you observe today

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.140
It's a visible wave segment

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.140
Like this

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.140
In this image

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.140
Galaxy cluster

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.140
And those background information

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.140
Like these one by one

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.140
So you have to find a way to distinguish them

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.140
If you want to study

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.140
High-resolution Galaxy

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.140
But if you observe

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.140
Sub-millimeter

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:20.140
There will be no problem

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.140
If you observe sub-millimeter

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.140
These gravity sensors are basically transparent

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.140
Why?

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.140
Galaxy cluster

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.140
Most of them are elliptical Galaxy

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.140
These elliptical Galaxy are very old

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.140
Very old Galaxy

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.140
They don't have star formation

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.140
No star formation

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.140
And they don't have dust

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.140
So these elliptical Galaxy

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.140
They basically don't emit

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.140
Far infrared light

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.140
They basically don't emit

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.140
Far infrared emission

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.140
They don't have dust emission

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.140
In addition, these stars

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.140
Their redshift is about 0.5

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.140
0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.140
So even if they have

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.140
Far infrared emission

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.140
They won't go to sub-millimeter

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.140
So the conclusion is

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:10.140
The conclusion is

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.140
These Galaxy clusters

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.140
They don't emit sub-millimeter

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.140
So when you are shooting this star

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.140
Then you use sub-millimeter

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.140
To observe

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.140
You see any

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.140
You see any of these sources

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.140
They are basically background

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:28.140
They are all emitted from a very distant universe

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.140
Not the star itself

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.140
Because I just said

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.140
The elliptical Galaxy in the star

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.140
They don't emit far infrared emission

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.140
So this is a very neat thing

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.140
You don't have to

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.140
Not like you are in visible light

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.140
You still have to distinguish

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.140
The background and the cluster itself

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.140
So these two pictures

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:50.140
Basically my

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.140
This is how it looks

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.140
And then

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:56.140
This blue and red area

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.140
It's basically the Hubble telescope

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:00.140
The area that has been observed

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.140
OK

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.140
So why do we

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.140
We have to observe these redshift stars

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.140
Because the Hubble telescope

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.140
Get these areas of very deep visible light

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.140
Then we also use sub-millimeter to shoot

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.140
We can find these

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.140
Sub-millimeter sources

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.140
And then we need to

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.140
We can also go to the Hubble telescope

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.140
To find the counterpart

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.140
It's in visible light

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.140
Right

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.140
It's not just the Hubble telescope

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.140
It also has other telescopes

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.140
That is to say

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.140
These areas are very rich

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.140
Very rich

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.140
Observations

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.140
What we do today

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.140
We are also in the area

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.140
We use

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.140
Sub-millimeter

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.140
Then the picture I showed today

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.140
The left is 450 micrometers

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.140
The right is 850 micrometers

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.140
Then we mainly use 850

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.140
Then today

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.140
The yellow circle

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:00.140
The circle

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.140
It's one by one

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.140
Sub-millimeter sources

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.140
Then this cluster

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.140
It's Abell 370

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.140
That's the one I just

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.140
One of the Hubble

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.140
Ok

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.140
Then

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.140
With this image

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.140
We can detect a lot of darker

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.140
Because I said that they were observed by us

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.140
So they are actually

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.140
Lower than our original

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.140
Sub-millimeter observation

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.140
Then we have to study these darker

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.140
What to do

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:40.140
Here is the explanation

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.140
The picture on the right

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.140
It's called

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.140
Sub-millimeter number count

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.140
The horizontal axis is 850 micrometers

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:54.140
The vertical axis is basically

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.140
Number density

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.140
That is

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.140
The number of sub-millimeter galaxies

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:02.140
The number of unit areas

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.140
Then divided by

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.140
Unit brightness

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.140
So its unit is like this

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.140
Because it is the number divided by

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.140
Area divided by

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:14.140
Flux

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:16.140
But basically it is

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.140
Number density per area per

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.140
Flux

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.140
If you measure it out, it's like this

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.140
Then

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.140
Usually we use this model

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.140
This is called Broken Power Law

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.140
Here is a Power Law

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.140
Here is another Power Law

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.140
Then today this red line

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.140
Is the Confusion Limit I just said

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.140
If I use JCMP to observe today

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.140
Our limit is this

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.140
Is this red line

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.140
OK, so if we observe

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.140
General sky area like this

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.140
These three are general sky areas

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.140
They are not sub-millimeter sky areas

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.140
We can only constrain this part

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.140
But if we observe today

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.140
These blue circles are all

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.140
Sub-millimeter sky areas

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.140
That is galaxy cluster

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.140
We can only observe the darker background

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.140
Sub-millimeter galaxy

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.140
Because they are lensed

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.140
We can also have

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.140
Measurement on the left side of the limit

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.140
So we can constrain

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.140
This part that we couldn't observe

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.140
OK

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:24.140
This picture is very basic

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.140
The darker it is, the higher the density

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.140
This is why the dark

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.140
Sub-millimeter galaxy is important

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.140
We used to have this limit

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.140
We can only observe this part of the sub-millimeter galaxy

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.140
But in fact, the dark galaxy is more

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.140
The density of the dark galaxy is more than that of the bright galaxy

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:42.140
That is to say

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.140
In this universe

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:46.140
You have to study

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.140
We are studying

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.140
Cosmic Star Formation History

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.140
Then I want to study

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.140
Dusty part

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.140
Dusty part

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.140
In this part

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.140
The dark sub-millimeter galaxy

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.140
Its contribution is far greater than

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.140
This brighter sub-millimeter galaxy

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.140
The reason is very simple

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.140
Because its density is higher

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.140
Although they are darker

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.140
So they contribute

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.140
If you only compare a single sub-millimeter galaxy

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.140
Then one is bright and one is dark

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:18.140
Of course the darker one

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:20.140
Will be less than a brighter one

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.140
But because

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:24.140
You are a power law

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.140
Its number density is a function of flux

01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:28.140
Is a power law

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.140
Darker

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:32.140
Its number is much more than the bright ones

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.140
So in general

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.140
Dark sub-millimeter galaxy

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.140
Contribute star formation

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.140
Is much more than the bright ones

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:42.140
So they are important

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.140
Is there any problem here?

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.140
No

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.140
What about the picture on the left?

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.140
This is called

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.140
Star Formation Rate Density

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.140
But it also

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.140
Normalize itself

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.140
It is per

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:02.140
Star Formation Rate

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.140
The horizontal axis is the star formation rate

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:06.140
It is the star formation rate

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.140
How much solar mass is generated per year

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.140
Here is the star formation

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.140
Sorry

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.140
Here is the galaxy

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.140
Its number density

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.140
Per star formation rate

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.140
Log star formation rate

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.140
The picture is like this

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.140
The picture on the left

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.140
Is observed by optical

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.140
Optical

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.140
To get the curve

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:34.140
The curve on the right

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.140
Is observed by sub-millimeter

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.140
To get the curve

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.140
Then you will find

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.140
The population on the left

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.140
Is the optical environment

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.140
As I said

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.140
Because it is a redshift galaxy

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.140
Its redstripe is actually UB

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.140
OK

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.140
These

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:56.140
UVs

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.140
Or the optical samples

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.140
On the left

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.140
On the left

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.140
You will find these two populations

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.140
Here are different curves

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.140
From different papers

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.140
These two

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.140
These two populations

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:14.140
Almost do not overlap

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.140
Why do not overlap?

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.140
Because these

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.140
Can be directly observed by optical

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:22.140
Because the star formation rate

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:24.140
Is not so high

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.140
Because usually the more dusty

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.140
The more dusty

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.140
The higher the star formation rate

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.140
Usually like this

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.140
So these sub-millimeter samples

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.140
They are very dusty galaxies

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.140
Although they are all on the right

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.140
Their star formation rate is very high

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.140
Then there is the confusion limit

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.140
I just said

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.140
Your sub-millimeter sample is limited to

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:48.140
The single digit limit

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.140
And these other visible light waves

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.140
Their samples overlap

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.140
So what we want to do today is

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.140
I use gravity

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.140
I can observe the darker

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.140
Sub-millimeter

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.140
Sub-millimeter galaxies

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.140
This red line and this red line

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.140
Basically correspond

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.140
I have gravity

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.140
I want to let the curve on the right

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.140
Extend to the left

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.140
Is to extend my sub-millimeter sample

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.140
Extend to the left

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.140
Let my sub-millimeter sample

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.140
With these visible light observed samples

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.140
Can overlap

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.140
Then after the overlap

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.140
The most important thing comes

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.140
I

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.140
I have observed

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.140
After this sub-millimeter sample

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.140
The question I want to ask is

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.140
In this place

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.140
I put this sample to the left

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:40.140
My sub-millimeter galaxy

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.140
In this place

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.140
Is it these

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:46.140
These visible light

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.140
Can see the galaxy

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.140
Are they the same thing?

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.140
Or is it completely different?

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:54.140
Part is the same, part is the same

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:56.140
Part is the same, part is different

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.140
This thing is very important, why?

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.140
Because we are

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:02.140
Establish, we are measuring our universe

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.140
Star formation history

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.140
I just said that there are two populations in the universe

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.140
These two populations are very important

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.140
One is directly observed by visible light

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.140
One is to use long-wave long-wave red light

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.140
These two samples

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.140
We can measure their

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.140
Star formation history contribution to our universe

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.140
OK

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.140
Both are important

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.140
Because there are two populations

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.140
We have to combine them together

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.140
Is the total star formation in our universe

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:30.140
OK

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.140
Then we can draw

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.140
The picture I just drew in the first page

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.140
Is the star formation history of the universe

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.140
We have to put these two observations

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.140
Combine together

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.140
But today

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.140
When we extend the sub-minimum sample here

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:46.140
Then we have to know

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.140
Are these sub-minimum samples

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.140
These sub-minimum samples

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.140
These sub-minimum galaxies

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.140
Is it already

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.140
Included in these samples

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.140
Right

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.140
In case we observe

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.140
We extend this sample here

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.140
Then in case these sub-minimum galaxies

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:06.140
In this place

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.140
Sub-minimum galaxies

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.140
Already included in these UV

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:12.140
These visible light samples

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.140
Then we just

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:16.140
We don't have to do it anymore

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.140
Because there is no need to

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.140
Study those darker sub-minimum galaxies

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.140
Because those darker sub-minimum galaxies

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.140
Basically it's you

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:26.140
Those galaxies selected by visible light

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.140
It's the same thing

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.140
Why do we have to go to Africa

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.140
To use more difficult

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.140
Long-wave long-wave observation to study them

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.140
Because it's the same thing

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.140
In fact

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.140
On the contrary

01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:42.140
In case these sub-minimum galaxies

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.140
In this part of the sub-minimum galaxies

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.140
Not all

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.140
Already included in this sample

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.140
Then we have to know

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.140
OK

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:54.140
How many fractions are already included in it

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:56.140
How many fractions are not included

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.140
That is to say

01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.140
We want to know how many fractions

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:02.140
In this part of the sub-minimum galaxy

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:04.140
We can directly see the visible light

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.140
How much is still visible

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.140
Still can't see

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.140
We have this information

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:12.140
After we quantize it

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:14.140
We can accurately put

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.140
This UV sample

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:18.140
The visible light sample

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.140
Contribute to the star formation

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.140
And our sub-minimum sample

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:24.140
Contribute to the star formation

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.140
Add them up

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.140
Because if these two samples today

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.140
Are completely independent

01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:32.140
Then just add them up

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:34.140
When they overlap

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.140
This part may not be completely independent

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.140
But it may not be completely dependent

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.140
So we have to know

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.140
How many fractions are overlapping

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.140
How many sub-minimum sources

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:46.140
It is actually also in the UV

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.140
Will see

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.140
This is why

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:52.140
Study the darker sub-minimum galaxy

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.140
Very important

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.140
We want to know

01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:58.140
How many of them

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:00.140
Already included in the rest-frame UV sample

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.140
So we can accurately

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:04.140
To measure

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:06.140
The star formation of our entire universe

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.140
Another important reason is

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.140
Because we found

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:12.140
In the past, these sub-minimum galaxies

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.140
Hello

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:16.140
I have a question

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:20.140
Can't hear

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.140
My question is

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.140
If you put them

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.140
Extend

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.140
I use typing

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.140
You can talk while typing

01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.140
Because after typing, I have to quit to see

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.140
Can you hear me

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.140
Hello

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.140
Sorry

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:54.140
I accidentally pressed you to leave

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.140
So you're back

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.140
Yes

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.140
My question is

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.140
Can you hear me

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:10.140
If you extend

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:12.140
If it's different

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.140
You know it's different

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.140
But if you extend and overlap

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.140
How do you know it's the same

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.140
Maybe it's still different

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.140
The so-called difference means

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:24.140
Suppose I detect

01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:28.140
Suppose I detect

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:30.140
Some darker

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.140
Sub-minimum galaxies

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:52.140
I detect some darker

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.140
Sub-minimum galaxies

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:56.140
Their star formation rate

01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.140
Can you hear me

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:04.140
I detect some darker

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.140
Sub-minimum galaxies

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.140
Their star formation rate

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.140
What I want to do is

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.140
Very simple

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:14.140
What I want to do is

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.140
Like this

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.140
Like this

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:26.140
What I want to do is very simple

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.140
Suppose I have a sub-minimum galaxy

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.140
Darker than this

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.140
Then I use the interferometer

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.140
To accurately measure its position

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.140
Then I go to the visible wave field

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:38.140
That is the Hubble telescope

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.140
Or other telescope

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:42.140
To find out if it corresponds to

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.140
The visible counterpart

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.140
When you have a visible counterpart

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.140
And it's a very obvious counterpart

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:52.140
It means

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:54.140
It is

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.140
It is this kind of galaxy

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.140
It is the galaxy found in the visible wave field

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.140
On the contrary, if you

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.140
Basically

01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:06.140
This kind of galaxy

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:08.140
If you find it has a visible emission

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.140
It means

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.140
It is this kind of galaxy

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.140
It is this kind of galaxy

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.140
I'm talking about

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.140
Statistically

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.140
Not a galaxy

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:22.140
I'm not talking about

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:24.140
A sub-minimum galaxy

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.140
Is it a galaxy in a paper

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.140
Is it a galaxy in a paper

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.140
I'm talking about

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.140
Statistically

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:34.140
Can a sub-minimum galaxy

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.140
Can a sub-minimum galaxy

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.140
Do you know what I mean?

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:40.140
So what you have to do is very simple

01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:42.140
You use the interferometer to accurately measure

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.140
The position of a sub-minimum

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.140
Then we go to the visible beam

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.140
To see if it emits light

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.140
Or if it is completely non-existent

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.140
That's it

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.140
I want to ask

01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:58.140
I see

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.140
I understand

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:02.140
I may have missed it

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.140
So in this way

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.140
The visible and non-visible light emitted by a star

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.140
The visible and non-visible light emitted by a star

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.140
The brightness of these two lights

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.140
There is no certain relationship

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.140
The so-called non-visible light

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:20.140
Is the sub-minimum we talked about

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.140
Is the sub-minimum we talked about

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:24.140
It's actually a little bit

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.140
I'll talk about it later

01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:28.140
Usually

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.140
It should be related

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.140
Of course

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:34.140
Because

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.140
Because it's with your

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.140
The amount of dust in the galaxy

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.140
The amount of dust in the galaxy

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:42.140
Does it matter?

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.140
How much dust

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.140
It's related, right?

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.140
It's related, right?

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.140
I'll talk about it later

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:52.140
Others are studying

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.140
A lower shift galaxy

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:56.140
I'll talk about it later

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.140
I'll talk about it later

01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:00.140
I'll continue

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.140
I hope I've convinced you

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.140
I hope I've convinced you

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.140
Why I'm studying the sub-minimum galaxy

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.140
Two things

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.140
I haven't talked about the second thing

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.140
The first thing is what I asked

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.140
The second thing is

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.140
The previous astronomers found

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:20.140
The bright sub-minimum galaxies

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.140
The brightness is brighter than the two-minimum galaxies

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.140
The brightness is brighter than the two-minimum galaxies

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.140
They are all very dusty

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:28.140
Very intense star forming galaxies

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.140
They are all very dusty very intense star forming galaxies

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:32.140
The green star forming galaxies

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.140
They are all very dusty

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.140
very intense star forming galaxies

01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.140
These sub-minimum galaxies

01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:40.140
These sub-minimum galaxies

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.140
They are all major mergers

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.140
They are all major mergers

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.140
They are conglomerates

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.140
They are conglomerates

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:50.140
They are conglomerates

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.140
You can look up

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:54.140
You can look up

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:56.140
The answer

01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:58.140
The answer

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.140
The answer is SMG

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.140
The answer is SMG

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:04.140
The answer is SMG

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.140
I forgot to mention

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.140
The darker stars are SMG

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.140
The darker stars are SMG

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.140
Are these also major mergers?

01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:14.140
Are these also major mergers?

01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.140
Or are they conglomerates?

01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:18.140
Or are they conglomerates?

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.140
They are not intense

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.140
They are not intense

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.140
Not major mergers

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:26.140
Not major mergers

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.140
They are isolated disks

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:30.140
These star formation data

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.140
These star formation data

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:34.140
are not major mergers

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:38.140
They are simple spiral galaxies

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.140
They are simple spiral galaxies

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.140
...

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.140
They are not that intense

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:46.140
They are not that intense

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.140
so their star formation rate is not that high

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:50.140
...

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:52.140
...
