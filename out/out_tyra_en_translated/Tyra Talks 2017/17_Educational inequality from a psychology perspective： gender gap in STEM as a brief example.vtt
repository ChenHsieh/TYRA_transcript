00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone, I am Zhang Yanyong, the host today.

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
We are very happy to invite Xie Dayang, Diane Xie, to talk to us about her field of research and her current research topic.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Diane's main field of research is psychology and education psychology.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
She is currently a second-year PhD student at UC Irvine.

00:30.000 --> 00:47.000
In the field of education psychology, Diane is particularly interested in how family, culture, and so on outside of school affect young people's motivation and results in school.

00:47.000 --> 01:01.000
Her topic today is Educational Inequality from a Psychology Perspective, Gender Gap in STEM as a Brief Example.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about gender in the Hollywood industry.

01:09.000 --> 01:17.000
Everyone has different views on gender recognition.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
We are very happy to invite Diane to talk to us about this topic.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that if you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone, otherwise you won't be able to hear me.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay, you can start.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
This is very interesting.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Thank you, Diane, for your introduction.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
It seems like I am very good at introducing myself, but I am actually not that good.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
I am very honored to share my research with everyone today.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I don't know if I can see six people today.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I will ask questions later.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
From the introduction of everyone, it seems that almost everyone is a science major.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
So I chose a topic that is more related to science in education psychology.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
It is about the inequality of education in STEM, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
As Diane said, this is one of the questions that I can answer in my research direction.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
I am currently in the second year of UCI Education College.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
Although I am in the Education College, the main research methods that I use and the methods that our professors and lab use are mainly from development psychology.

02:21.000 --> 02:34.000
In general, I study social culture, interpersonal relationships, activity experience, and other things that are greater than the individual.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
We call them social cultural factors.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
How to affect the psychological development of the individual, which is the second link,

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
individual psychological development, and then affect the behavior and cognition of the individual, etc.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
So this is a big direction.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
It sounds very mysterious and very broad.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
This is partly because my research has just started and I can't speak very professionally.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Also because my research has just started, so I will be very nervous today.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
If you find that I speak faster and faster or start to be biased,

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
you are welcome to interrupt me at any time to ask questions or tell me to speak slower or I don't make sense.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I won't be angry.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I really hope everyone will help me.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Okay, so let's get into today's topic.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
To start today's topic, I actually want to start with a question.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So if you can turn on the microphone, that would be great.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I just want to ask a very philosophical question.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Why are you here?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Specifically, why did you join Tyra?

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
Why did you choose a Saturday afternoon 3 o'clock and listen to some academic sharing here?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Why did you choose to get a Ph.D.?

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Why did you choose to enter the academic circle with so many potential opportunities?

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Does anyone want to share why?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Does anyone want to speak first?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Count to 10.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
If no one wants to speak first, I will demonstrate.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Okay, 1, 2, 3, 10.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I will demonstrate first.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Why did I join Tyra?

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
I think this question is more like why I decided to join Tyra.

04:24.000 --> 04:32.000
I think this has to do with why I chose to get a Ph.D. and why I chose to stay in the academic circle.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I think there's a very important reason.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
It's because I think...

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
I thought about the reasons behind it.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Why is it like this?

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
I thought about it and found new things.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Then I threw it back to solve the problem I was facing.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
If I succeeded, I felt very accomplished.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
So I hope I can continue to use this to do what I want to do in my life.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
So I will stay in the academic circle.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Of course, the condition of staying in the academic circle is to get a Ph.D.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
Also, Tyra, to a certain extent, started from this motivation.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
How should I put it?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
If I can communicate with others and have more ideas,

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
then I can think about the problems I'm facing and solve them.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Then I can get this kind of feeling.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Something like that.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Anyone else wants to speak?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Don't just let me speak.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Don't be shy.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Can I speak?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Hello, can you hear me?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm Chi Chi.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Can you hear me clearly?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Why did I join Tyra?

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
Because I'm quite interested in interdisciplinary learning.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
In the past, most of the people I met were interdisciplinary learners.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
So I thought it was interesting.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
But I wasn't very active.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I only participated in a few programs.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Actually, today is the second program.

06:18.000 --> 06:26.000
Because I didn't quite understand the topic.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
So it was a bit difficult.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
But now I'm trying to develop.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
I think my purpose is simple.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
I hope I can be a public intellectual.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
So what I write and talk can be heard by people from different fields.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Because my learning background in the past has made me narrow.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
Because the people I talk to are all from the same field.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
So I don't think I have the opportunity to talk to people from different fields.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
So I participated in this activity.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
On the one hand, I'm curious about things in different fields.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
On the other hand, I hope to communicate with different people.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
I can think about how to make people from different fields understand what I'm studying.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Thank you very much.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Does anyone else want to share?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I'll talk about it.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Hello everyone, my name is Qiyun.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
I wanted to join Taira because I thought the plan was a bit cool.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
I can use the Internet and hear that everyone is Taiwanese.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
And research in different fields.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Why do I want to get a PhD?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Mainly because I'm interested in my major.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I do math.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
And I want to keep doing research.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So I have to get a PhD.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
That's about it.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Thank you very much.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Anyone else wants to share?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Okay, I'll assume this is a no.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
I started with this question because I've always been interested in this topic.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I just wanted to hear everyone talk about it.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
The second is to bring everyone into the topic I'm going to talk about today.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Education.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Education.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
From what I just heard, we give it a lot of value.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Like someone said, I hope what I do today will be more valuable in the future.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Or I hope what I do today will be more valuable in the future.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
So I see it mainly as knowledge and strength.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
We can see that we believe that education is a positive thing.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Just like what I just shared, it's almost all positive.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
But if my question is why I want to get a PhD.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
You can also say that I lost something in the past few years.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
But no one said that.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
This gives a very positive value.

09:11.000 --> 09:19.000
This is a very common idea that people don't even question.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Education can give us a better future.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So we want to learn.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Everyone has already gotten a PhD.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't need to say that everyone is the best example.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
So if we want to look at the value we give to education.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
If we look at the level of education alone and the so-called successful indicators.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
For example, income.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
We can see a very beautiful straight line.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
If we look at education and unemployment rate.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
We see a beautiful inverse relationship.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
It seems that education can really bring social mobility.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
The so-called opportunity to climb up.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Just like this picture next to it.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
This is a very strong idea.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Just like I just said.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
We give education a very just value.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
So it's not hard to see that we put a lot of resources into education.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
For example, this year the United States allocated nearly $700 million to the Department of Education.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
If we look at the state level.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Take California as an example.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
The cost of education is actually greater than human resource health.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
It is also far greater than the cost of judicial administration or natural resource protection.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
So this is just a quick introduction to the topic I want to talk about today.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Everything sounds very reasonable at the moment.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Because education is a channel for everyone to climb up.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
So society should ensure that everyone gets equal education opportunities.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
That's why we can see the role of the state government is to invest money in education.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
This is also a very tempting idea.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Since education is a chance to turn around.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
We can say that we give education to the disadvantaged.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
They should climb up.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Education has become a tool to reduce inequality in society.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
I will talk about the topic of inequality today.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Although this idea is very tempting.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
But the problem is that if education itself is inequality.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Then it may amplify inequality in society.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Instead of reducing inequality.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Of course, we don't want to see the reduction of inequality.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
So the question for scholars is to ask.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Is education itself inequality?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
This is a big question.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
The short answer is yes.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Education is inequality.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
But inequality is very complicated.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
There are many reasons behind it.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
The second reason is that they are related to each other.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Let me give you an example.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
In the United States, the most discussed inequality in education is racial inequality.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
Specifically, it is the inequality between black and white people.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
If we look at this picture.

12:25.000 --> 12:34.000
The blue line is the performance of white children in mathematics.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
This is the performance of the ninth grade.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
We can see that the blue line is far higher than the black line.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
The orange line is the performance of Latin children.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
The green line.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
This is just one example.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
The same achievement gap can be seen at different ages.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
It can be seen in different subjects.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
I put a link below.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
This is just one of the research units tracking these data.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
To see how much racial inequality is now.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
To see if there is any improvement.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
From this picture, we can see that the X axis is the time.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
After so many years, there is still no improvement.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
The gap is still very large.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
Many people will start to think about the reason for this gap.

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
Of course, some people will wonder if it is because the resources of black children's schools are poor.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
It sounds like the racial discrimination of schools is outdated.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
It should not be abolished after the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Why do we still see such a big gap?

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
One of the reasons is that the reason just now is very good.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
But if we look at the data, we will find that there is still isolation.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
The fact is that most white children still go to schools for white children.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
Most black children still go to schools for black children.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
The schools that the latter go to are usually those schools that are less well-off.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
One of the people just said that schools are different now.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
We found that the problem of schools still exists.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Why does this problem still exist after so many years?

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
There are many reasons that are related to each other.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
For example, why is there a difference in schools?

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
One of the reasons is that there is a difference in income.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
On average, the income of black families is lower than that of white families.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
So the places they can live in are different.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
The places they live in are different, so the school district they go to is different.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
So if we put the income gap and the achievement gap together,

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
we will find that this is happening at the same time, and it is probably related to each other.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
So now things are getting more and more complicated.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
We just said that it may be because the schools are different.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
OK, now we find that their economic level is also different.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Then give another example.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
In addition to these two, we can also look at the family.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
If we add the family in, we will find that the parents' education level

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
also has a gap between black and white people.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
This gap and the achievement gap just now are also affecting each other.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
So now things are getting more and more complicated.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It's not just the school itself.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
There is also a problem with the inequality of income in the whole society.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Now we say that the parents' education level is also problematic.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
Sometimes I think it's a bit of a ghost gun.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It's a vicious cycle.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
For example, if there is a so-called gap in the family,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
you can imagine that the parents with a lower level of education

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
will naturally have fewer books at home.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Or they don't have those connections to participate in better extracurricular activities.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Then it leads to their next generation's poor income.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Then, as I said at the beginning, it's not about income, it's about education.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Then education is related to income.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Then it's like this, it's a vicious cycle.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
So I want to stop here.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Because I find that I speak faster and faster.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
It's probably because I'm getting more and more nervous.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And here...

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I actually just have a question.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Please say it.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
My question is like this.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
For example, the income gap or the education gap.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I may not have heard what you just said.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
What is its definition?

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
At least in this picture, what is the meaning of the gap?

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Because I don't quite understand why there are so many dots.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Is there no face?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
The dot is a week.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Every dot is a week.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Oh, the dot is a week.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
It's too exaggerated to put it on.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
So this should answer your question.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
As I said, the education gap is...

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Back to what I said at the beginning.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
Education is a tool that can help people climb up.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
But this gap means that some people climb higher, some people climb lower.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
And if we're talking about the racial achievement gap,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
white people climb higher, black people climb lower.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And if it's the income gap,

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
some people climb higher, some people climb lower.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
So...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Can I ask a question?

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
This is the first time I've seen this graph.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
What does it mean?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
The dots and the axis.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
What does that mean?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Right.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
That axis, that gap.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
For example, this graph is actually a combination of many graphs.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
The x-axis is talking about the income gap.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Each dot is a week.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
So if the income of white people in this week is twice as high as that of black people,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
then the x-axis is a 2.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
If it's higher...

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It starts from 0.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
So 0 and above mean that white people are higher than black people.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
And the achievement gap means that

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
the learning performance of white people is higher than that of black people.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
So there's a gap like this.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
This graph means that

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
these two gaps are related to each other.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
And it's a positive relationship.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
For example, if your income gap is high in the same week,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
then your learning performance gap will also be high.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Does that make sense?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Or is it getting more and more confusing?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Can I ask a question?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
So the circle means that each week is different.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And the diagonal line is the standard line.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
The middle line.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
And the x-axis is the income gap.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
What is the y-axis?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
The y-axis is talking about

19:26.000 --> 19:34.000
the gap between white people and black people.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
So you can see that the y-axis is all 0 and above.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
It means that every week,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
the average income of white people is higher than that of black people.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
And how much is higher

19:49.000 --> 19:57.000
is proportional to the gap between white people and black people.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
And the middle line is a standard line.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
It seems like someone wants to ask a question.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Go ahead.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
No, I just want to...

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Because I've seen this graph.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
But what I see is that

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
all the cities in the U.S.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
and then make a comparison.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
It's also racial inequity.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And then look at the gap between them.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
The gap between cities and schools is the biggest.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So the bigger the circle,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
it means that the city...

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
But in your graph, it's a state.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That state means that

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
the bigger the gap between the poor and the rich,

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
the bigger the circle.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And the smaller the circle means that

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
there's not much difference.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
But that's what I see in the graph.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
But you just said that

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
there's a lot of integration.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
So I don't know if it's because

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
American education, at least before K-12,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
was defined by property tax.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
So because of this,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
under the foundation of funding,

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
there will be the difference you just mentioned.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
The better the school district,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
if my parents can afford it,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
the better the school district.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Of course, the more resources I have here,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
the more money I have,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I can attract better teachers.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
But if I'm poor in this area,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I can't...

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Because this is a different education system from Taiwan.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It's the funding part.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
So there will be a gap like this.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Thank you for the supplement.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
And then I just said...

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
So this graph...

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Like you said,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
if you want to look for it,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
it's related to education

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
and the achievement gap.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
You can find any Y-axis

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
or X-axis you want.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
But I made this introduction

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
mainly to introduce

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
the concept of

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
inequality in education.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And then I want to say

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
that there are many reasons

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
behind inequality in education.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And those reasons are

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
the reasons that affect and interfere with each other.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
So to understand inequality in education,

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
you have to think about many aspects.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
And this is the conclusion I will come back to.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And then...

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
Like the example I just gave,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
if we only say that inequality in education

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
is because of the difference in school resources,

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
then we can say that

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
we will intervene.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
We take black children

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and take white children to school.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
This thing has indeed been done.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
But we will find that this is not enough.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Because you solve the difference in school hardware.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
But like we just said,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
there is still an income gap.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
So you have to solve

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
why the income gap

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
in this society is so big.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Of course, this is not enough.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Because we still haven't solved

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
the problem of parents' education level.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Do we have to give parents

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
some employment guidance, etc.?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
This is just...

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
to point out that

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
education should be a tool

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
to reduce inequality in society.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
If we can think of it this way,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I think it's a very tempting idea.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
But if we don't carefully measure

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
the social factors behind it,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
such as race, class, etc.,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
we may accidentally

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
cause more inequality.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So...

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I want to bring this into today's topic.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
My topic is

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
gender inequality in education.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
What kind of inequality

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
does gender social factors

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
have in education?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
So...

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I forgot to show this page.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I put it here.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
If you are interested in

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
finding out the picture

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
and reading it,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
you can pause the video

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
and go to the link above.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
But now...

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
I'm going to change it to

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
talk about the inequality of my topic today,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
which is inequality in gender and education.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
If we look at the 1960s,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
there was a time when

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
girls couldn't even go to college.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Of course, we're a long way from that time.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
A lot of things have happened in history,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
such as the rise of feminism, etc.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
We can see that the college degrees

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
and higher education degrees

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
that girls received

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
have been increasing.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
It's getting higher and higher.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Very good.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
If we look at the picture from 2016,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
we can see that

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
the degrees that girls received

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
are even higher than that of boys

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
in colleges and universities.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
So if we only look at

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
the effect of education,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
we can say that

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
gender inequality

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
has been reduced to a very small extent

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
compared to before.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
But today I still want to talk about this topic

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
because gender still has

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
an inequality in education.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
If we don't look at the education level,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
but look at what boys and girls are learning.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
So I'm going to summarize this data

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
and compare different subjects,

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
and I chose the university level,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
the university degrees given by different subjects

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
in 2015,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
and draw the proportion of girls in those degrees.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
So if we look at psychology,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
we can see that

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
77% of psychology graduates

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
are girls.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
So if we look at social science,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
in the middle,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
we can see that

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
half of the graduates are boys,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
and half of the graduates are girls.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
This picture is very interesting.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
You can look at any subject you are interested in.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
But one of the phenomena

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
is that if we look at the extreme level,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
we can see that

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
there are very few girls

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
in the red area.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
You will find that

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
they are all related to math,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
including math itself,

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
physical science, engineering, and CS.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Especially if you look at engineering and CS,

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
there are only less than 20% of girls,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
less than 20%.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
Compared to the rest of the subjects,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
it is very different.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
The phenomenon I saw today

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
is that in math,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
the number of boys is greater than the number of girls.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
I call it gender inequality in STEM.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
This phenomenon

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
has been studied by a lot of people.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
It is also a phenomenon that everyone cares about.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Because there are a lot of people

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
who are interested in this phenomenon.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
For example,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
there are a lot of people

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
who are interested in STEM.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
First of all,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
STEM has been very popular in the past few years.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Many countries want to push STEM.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
So you can imagine

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
if you don't let girls in,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
do you lose a lot of your potential?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
So now a lot of forces

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
want to push girls into STEM.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
So this phenomenon

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
has been studied by a lot of people.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I will briefly summarize

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
some of the phenomena

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
that have been studied in STEM.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
For example,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I divided this argument

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
into Nature and Nurture.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Of course,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
most people will choose

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
the point they want to stand

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
between the two.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
But if it is the Nurture side,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
they will argue that

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
boys and girls are not equal

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
in the field of math.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
This is a socialized phenomenon.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
For example,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
we have a stereotype

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
that boys study science

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
and girls study liberal arts.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
This leads us to treat

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
boys and girls differently.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
So it is a socialization process.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
We socialize based on gender.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
This is what we see today.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Other socialization processes,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
for example,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
when a child is just born,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
he is a boy,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
so we buy him a Lego.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
If he is a girl,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
we buy her a Lego.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
We socialize based on gender.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
This is what we see today.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Other socialization processes,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
for example,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
when a child is just born,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
he is a boy,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
so we buy him a Lego.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
If he is a girl,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
we buy her a Lego.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
This is what we see today.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Other socialization processes,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
for example,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
when a child is just born,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
he is a boy,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
so we buy him a Lego.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
If he is a girl,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
we buy her a Lego.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
This is what we see today.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Other socialization processes,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
for example,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
when a child is just born,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
he is a boy,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
so we buy him a Lego.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
This is what we see today.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Other socialization processes,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
for example,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
when a child is just born,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
he is a boy,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
so we buy him a Lego.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
This is what we see today.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Other socialization processes,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
for example,

29:30.000 --> 29:30.000


29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
he is a boy,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
so we buy him a Lego.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
This is what we see today.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Other socialization processes,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
for example,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
when a child is just born,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
he is a boy.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
This is what we see today.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
If you look at the above topics,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
family studies,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
psychology, education,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
you can study the gender inequality

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
in those areas.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
However,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
that is another group of people,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
or another topic,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
because you have to study

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
what is happening

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
in those areas.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
However,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
if there is no gender inequality,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
then all the people

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
in the picture are in the 50s.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Obviously not.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
This is what I want to talk about

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
today.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
The following topics

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
are related to math.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
So you mean

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
gender inequality

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
and inequality

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
of men

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
are two different things?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
If you are simply saying

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
that the conclusion is

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
different in numbers,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
of course it is the same.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
However,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
there are many reasons

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
behind the inequality.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
For example,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
in science,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
science is a subject

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
that men study.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
It is about science,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
not psychology.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
So if I use science

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
to explain psychology,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
that is not right.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
If I use psychology

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
to explain

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
gender inequality,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
that is not right.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Does that make sense?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Does that make sense?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Okay.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Okay.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Maybe you are right.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Now I want to talk about

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
nature.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
What I just said is

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
that the phenomenon

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
we see

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
is not caused by

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
individuals.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
It is caused by

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
external social factors.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Nature is saying

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
that the phenomenon

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
we see

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
is caused by

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
gender inequality.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Whether it is

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
the degree of math,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
or the attitude towards math,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
it is different.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
So we see

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
that

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
if everything

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
is socialized,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
after so many years,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
after so many years,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
why is there still a gap?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
It means that there is

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
an external force

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
to explain

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
this phenomenon.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
And if

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
there is only

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
socialization,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
then in a

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
gender-equal

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
society,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
we should see this reduction,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
but we don't.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
They also

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
say that

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
there is a difference

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
between

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
women and men.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Women prefer

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
human-to-human interaction.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
They also prefer

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
human-to-human interaction.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
So maybe it is not

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
because of math,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
but because women are

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
drawn to other areas,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
such as medicine,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
or architecture.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
So if we

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
look at the numbers

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and say that

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
we don't have 50%,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
then it is incorrect.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Because we shouldn't have

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
set 50% at the beginning,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
if women didn't want to

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
go into math.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It means that

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
although

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
there is no difference

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
in IQ

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
between men and women,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
on average,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
people don't say that

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
men are smarter than women.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
However,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
if you look at math,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
men are better at

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
problem solving and mental rotation

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
than women,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
and women are better at calculation.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
So if you look at

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
higher education,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
it is not about

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
basic calculation.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It is more about

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
problem solving

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
and mental rotation.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
At that time,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
you will see

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
the gender difference.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
At the end,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
both sides

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
will argue.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
For example,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
the last point,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
even if there is

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
a gender difference at the beginning,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
it is not over time.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
For example,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
when we take the exam,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
we focus on the so-called

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
math that men are good at.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
For example,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
when you interview people,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
you are looking at a specific

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
math talent.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
So even if there is

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
a gender difference,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
it is not over time.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
That's it.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I briefly covered

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
some points

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
about gender inequality

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
in math.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I also posted a video

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
about two psychologists

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
who were invited

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
to give a speech

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
for Nature.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Although it was not

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
a public speech,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
they gave a very

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
detailed and logical

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
speech.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
You can watch it

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
if you are interested.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
This list

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
can go on and on.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
There are many

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
possible explanations.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
At the beginning,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I said that

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
my research direction

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
is to see how social factors

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
affect personal development

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
and behavior.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
As I said,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
social factors affect

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
individuals,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I am more

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
on the side of Nature.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Next,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I will talk about

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
two projects I have done.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I will talk about

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
how they

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
discuss

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
how women

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
are more likely to

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
have more boys.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
As I said,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
social factors affect

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
individual psychological development

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
and behavior.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
In the middle,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
we need to identify

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
what we are interested in

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
in psychological development.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I chose to study motivation.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
This is a psychological factor.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I am interested in

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
how social factors

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
affect psychological factors.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
How does it affect

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
individual behavior?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
The concept of

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
learning motivation

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
is abstract.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Many different scholars

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
have discussed it.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
They use different theories

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
to define it.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Of course,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I can try different theories

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and start from different theories.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
The first project

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I want to introduce

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
is a simple theory.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
It is called

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Fixed Growth Mindset.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
The person who proposed this theory

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
wrote a book a few years ago.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It is very popular.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
This theory has been studied a lot.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
His theory

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
is very simple.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
He divided learning motivation

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
into two categories.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
The first one is

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Fixed Mindset.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
It means

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
whether you are good

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
in a certain subject.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Some people

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
don't have a good math brain.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
This is Fixed Mindset.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Or

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I am good at math.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Something like this.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
The second category

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
is Growth Mindset.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
It means

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
whether you are good

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
in a certain subject.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It depends on the person.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
If I am lazy today,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
no matter how smart I am,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
after a while,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
even if I am smart,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
if I am lazy,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I might

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
turn from a math person

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
to a non-math person.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Even if I am not good at math,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
if I work hard,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I might become a math person one day.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
It is a very simple concept.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
He proposed this

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
because he thinks

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
if we want to talk about

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
the outcome of math,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Growth Mindset

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
is healthier than Fixed Mindset.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Because

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
people always encounter setbacks.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
If you are a Fixed Mindset person,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
you can

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
put a label on yourself.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
For example,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
if I have a Fixed Mindset,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I am not a math person.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
So,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
it is less likely

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
to continue studying math.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
On the other hand,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
if you are a Growth Mindset person,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and you encounter setbacks,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
your

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
learning motive will tell you

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
that it doesn't matter

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
because you still have room for improvement.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
He proposed this

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
theory,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
and there are many

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
researches that show

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
that Growth Mindset

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
is healthier

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
than Fixed Mindset.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
It is also

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
better for future development.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
If we add in gender,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I can ask

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
if the reason why

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
we see fewer girls

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
entering science classes

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
is because

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
of the setbacks

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
we encountered

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
before higher education.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
If there are more

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Growth Mindset students,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
they can continue

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
entering higher education.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
So,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
we can see that

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
there are more boys

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
than girls.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
So,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
if we want to

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
improve our learning

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
motives,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
we need to

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
think about

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
how to

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
improve our learning

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
motives.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
we need to

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
think about

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
how to

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
improve our learning

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
motives.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
So,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
we need to

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
think about

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
how to

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
improve our learning

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
motives.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
So,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
we need to

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
think about

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
how to

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
improve our learning

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
motives.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
So,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
we need to

think about

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
how to

motives.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
So,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
we need to

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
So,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
we need to
