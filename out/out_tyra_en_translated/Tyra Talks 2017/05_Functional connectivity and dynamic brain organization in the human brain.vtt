WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Can you see me now?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Ok

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Can you see my screen now?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Yes?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Yes, yes, yes

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I will turn off my camera

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
So it will be smoother

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Ok

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Let me tell you

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
There are two more people here

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
One is here

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
One is over there

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
The camera may not be able to see

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
There are three people here

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
If they have any questions

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Don't be surprised if they are real people

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Sorry

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
There were some microphone issues

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
That's why we are delaying

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
The topic I am going to talk about

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
looks a bit

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
difficult to understand

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Functional connectivity and dynamics

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
and burn organization

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
In short

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
The main purpose of my research

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
is to look at the functional connections

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
between neural networks

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
The so-called functional connections

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
are the neural signals

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
generated by neurons

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
during activation

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
How these neural signals

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
are transmitted between different brains

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
This is the main thing

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I am going to talk about today

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I will divide it into two parts

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
The first part is introduction

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Introduction is a general

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
background idea

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
If you are not a neurologist

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
You need to know something

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
to make it easier for us to explain

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
This is one of the main research

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
The second part is

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
the current message

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It is about a

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
special project

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
The last part is all about that project

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
The first part is

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
a little bit

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
scientific

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
The second part is more about

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
that research

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I have seen

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
the comments

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Some people are just

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
talking about science

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
So I want to talk about

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
what is neuroscience

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I have seen

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
on the internet

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Neuroscience is a

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
comprehensive research

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It includes chemistry,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
medicine, physiology, medicine

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
even computer science and engineering

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
There are a lot of subjects

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
From the perspective of

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
modern neuroscience

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
There are

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
cells

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
and neurons

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
If you

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
enlarge the scale

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
There are cognitive science

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
and behavioral science

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Finally, there is transfer medicine

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
It is to apply the research

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
in the lab to clinical

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
If you want to

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
There are micro scale,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
mesoscale and macroscale

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
The last part is

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
about the research

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
The first part is

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
between neurons

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
The research topic is

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
between neurons

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Let me correct

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
The first part is

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
about single neurons

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
The second part is

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
between neurons

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
The last part is

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
between neurons

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
The biggest part

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
is what I have done

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
At the same time

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
What I have done

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
will cover the last part

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I will use

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
a simple sentence

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
It is about

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
neural connectivity

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
You will hear

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
functional connectivity

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It is about

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
the connectivity

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
of neurons

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
There is another point

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
We want to see

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
the connection of

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
human behavior

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
For example,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
their behavior

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
in clinical

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
or in cognitive science

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I will talk about

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
functional connectivity later

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I will talk about

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
functional connectivity later

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
For example,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
some of you

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
have studied psychology

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
or cognitive science

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You may have heard

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
some theory

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I will give you some examples

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
The left one is called localization

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
In short,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
scientists study

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
brain function

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
or human behavior

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
They want to

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
target some function

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
in a specific area

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
This is the result

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
of an FMRI

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
on the Internet

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
You can see

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
the three colored areas

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It means that

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
when the subject is doing something

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
the neurons in these three areas

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
are active

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
This is a more traditional theory

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
They think

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
they need to

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
classify

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
which brain area

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
is responsible for which function

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
The other one is called

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
distributed brain networks

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
These two schools

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
have been fighting for a long time

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
But recently

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
because of some new research methods

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
most people think

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
this is more like the human brain we expect

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
In this new school

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
their focus

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
is not on studying

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
a single brain area

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Instead,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
they focus on

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
the function between

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
different brain areas

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
For example,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
this brain area

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
may send a message

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
to this area

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
This area

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
may send a message

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
to this area

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
This area

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
may send a message

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
to this area

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
This is a way

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
for them to communicate

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
between neurons

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
This is a way

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
for them to communicate

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
between neurons

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
This is a way

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
for them to communicate

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
between neurons

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
About

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
how to study

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
and measure

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
functional connectivity

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
From statistics

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
from different areas

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
For example

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
This is a brain

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Let's say

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
you have 3 regions

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
1,2,3

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
The blue, red, and green lines

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
The blue, red, and green lines

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
are the time course

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
are the time course

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm using FMRI

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
This is the signal change

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
caused by the activation

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
of a neuron

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
FMRI is used as basic

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
FMRI is used as basic

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
ingredients for cooking

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
ingredients for cooking

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
When you get the signal

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
You can see the relation

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
between neurons

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You can use different machines

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You can use different machines

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
You can use different machines

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You can use different machines

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I used FMRI for my research

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I used FMRI for my research

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Every functional connectivity

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I use FMRI for my research

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I use FMRI for my research

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Time series

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I use FMRI for my research

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
If you have 3 regions

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
If you have 3 regions

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
The first step is

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
to extract the signal

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You start sending signals

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
You start sending signals

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
using different methods

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
to estimate the relation

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
to 2-3 brain regions

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
to estimate the relation

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
If you use Pairwise Correlation

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
You will see a lot of values

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
For example

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
This represents

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
the relation between

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Ri2 and Ri1

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
If they are positive

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
For example, this is about 0.5

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
For example, this is about 0.5

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
This means that this region

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and this region are connected

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
and this region and this region are connected

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Don't look at this

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Don't look at this

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
It means that you and yourself are connected

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
It means that you and yourself are connected

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
But this is not a normal situation

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
This is because we are calculating

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
After we get this evidence

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
After we get this evidence

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
We will force the line to 0

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
We will force the line to 0

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
This is the way we use

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
This is the way we use

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Of course, you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Of course, you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Many people use different methods

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
For example, Partial Correlation, Mutual Information

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Many people use different methods

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
There is no specific method

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
It depends on what you want to see

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
It depends on what you want to see

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It depends on what you want to see

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
After that

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
After that

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
After we get this evidence

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
We will be curious

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
What are we going to do next

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
After we get this evidence

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
We will be curious

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
There are too many signals

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
There are too many signals

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So, I am going to report on this data

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So, I am going to report on this data

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So we got the evidence

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
So we got the evidence

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
So we got the evidence

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
We have two main topics

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Now we have two main topics

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Let me answer a question

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Let me answer a question

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Let me tell you

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
If you have any questions

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
You can type it into the chat

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
You can type it into the chat

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and I will find time to answer

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Or I will tell you to check with the organization

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Or I will tell you to check with the organization

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And I will ask you the questions

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Because I can't see the chat

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Because I can't see the chat

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
So I don't know the questions

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
If you have any questions, you can ask

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
If you have any questions, you can ask

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Before we talk about graph theory

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Before we talk about graph theory

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Do you have any questions?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Do you have any questions?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
If not, let's continue

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
If not, let's continue

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
There is a little bit of abstraction

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Let me try

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Later we can continue to discuss

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Later we can continue to discuss

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It's intentional

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Describing the relationship between two points

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Describing the relationship between two points

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Describing the relationship between two points

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It is a very good tool

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
If you use graph theory

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
You can get a lot of different values

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Each value represents a specific feature of the network

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Each value represents a specific feature of the network

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
For example

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
We'll talk about some different values later

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Some values may represent

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
How well the signal is integrated in the entire brain

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
How well the signal is integrated in the entire brain

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Or how well it is integrated in a single system

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So there will be some different messages

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So there will be some different messages

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
When you do graph theory

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
There are two things that are very important

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
These are the two files you must get

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
The first one is Node

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
The other one is Edge

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Node is our so-called region of interest

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
For example, on the right

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
This is the data obtained by the actual receiver

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I have 36

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I have 36

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
So there are 36 areas of the brain

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
So there are 36 areas of the brain

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
So there are 36 areas of the brain

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
So there are 36 areas of the brain

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
One point to remember

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
One point to remember

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Each of those 36 types of dots

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Each of those 36 types of dots

Each of those 36 types of dots

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Each of these 36 types of dots

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Each of those 36 types of dots

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
The patient will be sent to the center of the machine.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Because the magnetic field in the center is more stable.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Then we start scanning.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
One thing you need to know is that

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
MRI has a very loud noise.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
So we put earplugs on the patient.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
To protect their hearing.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
In addition, it is a magnetic field.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
So there can't be any metal objects on the body.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
For example, keys, wallets, rings, etc.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
All have to be taken down.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Including women's underwear can also be brought in.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
So we always ask the cleaner to change clothes.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
This is the image we got.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
In principle, we do this kind of thing.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
We will scan two images.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
The most basic.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
One is called T1 Weighted Imaging.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
This is to provide you a structural image.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
You can see it clearly.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
This image will tell you which one is which.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Gray is gray.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
White is white.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The empty space in the middle is water.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
There is a spinal cord.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Brain.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
These two are eyeballs.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
The middle is the air.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
This image provides you with very clear structural information.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
In addition, we will scan the functional imaging.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
We call it Bolt Signal.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
It is written here.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
This image is physical observation.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
If you don't deal with it, you can't see anything.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
You can only see the middle is the CSF.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
You can't clearly define the brain.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Or gray and white.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
So when we analyze,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
The most important thing is to analyze this image.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
The principle of fMRI is quite complicated.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
This is what I have found so far.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I have seen the simplest and most powerful picture.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
I can introduce it to you.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
When the neural source is active,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
It needs oxygen, oxygen and blood.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Now the neural source is active.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
The blood vessels near the neural source begin to increase blood flow.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
Bring fresh oxygen blood cells to this place.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
You will find a lot of fresh blood coming here.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Because oxygen needs to enter the neural source.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Fresh blood will come.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
There are a lot of new oxygen here.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
When the oxygen-blood-red and oxygen-blood-red interact,

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
We can generate a signal.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Because fMRI is a strong magnetic field.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
We used to learn the Faraday's law.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Because of the change in the magnetic field, it will generate an electric signal.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
It will be received by the current.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
After a lot of image processing,

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
You will see this image.

36:49.000 --> 36:57.000
Because of the imbalance of oxygen-blood-red and oxygen-blood-red,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
It will generate a signal.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
So the picture we just talked about,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
The so-called Tom course,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
It's this thing.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
After we get this thing,

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
We can start the follow-up analysis.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Of course, the story is not that simple.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Because you can analyze from the signal to the magnetic field.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
There are a lot of things to do in the middle.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
For example, you have to correct the difference in time.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
And then correct the space difference.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Sometimes the brain will move like this.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You can't just take the data and analyze it.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You have to correct these things first.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
These things are called preprocessing.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I didn't talk too much today.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
The main thing is to let you know that you have to correct the difference in time and space.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
We will focus on the latter part.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
How do you analyze them?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Wait a minute.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
Did you have any questions about any image acquisition?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Can I ask a question?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Do you have any questions on the spot?

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
Did you get this picture on the spot?

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
You got this picture when you did it.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Then you turn it like this.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
Then you turn it into this picture.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
After sending this picture in, it will give you this.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
You have to set a few points on the picture.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Then it will find it.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Otherwise, how do you know how many pictures are there?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Okay.

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
He asked if we get this picture from here to here.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Basically, how do you get there?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Yes.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Because I omitted a lot of things.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
So I'm going to talk about it now.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
If we process it in our lab, we will get this T1 and BOL signal.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
Then we will throw T1 into a software called FreeSurfer.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
The purpose is to do so-called cortical postulation.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
That's why we get those R1, R2, R3, R4.

38:47.000 --> 38:55.000
We take this T1, which means we label each brain area and give it an ID.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
Then we do the pre-processing of the image obtained by the fMRI.

39:00.000 --> 39:07.000
After the pre-processing, we have to put the T1 with the label and the pre-processed fMRI in place.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Because they say that the victim's head won't move too much.

39:11.000 --> 39:23.000
But we still have to put these two images in place to ensure that the area we see on the T1 is the same area on the fMRI.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
So this placement is very important.

39:25.000 --> 39:34.000
After we put T1 and fMRI in place, we tell the software that we first define how many RIs you want from T1.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
If there are 100, I tell the computer that I want 90.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
Then I list all the 90 IDs.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
There is a step called Time Course Extraction.

39:46.000 --> 39:53.000
After we put these two IDs in place, I tell the software to extract the time course of the 90 RIs.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
For example, the first RI is here.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
I extract the time course of this RI.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
The second RI is here.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I extract the time course of this RI.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It's like this.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
How big is the RI?

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
It depends on how you do the protocol postulation.

40:14.000 --> 40:21.000
Basically, the resolution of this RI is 1x1x1 mm.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
But some areas are bigger.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
For example, if you have a prefrontal cortex, it's very big.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
But if you have a very small one, the anterior cingulate cortex will be smaller.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
So it doesn't necessarily depend on the area of your brain.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
So what do you usually decide to look at?

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
This is a very tricky question.

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
If you look at this area, you will find that this area has not changed at all.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It's just floating in another area.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Yes.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
So now most people tend to use it.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
It's a bit like looking at how many brain areas you have when you do postulation.

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
Usually, at least 90 or more.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
I know there are more than 100 in FreeSurfer.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
A lot of people take out more than 100 brain areas.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Because they don't know which one they want to look at.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
So they just take out all the information about the brain areas.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Some people are very specific.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
They have their assumptions.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
They think which brain area has a special relationship with which brain area they want to look at.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
Then they will have a purpose to choose those brain areas first.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
Indeed, at the beginning, when you are writing articles,

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
the question that often comes back is why you choose these brain areas.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
So now, I think it's better to avoid this question.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
Plus, you really don't know where the changes are.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
So you use all the brain areas.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
So is it a problem that you already have?

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
Or is it a problem that you already have?

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
Or is it a problem that you already have?

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Oh, I found that these PhD students have a lot of questions.

41:59.000 --> 42:06.000
In fact, it should be said that we already have different software and different templates.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
You will get different brain areas.

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
In fact, this is a big problem in video editing.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
Generally speaking, my answer is that we will have a defined brain area.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
For example, you use FreeSurfer.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
Then you will definitely know which brain areas you can find in FreeSurfer.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
This is a long list.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
Then we will say that we want these brain areas in that list.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
There is another one called AAL.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
This is another template.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
This is another software.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
If you write an article and say that this is an AAL template.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Then we probably know which brain areas.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
In principle, I don't think they are much different.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
But there are a lot of people who specialize in the so-called postulation.

42:49.000 --> 42:54.000
They will tell you which different templates will have which different shortcomings.

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
Then last year, I don't know if you have seen that report.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
There was a paper in Nature last year.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
There is a Human Connectome Project in the United States.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
They scanned thousands of people.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
Then they used the data of those thousands of people.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
Then at the same time, it also contains different modalities.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
For example, there is a functional image of MIT1.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
There is also T2 or Proton Density Modeling.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
There are many different images.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
They put all the modalities together.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
Use all these modalities to build another template.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
My impression is that there are more than 100 brain areas than we currently know.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
It seems to be more than 200.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
So how do you define your brain area?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
It's a bit tricky.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
At present, we can only say which template you use.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Or if you use which software.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
We probably know what your so-called brain areas are.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Is there any other questions?

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
For example, if the area is large or small,

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
you can set it to large or small.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
For example, if the signal is very strong when you are small,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
but when you are large,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
you have to remove the signal.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Yes, there is.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
This is what I don't believe.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
For example, there are some things in the brain area

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
where the signal is very, very bad.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Because it just intersects with the air.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
In fact, you can see it in this image.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
You can see that there is still a brain area here.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
This is the prefrontal cortex.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
But it's already close to the sinus, the air area.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
In T1, it looks okay.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
But in FMR, you can see that it's super bad.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Half of the frontal area is gone.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
For example, in the frontal area,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
there are some very small areas, such as the frontal pole.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
That area is very small.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
And it's close to the air.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
So the signal under FMR is super bad.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
Usually, I don't look at that area.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
If your signal is already bad,

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
and you find out that it's mutating,

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
what do you say?

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
Is it really caused by the difference in the vital signs of the nervous system?

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Or is it because your own signal is bad?

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
So my approach is to put those too small areas

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
or in those areas where the signal is unclear.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
I don't want those areas.

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
Which areas are often unclear when you draw like this?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Frontal

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
The closest to the frontal area

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
is the frontal area.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Because it's too close to the air.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
There will be a so-called partial volume effect.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
If you look at this picture,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
the signal is bad in the front area.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
And there's an area near here called the orbital frontal cortex.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
It's close to the nasal cavity.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
There's a lot of air there, so the signal is bad.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And the other area is the temporal pole.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
It's at the tip of the temporal area.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
And there's the inferior temporal cortex.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
It's at the bottom of the temporal area.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
Because it's close to the skull base.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
So in those areas,

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
if I actually see the whole data sharing,

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and find that there's an important change in the location,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I'll be a little hesitant.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
And then I'll go back and see if my image blurring is good or not.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
And then I'll decide whether to believe it or not.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Okay, anything else?

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Okay, let's move on.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Okay, this is a little bit...

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
You have to be patient.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Because this is a little bit complicated.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
This is the background I was talking about earlier.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
The background for this experiment.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Now I'm going to talk about how to use it for this experiment.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
And then you'll see...

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
First of all, I'm going to talk about dynamic functional connectivity.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
I use sliding window.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
This blue is the so-called fMRI timecord.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
That's what we've been talking about.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
When you're doing a sliding window,

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
the most important thing,

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
the first step is to define your so-called window length.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Which is how big your window is.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I'm using 20 time points here.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
That is to say, I only need...

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
I only have the first 20 time points.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
And then I'll do correlation.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I'm using Pearson's correlation here.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
And then I'll get a matrix.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
And this matrix represents...

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
I have 54 ROI here.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
It represents the relationship between these 54 ROI.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
And then I'm going to move my window forward.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Just one time point.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
And do the same thing and you'll get the second matrix.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Wait a minute.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
How long is a time point usually?

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
Oh, it depends on your MRI scan parameters.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
We have two seconds here.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
And then you just keep doing the same thing.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
Until you've used up all the fMRI timecords.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
I have a total of 221 window correlation matrices here.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
And then the next very important thing is...

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I've got so many matrices.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
But not all of them are the same.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
So how am I going to report their variability?

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
So we've calculated seven...

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I call them network features.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
According to these matrices,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I'm going to calculate some numbers.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
And each number represents variability.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
For example, the first one.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I call it network variation.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
The first one is very simple.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
In fact, we want to see the overall variability.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
So let's just take the first one and the second one.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Take all the numbers in the matrix and subtract them.

48:10.000 --> 48:15.000
And then do the same thing for each of the 221 matrices.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
On average.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
So the number we get is a bit like...

48:19.000 --> 48:25.000
On average, the variability of your entire brain's connectivity.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
And then the second one is called network power.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
This is actually very simple.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
It's mainly about adding up all the connectivity values.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
On average.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
And the purpose of this is to get...

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
It's a bit like...

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
On average, the strength of your connectivity.

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
And then these are very similar from C to G and A.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
But the difference is...

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
A is measuring all the numbers in the whole brain.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
All the elements in this matrix.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
But C to G is for a specific connection.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
For example, this is called Inter-Hemisphere Connection.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
We only calculate the connection between the opposite brain areas.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
And then this is Cross-Hemisphere.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
And then this is Within-Hemisphere.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
It's on the same side.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
And then we divide it into the left and the right.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
So you can see that the mathematics is actually quite similar.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
It's just that when we calculate C to G.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
The value we get is...

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
For example, when we calculate C, we take the right-angled line.

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
Because the right-angled line represents the connectivity from left to right.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
And then...

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
This is how the sliding window runs.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
What about the other graph theory?

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
I made it a little fancier here.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I have a little bit of a graph theory.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Combine the two sliding windows together.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
So in the front, you'll find that it's exactly the same as the sliding window.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
It's all the same until this step.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
The difference is that after I got this matrix.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
I didn't just add or subtract it.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
Do some processing to calculate the so-called network feature.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
But I first apply a threshold.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Above a certain threshold.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I think these connections are real connections.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
There's no miscommunication under this threshold.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
And then I'm going to throw this threshold edge.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
There's something called Brain Connectivity Toolbox.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
This is a free download on the Internet.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It's a graph theory.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
After I throw it into the graph theory.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
I'll get two global features in each window.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
And a local measure.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
In fact, you can get more.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I'm just using these three for now.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The so-called global measure is.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
One subject will have one number.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
The local measure is.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
It depends on how many RRIs it has.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
How many numbers will there be?

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
And then I'm going to have 221 sets.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
Then there are three numbers in each window.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
This is a bit complicated.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
But in a nutshell.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
It's a different way.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I got a lot of different numbers.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Or so-called network features.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
Then the point is to look at the patient.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
What's the difference between normal control and normal control?

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
And then the next one.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Okay.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Actually, this is a little bit.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Is there a problem?

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
It's okay. I'm going to ask this one.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Now you have it.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
You can keep talking.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Don't talk to me.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Okay.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Okay.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
It's okay.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
After the analysis of the RRIs.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
We got the so-called numbers.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
These are the ones.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
When we use the sliding window.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
We'll get the power of the network variation.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
And then the specific connections I just mentioned.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
This is inter-hemisphere.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
And then this is cross-hemisphere.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
And in the same brain.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
In the same brain.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
And then there's the left and the right.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
The so-called flexibility.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
It's actually what we're going to do.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
The number of correlations.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
The number of correlations between the two windows.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Two minus.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
And then on average.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
So these are the numbers in the sliding window.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
If the number is higher.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
It means that his connectivity is more dynamic.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
The more mutable, the bigger.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
And then dynamic graphical approach.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
That's what we just talked about.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
Combined graph theory and sliding window.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
It's the same global feature.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
I have two.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
One is called global efficiency.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
One is called modularity.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
It's a little hard to explain here.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
I'll try to explain it.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
I can't explain it.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
If it's not clear.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
Maybe you need to check that.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I'll show you a paper later.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
There may be a complete one in there.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
There's a complete math.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
It's easier to understand.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
In short, global efficiency.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
The way it's calculated.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
The shortest distance between these two points.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Make them equal.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
Do the math first.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
And then on average.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
This global efficiency represents.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
The information of the entire neural network.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
In the whole brain.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
How well is it integrated?

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
So it's also an indicator of integration.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Modularity is just the opposite.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
It's an indicator of segregation.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
Modularity is actually.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Under this network.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Will this network be.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
Will it be divided into several different.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Small networks.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
It's an indicator of segregation.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
This means.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
If the modularity value is higher.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
It means.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Its signal.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
In a single system.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
It's better to be integrated.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
These two points are the opposite.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Integration and segregation.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Another local measure.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Betweenness centrality.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
In short.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
You calculate this brain.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Brain area.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
This RRI.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
How important is it in the entire neural network?

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
That is to say.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
How many.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
The shortest path.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Through this brain.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
This brain area.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
This RRI.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
If this number is higher.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
It means.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
This brain area is more important.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
It could be.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
The hubs we just talked about.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
With these numbers.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
The first thing we do.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Is to see.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
What's the difference between the patient and the PD patient?

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
And the other is.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
These values.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Do a forward return with the clinical indicator.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
See what happens.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Then.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Next.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
it is good.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I want to test the bed.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I'm here.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
This is the result.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
I can tell you.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
If it's just a two-sample t-test.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I can't see any difference.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Between patients and normal people.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Those.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
There is no difference at all.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
But we do.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
Simple.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
When it's Pearson's correlation.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
You can find out.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
This is.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Sliding window.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
The result of dynamic connectivity.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
You can find out.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Let's look at the above two.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
It's the age.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
With the network power.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
And.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
I put a small picture.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
You can know which one it is.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Connection.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Inter-Hermitian connectivity.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
It's related.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
But I can tell you first.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I think this is actually more like.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Normal human aging.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Will be produced.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Because I.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I see this on Parkinson's disease patients.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
But I also see it on normal people.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
So this.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
We won't do so much discussion for the time being.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
And then.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
But.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
This is more interesting.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
This is that.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Postural instability.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Get disorder.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
It's their balance.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Physical coordination.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
That number.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
With.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Enter.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
On the right.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
This.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
This is the right.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
Dynamic functional connectivity.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
It's related to them.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
That is to say.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
The more serious the patient.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
His right connectivity.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
More.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Uh.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Stiff.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
Can't.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Uh.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Change.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
And then.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
This is the dose of the drug.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
It's the same.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
When the dose of the drug.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
When the higher.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
They are also.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
With.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Like.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
They are.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Uh.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Crossing two brains.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
This connectivity is also more rigid.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
You can find.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
In this way.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
If based on these two.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
If the relationship.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
We can roughly think.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Uh.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Parkinson's disease.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
The patient.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Their.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
Uh.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Uh.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
The.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Uh.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Uh.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Uh.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Yeah.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
Uh.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
This is.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Paras.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Uh.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Uh.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Uh.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
Uh.

56:14.000 --> 56:20.000
In the way.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
It is.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
Paras.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
Uh.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Uh.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
Uh.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Uh.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Paras.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Uh.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Yeah.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
Paras.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Uh.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Uh.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
Uh.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
Uh.

57:09.000 --> 57:37.000
Compensator effect.

57:37.000 --> 57:47.000
Uh.

57:47.000 --> 57:57.000
Uh.

57:57.000 --> 58:17.000
Uh.

58:17.000 --> 58:40.000
Uh.

58:40.000 --> 58:55.000
Uh.

58:55.000 --> 59:18.000

59:18.000 --> 59:41.000

59:41.000 --> 59:51.000

59:51.000 --> 01:00:11.000

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:21.000

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:31.000

01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Uh.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:21.000

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:31.000

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:41.000
