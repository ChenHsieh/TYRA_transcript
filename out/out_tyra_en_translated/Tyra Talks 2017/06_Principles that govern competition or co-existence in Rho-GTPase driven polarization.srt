1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If you have any questions, you can just type them in the chat box.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No, he just said to start recording.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Because when I pressed it, he told me that my memory was full.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, I'm going to turn off the microphone now.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, bye bye.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, so if you have any questions later, you can just type them in the chat box.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Or you can just turn on your microphone and ask questions.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Because in fact, this video, if I were to talk to a person who does biological math, it would be about 20 minutes.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But in fact, I think it should be far more than that.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Because I hope to let everyone, even if it's not a biological math background, to get a little bit of an idea of what I'm doing.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
At least have a concept.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, I'm going to start.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My topic today is mainly to discuss how a cell decides to extend itself in one direction.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As you can see, the nerve cell on the left side of the projection film, it only extends in one direction.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Or it extends in many directions.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Like the nerve cell on the right, it extends in many directions.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So how does it control such a mechanism?

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is actually a very, very big problem.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And in different biological systems, they may use different methods to control it.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But no one has actually asked this question yet.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So today I'm going to use the mechanism that we already know, the mechanism that the organism extends in a certain direction.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's understand this mechanism and then study what kind of nature it has to decide whether it extends in one direction or in many directions.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So my topic today is Principles that Govern Competition or Coexistence in Rho-GTPase Driven Polarization.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rho-GTPase is a protein.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a very interesting protein.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're going to go all over it today.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What does polarization mean?

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let me explain it to you now.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
First of all, for a cell,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Modeling people often think about how to model a cell.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Generally, you would imagine that you have a cell membrane.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There's a cell tissue inside.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a cell box inside.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's DNA in the cell box.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We don't care about DNA.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All the protein is floating in your cell tissue.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If someone asks me how much of the protein in the cell tissue is dense,

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Different proteins are different.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
For example, I'll tell you that the density of the protein in the cell tissue is about this much, a fixed number.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's make an assumption.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The whole cell is uniform.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The density of the same protein in the cell tissue is basically the same.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In this situation, a cell can't tell which side is the head and which side is the tail.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
For a person, it is very important to distinguish between the head and the tail.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because first of all, you need to know where your head is.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You even need to distinguish between the front and the back.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Front and back.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Back and side.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Left and right.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So a lot of this kind of asymmetry is very important to the cell.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not just a whole individual thing for humans.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
For a cell, it's the same thing.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
For example, if this is a mobile cell,

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
For example, if this is a tissue,

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It needs to know where it's going.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The tail will shake and it will swim to the other side.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Even if it's not a mobile cell,

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It could be, for example, your intestinal mucosa cell.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It needs to know which side is the side with food or poop.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And which side is the side with blood vessels.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Because it's trying to get nutrients from one side to the other.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So it needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So for biological cells,

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's very important to establish this front and back axis.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Usually, the way this is done is

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
A certain protein may have a completely uniform distribution in the cell.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It needs to go through a certain process.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It needs to gather at the same end of the cell.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And then from that end,

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
For example, it starts from that end.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The skeleton of the cell grows from there.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
For example, if it wants to secrete protein,

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The secretion ball will move forward along the cell skeleton.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So it needs to gather the protein to that side first.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
After the cell skeleton, it will let everyone go that way.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If this is a long-term cell,

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It obviously needs to grow a cell skeleton first.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
After the direction of this axis, it needs to go.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The source of all this is that we need to polarize a certain protein.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's what we call polarization.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It needs to be gathered to the same end.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In the process of polarization,

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In fact, it's not just a problem of building an axis.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Another problem is,

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you want to build an axis, or do you want to build a lot of axes?

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's say you want to transport something out.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you want to transport it to one place at a time,

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Or do you want to transport it to a lot of places at a time?

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
For example, what you see now is

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The nerve cells of the hippocampus.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
In fact, no matter what nerve cells,

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's pretty much how it grows.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In the beginning, it only grew to one end.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It only grew to one end when it was very small.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Then it started to grow to a lot of places.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
These things that grow to a lot of ends,

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Things like trees, we call them trees.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The tree is the place where the nerve cells receive information.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
After the tree grows, it starts to grow the axis.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It only grows to one end.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
A nerve cell has a lot of trees, but it only has one axis.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So it needs to switch from growing to a lot of ends to only one end.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then the axis will grow very, very long.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So the information that the nerve cells receive

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The same information is passed to the same axis.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So obviously, for the nerve cells,

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
When it grows to one end, when it grows to a lot of ends,

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a very important thing.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is the main problem I have today.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Our lab is not actually doing nerve cells.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Our lab is doing hemoglobin.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hemoglobin is the only thing on top.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's called Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
In short, hemoglobin,

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hemoglobin is what we brew beer,

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Or beer yeast,

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or yeast for making bread.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We often encounter it because

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you put it in a non-oxidative space,

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When it eats sugar, it will dilute it into alcohol.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
People are a kind of wild creature,

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So they love to drink.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So we like hemoglobin very much.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In addition, we often use hemoglobin

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It produces a lot of carbon dioxide.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then it will make the bread fluffy.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Anyway, this is cold knowledge.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just want to tell you what is hemoglobin.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hemoglobin is the one we see above.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What hemoglobin does is it will sprout.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you have read biology in high school,

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You will learn the name of sprout growth.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That is to say,

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The way hemoglobin gives birth to children is

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It will first try to gather a certain protein to one end.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That end will become its head.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It will grow a tooth from the head.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The tooth will become its baby.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Then the tooth will split out again.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It will become a baby.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is the way hemoglobin gives birth.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So for hemoglobin,

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It is very important that it only grows one head.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is the reason?

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Because when it is split up,

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Its DNA will be divided into two parts.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then the average one part is divided to the child,

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
One part is kept by itself.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If it grows two heads today,

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It will have two children.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
At this time, it does not know how to divide its DNA.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Many times, the child will only get half of the DNA.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then it will die.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So for hemoglobin,

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It is very important that it only grows one head.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But at the same time,

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The one below is also another kind of sprout.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But it is the kind of sprout that grows spores.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But hemoglobin is very close relatives.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They basically use the same system

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
To decide how to grow their heads.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But the sprout that grows spores

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We call it Aspia gossypia.

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Aspia gossypia

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It does not only grow one part at a time.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Because if it grows like this,

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It will grow into a pipe.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It will become a very useless sprout.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
One important thing for it is that

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It needs to split up.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If it can grow today,

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then grow forward, split up,

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Everyone splits up,

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It can grow into a secret net.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That secret net can absorb

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The nutrients of the whole land or tree trunk.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So for these sprouts,

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It is important to grow many heads at a time.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But controlling how they grow their heads

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is to decide the protein at the end of their heads

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is the same kind of protein.

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This kind of protein is called Rho-GTPase.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It is called Rho.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This kind of protein is called Rho.

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The most important question today is

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This Rho-GTPase protein

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why does it have the same mechanism

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
To decide these two different results?

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What kind of method

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Can control it to grow one part or two parts?

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Today, my speech will be divided into two parts.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
One part is my theory

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
To discuss

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This Rho-GTPase protein

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How does it

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
From a state of uniformity in a cell

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
To a state of uniformity in a cell

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
How does this mechanism

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Decide whether it grows one part or two parts?

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This is the first part.

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This part is mainly used for

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Phenolphthalein and some other things.

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The second part is

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I want to start from the actual biological body

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Actually, I'm using yeast.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
To verify the knowledge I got from the previous theory

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Whether some rules

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Are applicable to this biological body.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So I'm going to divide it into two parts.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
One part is very mathematical.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You'll see me shaking there.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But you'll see me showing the persimmon

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And see my cat running.

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The other part

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You'll see the video of yeast.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So far, are there any questions?

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I have one

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Maybe I missed it.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I feel a little weird.

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think you're talking about

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
These bacteria have

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Have consciousness

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It can decide what it wants to do.

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not a bacteria.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's a cell.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Anyway, you know what I mean.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It decides where it grows.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Is it active?

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Actually, it is.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
For example, a yeast

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There are two ways it grows.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But anyway

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes, it is active.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The so-called active means

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's not random.

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I know it's not random.

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because from the outside

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It doesn't look like it's random.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I mean, it decides where it's going to grow.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
For example

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's say there's a plant today.

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's going to grow in the opposite direction of gravity.

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Or grow in the direction of gravity.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then you turn it 90 degrees.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It will find the direction of gravity again.

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So it's actually

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In the direction of gravity

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's passively deciding where it's going to grow.

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe in the middle is some very simple

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Some underlying mechanisms of physics

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It may not be a conscious process.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But if it's a cell

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I can't imagine

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It can decide

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I want to put all the proteins in the same direction today.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And then it goes in the same direction.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
OK

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think I'll answer a simple question first.

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If your passive and active definition is like this

263
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If it is

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's a very simple

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Today there is a

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There is a source of information.

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And then it reacts to that source of information.

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And then if this simple process is passive

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's right.

270
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a passive mechanism.

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is the easy part.

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But the hard part

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's not my major.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Maybe it's

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So you think consciousness is

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's not a chemical reaction.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Or consciousness

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
With some biological cells

281
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The combination of reactions

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It may also

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The same pattern

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's the same as getting a message and then reacting.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's just that this process is very simple.

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Or it's a very difficult question.

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's right.

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's hard to answer that part of the question.

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And then that part is what I can't answer.

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But I think it's an interesting question.

291
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But just the simple part

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes, it is

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You can use a set of message transmission systems

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
To

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
To react to external messages

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
For example, this serum

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's going to be with another kind of

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Gender serum

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then it will try to grow there.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The reason is that the other one will release pheromones.

302
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Then it will grow there.

303
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If you think this is passive

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's right. All the processes I talked about today are passive.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
OK, thank you.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Are there any other questions?

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If not, I'll go down.

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Otherwise there is a question.

309
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
OK

310
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So

311
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let me say first that I haven't been on any creatures.

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So what I mean is that

313
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's not like a serum.

314
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
For example, you just said that there is a

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Gender

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Does the serum have a gender?

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's just that you said you want to match that example.

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Someone releases pheromones

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So this one will grow over there.

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So what you mean is that

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He can't decide for himself

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Contact that

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Sexuality

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is that right?

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Is that what it means?

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As long as someone releases pheromones, he will

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
not

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It should be said

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is what we see.

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That is to say, if you give him a group of serum today.

331
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then you put a group

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So the gender of the serum

333
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We will divide A and Alpha.

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
A and Alpha can be matched

335
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's it.

336
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So if you put a group of A and a group of Alpha today.

337
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you mix them together

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You can imagine it as a group of boys.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
A group of girls all mixed together

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
At this time, some people will run to

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Match with others

342
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Some people will not match with others

343
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Some people don't match

344
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's because they're in the wrong direction.

345
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Some people are because they

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's not right at all

347
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Pheromones

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So this is a phenomenon

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Is this his decision?

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Or did he decide not to say that?

352
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because I would think

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If this environment is for him

354
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's his mating that's more beneficial to him.

355
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
After this mating

356
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
After giving birth to a child

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If you can adapt to the environment

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Those who did not mate successfully

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They are likely to be killed by the gods.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then gradually

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This group of cells that will react

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So they are in the process of evolution

363
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Learn to react to pheromones

364
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is this a proactive process?

365
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I think it's a big question

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is how we understand the process

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But how do you determine

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Is this a conscious thing?

369
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think it's a big question

370
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I just said I can't answer

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OK, thank you

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are there any other questions?

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then I'll go down

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
it is good

375
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
In the past, there have been several studies

376
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We gradually realized that

377
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
These

378
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I just talked about

379
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It creates a front and back

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The principle of this polarity

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is a

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This mechanism of our so-called Turing text

383
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Turing

384
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Everyone should have heard a little bit

385
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Because there was a movie a while ago

386
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's called

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The Mutation Game

388
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The handsome guy in it

389
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Is playing Alan Turing

390
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So everyone should know who Alan Turing is

391
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Everyone may know

392
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He does computer

393
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And he is

394
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So-called mechanical consciousness

395
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Contribution in this area

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
In fact, he is a super genius

397
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I am studying this whole field

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Biomathematics

399
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Basically all

400
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is Turing text?

401
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Before

402
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Everyone has always had a doubt

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
For example, you see a tiger today

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It has a pattern

405
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You see a leopard, it has a pattern

406
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You see some fish

407
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It may have a pattern on it

408
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The pattern becomes a pattern

409
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
These patterns

410
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How did it come out?

411
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
How did these patterns come out?

412
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If you say there is something

413
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
To control these patterns

414
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That controls its thing

415
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So you have to go forward

416
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Then found

417
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It seems

418
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It seems to be in a certain step

419
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That pattern will need

420
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There is a way to self-release

421
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
From a completely uniform state

422
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Pattern comes out

423
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It does not need to be controlled at all

424
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It will automatically grow a pattern

425
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So everyone is very confused

426
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What does this machine look like?

427
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Alan Turing

428
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
First, with a very simple partial equation

429
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This conclusion

430
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He said

431
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If this cell is good

432
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Or a piece of land

433
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If it has two chemical substances

434
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
One is activator

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Then the other is substrate

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
One is

437
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
How to say activator?

438
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Activator should be easy to understand

439
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What it does is activate

440
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The other thing is substrate

441
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is its value

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What does activator do?

443
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Once there is this activator

444
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It will have a positive feedback

445
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Then let more activators grow

446
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Activator in the process of growing

447
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It absorbs the value and becomes activator

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
For example

449
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There may be an activator today

450
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The process of its positive feedback

451
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He went to catch another substrate

452
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Then turn that substrate into activator

453
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So in this process

454
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Once activator grows

455
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He will have a positive feedback

456
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
To make himself more and more

457
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But at the same time

458
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
In this process

459
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It will absorb the substrate

460
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So the substrate will become less and less

461
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If there is such a process

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
With activator

463
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It spreads very slowly

464
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Then substrate

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If it spreads very quickly

466
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
In this way, it will

467
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Such a system can make

468
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Point

469
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
A whole piece

470
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It can also make a strip

471
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It can make a very interesting pattern

472
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It can make a counterpoint

473
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It can even make a piece

474
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No substrate part

475
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So the same system

476
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
As long as you give it different parameters

477
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It can run

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Different pattern results

479
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So this is a very interesting thing

480
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The picture on the right

481
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Is that we took one

482
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Entering its black and white photo

483
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Then take the photo

484
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Its brightness

485
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That model will automatically

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
According to the brightness above

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
To run

488
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Its pattern is all white

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Or dot or semicolon

490
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In short, this is a very cool thing

491
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Everyone realized

492
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It turns out that such a system

493
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Can make a piece

494
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Nothing

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Run out of the pattern

496
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That such a system

497
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What does it have to do with the activator I just talked about?

498
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The activator is probably like this

499
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That is to say

500
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Rho-GTPase

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It is a protein

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It has two forms

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
One is when it sticks to GTP

504
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This form is activator

505
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This form is active

506
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It can guide the downstream

507
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
All biological reactions

508
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
To go to it

509
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Then there is another form

510
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It is a non-living form

511
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It is Rho-GDP

512
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It is Rho-GDPase

513
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So this protein

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It has a non-living form of GTP

515
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Then it switches between these two forms

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
When the active Rho-GDP

518
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It spreads very slowly

519
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Then the active Rho-GDP

520
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If it spreads very quickly

521
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This becomes a

522
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Healing mechanism

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So actually in the cell

524
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The way it works is like this

525
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That is to say, we have a Rho-GDP

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It is stuck on the cell membrane

527
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Because it has a tail

528
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It is stuck on the cell membrane

529
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That

530
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Once there is a Rho-GDP

531
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It will try to

532
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Turn other Rho-GDP

533
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Into Rho-GDP

534
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So everyone sees that the red arrow

535
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is a positive feedback

536
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
At the same time, it also has another form

537
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Called Rho-GDP

538
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I just told you that it is a living form

539
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Its tail is wrapped

540
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So it can be in the cell

541
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Happy in the cell

542
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It spreads quickly in the cell

543
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There is an

544
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Activator substrate system

545
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It just happens to be its activator

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It spreads very slowly

547
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Then its substrate spreads very quickly

548
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And its activator

549
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It has a positive feedback

550
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The way we model this thing

551
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Is that we have a partial differential equation

552
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That is to say

553
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If we put the active form

554
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Called U

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The inactive form is called V

556
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That

557
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The change in time

558
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Will determine

559
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How fast it spreads

560
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And its

561
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I just put three arrows on it

562
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
To give it a reaction

563
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
At the same time

564
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Its V

565
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The change in time

566
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It depends on how fast it spreads

567
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And its chemical reaction

568
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's just a little bit special here

569
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Because the reactor

570
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That part

571
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's basically

572
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
If anything grows out of U

573
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It must have disappeared from V

574
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It can only be exchanged between V and U

575
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So its

576
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That term

577
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's positive and it's negative

578
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What this means

579
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Is that the whole system is qualitatively consistent

580
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
There is no term in here

581
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It will automatically

582
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Grow out of

583
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Rho GDP

584
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Or U

585
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
There is no term

586
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Any particle

587
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Disappears from the system

588
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I have a question

589
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Okay

590
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That is

591
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What is the unit of UV?

592
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Is it density?

593
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Or something like that

594
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yes, it should be

595
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It should be concentration

596
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But because it is

597
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
For example, the concentration on the entire cell membrane

598
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So it is

599
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It is the change in position and time

600
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But it is concentration

601
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So this is weird

602
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There is a problem with this

603
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I think your big D

604
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
U and big D

605
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's not a dimensionless value

606
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That is to say

607
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You are discussing

608
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
A

609
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Rho GDP

610
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
With a Rho GDP

611
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Interaction

612
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Discuss with you once

613
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Ten Rho GDP

614
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
With ten Rho GDP

615
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It won't be the same

616
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Because your big D is not dimensionless

617
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Do you understand? It can't be multiplied by ten

618
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Because it is not a value without units

619
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't understand

620
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes, I don't understand

621
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't understand

622
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So U and V are equal

623
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You said concentration

624
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's actually a concept of density

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
For example, unit volume

626
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
At this time

627
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
At this time, at this position

628
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Its density

629
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Then DU and DV are the rate of expansion

630
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
For example, the unit may be

631
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The unit should be

632
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Every second

633
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Then the molecule should be

634
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
For example, square meters or square meters

635
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It should be similar to this concept

636
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That is to say

637
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
DU and DV

638
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Its concept should be

639
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Every second it can

640
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It should be one square meter per second

641
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It should be like this

642
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
How much can it move outward every second

643
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Is this outward expansion

644
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
OK, confirm

645
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes, that's right

646
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But like this

647
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What did you just say

648
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
One U

649
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
One rho gdp

650
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
OK, good

651
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You remove the big F first

652
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because don't worry about the big F

653
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Both sides of this square

654
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
There is this small U or small V, right?

655
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So the two of them

656
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The units in this place

657
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Will be the same

658
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Then you put

659
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What is the right side of the square?

660
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Divided by two X

661
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then X is the unit of length

662
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Then on the left

663
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Divided by a T is the unit of time

664
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So your unit of big D is actually

665
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Distance per square unit time

666
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yes, yes

667
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So the dimension on both sides

668
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Is it right?

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But the distance per square unit time

670
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
This value

671
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In your change

672
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You discussed

673
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This whole distance

674
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
For example, the size of your change

675
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Or you only look at one at a time

676
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Or you only look at ten at a time

677
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This value will keep running

678
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It won't be unchanged

679
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Unless you take data

680
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Time also changes

681
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But it won't

682
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Because you take data

683
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You keep looking at it every second

684
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Keep looking

685
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So your value will change

686
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
From that

687
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
From that

688
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
From you

689
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
OK, all the way to that

690
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
All the way to that

691
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The unit of the expansion constant

692
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I followed up

693
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And then you said

694
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So why does it

695
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Why does it change

696
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's a fixed value

697
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Then

698
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You said why does it change

699
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I really don't understand

700
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Wait a minute

701
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm the only one who doesn't understand

702
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Is there anyone who can help me

703
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Say

704
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What does this mean

705
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think it sounds a bit strange

706
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because it

707
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah, I understand

708
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's a rate of expansion

709
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The rate of expansion should be related to the environment

710
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Instead of GDP or GDP

711
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
For example, you say the rate of expansion

712
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah

713
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The rate of expansion has nothing to do with GDP or GDP

714
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah, if you look at this rate of expansion

715
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It should be said that

716
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
On the cell membrane

717
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The rate of expansion is a slower value

718
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And then in the cell nucleus

719
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus

720
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus

721
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's another faster value

722
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But

723
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But in

724
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
In different locations

725
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Different time points

726
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
As long as it is

727
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
As long as it is on the cell membrane

728
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The rate of expansion is the same

729
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
As long as it is in the cell nucleus

730
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The rate of expansion is the same

731
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, okay, I know

732
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I know how to ask

733
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Then I change a question

734
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This big D

735
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Big D U or big D V

736
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
These two values

737
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What does it have to do with

738
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's going to be with the nature of these two cells

739
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What kind of cell is it?

740
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Right?

741
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah

742
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Is there anything else besides this?

743
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's basically the same

744
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Theoretically, you should

745
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Theoretically, when you write this governing equation

746
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You should hope that these two

747
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
These two numbers are basically used to present

748
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
To some extent

749
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's just the relationship between this interaction

750
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Right?

751
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Just the two of them

752
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But

753
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
If you do that

754
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
If one is a stone

755
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Or one is protein

756
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Obviously that D will be very different

757
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I can't even write

758
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So it is

759
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Characterize the nature of your system

760
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Or the nature of the unit in the system

761
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But

762
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It looks like your persimmon

763
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's still with

764
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
For example, you put these cells

765
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It doesn't matter how much you cultivate

766
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It looks weird

767
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Wait, why?

768
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I

769
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I

770
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It looks weird

771
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I think I understand

772
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Then I also know

773
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I understand your question

774
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I think I understand the question

775
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But why

776
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That D

777
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm guessing what you mean

778
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That D

779
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I said Zhang Yiyong

780
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You mean that D is not a constant

781
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's actually a variable, right?

782
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It will change according to the unit you choose

783
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah, so why is this a problem?

784
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I

785
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I can know what that thing is

786
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
A system

787
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's a constant

788
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah, you set a system

789
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's a constant

790
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Then you change a system

791
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You change a constant

792
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So why is this a problem?

793
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah

794
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
This is equivalent to

795
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Your expansion equation

796
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's actually the same as the general heat transfer

797
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The expansion equation is the same

798
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's exactly the same

799
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Heat transfer coefficient is related to temperature

800
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It changes with temperature

801
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
No matter what

802
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It won't be a problem

803
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So I don't understand

804
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't understand what the problem is

805
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
My feeling is that

806
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This thing is not

807
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I won't say it's a problem

808
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But I will say it's not enough

809
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Not beautiful enough

810
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Because it's actually

811
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah, it's actually a heat transfer

812
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
This is a matter of aesthetics

813
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because it's not enough

814
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Generalize

815
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I

816
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay, I think I need to think about it

817
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay, because I think we've been stuck for a long time

818
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It will take up a lot of your time

819
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I basically

820
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I basically understand this equation

821
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Because this is actually

822
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah

823
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
This is a

824
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The heat diffusion equation

825
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's just an expansion equation

826
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Then add the heat diffusion

827
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah

828
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Then let's continue today

829
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Thank you, I'm sorry

830
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No

831
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yeah, so

832
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So

833
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That expansion constant

834
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's only two

835
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
One is

836
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
One is the expansion constant of U

837
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's on the film

838
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So it's a

839
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's a slower value

840
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But it's in

841
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's the same in different positions

842
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Then

843
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The expansion constant of V is faster

844
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Bigger

845
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Speaking of this, I suddenly thought of

846
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You just said

847
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Their quantity

848
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Anyway, you just said that

849
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Magnitude is called magnitude

850
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So you don't need to add another

851
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Magnitude equation

852
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
For example, the total number must be equal

853
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and so on

854
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No, because he himself

855
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
He himself

856
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm writing it like this now

857
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
He's already perpendicular

858
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The reason is that first of all

859
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The expansion side

860
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He'll just run to the side

861
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
He won't

862
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He won't

863
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
He won't disappear, right?

864
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So the expansion is already perpendicular

865
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
What about the part of the reaction?

866
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Um

867
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You are

868
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
V disappears

869
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Because his V side

870
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The reaction rate is

871
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Negative f of uv

872
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And then the reaction rate over there

873
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Is f of uv

874
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So anything

875
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Disappear from V

876
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
He will use the same rate

877
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Come out from U

878
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So he will automatically say

879
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Yes, I see

880
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
OK, thank you

881
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Good

882
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Good

883
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What about this system

884
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Basically

885
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You will see that

886
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Rho gtp

887
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
He's in

888
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If he's anywhere

889
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
He has a little bit

890
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
More rho gtp

891
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It will cause a positive feedback

892
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And then it will suck a lot of

893
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Substrate

894
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And then it becomes

895
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Just suck a lot of rho gtp

896
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And then it becomes a lot of rho gtp

897
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Gathered in that position

898
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
The problem is now rho g

899
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
At this time it causes a rho gtp vacuum

900
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But in that cell

901
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Part of it is

902
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It doesn't seem to have

903
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's just rho gtp

904
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The concentration is very low

905
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But at this time

906
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Because in the cell

907
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Its expansion rate is very fast

908
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So the vacuum of this concentration

909
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It will be quickly

910
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's the rho gtp in other places

911
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Once it's subtracted

912
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It will be quickly sucked

913
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
To the cell membrane

914
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So this mechanism

915
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Will quickly put

916
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The whole cell

917
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Rho gtp

918
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's all gathered in the same cell membrane

919
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The location of the cell membrane in the same area

920
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Go up

921
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
That's basically the Turing mechanism

922
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
In my special example

923
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
More intuitive explanation

924
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
If I plot it directly

925
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It will be like this

926
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That is to say

927
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You see here

928
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The orange text you see here

929
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The orange is

930
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The x-axis is the location

931
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Then the y-axis is

932
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The y-axis is the concentration

933
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Anyway, this mechanism

934
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It will basically make you from

935
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Random

936
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It will automatically grow out of the message

937
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
All of these objects

938
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Try to gather

939
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Go to the same location

940
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It will form a concentration peak

941
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's our understanding of the Turing system

942
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
That is to say

943
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
How long is this cell

944
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's three microns today

945
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
If I'm on three microns today

946
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Model this system

947
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It will grow out of a peak

948
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But if I use six microns today

949
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That one

950
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It will grow out of two peaks

951
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But we find

952
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The next thing that happens is

953
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
These two peaks

954
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
There is a bit of competition between them

955
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Because they are both

956
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Absorbing the same pool value

957
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So when a peak

958
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It will grab another peak

959
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It will absorb faster than the other

960
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So it takes the other

961
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Things in the peak

962
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And so it

963
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Although a Turing system

964
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
In theory, like the picture we just saw

965
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It can grow a lot of dots

966
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But in fact

967
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
In a system of quality conservation

968
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
If you grow a lot of dots

969
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
A lot of dots

970
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They will compete with each other

971
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
In the end, there will only be one left

972
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So in a quality conservation situation

973
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It will definitely compete

974
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Then the competition will decide

975
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It only has one peak

976
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We can understand it like this

977
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You may have to believe me for this part

978
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Just a peak

979
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It absorbs

980
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The ability to absorb these values

981
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Actually determines

982
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
The concentration of the peak

983
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's basically the height of the peak

984
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Determines its ability to absorb

985
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Like the one on the right

986
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The one on the right

987
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It has a stronger ability to absorb

988
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So if you look at its value

989
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It will cause a bigger value vacuum

990
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Then it will be more

991
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
The concentration of the cell is lower

992
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
At the same time, if you look at the small one

993
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Because it has a poor ability to absorb

994
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So it won't be so fast

995
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Take all the cells under it

996
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So the concentration of the cell under it

997
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Is relatively high

998
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
At this time, it caused

999
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
At this time, it caused

1000
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
There is a concentration in the cell

1001
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Because in the cell

1002
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Its expansion is very fast

1003
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
At this time, the matter will be very fast

1004
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
From the small peak on the left

1005
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Run to the right

1006
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Then this will happen

1007
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
This kind of thing

1008
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Everyone runs over

1009
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Then it will be absorbed to the other side

1010
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
This is probably why the two peaks

1011
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Will compete with each other

1012
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Rationale

1013
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
In fact, we are in

1014
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
In the real model

1015
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
There is such a phenomenon

1016
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
In fact, like me

1017
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Of course not only

1018
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
One row gtp

1019
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
One row gtp

1020
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Between it

1021
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
There are other molecules involved

1022
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But basically the concept is the same

1023
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Everyone can still see

1024
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I helped him point out

1025
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Great

1026
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Basically everyone was here

1027
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
See the positive feedback

1028
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's not going to promote itself

1029
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Its own activation

1030
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It will catch a scaffold

1031
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Is a framework protein

1032
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That protein will stick

1033
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Another protein called GAP

1034
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But this GAP

1035
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Its role is

1036
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It is used to put

1037
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Row gtp

1038
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Becomes row gtp

1039
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So once there are so many

1040
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
After row gtp

1041
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It will call out this green

1042
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And this yellow

1043
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Then this yellow

1044
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Will try to turn blue into yellow

1045
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So this

1046
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
This itself is a positive feedback

1047
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So basically in the school we go

1048
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We can see

1049
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You can see

1050
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The thing I just modeled

1051
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
In the school we go

1052
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
We do see that

1053
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
If you don't let that green

1054
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
This protein emits light

1055
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Is that you will see the black part later

1056
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Is this green protein

1057
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Or you let this red protein

1058
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It is that row gtp

1059
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
In the school it is called cc42

1060
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This protein emits light

1061
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You will see later

1062
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
First it will grow out many points at once

1063
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But

1064
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
This will compete between different points

1065
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And then there is only one point left

1066
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Everyone can see again

1067
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
These two are the same cell

1068
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Different proteins

1069
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
There are two

1070
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Then it becomes one

1071
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The following one is the same

1072
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Is

1073
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
At first

1074
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There will be two points

1075
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Then these two points

1076
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Finally it becomes a point

1077
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Excuse me

1078
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So this competition

1079
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
This is not a simulation

1080
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
This is true

1081
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yes, this is seen from the microscope

1082
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
If you put that protein

1083
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
If you connect a fluorescent protein

1084
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Then it will be recorded under the microscope

1085
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Record the light

1086
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Then

1087
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes, I am now black and white

1088
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So the place where the light is emitted is black

1089
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Hi, I have a problem again

1090
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I have been looking for trouble

1091
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
My question is

1092
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Is the unit of time under this video a second?

1093
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It is a few seconds

1094
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
A few minutes

1095
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So its unit of time is 45 seconds

1096
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So

1097
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
This whole video is probably

1098
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What ten minutes or so

1099
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yes, then it competes in this process

1100
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It will end in about three minutes

1101
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
How much is the distance between the two points?

1102
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The diameter of the entire cell is about

1103
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
5 micrometers

1104
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
5 micrometers

1105
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
10 to the minus 6 square meters

1106
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Is its diameter

1107
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So the distance between the two points is probably

1108
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
2 micrometers

1109
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So generally this type of cell

1110
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
In the spread

1111
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Speed

1112
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Will

1113
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
In this ten minutes

1114
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Will be less than the distance between the two points

1115
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Otherwise, your F

1116
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
The parameter should have time

1117
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It won't be

1118
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It won't be

1119
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Because you assume that

1120
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Interaction is infinite

1121
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It is

1122
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It reaches its effect every moment

1123
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Like this

1124
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That F inside

1125
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Is

1126
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The parameter of the reaction rate inside

1127
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There is time

1128
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That is

1129
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It will be in that F

1130
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
How much per second

1131
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
How much more can be generated per second

1132
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
How much

1133
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
The concentration of U

1134
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Just like this

1135
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
That

1136
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The parameter in front has time

1137
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
OK

1138
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I also have a question

1139
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That is

1140
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
GTP will consume GDP

1141
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That consumption is

1142
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Will definitely

1143
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
As long as there is GDP

1144
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It will definitely consume it

1145
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Or

1146
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It has a certain criteria

1147
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
To a certain extent

1148
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Even if it has GDP around it

1149
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It doesn't care about it

1150
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
No

1151
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
We are

1152
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
We didn't imagine

1153
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It has a threshold

1154
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That is

1155
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
As long as it

1156
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That is

1157
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
GTP will consume

1158
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
If GTP will consume

1159
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
If GTP will consume

1160
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
If GTP will consume

1161
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Then

1162
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Then

1163
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Then I mean

1164
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
This consumption is

1165
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
There is actually one less

1166
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
There is a arrow

1167
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
For example, you can see

1168
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There are two arrows here

1169
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Right

1170
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So it is

1171
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
For example, this one comes

1172
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
This arrow

1173
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The rate is related to

1174
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The GDP is related

1175
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Then come back

1176
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The rate is related to

1177
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The GDP is related

1178
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So today if there is

1179
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Very little GDP

1180
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
A lot

1181
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
A lot of GDP

1182
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
A lot of GDP

1183
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
A lot of GDP

1184
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That

1185
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That this positive feedback run

1186
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That this positive feedback run

1187
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It will try to put the value

1188
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That is GDP

1189
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
All become

1190
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
That is

1191
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
GTP

1192
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Right

1193
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Then but GDP

1194
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It is also going back

1195
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It will also run back

1196
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So it is a little bit

1197
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So it is a little bit

1198
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Depends on

1199
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The balance of the middle

1200
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Depends on

1201
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So

1202
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So GTP

1203
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So GTP

1204
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That pink one

1205
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
There is also a chance to turn blue

1206
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It is not single

1207
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It is a

1208
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It is reversible

1209
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Right

1210
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I see

1211
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Thank you

1212
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I see

1213
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Right

1214
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So

1215
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
In this complex

1216
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It is a two-way arrow

1217
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
In the original simple

1218
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It is also a two-way arrow

1219
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It is also a two-way arrow

1220
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It can run on the model

1221
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It will fall back

1222
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It can run on the model

1223
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But because

1224
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Because

1225
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Because

1226
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Because if there are a lot of

1227
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
If there are a lot of

1228
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
RTDP

1229
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
GTP

1230
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It will fall back

1231
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It will fall back

1232
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It will fall back

1233
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It is easy to be sucked

1234
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
To stay on the screen

1235
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
To stay on the screen

1236
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
To stay on the screen

1237
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Good

1238
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Good

1239
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Right

1240
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Right

1241
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Right

1242
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So we find in the developer

1243
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So we find in the developer

1244
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
That's right

1245
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
This system

1246
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Is the system

1247
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Is the system

1248
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
At the first

1249
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
This system

1250
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Is the system

1251
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Is the system

1252
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Several

1253
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Several

1254
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Several

1255
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Several

1256
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Systems

1257
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
allocation

1258
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Depends on the

1259
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Depends on the

1260
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000

Decide

1262

Decide

Proceed

1265

1271
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
G resist

1272
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
G resist

1273
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
G rich

1274

G rich

1275
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
G rich

1276
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
G rich

1277
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
G rich

1278
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
G rich

1279
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
There are

1280
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
A lot

1281
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So

1282
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Let's

1283
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,000
I found that it was actually a very simple thing to

1284
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
simply increase the length of the cell.

1285
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That is if

1286
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:12,000
it is a

1287
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
very long period of time.

1288
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
OK.

1289
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So why is it like this?

1290
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Let me confirm a little bit.

1291
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If my understanding is correct,

1292
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
they should still be

1293
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
competing with each other,

1294
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
but that is an equilibrium.

1295
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Is that what you mean?

1296
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Of course they are competing with each other.

1297
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yes, they are actually

1298
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
still competing with each other.

1299
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But the speed of the competition

1300
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
becomes very, very slow.

1301
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's very fast at the beginning,

1302
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
but I don't know why

1303
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
the competition becomes very slow later.

1304
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
If my understanding is correct,

1305
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
according to the expansion formula,

1306
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
because the blue turns red

1307
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and the red turns blue

1308
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
are two-way,

1309
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
so if your distance is long enough,

1310
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
if they each reach

1311
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
the local balance,

1312
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
then they will not compete

1313
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
with each other

1314
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
in the end.

1315
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Because...

1316
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yes, that's what I mean.

1317
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It should be like this, right?

1318
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yes, it should be like this.

1319
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes, I guessed it myself.

1320
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I just want to make sure.

1321
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But according to

1322
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
what we said earlier,

1323
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
if there are two peaks

1324
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
over there,

1325
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
they should compete with each other in the end.

1326
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes, they do.

1327
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
The locals have reached

1328
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
an equilibrium.

1329
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That is to say,

1330
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
you will see that

1331
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
there is a small peak up there.

1332
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
There will be a small

1333
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
concentration line.

1334
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
There will be a place

1335
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
that is more R.

1336
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So this value

1337
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and its activator

1338
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
are balanced.

1339
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And this side is also balanced.

1340
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But under this balance,

1341
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
the concentration here will be higher.

1342
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Under this balance,

1343
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the concentration here will be lower,

1344
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
resulting in

1345
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
it still competing in the end.

1346
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Theoretically,

1347
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
this mechanism

1348
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
should still be possible

1349
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
no matter how long it is.

1350
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But if it looks like

1351
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
if the distance is long enough,

1352
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
the blue line

1353
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
will have an angle,

1354
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
so it will lead to

1355
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
flow from the high place

1356
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
to the low place.

1357
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But at the same time,

1358
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
the orange line

1359
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
will return

1360
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
to the blue.

1361
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So it is very likely

1362
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
that the orange line

1363
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
will become blue

1364
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
faster than

1365
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
the blue high place

1366
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
to the low place.

1367
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
In this way,

1368
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
they will reach

1369
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
a balance between each other.

1370
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
If the distance is long enough.

1371
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But because in this system,

1372
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
its blue...

1373
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Sorry.

1374
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Because in this system,

1375
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
its blue spreads super fast.

1376
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And its red

1377
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
spreads very, very slowly.

1378
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So it turns out that

1379
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
the effect of the blue spread

1380
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
is far greater than the red.

1381
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Should I say that?

1382
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
OK.

1383
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Then,

1384
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
in theory,

1385
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
it should run like this.

1386
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yes, in theory,

1387
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
it should compete.

1388
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Then wait for me.

1389
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It seems that someone

1390
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
wants to come to the grassland

1391
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and want to enter our house.

1392
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Wait for me.

1393
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Sorry.

1394
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Pervert.

1395
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Ask them to come in

1396
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and listen to the speech.

1397
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
He is not here now.

1398
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
He can't hear it, right?

1399
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They have their own speech.

1400
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
They are going to talk about that today.

1401
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
They just said

1402
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
they are going to talk about Maya culture.

1403
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And there is food to eat outside.

1404
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Why do you think

1405
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
they will come in?

1406
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Speaking of this,

1407
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I would like to discuss

1408
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
a topic with you.

1409
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Now,

1410
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
the budget of

1411
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Taira

1412
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
can actually explode.

1413
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
There is food.

1414
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Because

1415
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
we are now

1416
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
writing a grant

1417
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
with the Ministry of Education.

1418
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It can be written up to 400 yuan at most,

1419
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
but it must be reported in time.

1420
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
We only buy this city now,

1421
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
so it actually took

1422
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
more than 100 yuan

1423
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and less than 200 yuan.

1424
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And

1425
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
if you want,

1426
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What?

1427
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
He should be talking to

1428
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
people outside the door.

1429
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Don't mind him.

1430
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
OK.

1431
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I will finish it quickly.

1432
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Wait for me.

1433
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We are discussing another thing.

1434
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So if you want,

1435
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
every time you open Taira,

1436
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you can buy some donuts.

1437
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
In fact,

1438
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
you can

1439
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
send me some votes.

1440
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Then I will transfer

1441
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
the money to you.

1442
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Then those votes can be used

1443
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
to pay for education.

1444
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
This is the account of our project.

1445
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Then everyone can

1446
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
save some money.

1447
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Every time you have a meeting,

1448
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
you can buy some donuts.

1449
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Think about it.

1450
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If you are interested,

1451
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
we can discuss it later.

1452
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Sorry.

1453
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You can continue.

1454
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Sorry.

1455
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I went to find someone else.

1456
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yes.

1457
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yes.

1458
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Where was I?

1459
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
We were talking about

1460
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
an equilibrium here.

1461
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
If the distance is too long,

1462
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
it should be said

1463
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
that if the distance is too long,

1464
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
why is there an equilibrium?

1465
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Actually, I don't understand.

1466
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But OK.

1467
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Let's leave it alone.

1468
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Because now I think

1469
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
it may be difficult to explain

1470
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
why there is no equilibrium.

1471
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But

1472
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
in fact, we can

1473
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
directly from

1474
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
this is called

1475
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
stability analysis.

1476
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That is to say,

1477
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
if I look at

1478
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
two peaks

1479
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
of the same height today,

1480
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and then look at

1481
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
this peak solution

1482
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
if there is stability in math,

1483
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I will find that

1484
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
it will actually

1485
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
never be unstable.

1486
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It will always be competitive.

1487
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
This is already

1488
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
that

1489
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
this is what we

1490
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
directly use math to prove

1491
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
that it will be competitive.

1492
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
This thing

1493
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
is just that in this kind of speech,

1494
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I usually don't put

1495
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
that math

1496
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
out.

1497
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So I hope you can

1498
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
believe me first

1499
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
that they will definitely

1500
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
compete in this matter.

1501
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
OK.

1502
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
But I know this is a

1503
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
bit too much.

1504
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It becomes that

1505
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
everyone has to believe me.

1506
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But anyway.

1507
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yes.

1508
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Then it becomes that

1509
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
this is very strange now.

1510
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
In the end,

1511
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
if it is already

1512
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
proven that

1513
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
it will definitely compete,

1514
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
then in the end

1515
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
it is

1516
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
in the end

1517
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
why their competition

1518
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
will become so slow.

1519
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Later I found

1520
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
that it was like this.

1521
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
That is to say,

1522
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
because at first

1523
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
we guessed the distance

1524
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
because it was obvious

1525
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
that we would

1526
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
just make the distance longer.

1527
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So we guessed the distance at first.

1528
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Then I spent about

1529
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
half a year on

1530
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
guessing the distance.

1531
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I found out later

1532
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that it was not the distance.

1533
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
In fact,

1534
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
the biggest impact

1535
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
is the protein content

1536
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
inside.

1537
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Today we said

1538
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
that if we

1539
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
model this system

1540
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
that is to say

1541
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
today if it is

1542
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
a small cell

1543
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and a big cell

1544
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
then we assume

1545
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
that the protein content

1546
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
of the cell

1547
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
at the beginning

1548
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
is the same.

1549
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Then when I make

1550
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
the cell longer

1551
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
at the same time

1552
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I also added

1553
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
all the protein content.

1554
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So if

1555
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
this is the first thing.

1556
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
The second thing

1557
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
is more trivial.

1558
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
The second thing

1559
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
is that

1560
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
we suddenly found

1561
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
this thing.

1562
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
If there was

1563
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
a peak

1564
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
inside

1565
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
you kept

1566
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
guessing

1567
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
the protein content

1568
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
of the cell.

1569
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
The mouse is gone.

1570
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
If the protein content

1571
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
becomes more

1572
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
the peak

1573
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
will increase.

1574
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
It will become

1575
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
more concentrated.

1576
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But when it

1577
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
increases to a certain extent

1578
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
it no longer increases.

1579
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It only increases horizontally.

1580
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
The horizontal increase

1581
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
means that

1582
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
there is actually

1583
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
a boundary

1584
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
that you can't

1585
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
exceed.

1586
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You can't grow

1587
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
higher than it.

1588
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
The reason for

1589
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
this boundary

1590
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
is because

1591
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
if you are

1592
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
more familiar

1593
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
with this system

1594
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
you will realize

1595
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
that this is

1596
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
a bi-stable

1597
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
reaction.

1598
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That is to say

1599
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
the concentration of U

1600
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
at the highest point

1601
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
is stable

1602
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
and at the lowest

1603
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
point

1604
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
is stable.

1605
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So if it

1606
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
reaches that point

1607
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
it will return

1608
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and stop at that point.

1609
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
The nature

1610
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
of bi-stability

1611
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
comes from

1612
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
the fact that

1613
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
every time there is

1614
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
a peak

1615
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
it will

1616
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
cause a

1617
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
value vacuum.

1618
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
The higher the peak

1619
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
the more

1620
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
serious

1621
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
the value vacuum

1622
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
will be.

1623
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But it can't

1624
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
become more serious

1625
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
because it can't

1626
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
become negative.

1627
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So it will

1628
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
stop at a point

1629
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
and limit

1630
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
that you can't

1631
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
stop

1632
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
at that point.

1633
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That's the

1634
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
basic concept.

1635
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
If we look at

1636
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
this from a

1637
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
mathematical point of view

1638
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
if we plot

1639
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
f of u, v

1640
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
let's say

1641
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
f of u, v

1642
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
is a u squared

1643
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
minus b u squared

1644
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
it is

1645
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
as far as

1646
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I know

1647
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
as far as I know

1648
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
the simplest

1649
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
way to make

1650
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
this system

1651
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
polarize

1652
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
is

1653
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
a and b

1654
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
are both

1655
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
a function

1656
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
of time

1657
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and u and

1658
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
v are

1659
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
densities.

1660
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
If this

1661
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
is the

1662
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
reaction

1663
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
it will

1664
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
look like

1665
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
a green curve.

1666
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
At first glance

1667
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
it looks

1668
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
wrong.

1669
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
It is a

1670
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
two-dimensional

1671
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
curve.

1672
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Why does it

1673
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
look like

1674
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
a three-dimensional

1675
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
curve?

1676
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It is

1677
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
because

1678
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
in

1679
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
steady-state

1680
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
how do you

1681
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
say

1682
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
in steady-state

1683
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
d u

1684
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
d t

1685
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
is

1686
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
a

1687
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
function

1688
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
of

1689
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
time

1690
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
and

1691
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
u.

1692
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
If you

1693
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
add

1694
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
these two

1695
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
things

1696
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the f of

1697
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
u, v

1698
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
will

1699
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
disappear.

1700
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
If the

1701
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
f of

1702
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
u, v

1703
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
disappears

1704
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
you will

1705
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
get this

1706
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
if you

1707
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
multiply

1708
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
x

1709
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
by

1710
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
two

1711
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
times.

1712
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So

1713
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
the density

1714
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
of

1715
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
the

1716
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
f of

1717
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
u, v

1718
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
is

1719
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
a function

1720
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
of

1721
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
