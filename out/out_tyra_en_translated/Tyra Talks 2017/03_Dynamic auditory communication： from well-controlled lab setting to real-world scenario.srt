1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,500
So after I graduated from university, I think I did an RA, if I remember correctly, at Professor Chen's place, right?

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
I did it for a year or two

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,500
After that, I went to Canada's McMaster to study for my PhD

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,500
When I was studying for my PhD, one of the tutors was Dr. Trenner

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,500
He was doing a course on music perception and intuition

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:55,500
If you're interested, you can ask him why he chose to do music

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
or intuition and cognition

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I don't know much about intuition, but my impression is that

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,500
doing visual psychology takes up a large portion of the work

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
So why did I decide to do intuition? I think it's interesting

11
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
I don't know, it's just my guess

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Yongyi has a website, you can go check it out, it's really scary

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
The publications are as long as ghosts

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Other than the publications, there's also awards and media coverage

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
I think that's really cool

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
I hope one day I can tell my parents that I'm a journalist

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Without further ado, let's welcome Yongyi to share his research with us

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,500
I'll turn off my mic so you can hear me

19
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Can you hear me now?

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I think it's okay

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm a little shy

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I don't even know if I have to give a score

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Today is July 8th, I'm guessing my highest score is 87

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
I can't go any higher

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
That's about it

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I can predict the results

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,500
You have to turn on the audio so you can hear the laughter

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
I don't think there's any feedback

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I think we need feedback

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Forget it

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
It's pretty funny

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I'm being encouraged, I'm indeed a person who studies truth psychology

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
It's different

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm probably just making things up

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I'm not really interested in hearing

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
There's no deep reason

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
First of all, I'm very interested in music

38
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I only found out later that most people do visual research

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Most people talk about intuition

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
It's directly implied that it's visual research

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I only found out later

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
If you're doing hearing research

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
You have to say it's particularly famous for auditory

44
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Otherwise people will get it wrong

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
It's pretty interesting

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I think there are some phenomena in hearing

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
It's different when it comes to other senses

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
There are some special problems to deal with

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
I think that's what makes hearing interesting

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
It's a special place

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Okay, let's get into my presentation

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm going to start studying how to share my screen

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Okay, while you're studying

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Let me tell you

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Just in case there's feedback

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Let me turn off the microphone

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
If you have anything you want to say

58
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
You can type it in

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
You can also speak

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Okay

61
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Okay

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Let's go

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Okay

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,500
My PhD research topic is

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
It's very vague

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Dynamic Auditory Communication

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
It's vague

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
It's about how to change your hearing

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
In a dynamic situation

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
How to change your hearing

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
In a dynamic situation

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
This includes

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
For example, you're listening to me now

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
All my voices change at any time

75
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
For example, every time I make a sound

76
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
There's a millisecond

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
And then it disappears

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Or listening to music

79
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
It's kind of like that

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
And then

81
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
And what I want to share today is

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
My experiment

83
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
From a traditional laboratory

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Psychological laboratory

85
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
And then do it

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
More complicated

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
We think it's closer to the real

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Interaction

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Under the environment of human interaction

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
That is

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
From a small laboratory to a large laboratory

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Between each other

93
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
There are some research methods

94
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Needs to be adjusted

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
And then I just want to explain today

96
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Take our research as an example

97
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
How do we do this

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
So my sub-topic is

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
How do psychologists do research

100
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
And there is a step-by-step explanation

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Explain

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
What are the problems we encounter

103
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
And then

104
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
We think

105
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
In our situation

106
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
How do we solve it

107
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
And then

108
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
By the way

109
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Just

110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Just

111
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Please help everyone

112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
The place is

113
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
September

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Taiwan's Science and Music Magazine

115
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
There will be a

116
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
A special special issue of music psychology

117
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
And then

118
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I want to put this

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Related research

120
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
It's a draft

121
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Go over there

122
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
As a

123
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
A small topic

124
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Just share it

125
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Just as a science book

126
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Share it to readers in Taiwan

127
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Then I didn't write it myself

128
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
The experience of doing a science book article

129
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Then if I hope

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
That is to say

131
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
I hope to make today's speech

132
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Into different fields

133
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
People interested in science

134
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Can probably

135
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Psychologists

136
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
How do we do research

137
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Especially in

138
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
How do we do research

139
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
In such a special situation

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
If you think

141
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
On the content

142
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Or how to explain

143
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
How can it be adjusted better

144
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
That is

145
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I hope you can tell me

146
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Then

147
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I will

148
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
I'm going to take the exam in two weeks

149
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
So thank you very much

150
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
If there is any help

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
OK

152
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
it is good

153
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
The nonsense should be over

154
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
First of all, I want to say

155
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Hearing has many domains

156
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Like for example

157
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
You can know if the pitch is high or low

158
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
What I want to focus on today is

159
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Focus on time

160
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
For hearing

161
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Is a very important thing

162
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
In fact, time is for many senses

163
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
And the reaction is very important

164
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
For hearing

165
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I think it is especially critical

166
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Why

167
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
If you record my voice

168
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Then take it to

169
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
In the software of the computer

170
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Open it

171
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Look at its radio

172
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Its radio

173
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
It looks like

174
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Almost like this

175
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Then you can of course

176
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Decode

177
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
That is to say

178
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
What is my voice

179
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Then

180
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Our hearing is

181
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
We have to put it together

182
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
To become a meaningful sentence

183
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Ah

184
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
But it's hard for hearing

185
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
That is to say

186
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Every message

187
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
The time it appears is so short

188
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
And

189
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
It won't appear again

190
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Ah

191
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Human beings have lived for so long

192
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
History

193
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
The history of human communication

194
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Before the recorder was invented

195
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
We have no chance

196
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Listen again

197
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
What happened before

198
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
How is it

199
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
So human hearing

200
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
A big problem

201
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
That is to say

202
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
We have to be able to catch it quickly

203
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Ah

204
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
This message is displayed at any time

205
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
And then accurately

206
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Awareness

207
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Feel it accurately

208
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
The content of this

209
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Then

210
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
And another

211
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
More demanding is

212
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
That is

213
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
We are not just aware of this

214
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
And we have to

215
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Make a quick response

216
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
For example

217
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
When you have a conversation with others

218
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
What are you hearing

219
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
You will be able to understand immediately

220
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Then immediately

221
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Be able to react

222
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Then this skill

223
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
When quarreling

224
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
It's particularly important

225
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Because if you slow down

226
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
If you slow down

227
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
You lost the quarrel

228
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
It's very

229
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It's important to speak

230
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Right

231
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
So you see

232
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Human beings are like this

233
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
No, I'm kidding

234
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
That

235
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Not only in conversation

236
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
In another situation

237
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
For example, you are listening to music

238
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Ah

239
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
And for example, you are with

240
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
You sing with others

241
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Ah

242
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Sing together

243
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
That

244
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I can't just listen to other people's music

245
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Listen to this

246
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm going to

247
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Sing my part

248
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Because you are like this

249
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
No matter how fast your processing speed is

250
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
There must be a time difference inside

251
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
That

252
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Ah

253
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
So

254
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
In fact, in many cases of hearing

255
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
We think it is

256
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
He keeps

257
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Keep predicting

258
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
What's going to happen next

259
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Then let people

260
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Always

261
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Let your intuition

262
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Let your nervous response

263
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Always in a

264
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
In a well-prepared situation

265
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Then you can

266
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Precise intuition to this matter

267
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
And then

268
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Quickly prepared

269
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
To make the next reaction

270
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
So I think hearing is on time

271
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Ah

272
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
In fact, compared to other sensory domains

273
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Is

274
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
More demanding

275
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
This is

276
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
My task

277
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
So I think time is very important to hearing

278
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Ok

279
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
If you have any questions

280
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
You can interrupt me in the middle

281
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Then if there is no problem

282
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I will continue

283
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Then

284
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
By the way because I

285
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Now

286
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I share the screen

287
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
So if everyone

288
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
If you leave a message in the chat

289
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I should not be able to see it now

290
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
So everyone can

291
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Just turn on the microphone

292
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
It has nothing to do with me

293
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Ok

294
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Ah

295
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I have a question

296
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Ok

297
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Please say

298
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
The

299
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
The M-I-N-G-E-R above the waveform

300
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
What is that?

301
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Oh, that's just an example I found on the Internet

302
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I don't know what that is

303
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Sorry

304
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Ok

305
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Ok, thank you

306
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
It should be a project title

307
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Yes

308
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
It looks like this

309
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
But I don't know

310
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I haven't searched either

311
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Alright

312
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Maybe it's doing something

313
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Voice

314
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Voice of the computer

315
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Some of the projects handled by the visual

316
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I don't know

317
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Sorry

318
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Then I will talk about it first

319
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
In traditional psychology and neuroscience

320
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
How do we do this kind of research in the lab

321
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
If we want to know

322
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
What is the importance of time for hearing

323
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
How do we do research

324
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
For example

325
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
I

326
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
I will

327
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Design a series of hearing with a computer

328
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
A series of hearing that opens at any time

329
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Then for example

330
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Then for example

331
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I can

332
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
A kind of audio file

333
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
I put it

334
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Every note

335
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Bop, bop, bop

336
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
All time

337
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Every bop, bop, bop

338
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Between each tone

339
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Its time is fixed

340
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
The same length

341
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
For example, it's 500 milliseconds

342
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
So this way you

343
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
It sounds like a decoder

344
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

345
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Then you can keep going

346
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
So this

347
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
This is a very regular time

348
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Then you can have a

349
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
An irregular time

350
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
For example, it's

351
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Between your pain and pain

352
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Can be

353
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
For example

354
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Random 250 milliseconds

355
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Between 750 milliseconds

356
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
So it might sound like this

357
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

358
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Just

359
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
You don't know at all

360
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
You

361
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
When will the next pain appear

362
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
And then

363
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
In this different

364
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Under the circumstances

365
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
We can

366
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Require the audience to do some

367
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Intuitive answer

368
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
For example, we can make

369
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Some of them have sounds

370
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Most of these sounds

371
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Most of them are exactly the same

372
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
There are some sounds

373
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Maybe we'll just make it

374
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
It's a little bit higher or a little bit lower

375
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
We're on the frequency domain

376
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
To make some adjustments

377
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
And then the audience

378
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Just

379
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
To participate in the experiment

380
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
The college student has to listen to that sound

381
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
If he hears a higher pitch

382
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
He'll press a button

383
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
If you hear a lower pitch

384
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Just press a button

385
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
It sounds like

386
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

387
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

388
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

389
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
You have to listen to the higher pitch

390
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
You have to react

391
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
And then the other

392
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Under the circumstances of irregular time

393
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
You can also do this kind of manipulation

394
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
And then we can go and see

395
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
For example

396
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Under the circumstances of regular time

397
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
The correct rate of his answer

398
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
It's going to be higher

399
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Under the circumstances of irregular time

400
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Then we can

401
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Psychologists usually say

402
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Oh, that's the regular time

403
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
It can help you

404
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Have a better sense

405
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Because you're better

406
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Because your accuracy is higher

407
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
You can have a more accurate answer

408
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
In this case

409
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
We can also do some

410
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Neuroscientific measurements

411
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
For example, I can measure people's brainwaves

412
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
This is a memory map

413
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
It's because of the nervous response of the brain

414
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
The nervous response of the brain

415
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
It's all about the nerve

416
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
It's all about the neurotransmitter

417
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
To do the reaction

418
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Then we can put those

419
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
For example, the ECG map

420
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Or the sensors for measuring muscle position

421
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
We'll put it on the scalp

422
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
That's because of the nerve response

423
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
It's going to be that wave signal

424
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
It's going to come out

425
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
So we can put it on the surface of the scalp

426
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Record this signal

427
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
That's what we call it

428
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
The signal of the brainwaves

429
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Then we can do some corresponding analysis

430
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
We can see that the brainwaves are

431
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
How to capture the regularity of this time

432
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
And then for example

433
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Let's do some complicated processing

434
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
And then we'll get

435
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Something like this

436
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
The answer is

437
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
We'll find out, for example

438
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
The brainwave

439
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
It's going to adjust the speed of its vibration

440
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
It's the same as the external stimulus

441
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
And then we just have to catch this

442
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
In the brain

443
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Imagine the nerve in the brain

444
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
It's like a decoder

445
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
It's going to be able to accurately capture

446
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
How to produce the next second

447
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
That's the traditional neuroscience

448
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Or psychologically

449
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
We're going to do this

450
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
A study of orientation

451
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
But this study is actually quite

452
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
OK, please go ahead

453
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
That's your time

454
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
That's the frequency

455
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
That cycle

456
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
How short can it be

457
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
You mean the cycle of my voice

458
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Or the cycle of the brainwaves

459
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
The cycle of the voice

460
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
And then there's the brainwaves

461
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
You're going to adjust it

462
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
If it's the same as your external

463
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Does it have a limit

464
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
This is a good question

465
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Usually humans can catch the beat

466
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
The shortest is the shortest between pain and pain

467
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
It's 200 milliseconds

468
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I can't sing so fast

469
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
It's about the same speed

470
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
More than 200 milliseconds

471
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
You probably think

472
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
It's almost a continuous sound

473
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
That's the slowest

474
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
It's the longest between pain and pain

475
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,500
It can be as long as 1,200 milliseconds

476
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
1.2 seconds

477
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
After that

478
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
You'll feel like every sound is independent

479
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
You don't think it's a continuous rhythm

480
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
You just can't

481
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Know the pattern

482
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
What's interesting is that the brainwaves

483
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Can only catch up

484
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Such a speed range

485
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
It's slower than this

486
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Or faster than this

487
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
There's no way

488
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
As for what causes what

489
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I don't know

490
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
It's because the brain can't move so fast

491
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Move so slow

492
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
To make us instinctively

493
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Can't catch up so fast

494
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Such a slow speed

495
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I don't know

496
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I can only say

497
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
This is what we have now

498
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Thank you

499
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Hello

500
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
So I'd like to ask

501
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
When you do this experiment

502
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Do you have to eliminate

503
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Other noise interference?

504
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
That's right

505
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
We do this kind of experiment

506
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Because we want to be clean

507
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
So we do it in the soundproof room

508
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
And then we'll use headphones

509
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
That is, we'll use those

510
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
More special headphones

511
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Just send the sound

512
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Into the ear

513
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
And it's very close

514
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
The more inside, the better

515
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
And then the sound is transmitted

516
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
It's all very clean

517
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I just want to reduce

518
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
External interference

519
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
That's right

520
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
So when you say

521
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
The so-called hearing

522
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
It means

523
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Human beings

524
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
We can really

525
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
The sound we hear

526
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Or include that

527
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Include that

528
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
The frequency we can't hear

529
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
It's also in the hearing

530
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
For example, ultrasonic waves or

531
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Very low frequency

532
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
That kind

533
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
That kind of hearing

534
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
That kind

535
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
That's what you're asking

536
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
That is to say

537
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Physical stimulation

538
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Does it stimulate psychological feelings?

539
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
That's what we say

540
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Will ask questions like this

541
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Of course

542
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Of course there are people

543
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Study such a question

544
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
That is to say

545
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Where is the limit of human hearing?

546
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Then you can see

547
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Where is the limit of frequency?

548
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
But this is not me

549
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Today

550
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Is the main part of the discussion

551
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Maybe we'll wait

552
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Discuss again later

553
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Like this

554
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I don't know if it's like this

555
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Or just

556
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
You can discuss it casually

557
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
No no no

558
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Because of me

559
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm more curious

560
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
When you say you want to eradicate

561
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
That interference

562
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
When noise interference

563
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
That's how you eradicate that kind

564
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
We don't know at all

565
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
The kind of interference we hear

566
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
For example, like ultrasonic waves

567
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
You are in that

568
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
What is that called

569
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
There is no noise at all

570
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
That kind of interference

571
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
In that kind of experimental environment

572
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
You can't guarantee

573
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
He won't be affected by the outside world

574
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
OK OK OK

575
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Then I know

576
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Of course we

577
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
What we do is

578
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
We already know

579
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Human hearing frequency range

580
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
It's about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz

581
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
In the frequency range of this Hz

582
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
We

583
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
In fact, in the experimental environment

584
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Can still measure

585
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
In the case of measurement

586
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
We will make a comparison

587
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
As for ultrasonic waves

588
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
We generally think it's human

589
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Physically, you can't hear it

590
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
So

591
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
So we don't care about his control

592
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
So for example

593
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
There is an ultrasonic wave in the lab

594
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
The sound of the ultrasonic wave

595
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Or that kind of very, very, very high frequency

596
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
We don't care

597
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
So it's based on an assumption

598
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Those things won't cause

599
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
It won't cause too much interference to humans

600
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Yes, it really won't

601
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
And the other thing is

602
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
In the case of our experiments

603
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
We don't say

604
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
One condition is to make a trial

605
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Of course we will do hundreds of trials

606
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Thousands of trials

607
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Even if there is an effect

608
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
As long as it is with your experiment

609
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
The program set by the computer

610
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
If it's not related to each other

611
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Then the effect we observe

612
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
These external effects

613
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It should be reduced a lot

614
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
OK, thank you

615
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Then

616
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Hey, copy it

617
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
That is to say

618
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
What about this POP process

619
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Of course you can decide for yourself

620
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
See if you want to say

621
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
To accept the middle question

622
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Or ask at the end

623
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Or open the discussion directly

624
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
You can decide

625
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Then but

626
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
That is

627
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
We

628
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
The prediction is that you can

629
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
You can talk for about an hour

630
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
And then

631
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
There will probably be a 20-minute discussion

632
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Ah

633
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
That's it

634
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
As for you

635
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Cut it in half

636
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Or mixed together

637
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
How do you decide

638
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Just decide for yourself

639
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
OK OK OK

640
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
OK

641
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Let me tell you first

642
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I actually didn't prepare a lot of POP

643
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I only prepared about 18 pages

644
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
So

645
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
So the topic part will be finished in a moment

646
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
If there are some related topics

647
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Sorry, I just didn't know what your question was

648
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
If it's related to listening or other music

649
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
We can wait until then to discuss

650
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
That if it has to do with the topic I'm talking about

651
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Of course we will raise it and discuss it live

652
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Sorry, I just didn't know what your question was

653
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
With this

654
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Where is the thing I'm talking about now

655
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
OK

656
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Well

657
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
But

658
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
OK, I will continue

659
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I think the biggest problem in doing research in the lab

660
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Is that

661
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
If what we want to know is

662
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
How people interact with each other normally

663
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
For example, interacting with each other by listening

664
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
But in fact, the two kinds of information

665
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Time-regulated and time-unregulated

666
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
This kind of experiment

667
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
The information I made in my computer

668
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
It doesn't exist in the natural world

669
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
In the natural world

670
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
You won't hear a

671
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Such accurate information like a decoder

672
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You won't hear a

673
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
A completely random message

674
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
You usually hear

675
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
A little regular

676
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
But it's not that regular

677
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
So if I do research like this

678
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
What does it do to understand my human

679
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
What is the real ability to help

680
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500
In fact, sometimes it is a bit biased

681
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
So

682
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
In fact, there is a very interesting paper

683
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
It was just published recently

684
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
It's called Neuroscience Needs Behavior

685
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
If you are interested in

686
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Related philosophy, scientific philosophy

687
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
If you are interested

688
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
I highly recommend this paper

689
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Then I will use the few pictures in it

690
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
To talk about

691
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
This research

692
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
The limitations of laboratory research

693
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Generally, we want to know

694
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
It can be said

695
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
For example, the neural pattern of the human brain

696
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
What is the relationship between natural behavior

697
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Then you can take the neural pattern

698
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
As a

699
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
For example, the psychological process

700
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
The psychological inner process can also be

701
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
This is what we want to know

702
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Then a better designed ideal experiment

703
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
That is to say

704
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
We can control

705
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,500
We know which part of the psychological process

706
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Or neural response

707
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Corresponding to some of our natural behaviors

708
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
We can have one-to-one

709
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Is the correspondence of one-to-one

710
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Or a simpler correspondence

711
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
But like the experiment we just did

712
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
In fact, the experiment just now

713
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Is the experiment I did

714
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
I did it myself

715
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Um, we

716
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
I actually designed an experiment

717
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
The situation is

718
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Humans are generally

719
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
It's not going to happen

720
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Then we are studying his neural response

721
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Although we can know

722
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
The relationship between these

723
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
But we can't answer directly

724
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
What is human nature

725
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
We can't answer

726
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Human natural reaction

727
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
So what we know is

728
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Some humans

729
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Supernormal ability

730
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
It's beyond his usual ability

731
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
but

732
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Our main research topics

733
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
In fact, there is no direct understanding

734
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
This is what I think

735
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Laboratory research

736
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Some big limitations

737
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Especially in other areas

738
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
There is such a situation

739
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
For example

740
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
If you want to manipulate social interaction

741
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
You are in a very small laboratory

742
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Basically can't do this

743
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Because our lab

744
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Basically looks like this

745
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Just a person

746
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Sitting in a small space

747
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Because we have to

748
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Like I just said

749
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Must control all external stimuli

750
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
So

751
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I often sit alone inside

752
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
In a very quiet situation

753
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Interact with the computer

754
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Then at the same time because

755
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Uh, our measuring tool

756
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
For example, uh, uh, uh

757
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
That side brain wave

758
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
The length of the line

759
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
He can only sit there

760
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
He can't do anything

761
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
He can only use two fingers to react

762
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
So actually this is also

763
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Very unnatural

764
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Then this is some

765
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Traditional laboratory environment

766
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Some restrictions given

767
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
OK

768
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Come here

769
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Everyone agrees that there are actually quite a lot of restrictions

770
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Then I

771
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
What I want to say is

772
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Then we

773
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
In our laboratory

774
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
How do we try to go

775
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Uh, extend to solve

776
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Such a barrier

777
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Uh, what I want to say first is

778
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Music can be a good research tool

779
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
It can be a research tool

780
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
As a

781
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Uh, to help study human mind activities

782
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
And neural reactions

783
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
He

784
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Uh, there are some very good ways

785
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
For example, I can keep

786
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
There is a good experimental situation

787
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
For example, today I

788
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
For example, look at this A picture on the far left

789
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I can ask the subject

790
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Ask someone to come in

791
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Then I'll give him a beater

792
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
I asked him

793
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Press the key of the piano

794
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Then the speed of pressing is exactly the same as the beater

795
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Then this is a

796
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
A good control experiment

797
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Then I can put this

798
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
The conditions I control are getting more and more relaxed

799
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
For example

800
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
I can ask

801
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
The computer generates a beater

802
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
But this beater is

803
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
At the speed of your pressing keys

804
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Then he will go

805
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Follow your speed

806
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
To change his own rhythm

807
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Or you can say

808
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Let two people play together

809
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Multiple people play

810
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Even in the case of multiple people playing

811
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
You and the audience are listening at the same time

812
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
That

813
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Moving more and more to the right of the score

814
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
That's what we call ecological interaction

815
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Interaction

816
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Ecological validity

817
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
That is to say, what you are studying

818
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Is

819
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Can correspond to human

820
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
In the case of real life

821
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
The more right-handed

822
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
That's what we think

823
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
More like real life

824
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Because when you play music

825
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
You will also have an audience listening

826
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
This can be understood

827
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
But on the right side of the score

828
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
In fact, your experimental control

829
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
It's getting worse and worse

830
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
So for example

831
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
When a group of people play music

832
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
If they decide together

833
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
To speed up or slow down

834
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
What do you want

835
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
This is not your experiment

836
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Things that can be decided in advance

837
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
The information you get in the end

838
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
It will be difficult for you to explain

839
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
That music can be a good tool

840
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Just because he can

841
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Get some kind of balance in the middle

842
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
For example, when the two of them interact

843
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
They may not be random

844
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Play the music they want

845
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I can give him a score

846
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Ask them to play according to the score

847
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
And if they have

848
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
If they play the wrong note

849
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
In fact, we can

850
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
From the recording afterwards

851
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
To find out about this

852
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
So we can know

853
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
What did he do wrong

854
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I can also know

855
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
What is the correct answer

856
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
And we can set

857
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
That is to say

858
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
What is the rhythm he wants to play

859
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
So we still have some control

860
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
But even under these conditions

861
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Their activities

862
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Still very

863
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
An activity that is very close to human behavior

864
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
So we think music

865
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Can be a good tool

866
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
To study human interaction

867
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
But there is also auditory communication

868
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
And it can balance

869
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Experimental control and ecological efficiency

870
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,500
These two big problems

871
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
And another advantage of music is

872
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
You said music is a good research tool

873
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
The reason is

874
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
It sounds like it's because he can be

875
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
That is, he can have this

876
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
From experimental control

877
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
To ecological interaction

878
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
The whole spectrum

879
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
But then you think

880
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
What research tool

881
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Um

882
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
How to research

883
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Is there no such thing as language?

884
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Language, can you

885
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Yeah, so I think I don't really understand

886
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
That's why he's a special

887
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Good research tool

888
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
I didn't say he was particularly good

889
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
I said he could be a good research tool

890
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
OK, good

891
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
So I understood this time

892
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
What you mean is

893
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
He can span the whole spectrum

894
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
He can span the whole spectrum

895
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Language is of course

896
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
You can communicate with the computer

897
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Language communication

898
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Or the language between people

899
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Communicate with others

900
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Yes, language is also a good research tool

901
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
My language is on

902
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
There is a difficulty in neuroscience

903
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Because when you want to talk

904
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Mouth to move

905
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
And then actually

906
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
It's a bit difficult to measure signals

907
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Of course, this is an externalization

908
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
But I think language is also a

909
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
It's still a good tool

910
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I understand

911
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
I understand

912
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
I didn't say music is the best

913
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
He is one of them

914
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
And then

915
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
And another advantage of music is

916
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
He is a special one

917
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
A special activity

918
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,500
But in fact, in each culture

919
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
There are music activities

920
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
And humans actually spend

921
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Spend a lot of resources

922
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
In music activities

923
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
A lot of time and resources

924
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
In music activities

925
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
So we think

926
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Research on music activities

927
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
In fact, it can also be

928
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
He is a reflection of a human being

929
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
A very basic behavior

930
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
With a capability

931
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
OK

932
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
So

933
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
So you say music is a good research tool

934
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
It means

935
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
For example, you want to measure his brain

936
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
How does the brain work

937
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
You just play music for them

938
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Is it similar to this

939
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Is this a research method

940
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Play music for them

941
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Or let them

942
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Let them play music

943
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
So that means

944
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
You can have a

945
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
A spectrum

946
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
You can go from the far left

947
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Play music for them

948
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I have already designed this music in advance

949
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
All the way to the far right

950
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
For example, you can

951
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Interact with the music

952
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
For example, singing karaoke

953
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Or if there is no music

954
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Two people play music with each other

955
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
OK

956
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Everyone has a question

957
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
OK

958
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I have a simple question

959
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
It's like this

960
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Because it's said here

961
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
We may start from here

962
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
More and more

963
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
More and more

964
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
About music as a

965
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Research tool

966
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
So I want to clarify

967
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
A simple question

968
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
What we are discussing now is

969
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Sound is a good research tool

970
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Or music is a

971
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
A specific

972
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
There is a clear subset

973
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
In the sound

974
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Or are we discussing

975
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Sound as a research tool

976
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I would say it's music

977
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Because

978
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
If I talk about sound

979
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
It's just a definition

980
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Because

981
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Because sound

982
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Can you repeat your question?

983
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Yes, so my question is actually

984
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
You are talking about music

985
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
A good research tool

986
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
What kind of sound

987
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Don't you think it's

988
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
You want to use it as

989
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
The definition of music

990
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Research tool

991
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
I understand

992
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Yes

993
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
I forgot to say before

994
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
In fact, in traditional research

995
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
In terms of listening

996
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
We will use computer synthesis

997
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
That's a very

998
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
It's like you pick up the phone

999
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
To hear that kind of sound

1000
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Or more than that

1001
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
A lot of noise

1002
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
These things

1003
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
We all know

1004
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Basic listening

1005
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Materials used

1006
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
But in general

1007
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
We don't use

1008
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
That kind of material

1009
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
And then we

1010
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
And

1011
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
In addition

1012
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
When we study listening

1013
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Often we will present

1014
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
A completely unchanging sound

1015
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
A complete array

1016
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
For example, show it for one second

1017
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
But in the natural world

1018
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
All the sounds

1019
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
It's probably the first time

1020
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
It's gone

1021
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
It won't have the same stimulus

1022
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Repeat repeat

1023
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
And music

1024
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
It has another component

1025
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
That is, it has

1026
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
More social interaction

1027
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
It's not just about making sounds

1028
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
It's not just about making

1029
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
I'm going to knock on the table today

1030
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Make a sound

1031
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Instead, people will

1032
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
According to your voice

1033
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
And then he has a response

1034
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
And then he makes a new action

1035
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Does that answer the question?

1036
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Yes yes

1037
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Yes yes

1038
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Thank you

1039
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
OK OK

1040
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
OK

1041
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Everyone's questions are very good

1042
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
That

1043
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
In our study

1044
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
The example is

1045
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
We want to understand

1046
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Play with music

1047
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
As an example of a model

1048
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Is a model of social interaction

1049
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
How do we measure cooperation

1050
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
And then we have to understand

1051
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Is the relationship between the leader and the follower

1052
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
And then we have to

1053
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
What direction to go

1054
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
To do this research

1055
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Ah this photo

1056
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Is a photo of our lab

1057
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Then I just found

1058
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
We have a short film before the lab

1059
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
OK

1060
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Show it to everyone

1061
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
I hope everyone can hear the sound

1062
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Uh, there's a two and a half minute introduction

1063
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
String quartet

1064
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Is just as exciting and challenging

1065
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Canadian cellist Adrian Fung

1066
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
And his colleagues are fitted with

1067
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Specially designed caps and sensors

1068
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
You put them in front of your shirt

1069
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
And wired to monitors

1070
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,500
That measure their brain activity and heart rate

1071
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Motion capture cameras

1072
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Record their movements too

1073
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Researchers are studying

1074
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
How the musicians communicate with each other

1075
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
During a performance

1076
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Without using a single word

1077
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
How do they use movements

1078
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
What gestures do the musicians make

1079
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
That make it possible for them

1080
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
To communicate with each other

1081
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,500
And to communicate with members of the audience

1082
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
They're all wired up too

1083
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
To study how they respond

1084
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Physically and emotionally

1085
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
To the performers on stage

1086
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
What's great about this

1087
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Is it affords us the ability

1088
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
To see how effective we are as communicators

1089
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
The theatre is state-of-the-art technology

1090
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Including a sound system

1091
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
With incredible acoustics

1092
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Here with just a tap on a tablet

1093
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,500
I'll make it extremely reverberant in here

1094
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Sort of like a cathedral

1095
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
The room is transformed

1096
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
A cool feature that serves

1097
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
A wider, more scientific purpose

1098
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
One that could help researchers

1099
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Design a better hearing aid

1100
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
For the hearing impaired

1101
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
So, ratting

1102
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Ratting

1103
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Background noise is coming out of all the speakers

1104
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
It's a multi-channel surround mix

1105
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
And then we can test how well

1106
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Does a person with a hearing aid

1107
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Comprehend speech

1108
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
That's presented to them

1109
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
In an environment like this

1110
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Instead of in the quiet room

1111
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
But for now

1112
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Most of the research is focused on music

1113
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
And its therapeutic powers

1114
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Researchers hope their findings

1115
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Will uncover how some rhythms

1116
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Might help an autistic child

1117
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Or why a musical beat

1118
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Can improve the gait of a patient

1119
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
With Parkinson's disease

1120
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
In order to understand

1121
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
What's going on in the brain

1122
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
We need to know how it's done

1123
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
In typical populations

1124
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Once we understand that

1125
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
And we know that music

1126
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Can help people with Parkinson's

1127
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Or we know that music has an effect

1128
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
On children with autism

1129
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
We can start to understand

1130
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
The deep reasons for that

1131
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
We can perfect the therapies

1132
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
That we give these people

1133
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
And add to mounting evidence

1134
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
That music is good medicine

1135
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
For the brain

1136
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Cass Roossey, CBC News, Toronto

1137
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Can everyone hear the sound

1138
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
From the video?

1139
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Yes, we can

1140
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
We are lucky

1141
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Our lab

1142
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Has built a music room

1143
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
With the same size

1144
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
With a stage

1145
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
And a seat for the audience

1146
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
And those can be adjusted

1147
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
So in general

1148
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Just like just now

1149
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Sorry, I don't know who asked

1150
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
In general

1151
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
We can't control a lot of environmental factors

1152
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
But in this case

1153
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
We can let a large space

1154
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
To be controlled

1155
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
And in this space

1156
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
We can do some precise measurements

1157
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
And experiments

1158
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
So our lab

1159
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Can solve the trade-off

1160
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Between experimental control

1161
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
And eco-efficient

1162
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
A little bit

1163
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
So this research

1164
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Is done in this situation

1165
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
And you can see

1166
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
The situation of this bottle

1167
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
You can see

1168
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
There is a ball

1169
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
It is a motion capture marker

1170
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
We can use the camera

1171
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
To capture the red light

1172
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
And we can build

1173
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
The body movement

1174
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
And the time

1175
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
And the location

1176
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
So when we measure

1177
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
The image will look like this

1178
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
It is a 3D image

1179
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
It is the body movement

1180
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
It is the shoulder

1181
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
It is the right arm

1182
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
And the head

1183
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
So our research is

1184
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Can we use

1185
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
The easiest index

1186
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Like the body movement

1187
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
To understand

1188
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
The human interaction

1189
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
And the leader

1190
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
And the follower

1191
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
We want to start

1192
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
From the easiest

1193
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
And the simplest

1194
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
So there are some questions

1195
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
If we want to do anything

1196
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
We do something

1197
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
The body must have a lot of movements

1198
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Like playing music

1199
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
We can start from the simple

1200
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
For example

1201
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
If I play the piano

1202
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I can study the simple movements

1203
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Like the time

1204
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
The difference between the time

1205
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
And the person

1206
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
We can see

1207
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
The difference between the time

1208
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
And the person

1209
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
But there is a big problem

1210
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
When we do this research

1211
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
The time of each player

1212
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
The time of each player

1213
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
The time of each player

1214
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Is affected by the music

1215
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
And the music

1216
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
And the music

1217
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
So even if we measure

1218
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
The result

1219
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
We can only see

1220
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
The music

1221
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
And the performance

1222
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
And the performance

1223
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
We can't measure the actual

1224
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Interaction

1225
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
This is a limitation

1226
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Another interesting signal

1227
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
We can measure

1228
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
The whole body movement

1229
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
For example

1230
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
The body movement

1231
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Is not only in the music

1232
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
But also in the daily conversation

1233
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
If you measure

1234
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
The body movement

1235
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
The body movement

1236
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
The index

1237
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Is the addition of the whole body movement

1238
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
For example

1239
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
If I raise my arm

1240
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
My body needs to lean back

1241
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
To balance the center

1242
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Otherwise you will fall

1243
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Another interesting thing

1244
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
The music itself

1245
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Doesn't require you to move your body

1246
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
When you talk

1247
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
But people will naturally do this

1248
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
So it's not limited to the music

1249
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
It's not limited to

1250
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
What you do

1251
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
It's not limited to

1252
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
What you say

1253
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
It's something that happens naturally

1254
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
So it may reflect

1255
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
A psychological process

1256
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
We think it can be a good index

1257
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
So

1258
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
The first problem is

1259
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
We decide to measure

1260
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
The whole signal

1261
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Don't just measure the finger

1262
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
The other problem is

1263
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
We know what to measure

1264
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
How do we use

1265
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Traditionally

1266
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
We get this time series signal

1267
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
We can see the relationship

1268
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Between the two signals

1269
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
We call it cross correlation

1270
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
A big limitation of cross correlation

1271
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Is that it can only tell you

1272
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
How similar the two signals are

1273
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
But if today

1274
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
In the case of interaction

1275
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Usually there will be a leader

1276
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
For example, four people move chairs together

1277
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
There must be a person shouting slogans

1278
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Now 321 everyone moves together

1279
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
So if we want to know

1280
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Social interaction

1281
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
The direction of social interaction is also important

1282
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
But cross correlation analysis

1283
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Can't tell you the result

1284
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
The other analysis is

1285
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Granger causality

1286
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Granger causality

1287
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
It was originally invented by economists

1288
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
A mathematical method

1289
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
It mainly reflects

1290
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
A time series signal

1291
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
To what extent

1292
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
To predict

1293
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
A time series signal

1294
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
If it can predict

1295
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
We can say

1296
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
The first time series

1297
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
It can affect time series B

1298
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
But it doesn't matter

1299
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
There are many

1300
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Methodological disputes

1301
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
But we have to say

1302
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
We can measure

1303
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
How much of the first series

1304
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Can predict the second series

1305
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
We can

1306
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
Reflect the direction of message transmission

1307
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
So we think

1308
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Granger causality is more than traditional

1309
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Related measurement

1310
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Is to provide more human

1311
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Interaction

1312
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
So now we know what to measure

1313
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Then we know

1314
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
How to analyze

1315
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
The third question is what they want to do

1316
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
We just play music

1317
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
If so

1318
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
We just observe

1319
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
Scientific research

1320
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
We need to separate

1321
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
What we are interested in

1322
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
And what we naturally observe

1323
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
We need to know

1324
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Will it affect our observation

1325
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
This is to understand

1326
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
What we are interested in

1327
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
So on the stage

1328
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
They will do

1329
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
This is just a summary

1330
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
It will have front and back movements

1331
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
We have to measure this

1332
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Then we want it to play

1333
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Bach's Hymn

1334
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
And while playing

1335
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
We did one thing

1336
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
It's a little different from normal music

1337
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
We will randomly point

1338
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
One of the people as the leader

1339
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Usually in the case of music

1340
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
For example, rock band

1341
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
The lead singer is usually the leader

1342
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Everyone has to follow the speed of the lead singer

1343
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Follow the volume of the lead singer

1344
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,500
To make adjustments

1345
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
It's the same in the case of music

1346
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Usually the first violin is the leader

1347
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
But in Bach's Hymn

1348
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
The advantage of this piece is

1349
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
The relationship between the leader and the follower

1350
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
So when we do experiments

1351
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
We tell them in addition

1352
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
For example

1353
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
We only play the violin today

1354
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
For example, the third row

1355
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
You are the leader today

1356
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
You are going to lead the other three people

1357
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
To play this music

1358
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
And while we are playing this music

1359
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
In order to

1360
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Close to natural interaction

1361
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
So they play this music

1362
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
They have never rehearsed before

1363
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
This is the first time I saw this score

1364
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Then they played for the first time

1365
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Then ask them to interact

1366
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
And we

1367
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
When we point out who is the leader

1368
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
We also give him a note

1369
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Everyone can only see their own role

1370
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
If you are the leader, of course you know you are the leader

1371
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
But if you are a follower

1372
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Then you can only know that one of them is the leader

1373
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Then I have to try to find

1374
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Who is the leader and then I have to follow him

1375
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
It's a bit like a guessing game

1376
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
OK

1377
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
This is the part of our experiment

1378
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
We experiment on the society

1379
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Who is the leader

1380
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Who is the follower

1381
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Then we hope

1382
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
If our measurement is effective

1383
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
It should be able to reflect

1384
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
We follow the leader

1385
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
A relationship of such manipulation

1386
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
It should be able to reflect our experimental manipulation

1387
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
OK

1388
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
So the information we get is like this

1389
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Their body movements

1390
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Then for example, the relationship between the first step of the violin and the second step of the violin

1391
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Then according to the measure

1392
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
That is to say

1393
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
The first violin

1394
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
How much to predict the second violin

1395
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
This body movement

1396
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Then in the case of the four-axis

1397
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
We have 12

1398
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
The direction of possible message transmission

1399
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
This is the direction of all message transmission

1400
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Then

1401
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Through our experimental manipulation

1402
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
For example, we are in a piece of music

1403
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
We call the first violin

1404
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
It says V1 on it

1405
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Then

1406
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
So the direction of these three messages

1407
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
It will be the relationship between the leader and the follower

1408
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
The opposite direction is

1409
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
The relationship between the follower and the leader

1410
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Then the rest of the direction

1411
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Is the relationship between the follower and the follower

1412
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
OK

1413
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Then I just use English to put it

1414
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Leader follower follower

1415
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
So that means we

1416
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Through the manipulation of this experiment

1417
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Everyone of us

1418
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Interactive relationship between them

1419
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Different situations

1420
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
Then if we are in the next situation

1421
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
For example, if the second violin is the leader

1422
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Then all the colors of these arrows

1423
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Will exchange

1424
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
Will exchange

1425
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Is there a problem here?

1426
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
This is the more complicated part of the experimental manipulation

1427
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I want to ask

1428
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
You just said that

1429
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
What is the tune of the performance

1430
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
I don't know about music, but what is it?

1431
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
That means

1432
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
Does it already exist in this world?

1433
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
That's right

1434
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
We let him find something to do

1435
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
Will it be like this?

1436
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
For example, these four people

1437
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Someone in particular

1438
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
I've known this song for a long time

1439
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Then it will affect the results of the study

1440
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,500
This is a good question

1441
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
So we are special

1442
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
Special is that we have confirmed with the musicians

1443
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,500
They haven't played these songs

1444
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
It's the first time

1445
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
Then these musicians

1446
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
We are looking for more professional musicians

1447
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
So they got these songs for the first time

1448
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,500
They can start cooperating right away

1449
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
OK, thank you

1450
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
This is a good question

1451
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
This reviewer also asked

1452
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Then the next thing is

1453
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Get the result of our experiment

1454
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
The three points on the X-axis are different situations

1455
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Then the Y-axis is

1456
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,500
The strength of Grand Jack Casualty

1457
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
The higher the Y-axis

1458
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
The higher the Y value

1459
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
The stronger the transmission in this direction

1460
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Then this is the result of the experiment

1461
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,500
You can see it

1462
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
You can see it from here

1463
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
From the leader to the follower

1464
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
Their information

1465
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
The amount of transmission is the highest

1466
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,500
It's the highest compared to other situations

1467
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
OK, this is a

1468
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
The statistics show that

1469
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
And then we have another one

1470
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
The manipulation is to say that they are playing

1471
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Can you see other people

1472
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,500
We found that

1473
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
This effect is relatively strong

1474
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
But even if you can't see it

1475
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Even if it's just playing music

1476
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
There is no visual information

1477
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
You don't know what other people are doing

1478
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
You see what other people are doing

1479
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
You still have this effect

1480
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
OK

1481
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,500
This is our main finding of the experiment

1482
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,500
Basically it means

1483
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,500
The overall action can reflect the direction of information transmission

1484
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,500
Then see the other person

1485
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Will this

1486
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,500
This communication is helpful

1487
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,500
OK

1488
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,500
This is the first result

1489
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,500
The second result is

1490
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
Sorry, you say

1491
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
I see your

1492
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
Non-seeing condition

1493
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,500
I can't speak Chinese

1494
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Follower

1495
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
This is the difference between FL and FF

1496
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
There is a difference in dark gray

1497
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
Is there any difference in light gray?

1498
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
No

1499
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Oh

1500
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,500
This is quite interesting

1501
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,500
This means

1502
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Leader actually ignores

1503
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Not affected by Follower

1504
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Relative to the relationship between Follower and Follower

1505
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
That's what it means

1506
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
And this is only in non-seeing

1507
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Follower and Follower

1508
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Need to coordinate with each other

1509
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
But the leader doesn't need to adapt to Follower

1510
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
It will look like this

1511
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
But this is only

1512
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
In non-seeing

1513
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
An obvious effect

1514
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
The experience of non-seeing

1515
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Maybe

1516
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Make some noise

1517
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Make it more difficult

1518
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Not to be affected by Follower

1519
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
Of course this needs to be replicated

1520
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
This is a small difference

1521
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Or did you analyze the interaction?

1522
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Did you find it

1523
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
Sorry

1524
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Your

1525
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
There is no difference between the two white bars

1526
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
There is a difference between the two dark gray bars

1527
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Is there any difference in this difference?

1528
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
No

1529
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
I looked at all the interactions

1530
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
OK

1531
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Thank you

1532
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
You're welcome

1533
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,500
We actually replicated this thing

1534
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,500
But you just said

1535
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
The difference between the two dark gray bars

1536
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
The difference between the two dark gray bars

1537
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
Actually did not appear in the replication

1538
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
So

1539
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
So

1540
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,500
We didn't explain too much on paper

1541
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
What is the reason

1542
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Not very clear

1543
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
But basically it can be found

1544
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
The body movement can reflect the direction of information transmission

1545
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Reflect the direction of information transmission

1546
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
But I don't think this is very interesting

1547
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Because

1548
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,500
What does this have to do with playing music?

1549
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Just a bunch of people moving around in the studio

1550
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Who moves first

1551
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Then we

1552
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
In fact, after they play every song

1553
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
We ask musicians to use a scale

1554
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
To evaluate how well you feel

1555
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
Then

1556
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
We asked him to evaluate three items

1557
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
What is the overall quality of the performance?

1558
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
1 to 5 points

1559
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Then the synchronization of time

1560
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Is it very synchronized?

1561
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Then the difficulty of the cooperation

1562
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Is there a difference?

1563
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Then we go to them

1564
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
The amount of Granger Casualty

1565
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
To do

1566
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
Then we found

1567
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
This X axis is

1568
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
For example, here is very good

1569
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
The far right is very good

1570
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Then the Y axis is

1571
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Basically

1572
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
The overall amount of information exchange

1573
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Then we found

1574
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
In fact, the quality of this performance

1575
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
With causal density

1576
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,500
With the amount of information exchange

1577
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
The coupling of body movements

1578
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,500
Is related

1579
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Then there is also some correlation with the synchronization of time

1580
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
But in my second time

1581
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
Replication

1582
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Only the overall quality of the performance is related

1583
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
So that is

1584
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
The amount of information transfer

1585
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,500
This body movement

1586
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Not only reflects the direction of information transfer

1587
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Then the amount of information transfer

1588
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
It seems to be with the quality of cooperation

1589
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,500
Can reflect their quality of cooperation

1590
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
So that is

1591
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
Summarize what we learned

1592
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
That is to say

1593
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Learned in a multi-person cooperation environment

1594
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Can be observed from the body movement

1595
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Direction of information transfer

1596
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Then even if this is a

1597
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Listening and action-based homework

1598
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
But can you visually see the other person

1599
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
It seems to be a very important communication channel

1600
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Then the overall action

1601
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,500
Information flow

1602
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
By measuring the body movement

1603
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
The amount of information activity can reflect the quality of cooperation

1604
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Then

1605
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
In fact, these three points

1606
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,500
For everyone

1607
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
In fact, if you don't do research, you will probably get this result

1608
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Then we think the biggest value

1609
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
That is to say, we actually provide

1610
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
A very low-threshold research method

1611
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
As long as you don't have to be in our

1612
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,500
Such a laboratory for observation

1613
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
You can observe in any natural situation

1614
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,500
You can use imaging analysis

1615
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
To observe their

1616
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Physical actions between people

1617
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
You may be able to observe in a natural situation

1618
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
The group behavior between people

1619
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
We are just in a better and more precise

1620
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Under the control of the laboratory

1621
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Prove that this effect should exist

1622
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Should be an effective index

1623
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
Then I think that is

1624
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
Provided may follow-up researchers

1625
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
If you want to study complex social behavior

1626
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
At least

1627
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
He may now have a tool

1628
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
I have a question

1629
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Sorry

1630
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
You said

1631
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
I don't understand the second point

1632
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
The third point is the second point

1633
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
I thought the result was

1634
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
If they are facing each other

1635
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
So in the absence of

1636
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
This result is still the same

1637
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,500
Still have

1638
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,500
But its effect is weaker

1639
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
Then

1640
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
There is a main effect

1641
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Simple main effect

1642
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,500
Leader to follower

1643
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Leader to follower

1644
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
In this direction

1645
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
See each other

1646
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Much better than not seeing each other

1647
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
But

1648
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
In fact, both sides are still effective

1649
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
So this is my

1650
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
The third question is

1651
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
What is the direction of causal relationship?

1652
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
For example

1653
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
This

1654
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
This communication channel is because of

1655
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Communication on music

1656
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
Caused your body to move like this

1657
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Following

1658
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Or your body moves like this

1659
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
Caused the progress of music

1660
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Because if

1661
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
If you can't see your body now

1662
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,500
Body sway or follow each other

1663
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
It means that it is not visual communication at all

1664
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
Is hearing

1665
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
Or the essence of music

1666
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,500
Caused by

1667
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Natural body reaction

1668
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Is a real cause

1669
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
I didn't say it was a cause

1670
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,500
I just said it was a reaction

1671
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
Indicator

1672
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,500
I said it was

1673
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
When we play music

1674
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
Actually don't need

1675
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Body to do this action

1676
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
But we still do

1677
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
Then this information seems to reflect

1678
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Direction of information transmission

1679
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
And the quality of its cooperation

1680
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
So you don't think

1681
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
It is functional

1682
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
It's just a indicator

1683
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,500
It's just a indicator that you can measure

1684
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
I'm conservative

1685
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
I'm conservative

1686
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,500
I don't know

1687
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,500
I can't prove it yet

1688
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,500
There are other studies

1689
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
Some people are

1690
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,500
Block the whole person

1691
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Then measure their time

1692
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,500
The time difference between each other's buttons

1693
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,500
It is true that the time difference between the buttons

1694
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,500
Will affect

1695
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,500
But I think

1696
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,500
The conclusion is

1697
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,500
My current research

1698
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,500
My current results can only say

1699
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
It can be reflected

1700
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Maybe it's just a related indicator

1701
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,500
But its function

1702
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,500
Is it part of the communication itself

1703
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,500
Is it that I want to see other people's body movements

1704
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,500
Or part of it

1705
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
I don't know about this

1706
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,500
Because like you said

1707
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Even if you can't see it, the body movements have this effect

1708
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Understand

1709
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
I have another question with Zhang Ting

1710
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,500
I have another question with Zhang Ting

1711
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,500
But it's not directly

1712
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,500
About your research itself

1713
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
But we want something very interesting from your research

1714
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
If we

1715
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
This Baja

1716
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
Because you just emphasized

1717
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,500
Its four characters are actually relative

1718
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,500
What is that called

1719
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Responsibility is more average

1720
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
So you can randomly assign who you are

1721
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,500
But if we change it to jazz four beats

1722
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,500
That kind of character is very strong

1723
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,500
You expect

1724
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
The effect size will become very strong

1725
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Or will they break down

1726
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,500
Because they don't know who they are

1727
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Suppose you don't assign

1728
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,500
I know

1729
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,500
This is our experiment 2

1730
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Actually we

1731
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
We also did it

1732
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,500
I didn't post it today, but this is experiment 2

1733
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,500
In the case of experiment 2

1734
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
We don't have that kind of jazz four beats

1735
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
We want them to play

1736
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Mozart's music

1737
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
Mozart's music

1738
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
If you look at the score

1739
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,500
All the melodies are in the first minor

1740
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
The other parts are just beats

1741
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
But we still do exactly the same

1742
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Even if we say the cello is just beat

1743
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
You still have to lead the cello

1744
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,500
To play his music

1745
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
So this is basically the same as you think

1746
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,500
The result is

1747
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,500
I go back to the previous slide

1748
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
This is what I just said

1749
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
Replication

1750
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,500
There are still three lines above

1751
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
The following three lines are gone

1752
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,500
So we are in a task

1753
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Is an unbalanced starting point

1754
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,500
We do manipulation

1755
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,500
Still see the above effects

1756
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
But he is actually weak overall

1757
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
Then we measure

1758
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
That is to say

1759
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
In the case of bassline

1760
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Is the strength of the grunge causality between each other

1761
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,500
How much

1762
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,500
We found that in the case of playing Mozart's music

1763
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,500
The bassline is more uneven

1764
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,500
In the case of playing Bach

1765
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
The bassline is average

1766
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,500
This is the effect of this bassline

1767
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,500
This effect

1768
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,500
It actually shows that this is functional

1769
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,500
Because you are in the case of non-sync

1770
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
When this music itself

1771
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,500
When there is no such message

1772
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,500
When this music itself has an obvious bias

1773
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,500
It's hard for you to have one

1774
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
For example, in the case of a cello

1775
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,500
Without seeing your body

1776
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,500
But

1777
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
When you see

1778
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,500
It still produces an effect

1779
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
It means he is

1780
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Link

1781
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
I suddenly feel like I'm talking about

1782
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Because although

1783
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
But we didn't

1784
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
But the music itself is also

1785
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Actually explained

1786
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,500
Then we

1787
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
I think it's a bit difficult

1788
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,500
difficult

1789
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,500
I think even if there is such a difference

1790
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
Just say there is this possibility

1791
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
But answer the question directly

1792
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
For example, I tied the musician

1793
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,500
Tied to the chair

1794
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
I can't move

1795
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,500
This is a direct manipulation

1796
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
Do you agree with me

1797
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500
I don't know, I can't figure it out

1798
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,500
I have to think about it

1799
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,500
That is to say, I can't let you move today

1800
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
See if the quality of your performance will be reduced

1801
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
You obviously have a lot of barriers

1802
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,500
You can't do that

1803
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,500
I'm still thinking

1804
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
The evidence just now is not enough

1805
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,500
He seems to be able to prove

1806
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,500
You still find this body

1807
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,500
The reaction is related to the cause and effect

1808
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Follower

1809
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,500
This is related to the leader

1810
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,500
But the cause and effect of this relationship does not mean

1811
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
Music performance

1812
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Cause and effect between body sway

1813
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,500
So it's not a good evidence

1814
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
Have you always been like this

1815
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,500
I'm a little confused

1816
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
I'm also confused

1817
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
When we wrote the paper

1818
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
In fact, different authors are thinking

1819
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,500
Some authors argue directly

1820
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,500
Body sway is communication

1821
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
But

1822
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,500
I don't think you have that evidence

1823
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,500
I think the evidence is not direct

1824
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,500
Then I'll be safe

1825
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,500
Then discuss

1826
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,500
But I don't know

1827
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,500
I think there are two causal relationships

1828
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
One causal relationship is the body sway of the leader

1829
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
Causing the body sway of the follower

1830
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,500
This is the analysis you are doing now

1831
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
As long as the bar on your left is higher

1832
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
It means that this causality exists

1833
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
But

1834
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,500
You finish first

1835
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
But another causal relationship

1836
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Music communication

1837
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
Causal relationship between body sway

1838
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,500
Is body sway

1839
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
Is the cause of music communication

1840
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,500
The first point

1841
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
About grunge causality

1842
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,500
I guess many listeners may know

1843
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
It is actually argued

1844
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Causality is a big problem

1845
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
Mathematically

1846
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
It can only say

1847
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
The amount of information transfer

1848
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
Is there really a cause?

1849
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
There must be some other situations

1850
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,500
For example, I have to sample

1851
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,500
The whole universe

1852
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
And you have to assume

1853
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
Anyway, there are some situations

1854
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
Anyway, it's conservative

1855
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
Mathematically, I can only say

1856
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
A predict B

1857
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,500
Can't say A cause B

1858
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
You can say causality

1859
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,500
Because it is the difference in time

1860
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
This message leads to this message

1861
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500
What other factors do you have in body sway

1862
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,500
Will lead to this change

1863
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
There may be a third reason for music

1864
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
In short, I think

1865
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
Alternative is limited

1866
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
Not any possible hypothesis

1867
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
These alternatives sound

1868
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,500
Not very

1869
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,500
Not very convincing

1870
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
So I think even if it's a bit risky

1871
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,500
You can still argue

1872
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,500
But on the other hand

1873
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,500
What you really care about is

1874
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,500
Body movement response

1875
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,500
Is this message

1876
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Is it music communication itself

1877
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,500
Does it cause better music quality

1878
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Is it a good communication

1879
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
This sound

1880
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
But this seems to need other evidence

1881
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
That's right

1882
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,500
I'm conservative

1883
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
I think you are conservative

1884
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
My bubble is gone

1885
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
So everyone is welcome to discuss freely

1886
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
It doesn't matter

1887
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
I would like to ask you this experiment

1888
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,500
You are talking about this experiment now

1889
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,500
For example, how many groups do you want to do

1890
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Is a group

1891
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,500
Or how many musicians

1892
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,500
There is a way to get one

1893
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,500
Is relatively unrecognized

1894
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,500
For example, the culture of the performer

1895
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
Or the level of training of the performer

1896
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,500
Is less disturbed by this aspect

1897
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,500
OK, I think you asked this question very well

1898
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
I think this is the weakness of this study

1899
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
Because first of all

1900
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
We are looking for very high-level musicians

1901
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,500
That is, you have to pay a lot of money

1902
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,500
The kind of concert to buy a ticket

1903
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,500
They will come

1904
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,500
Because of the financial restrictions

1905
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,500
We found two groups

1906
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
We found two groups

1907
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,500
In terms of statistical methods

1908
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,500
We think it's better to say

1909
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,500
We are all

1910
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,500
We call it within subject comparison

1911
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,500
Compare yourself to yourself

1912
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,500
That is, in the case of yourself

1913
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
How much stronger is this effect

1914
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,500
So even if

1915
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,500
The sample we took

1916
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,500
Is very limited, that is, two groups of musicians

1917
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
A total of eight people

1918
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,500
But within each person

1919
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Their direction of effect is consistent

1920
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Is it possible

1921
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
I took some very biased samples

1922
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
For example, these musicians do not represent all humans

1923
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
It is possible

1924
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,500
This is the weakness of this study

1925
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
How high is this representation

1926
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
I do not know

1927
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,500
I can only say from other current studies

1928
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,500
Musicians and normal humans

1929
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,500
The representation is actually

1930
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,500
It can represent

1931
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Ordinary human beings

1932
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Other cultures

1933
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
This is also a matter of representation

1934
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,500
It is also said that the representation is still OK

1935
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,500
It is also said that the representation is still OK

1936
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,500
It's just that I don't have direct evidence

1937
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,500
Say this effect

1938
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,500
Can it represent the effect of all humans

1939
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,500
I don't know

1940
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Is it conservative

1941
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,500
It's okay

1942
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,500
I have a question

1943
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,500
You ask first, you finish first

1944
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,500
It's okay, my next question has nothing to do with this

1945
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,500
So you can continue to ask other questions

1946
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
You mentioned quarreling at the beginning

1947
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
But quarreling

1948
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,500
It doesn't seem to be sung

1949
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
I want to know

1950
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,500
It can also be sung

1951
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
So I want to ask

1952
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
The question is

1953
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
The results are already here

1954
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,500
How big do you think it is

1955
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,500
How big can it be

1956
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,500
Let us predict

1957
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Or provide us

1958
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Language communication

1959
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
Knowledge

1960
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,500
What kind of implications

1961
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,500
What kind of implications

1962
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,500
If there are some

1963
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
Weaknesses

1964
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
Where it can't be inferred

1965
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,500
Some research that may need to be supplemented

1966
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,500
What will it be

1967
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,500
To the part of speech

1968
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
OK

1969
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,500
First of all

1970
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,500
About body movements

1971
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Most of the research is actually done in the case of speech

1972
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,500
But what they do is

1973
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,500
In a small lab

1974
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
Two people

1975
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
Use relevant methods

1976
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
That

1977
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
There are other research around

1978
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
In fact

1979
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,500
Music performance and speech

1980
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
The psychological process they use

1981
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,500
Actually very similar

1982
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,500
Then we are equal to

1983
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,500
In the case of music, we also observed

1984
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,500
This body movement

1985
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,500
Of course it's not exactly the same effect

1986
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Extend out

1987
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,500
But the effect is the same

1988
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,500
Effect

1989
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Although there is no direct evidence

1990
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,500
But I think

1991
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,500
This effect should be in speech

1992
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,500
It should be exactly the same

1993
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,500
This is my guess

1994
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,500
Thank you

1995
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,500
I have a related question

1996
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
Can you plug in

1997
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,500
Is there a lottery number

1998
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,500
Someone said he had a problem

1999
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
I'm afraid I won't keep plugging in

2000
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
I asked too many questions

2001
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,500
You just said language

2002
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,500
In fact, I think

2003
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,500
More broadly

2004
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,500
Do you think these are all

2005
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500
Is it the phenomenon of hearing?

2006
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Or is it actually a wider perception

2007
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,500
Or is it a new way of operation

2008
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,500
Or is it

2009
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,500
Specific to the phenomenon of hearing

2010
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,500
For example, the experiment you just started is regularity

2011
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Decide

2012
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,500
You can anticipate

2013
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,500
How to deal with sensory information

2014
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,500
Obviously this is also the case in vision

2015
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,500
Then there is your current music

2016
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,500
The communication of cooperation

2017
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,500
Is it really due to the performance of music

2018
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,500
Or all the cooperation

2019
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,500
All the cooperation

2020
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,500
For example, the table you just raised

2021
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
There are all the same phenomena

2022
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
Does the sway of the body also affect

2023
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,500
Or there are some more general mechanisms

2024
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,500
For example, any synchrony

2025
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,500
Any synchronicity

2026
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
Will help communicate

2027
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Can you remind me again

2028
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,500
What is the first part

2029
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,500
I thought it was all examples

2030
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,500
The main question is

2031
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Do you think this is a domain-specific phenomenon

2032
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
Specific to the phenomenon of hearing

2033
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,500
Or is it a broader

2034
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,500
New way of operation

2035
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,500
I don't need a standard answer

2036
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,500
I'm just curious

2037
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,500
Curious about my idea

2038
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,500
According to other studies

2039
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
Actually found

2040
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,500
Like this kind of time synchrony

2041
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,500
For hearing

2042
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,500
It's still a bit different from vision

2043
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,500
Like

2044
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,500
The sense of rhythm of vision

2045
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,500
In fact, it is relative to hearing

2046
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Is quite difficult to trigger

2047
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,500
The accuracy of his track time

2048
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,500
No

2049
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,500
It seems that the results are not so high

2050
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
But someone has succeeded

2051
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
Someone has succeeded

2052
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,500
Vision still has this effect

2053
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,500
In fact, it may not be the same

2054
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,500
The domain of hearing

2055
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
Obviously frequency and time

2056
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,500
But in vision

2057
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,500
It will be space and location

2058
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,500
So

2059
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,500
Translated, it becomes

2060
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,500
Like statistical learning

2061
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,500
If there is a fixed pattern

2062
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
Can't speak Chinese

2063
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
If there is a fixed pattern

2064
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
Repeatedly appear

2065
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
Your processing will be faster and better

2066
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,500
More accurate

2067
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,500
Is this a similar phenomenon?

2068
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,500
Or there is a specialized

2069
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,500
Some

2070
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Processing in the brain

2071
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,500
Processing in different areas

2072
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,500
I think the special process

2073
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Because time is one dimension

2074
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,500
Although

2075
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,500
It is a single direction

2076
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,500
But you are always

2077
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,500
To the future

2078
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,500
That

2079
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,500
For example

2080
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,500
Visual

2081
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,500
This pattern

2082
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,500
This pattern is not the same

2083
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,500
But it must be future-oriented

2084
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Based on your existing knowledge

2085
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,500
You keep guessing

2086
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
What is the future information

2087
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,500
And it is online processing

2088
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,500
So

2089
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
I think these details

2090
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,500
Let time

2091
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,500
For hearing

2092
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,500
The requirements become

2093
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,500
Different from other senses

2094
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
Because his information is open at any time

2095
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,500
Let me give you an example

2096
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,500
Visual phenomenon

2097
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,500
Also belongs to

2098
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,500
Temporal anticipation

2099
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
For example

2100
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,500
You should know this experiment

2101
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
Three

2102
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Three random sounds

2103
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,500
Combination

2104
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,500
This is the first time

2105
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,500
Language learning

2106
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
For example, there are nine possible

2107
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,500
Tones

2108
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,500
These things

2109
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,500
Three

2110
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,500
Always stuck together

2111
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,500
Three

2112
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,500
Always a pair

2113
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,500
These sentences

2114
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,500
Can be combined

2115
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,500
But in fact

2116
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
If you use visual stimulation

2117
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,500
Do the same experiment

2118
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,500
All the results are the same

2119
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,500
This is also a future

2120
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,500
Processing from the past and online

2121
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,500
Anticipation for the future

2122
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,500
Affect your intuition

2123
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
I know

2124
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
In each special case

2125
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,500
Some cases are replicated

2126
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,500
But there are many cases

2127
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,500
It's hard to do

2128
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,500
For example, the effect of rhythm

2129
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,500
Temporal grouping

2130
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
I know you have done it in the lab

2131
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,500
But their citation

2132
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,500
In fact, you can see

2133
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,500
A lot of people failed

2134
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,500
But it doesn't matter

2135
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,500
I know I have done that multisensory

2136
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,500
I know it's hard

2137
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,500
It's super simple

2138
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,500
You just need to present four tones

2139
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,500
People will know

2140
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,500
So you mean

2141
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,500
It has a domain-specific part

2142
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Extract

2143
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,500
Temporal regularity

2144
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,500
What do you think

2145
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,500
About regularity

2146
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,500
What do you think is different

2147
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,500
What is the difference between auditory regularity and visual regularity

2148
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,500
I think

2149
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,500
I think the effect is the same

2150
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,500
But maybe in processing

2151
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,500
In the very early stage of hearing

2152
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,500
Will start to deal with this matter

2153
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,500
You will be in

2154
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,500
Temporal coding

2155
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,500
But visual

2156
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,500
You may want to

2157
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,500
Where domain

2158
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,500
I'm not sure

2159
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,500
The later process will deal with

2160
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,500
This message

2161
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,500
These mechanisms

2162
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,500
That's why it's so noisy

2163
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,500
For example

2164
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,500
I don't know if it will affect auditory

2165
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,500
Because of these phenomena

2166
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,500
So auditory and visual

2167
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,500
Basically there is a difference

2168
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,500
Ok

2169
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,500
I've been standing for too long

2170
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,500
Can I guess

2171
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,500
It's over, please say

2172
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
I read a article before

2173
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,500
He said

2174
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,500
This is a new one

2175
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,500
He said if the stimulation material

2176
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,500
The trigger material is used

2177
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,500
Language or

2178
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,500
Sound is the hearing

2179
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,500
Trigger material

2180
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,500
That

2181
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,500
The subject

2182
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,500
The abstract

2183
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
Will be higher

2184
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,500
Later he described this material

2185
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,500
And so on

2186
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,500
He will use a more abstract and psychological distance

2187
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
To describe

2188
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Relative to visual stimulation material

2189
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,500
I don't know this

2190
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,500
Processing

2191
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,500
Listening to music

2192
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,500
Music and language

2193
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
Are close

2194
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,500
Relative to visual stimulation

2195
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,500
Because

2196
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,500
Take the initiative to do

2197
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,500
Prediction

2198
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,500
It feels like

2199
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,500
My feeling is to be abstract

2200
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,500
When it's higher

2201
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,500
I will do it

2202
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
Because if it's very concrete

2203
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,500
Isn't it just

2204
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,500
Just accept input

2205
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,500
You don't have to guess

2206
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,500
Or is it like this

2207
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,500
I don't know

2208
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,500
But

2209
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,500
I really don't know

2210
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,500
I don't know how to do it

2211
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,500
I don't know

2212
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,500
I really don't know

2213
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,500
Hello

2214
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,500
I just said I don't know

2215
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Sorry

2216
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,500
Okay

2217
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,500
Do you have any questions?

2218
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Someone is chatting

2219
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Okay

2220
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,500
Can I ask a question?

2221
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,500
Okay

2222
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,500
Please

2223
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,500
I was thinking

2224
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,500
If you

2225
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,500
When the musicians come

2226
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,500
You tell them on purpose

2227
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,500
Three of you

2228
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,500
Follow and one is leader

2229
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,500
Now you are saying

2230
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
When you are doing it

2231
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
You give them two leaders and two followers

2232
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,500
To see their

2233
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
Will they fight?

2234
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
Yes

2235
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,500
Actually we did this experiment

2236
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,500
Our condition

2237
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,500
Is called

2238
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,500
Bitch I'm the leader

2239
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
We

2240
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
We originally thought

2241
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
When your leadership assignment

2242
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
Is a conflict

2243
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,500
How do we

2244
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,500
Choose a leader

2245
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,500
Then

2246
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,500
That person becomes the leader

2247
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,500
We originally wanted to see this

2248
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,500
But the result of the experiment

2249
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,500
We found that only when

2250
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,500
Everyone can see each other

2251
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,500
And everyone is assigned as followers

2252
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,500
To solve this conflict

2253
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,500
To be able to

2254
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,500
At first everyone's coordination was bad

2255
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,500
But after a while

2256
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,500
Only when everyone is followers

2257
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,500
And can see each other

2258
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,500
To solve this

2259
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,500
In other cases

2260
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
For example, everyone is the leader

2261
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,500
Or can't see each other

2262
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,500
They can't solve it

2263
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,500
So we call it bitch I'm the leader

2264
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
Okay

2265
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,500
Have you ever tried

2266
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Without a leader

2267
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,500
For example

2268
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,500
If you tell them

2269
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
One person is the follower

2270
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,500
One person is the leader

2271
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
But no one gets the leader

2272
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
That's right

2273
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,500
We just said

2274
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,500
Everyone is the follower

2275
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,500
And can see each other

2276
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,500
When no one is the leader

2277
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,500
And they play

2278
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,500
Gradually

2279
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,500
Information flow

2280
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,500
But only in a quartet

2281
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,500
Only in Bach

2282
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,500
In Mozart

2283
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,500
If it's not balanced

2284
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,500
It doesn't work

2285
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,500
So we think

2286
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,500
If everyone is the follower

2287
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,500
Everyone follows Poussin

2288
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,500
Follow Poussin

2289
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500
Once they find this conflict

2290
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,500
Just follow Poussin

2291
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,500
At the same time

2292
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,500
After each performance

2293
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,500
They have to guess who is the leader

2294
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,500
They were forced to choose the other three

2295
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
Even if they are all followers

2296
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,500
You have to guess who

2297
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
I think they are too good

2298
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
After the performance

2299
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,500
They wrote on the answer sheet

2300
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,500
No leader

2301
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,500
They were not fooled by us

2302
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,500
So this part

2303
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
The conclusion is not clear

2304
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
And we avoid

2305
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
In order to have no leader

2306
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500
In the case of no leader

2307
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
Or in the case of all leaders

2308
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,500
They will conflict at the beginning

2309
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,500
Two seconds before the performance

2310
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,500
We play the beat

2311
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,500
Before the performance

2312
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,500
The beat is removed

2313
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,500
So they just have to follow the beat

2314
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,500
So there will be no problem

2315
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Does anyone have any questions?

2316
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
I have a question

2317
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,500
If I understand correctly

2318
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,500
You do this experiment with music

2319
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,500
Because I hope this experiment can be close to

2320
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,500
Social interaction

2321
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,500
But in human interaction

2322
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
For example, there are leaders and followers in group behavior

2323
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,500
This often depends on

2324
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,500
Personal characteristics

2325
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,500
Personality

2326
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,500
These things

2327
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,500
In music, they have been closely trained

2328
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,500
They may be able to express their personality

2329
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,500
Their desire

2330
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Then follow the music

2331
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,500
So they can't react to human society

2332
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,500
Personal characteristics affect interaction

2333
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,500
Do you think this will affect

2334
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,500
Your research results

2335
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,500
How to cover this part

2336
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,500
I think these questions are too good

2337
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,500
I can only say

2338
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500
In this case, this is also a weakness of our research

2339
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,500
Because we are looking for a group

2340
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
We are not

2341
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,500
Go out and find two violin

2342
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,500
Put them together

2343
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,500
In this case, we can

2344
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,500
For example, we look for

2345
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,500
For example, a very strong first violin

2346
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,500
Or a very strong cello

2347
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,500
Then look at the relationship between their personalities

2348
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,500
Relationship

2349
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,500
Then see how they

2350
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,500
What effect will this experiment have

2351
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,500
I don't know about this, Zhang Yanping can do an experiment

2352
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,500
You can come to us

2353
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,500
I can only say that this is indeed a weakness of our research

2354
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,500
Our research is currently

2355
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500
As a personality effect

2356
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,500
We didn't study

2357
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,500
We just don't look at it

2358
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,500
Answer

2359
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,500
I think

2360
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,500
In your experiment

2361
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,500
You have assigned leadership

2362
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,500
Can't you argue

2363
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,500
To a certain extent

2364
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,500
Do you operate such a personality

2365
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,500
Because when a person gets

2366
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,500
When this assignment

2367
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,500
To a certain extent

2368
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,500
That person

2369
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,500
Is a strong personality

2370
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,500
Of course, people who are not so strong

2371
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,500
May not be able to get so much

2372
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,500
But in general

2373
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,500
That person

2374
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,500
Should be taken out

2375
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,500
It seems

2376
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,500
Right, this must be understood

2377
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,500
I don't understand this

2378
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,500
That's right

2379
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,500
This leader

2380
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,500
The operation of the follower is our experiment

2381
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,500
I think it is

2382
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,500
In a more unnatural situation

2383
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,500
Just like the previous question

2384
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,500
In general, everyone is

2385
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
According to the personality

2386
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,500
Then we experiment to manipulate

2387
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,500
As for the effect of the operation and its original personality

2388
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,500
I don't know

2389
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,500
Just say we manipulate

2390
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,500
It seems to be

2391
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,500
In everyone

2392
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,500
We still see

2393
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,500
Even if I am the leader

2394
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,500
I can influence others

2395
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
The level of predicting others

2396
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,500
Higher

2397
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,500
Thank you

2398
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,500
Do you have any questions?

2399
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,500
We designed 10 experiments

2400
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,500
To continue, right?

2401
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,500
Not bad

2402
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
Then we have to hang the author

2403
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,500
Hang the author

2404
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,500
Who will help me run the experiment?

2405
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,500
Canada is a bit cold

2406
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,500
Caltech is now 100 degrees

2407
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,500
Almost hot

2408
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,500
It's already 4.24

2409
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
Then we officially

2410
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,500
Come here

2411
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,500
If you have any questions

2412
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,500
Or want to continue with Andrew

2413
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,500
Future interaction

2414
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Please remember to fill in the feedback form

2415
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,500
You can leave your contact information

2416
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,500
To YongYi

2417
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,500
Then we will help you get it

2418
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,500
Thank you

2419
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,500
Especially the comment part

2420
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,500
If there is a comment

2421
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,500
Welcome

2422
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,500
I think

2423
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,500
I think it's good

2424
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,500
And you turned to Chinese

2425
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,500
Everyone is laughing

2426
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,500
I was practicing 20 minutes before the speech

2427
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,500
I can't speak a word of Chinese

2428
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,500
I'm starting to chat now

2429
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,500
So if you want to leave

2430
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,500
You can leave

2431
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,500
Because I

2432
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,500
I talked about it in Taiwan University two months ago
