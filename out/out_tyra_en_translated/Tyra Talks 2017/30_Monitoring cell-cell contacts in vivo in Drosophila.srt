1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, no problem.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello everyone, I'm Dinghao.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm a postdoc at Caltech.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,920
The topic I'm going to talk about

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
is mainly my research on some of my papers.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,440
My research is about

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,320
designing an artificial system

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,320
and hoping to use that system to detect cell-cell contacts.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,520
My ultimate goal is to use this system

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,360
to dissect the entire neural circuit.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,800
Oh, in the field of neuroscience,

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,520
the most important answer that everyone wants to know

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,560
is how our brain functions,

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,040
so that we have all kinds of different emotions

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,040
and how reactions to the environment stimulate.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,440
How to stimulate.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
But about 100 years ago,

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Raymond Kahar had a very elegant study.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
And the elegant study proved that

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,680
our brain or neural system

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,040
is mainly operated by these neurons or other cells

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,840
to transmit all kinds of neural messages

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,880
and ultimately have a behavior.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,920
This is a very famous neural doctrine.

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,520
So a lot of research now

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,320
is focused on how different neurons

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,760
communicate with each other.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,840
This is a very complicated problem

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
because our brain is a huge machine.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,680
Like what I'm showing in this picture,

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
it's a reward circuit.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,840
This actually includes a lot of brain areas,

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,600
like the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex,

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,480
and the famous basal ganglia,

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,880
nucleus, convent, VTA.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,120
These different brain areas connect with each other

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
and operate and calculate

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,160
to achieve a goal.

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,800
And another more complicated aspect

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,280
is that even in the same brain area,

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,120
there are different neurons

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,320
that receive different messages.

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,960
And after synchronization,

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
it's transmitted to another brain area.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,160
And the calculation of the other brain area

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
may be transmitted back.

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,920
So these connections are what we...

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,880
What we want to answer right now

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,200
is the idea of connectome.

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,440
We hope that by understanding these connectome,

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,880
we can have a blueprint

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,240
of how our brain or neural system

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,440
is wired.

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,560
And then we can use this basic knowledge

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,600
to calculate

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,160
the changes in the message transmission

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,080
of the neural cells

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,120
that may lead to different behaviors.

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
Like this.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,480
But in fact,

61
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,680
in addition to neural cells,

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,160
there are many other different cells,

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,800
such as glial cells.

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,560
Many studies have found that

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,720
these glial cells

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,080
actually affect the function of our neural neurons.

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
For example,

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
like this astrocyte,

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,600
the heart-shaped neural cell,

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
is...

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,920
It has been found that it can actually

72
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,480
clean up some of our neurotransmitters

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,480
and make it turn over faster.

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
And it's also found that...

75
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,960
Sorry.

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,040
It's found that it can actually transmit some signal

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,040
and affect the whole synaptic property.

78
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,560
So the connectome or microcircuit

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,120
that we originally thought of

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,440
is like this.

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
In addition to neural cells,

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,320
we still need to consider

83
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
the function of these neural glial cells

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,480
to have a more complete picture

85
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,240
of how our brain functions.

86
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,480
And then I mentioned earlier

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,720
that understanding these microcircuits

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,480
can help us know how our brain works.

89
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Another point is that

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
many...

91
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,320
We already know that there are many neurological disorders.

92
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
It actually has something to do with

93
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
the wiring of the neural circuit.

94
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,920
Like schizophrenia,

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,760
phrenia,

96
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,440
or some psychological diseases.

97
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,760
It actually has something to do with it.

98
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,200
If we know how the normal brain works,

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,760
we can further study

100
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,400
the causes of these disorders.

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,520
I hope to get some answers

102
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,400
to help these patients.

103
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,640
So far,

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,200
there are many different tools

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,840
that have been developed

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
to help us understand

107
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,520
how to dissect,

108
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,360
that is, to analyze the entire brain circuit

109
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,760
or neural connection.

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,600
Here are some examples that are commonly used.

111
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,800
For example, Serial Electron Microscopy,

112
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
which is an electronic microscope.

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,200
There is another one called GRASP.

114
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,640
Its full name is

115
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,600
GFP Green Fluorescent Protein Reconstitution

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
Across Synaptic Partner.

117
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,680
This means that it has a fluorescent protein

118
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,640
that divides engineering into two parts.

119
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,200
I will explain this later.

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,280
There is also Tango.

121
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,760
There is another popular tool

122
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,840
called Rabie Virus

123
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,520
to trace neural connection.

124
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,040
These are all great tools,

125
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,320
but they all have different

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,560
shortcomings.

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,920
For example, Serial EM

128
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,240
is to take a small sample

129
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,760
and cut it into pieces.

130
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,880
Then use EM to take the whole image

131
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,880
and then reconstruct it.

132
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,240
Then look at its very fine-detailed

133
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,240
neural morphology

134
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,120
or the connection of different neural cells.

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
Usually, a small one-millimeter-cube

136
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,880
size sample

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,920
takes about five or six years

138
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,800
to complete its analysis.

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,680
It also requires a lot of human power.

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,000
So this is not a very efficient method.

141
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
Because it is not very efficient,

142
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,040
it can only analyze a small sample of an animal.

143
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,320
If you want to analyze 10 different animals,

144
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
different variations,

145
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,600
it may be a bit difficult

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,360
or require more time and more manpower.

147
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,480
Another is CRESP, a genetic tool.

148
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,880
It can be used in

149
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,320
mice or

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm going to talk about Drosophila fruit flies.

151
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,800
It is mainly divided into two parts of this fluorescent protein.

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,040
Normally, it emits green light.

153
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,120
After dividing it into two parts,

154
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,680
they will not emit light.

155
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,960
Only when the two parts are very close,

156
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,800
they will be re-combined

157
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,280
like this.

158
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,480
So the two parts themselves do not emit light.

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,280
When they are re-combined, they will emit light,

160
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,120
and you can see the green light.

161
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,800
Then it can detect

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,880
that two cells are close to each other.

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Its disadvantage is that

164
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
it...

165
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
Sorry.

166
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,520
It can only see where it is in contact with.

167
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,560
It can't make any further modifications

168
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,600
to affect cell poverty.

169
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,720
In addition,

170
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,720
its binding is irreversible.

171
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,360
So there is a concern that

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,280
it may affect the connection between the cells.

173
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,640
The dynamic.

174
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
Connection to dynamic.

175
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
Another system is called Tango.

176
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,400
It mainly has a G-protein couple receptor.

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,760
Its feature is that

178
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,040
when it binds its ligand,

179
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,400
it will recruit a protein called arresting.

180
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,120
Arresting comes to activate

181
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,120
its downstream signaling transduction.

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Then the engineer added a protease to this protein.

183
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,600
Then this receptor has a transcription factor.

184
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,400
Then there is a sequence in front of it

185
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,680
that will be cut by this protease.

186
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,600
So when the protein is binded,

187
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,280
the protease will cut this part.

188
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Then it will release the intracellular transcription factor

189
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
and drive downstream gene excretion.

190
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,920
Its advantage is that

191
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,840
it has these reported proteins,

192
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,800
either fluorescent proteins

193
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,880
or mutant proteins.

194
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,360
You can control some of the features in its cells.

195
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,680
But the disadvantage is that

196
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,960
it is only limited to G-protein couple receptors.

197
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,480
In our neural system,

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
there are many...

199
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,800
For example, this is a dopamine receptor.

200
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,840
It is a G-protein couple receptor.

201
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,640
But there are many receptors that are just IN channels.

202
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,920
So it can't be used in this place.

203
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,680
In the mammalian,

204
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,680
there is a very popular tool

205
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,480
called re-engineering the RebVirus.

206
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,480
It can monosynaptically trace upstream neurons.

207
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,480
The point that needs to be considered

208
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,360
is that we need to do surgery

209
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,360
to inject this virus into the brain

210
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,080
to express,

211
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,480
to let this virus

212
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,480
to transmit to its Gag cells.

213
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,560
It has cytotoxicity.

214
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,200
So usually the research

215
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,240
can only be completed within a week.

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,840
Otherwise, the cells will die.

217
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,040
But another point is that

218
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I just mentioned that it can only be used in the mammalian.

219
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Even so, its efficiency is not very good.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,440
I have tried this tool before.

221
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,160
Different brain regions.

222
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,760
Some brain regions may have special neurons.

223
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,760
It's harder to let the RebVirus

224
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,040
jump to their upstream partner.

225
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,960
So the important purpose of my research

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
is to generate a system

227
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,240
that can be used on all transgenic animals.

228
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,480
I hope it won't have any toxicity.

229
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,680
So we can safely study

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the property and function of these cells.

231
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,280
In addition to tracing the neuron

232
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,360
or the connection between the cells,

233
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,000
we can also manipulate their property.

234
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,760
So my main design here is that

235
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,560
if a cell, not necessarily a neuron,

236
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,240
has a ligand

237
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,240
and the other cells have a corresponding receptor,

238
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,120
when these two cells have contact,

239
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,440
the binding will generate a cell signaling

240
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,240
to the downstream cell.

241
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Then we can either express some fluorescent reporter protein,

242
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,680
or express some gene or mutant that we are interested in.

243
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,080
Or it can be RNAi.

244
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,080
So here, we used a very important

245
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,080
signaling pathway in animals,

246
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Delta protein and Notch protein's signaling pathway.

247
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
So let me briefly introduce

248
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
the structure of Notch protein.

249
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,080
It has a very long hRSA domain.

250
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Most of it is EGF repeat.

251
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,080
This domain will bind its ligand, Delta,

252
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,080
and when they bind,

253
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,080
the current hypothesis is that

254
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,080
if the ligand is endocytosed,

255
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,080
that is, if it is brought in by the cell membrane,

256
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
it will generate a force.

257
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,080
It will open this structure called NRR.

258
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,080
After Notch binds,

259
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,080
there will be two cutting points

260
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,080
that will be cut off by Proteus.

261
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,080
One is S2 and the other is S3.

262
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,080
So the original S2 cutting point

263
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,080
is in the NRR structure.

264
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,080
So it's embedded inside the structure,

265
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,080
and Proteus can't digest the S2 site.

266
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,080
So it won't be cut off

267
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
until Delta binds.

268
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,080
After it binds, it opens this structure,

269
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,080
and the S2 site can be cut off.

270
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Next, its transmembrane domain

271
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
also has a cutting point called S3.

272
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
S3 will also be cut off.

273
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Then its intracellular domain

274
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
is a transcription factor.

275
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
It can move to the cell membrane

276
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,080
to activate downstream gene expression.

277
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,080
So here we use this logic.

278
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,080
We replace some domains

279
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,080
that will affect the cell's endogenous domain,

280
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
like EGF repeat,

281
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
it will bind the endogenous Delta ligand.

282
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:00,080
So we replace it with an antibody here.

283
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Then its intracellular domain

284
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,080
will drive endogenous downstream gene expression.

285
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
So we also replace it

286
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,080
with a yeast transcription factor called GAL4.

287
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,080
So our idea is that

288
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,080
our new synthetic receptor

289
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,080
can recognize its own ligand.

290
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,080
I'm using CD19 here.

291
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
After it binds,

292
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,080
it uses the NRR domain in the middle

293
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
and transmembrane domain.

294
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,080
It will have S2, S3 cleavage.

295
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Then it will release intracellular GAL4.

296
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Then it can drive either GFP

297
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
or any gene expression.

298
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
It depends on what kind of study we want to do.

299
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,080
We call this whole section track.

300
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,080
It's Transcellular Activation of Transcription.

301
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,080
First, I'll test

302
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,080
whether our designed ligand and receptor can work.

303
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,080
So we use it in the cell line.

304
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Here I show you the control.

305
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Red represents the ligand.

306
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,080
The cell line with or without ligand.

307
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,080
My reporter is GFP.

308
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,080
So when you see the cell with receptor,

309
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
it has no GFP

310
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,080
because the co-culture cell has no ligand.

311
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,080
When I change the co-culture cell

312
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,080
to the cell with CD19,

313
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:13,080
you can see that most of the receptors

314
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,080
and positive cells

315
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,080
start to show GFP.

316
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Here you can see the difference in the amount of GFP.

317
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,080
You can see that the amount of GFP

318
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,080
increases with the co-culture time.

319
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,080
The blue line is the control cell.

320
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,080
The orange line is the test group.

321
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,080
To make sure that they have cell-cell contact,

322
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,080
not because my ligand-positive cell

323
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,080
releases any weird factor

324
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,080
to trigger the downstream gene expression.

325
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:11,080
So I put the receptor cell

326
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,080
and the ligand-positive cell

327
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,080
in the same play.

328
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
But I put less CD19.

329
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,080
So they generate their own colonies.

330
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,080
When they grow up,

331
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
only when the two colonies

332
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
have direct contact with each other,

333
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,080
the ligand-cell line and the receptor-cell line

334
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
will have contact.

335
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,080
This is the receptor-positive colony.

336
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,080
This is the ligand-positive colony.

337
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Only when they have direct contact with each other,

338
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,080
the cells produce green ligand.

339
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
The rest are dark.

340
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,080
We use the cell-cell line to prove

341
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,080
that our system can function normally

342
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,080
and detect cell-cell contact.

343
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,080
We hope to use it in the in vivo system.

344
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
We use the fruit-gene model.

345
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,080
It is a well-established genetic model.

346
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,080
We have a lot of tools to study it.

347
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,080
The life cycle is relatively short.

348
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,080
The fruit-gene model is about two weeks

349
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,080
from the soft to the mature.

350
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,080
The most important thing is that

351
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,080
the nerve system is similar to the mammalian brain.

352
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,080
We hope to use the nerve system

353
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,080
to imply the mammalian brain.

354
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
We hope to use the nerve system

355
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,080
to imply the mammalian brain.

356
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Let me briefly introduce the central nervous system of Drosophila.

357
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,080
They still have neurons and glia.

358
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Their neurons are not like our brain.

359
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,080
There are a bunch of neurons in the brain.

360
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Their synapses are in the same area.

361
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Drosophila's cell body is mainly

362
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,080
around the edge of the nervous system.

363
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,080
around the edge of the nervous system.

364
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,080
These regions have no synapses or connections.

365
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,080
These regions have no synapses or connections.

366
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,080
In this area, the synapse is only there.

367
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,080
In this area, the synapse is only there.

368
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Besides neurons, there are many other glial cells.

369
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I will go into more detail about these later.

370
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,080
I will go into more detail about these later.

371
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,080
One thing to remember is that

372
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,080
what I will talk about later is not about the neural pill itself,

373
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,080
what I will talk about later is not about the neural pill itself,

374
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
but about the cells themselves.

375
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:58,080
First, we want to test whether our system can detect

376
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,080
First, we want to test whether our system can detect

377
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,080
the contact between glial cells and neurons.

378
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,080
the contact between glial cells and neurons.

379
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,080
We can see that neurons and glial cells...

380
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,080
We can see that neurons and glial cells...

381
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,080
The first part is to see if we can detect the contact

382
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,080
The first part is to see if we can detect the contact

383
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,080
between glial cells and neurons.

384
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Then we want to further use our system

385
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,080
to see if we can trace the contact between neurons.

386
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
to see if we can trace the contact between neurons.

387
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,080
First, glial-to-neuron.

388
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:58,080
There are different types of glial cells in the ToSoftware.

389
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,080
There are different types of glial cells in the ToSoftware.

390
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:14,080
The contact between neurons is different.

391
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:21,080
For example, the surface glial is wrapped around the nervous system.

392
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,080
It's more like a protective film.

393
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,080
They don't have much contact with our neurons.

394
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,080
They don't have much contact with our neurons.

395
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,080
On the contrary, different types of glial cells,

396
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,080
such as cortex glial,

397
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,080
are mainly wrapped around the neural soma.

398
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Or the astrocytes are mainly

399
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,080
infiltrated into the neural pill

400
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,080
and wrapped around the synapse.

401
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,080
These different types of astrocytes

402
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,080
have more contact with neurons.

403
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,080
So what we want to test here is

404
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,080
to see if the ligand is present in the glial cell,

405
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,080
can we detect the connection between neurons?

406
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,080
So here I have all the bioreceptor proteins

407
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
in all the neurons.

408
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Then we use the ligand in the glial cell

409
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,080
to see what happens.

410
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,080
This diagram shows

411
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,080
what the ToSoftware's Lava Brain looks like.

412
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,080
There are two main parts.

413
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
The central brain,

414
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,080
which is the main area of the brain.

415
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
And the ventral nerve cord,

416
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,080
which is like the spinal cord.

417
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,080
The first thing I want to show is

418
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,080
if our system doesn't have any ligand,

419
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
its background is quite weak.

420
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,080
It only shows up in different tissues.

421
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:34,080
When the ligand is present in the astrocytes,

422
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,080
we can see a lot of neurons are labeled.

423
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
This is mainly because

424
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,080
the ligand and the receptor present in the neurons

425
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
are combined

426
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:53,080
to stimulate the GFP protein in the lower part of the brain.

427
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Here I use another driver.

428
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,080
This driver is called ELAM.

429
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,080
This is an astrocyte-specific gene.

430
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
So using its promoter,

431
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
we can see that

432
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,080
the ligand mainly shows up in the astrocytes.

433
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
But the REPL

434
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,080
is a protein found in all glial cells.

435
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,080
You can see that the pattern between them is different.

436
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,080
When these glial cells are shown in different populations,

437
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
we can see that

438
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,080
the pattern of the label changes a little bit.

439
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
For example,

440
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
in this brain area,

441
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,080
I will zoom in to show you.

442
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
In this area,

443
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,080
the driver doesn't show a lot of GFP expression.

444
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,080
In the next slide,

445
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,080
I will zoom in to show you.

446
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
I want to show you that

447
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,080
our system is quite specific.

448
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
This is mainly because

449
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,080
we can see so many green neurons are labeled.

450
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
This is mainly because

451
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
in the same area,

452
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,080
the cell body doesn't show a lot of ligand expression.

453
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
It's darker here.

454
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
It's mainly because

455
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
the process of these neurons

456
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
will have contact with

457
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
this

458
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,080
row of glial cells.

459
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
But here,

460
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
and these two places,

461
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
that's why

462
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
we have

463
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
this

464
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
strong

465
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
GFP expression

466
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
in these neurons.

467
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Next,

468
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
we can prove that

469
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
our system

470
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
and our tool

471
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
in Drosophila

472
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
can work.

473
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
The question we want to ask is

474
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
can we use our system

475
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
to label

476
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
astrocytes?

477
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Mainly because

478
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
astrocytes

479
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
has been proven

480
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
that

481
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
it has

482
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
a very important

483
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
role

484
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
to control

485
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
synaptic function.

486
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
For example,

487
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
it can

488
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
control synaptic contact

489
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
by

490
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
eating

491
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
those

492
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
unused synapses

493
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
or unused processes.

494
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,080
It can also

495
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
help

496
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
synaptic formation

497
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
of

498
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
neurons.

499
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Astrocytes

500
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
have been studied

501
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
that

502
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
astrocytes can also

503
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
react to

504
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
neurotransmitters.

505
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
It can

506
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
control

507
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
the level of

508
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
neurotransmitter release.

509
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
It can also

510
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
control

511
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
neuronal activity.

512
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,080
However,

513
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
all these studies

514
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
assume

515
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
that astrocytes are

516
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
a homogeneous population.

517
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Some tools

518
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
can be used

519
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
to

520
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
knock down

521
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
gene

522
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
function

523
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
or mutant gene.

524
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
All astrocytes

525
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
can be used

526
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
to knock down

527
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
gene function

528
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
or mutant gene.

529
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
However,

530
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
all astrocytes

531
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
can be used

532
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,080
to

533
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
knock down

534
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
gene function

535
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
or mutant gene.

536
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
All astrocytes

537
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
can be used

538
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
to

539
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
knock down

540
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
gene function

541
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
or mutant gene.

542
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
All astrocytes

543
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
can be used

544
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
to

545
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
knock down

546
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
gene function

547
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
or mutant gene.

548
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
All astrocytes

549
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
can be used

550
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
to

551
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
knock down

552
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
gene function

553
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
or mutant gene.

554
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
All astrocytes

555
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
can be used

556
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
to

557
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
knock down

or mutant gene.

560
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
All astrocytes

561
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
can be used

562
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
to

566
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,080
All astrocytes

567
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
can be used

568
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
to

can be used

1322
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,080

All astrocytes

1328

can be used

1329
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,080

mutant gene.

1334
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,080
Either

1335
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,080
your head

1336
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,080
has to be transparent

1337
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,080
or you have to

1338
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,080
punch something

1339
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,080
on a mouse's bone.

1340
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,080
It's not possible

1341
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,080
in real life.

1342
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,080
In my system,

1343
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,080
you have to

1344
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,080
express two

1345
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,080
ligand and receptor

1346
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,080
and three reporter.

1347
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,080
If you can't

1348
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,080
use

1349
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,080
transgenic animal

1350
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,080
or other virus

1351
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,080
to express, it's impossible.

1352
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,080
Also, human brain

1353
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,080
has

1354
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,080
limitations.

1355
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,080
I just mentioned

1356
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,080
that I don't know

1357
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,080
if you are there.

1358
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,080
Now CRISPR

1359
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,080
is very popular.

1360
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,080
It can

1361
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,080
make it easier

1362
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,080
to

1363
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,080
change

1364
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,080
the genetic profile

1365
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,080
of different animals.

1366
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,080
You can

1367
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,080
do transgenic animal.

1368
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,080
In other words,

1369
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,080
using CRISPR,

1370
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,080
we should have

1371
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,080
more opportunities

1372
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,080
to test

1373
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,080
on different animals.

1374
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,080
Like rabies virus,

1375
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,080
it's a good tool.

1376
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,080
Many papers

1377
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,080
published

1378
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,080
about it.

1379
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,080
The problem is

1380
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,080
we can't use it

1381
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,080
on birds.

1382
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,080
Birds can't

1383
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,080
get rabies.

1384
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,080
It's rabies virus.

1385
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,080
This tool

1386
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,080
is transgenic.

1387
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,080
If CRISPR

1388
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,080
looks promising,

1389
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,080
we can use it

1390
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,080
on different animals.

1391
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,080
As I mentioned,

1392
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,080
there is a kind of

1393
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,080
sea...

1394
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,080
dolphin.

1395
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,080
Tuff fish.

1396
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,080
Tuff fish.

1397
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,080
Yes, dolphin.

1398
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,080
It has a strange

1399
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,080
and special behavior.

1400
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,080
It will

1401
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,080
draw on the sand

1402
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,080
in the sea

1403
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,080
in a symmetric pattern

1404
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,080
to attract...

1405
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,080
It's amazing.

1406
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,080
If I have a chance,

1407
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,080
I want to study

1408
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,080
its brain.

1409
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,080
Really?

1410
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,080
Really?

1411
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,080
Why is it like this?

1412
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,080
I don't know.

1413
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,080
But the pattern

1414
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,080
is like

1415
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,080
the pattern

1416
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,080
of a

1417
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,080
shark.

1418
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,080
It's big.

1419
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,080
I think

1420
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,080
it's interesting

1421
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,080
to study it.

1422
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,080
But

1423
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,080
it's not

1424
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,080
transgenic.

1425
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,080
We can only use

1426
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,080
functional MRI.

1427
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,080
But it can't

1428
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
be that good.

1429
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,080
I'm thinking

1430
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,080
how to

1431
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,080
develop it

1432
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,080
so that we can

1433
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,080
understand

1434
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,080
its brain.

1435
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,080
I was thinking

1436
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,080
if you change it

1437
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,080
to a

1438
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,080
magnetic field

1439
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,080
or electrical field,

1440
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,080
you can use

1441
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,080
MRI technology

1442
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,080
to locate it.

1443
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,080
But the resolution

1444
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,080
is not high enough

1445
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,080
to see such a small thing.

1446
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,080
It looks like a piece.

1447
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,080
It's bright here.

1448
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,080
So it's useless.

1449
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,080
I remember

1450
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,080
I saw

1451
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,080
a speech

1452
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,080
or something.

1453
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,080
They were using X-ray

1454
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,080
to look at

1455
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,080
the structure

1456
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,080
of the brain.

1457
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,080
The structure of the brain.

1458
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,080
The brain is

1459
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,080
very small.

1460
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,080
X-ray

1461
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,080
has a strong trajectory.

1462
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,080
I think they were thinking

1463
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,080
if they can

1464
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,080
use X-ray to dissect

1465
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,080
such a small brain,

1466
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,080
the resolution will be good.

1467
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,080
Maybe in the future,

1468
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,080
we can use it

1469
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,080
to dissect

1470
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,080
large animals.

1471
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,080
But

1472
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,080
I don't know

1473
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,080
how long

1474
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,080
the technology will last.

1475
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,080
Maybe in the future,

1476
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,080
there will be a big breakthrough.

1477
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,080
I think

1478
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,080
there is a big gap.

1479
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,080
I think

1480
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,080
it's very helpful

1481
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,080
for animal models.

1482
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,080
But animal model

1483
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,080
literature and

1484
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,080
human models

1485
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,080
have a big gap.

1486
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,080
Both sides

1487
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,080
don't know how to

1488
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,080
cross the gap.

1489
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,080
There is no bridge.

1490
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,080
Maybe

1491
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,080
the closest

1492
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,080
is primate.

1493
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,080
Primates

1494
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,080
may have some...

1495
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Yes.

1496
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,080
I think

1497
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,080
it's very obvious.

1498
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,080
If you are a primate,

1499
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,080
you do some

1500
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,080
obvious things

1501
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,080
like

1502
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,080
aggression

1503
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,080
or mating behavior

1504
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,080
or

1505
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,080
hierarchy.

1506
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,080
But if you are

1507
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,080
a high-ranking animal,

1508
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,080
like a stork,

1509
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,080
you are very close to a primate.

1510
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,080
But if you are

1511
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,080
a high-ranking animal,

1512
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,080
you are very close to a primate.

1513
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,080
But if you are

1514
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,080
a high-ranking animal,

1515
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,080
you are very close to a primate.

1516
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,080
I think

1517
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,080
it's a very complicated social behavior.

1518
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,080
I heard people

1519
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,080
do jealousy

1520
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,080
on mice.

1521
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,080
I heard people

1522
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,080
do jealousy on mice.

1523
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,080
I heard people

1524
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,080
do love on mice.

1525
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,080
It's painful.

1526
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,080
Yes.

1527
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,080
Yes.

1528
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,080
I was thinking

1529
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,080
how to use

1530
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,080
this system.

1531
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,080
But

1532
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,080
if you really use it on humans,

1533
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
there will be some

1534
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,080
limitations

1535
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,080
on human brain function.

1536
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,080
on human brain function.

1537
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,080
Yes.

1538
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,080
Yes.

1539
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,080
Yes.

1540
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,080
But

1541
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,080
we can't

1542
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,080
do research on humans.

1543
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,080
we can't do research on humans.

1544
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,080
But I think it's cool.

1545
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,080
But I think it's cool.

1546
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,080
I think your resolution

1547
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,080
is very high.

1548
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,080
It's quite

1549
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,080
big.

1550
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,080
I don't know where the people in front sit.

1551
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,080
It's amazing.

1552
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,080
It's amazing.

1553
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,080
It's amazing.

1554
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,080
You can see everything in detail.

1555
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,080
It's mainly

1556
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,080
through social contact.

1557
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,080
So we still have to

1558
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,080
test

1559
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,080
its sensitivity.

1560
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,080
its sensitivity.

1561
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,080
Minimal area

1562
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,080
that you need to

1563
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,080
see the difference.

1564
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,080
see the difference.

1565
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,080
So

1566
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,080
you still have to

1567
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,080
see

1568
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,080
how big is your contact area.

1569
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,080
And

1570
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,080
if your concentration

1571
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,080
is high enough

1572
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,080
to see

1573
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,080
its downstream

1574
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,080
performance.

1575
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,080
You can adjust it

1576
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,080
slowly.

1577
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,080
My main work is to adjust

1578
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,080
this tool.

1579
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,080
So it can be used

1580
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,080
in

1581
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,080
tracing neural circuits.

1582
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,080
And

1583
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,080
Yeah.

1584
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,080
Yeah.

1585
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,080
I don't want to talk alone.

1586
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,080
Do you have any questions?

1587
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,080
Do you have any questions?

1588
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,080
Do you have any questions?

1589
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,080
YuQing asked a question.

1590
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,080
YuQing asked a question.

1591
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,080
I don't know if Jenny is still here.

1592
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,080
I don't know.

1593
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,080
I'm here.

1594
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,080
YuQing is here.

1595
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,080
I mean Jenny.

1596
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,080
There's another one.

1597
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,080
Yeah.

1598
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,080
I think

1599
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,080
maybe in the future

1600
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,080
after I have more

1601
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,080
information,

1602
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,080
this is just the basics.

1603
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,080
Maybe in the future,

1604
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,080
I still need something like

1605
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,080
telekinesis or

1606
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,080
computer simulation

1607
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,080
to really

1608
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,080
understand

1609
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,080
brain function.

1610
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,080
Now I can only

1611
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,080
provide a tool

1612
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,080
with a blueprint.

1613
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,080
Just an established

1614
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,080
blueprint.

1615
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,080
In the future,

1616
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,080
I want to

1617
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,080
control

1618
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,080
Apple's

1619
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,080
cell property.

1620
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,080
So I can be more selective

1621
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,080
in my research.

1622
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,080
Does anyone else have a question?

1623
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,080
Please go ahead.

1624
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,080
There's a drug

1625
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,080
called LSD.

1626
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,080
Is it...

1627
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,080
I think...

1628
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,080
I think...

1629
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,080
I don't know if it's related to this.

1630
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,080
Is it that

1631
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,080
after taking the drug,

1632
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,080
what will happen?

1633
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,080
Is it related to

1634
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,080
this research?

1635
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,080
After taking the drug,

1636
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,080
it will control...

1637
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,080
LSD will

1638
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,080
simulate

1639
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,080
those things, right?

1640
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
It's a bit like...

1641
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,080
Yeah, I didn't say it myself.

1642
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,080
It should be like that.

1643
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,080
I don't know.

1644
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,080
It mainly works on...

1645
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,080
I'm not sure

1646
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,080
if it's doping

1647
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,080
or that...

1648
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,080
What's it called?

1649
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,080
It's like

1650
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,080
the same place

1651
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,080
where the drugs work.

1652
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,080
I kind of

1653
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,080
forgot what it's called.

1654
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,080
It works on

1655
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,080
a certain neurotransmitter

1656
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,080
circuit.

1657
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,080
So it's like

1658
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,080
what I just said.

1659
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,080
There's a reward

1660
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,080
circuit.

1661
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,080
It's mainly

1662
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,080
in that area.

1663
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,080
Like that area.

1664
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,080
The brain area

1665
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,080
is very popular.

1666
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,080
It's related to

1667
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,080
reward and addiction.

1668
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,080
It's related to reward and addiction.

1669
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,080
Talking about

1670
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,080
reward system.

1671
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,080
I'm not a

1672
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,080
biopsychologist,

1673
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,080
so I'm not sure.

1674
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,080
But the reward system

1675
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,080
is very popular now.

1676
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,080
It's related to addiction.

1677
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,080
You might have mentioned it, but I missed it.

1678
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,080
Other than addiction,

1679
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,080
it's also

1680
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,080
related to...

1681
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,080
Like a lot of

1682
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,080
psychological disorders,

1683
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,080
like autism

1684
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,080
or

1685
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,080
etc.

1686
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,080
They have

1687
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,080
abnormal repetitive behaviors.

1688
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,080
They keep doing it.

1689
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,080
It's like

1690
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,080
what?

1691
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,080
Like obsessive-compulsive disorder.

1692
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,080
Right.

1693
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,080
It's because their reward system

1694
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,080
has a problem.

1695
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,080
When they do these behaviors,

1696
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,080
their reward system will keep firing.

1697
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,080
As a result,

1698
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,080
the abnormal

1699
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,080
unnecessary behaviors

1700
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,080
will keep firing.

1701
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,080
Some imaging researches

1702
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,080
are doing this.

1703
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,080
ADHD.

1704
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,080
Right.

1705
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,080
As I mentioned,

1706
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,080
we

1707
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,080
research

1708
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,080
connectome

1709
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,080
in the brain.

1710
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,080
The purpose is

1711
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,080
to make a normal reference.

1712
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,080
Then we can

1713
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,080
study

1714
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,080
schizophrenia

1715
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,080
or other

1716
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,080
brain related

1717
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,080
disorders.

1718
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,080
What are

1719
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,080
the differences

1720
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,080
between them?

1721
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,080
Right.

1722
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,080
Schizophrenia

1723
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,080
has excitatory

1724
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,080
and inhibitory

1725
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,080
differences.

1726
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,080
Do they have

1727
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,080
fewer connections?

1728
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,080
Or

1729
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,080
do they have

1730
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,080
fewer synaptic strain?

1731
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,080
I think

1732
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,080
many professors in our department

1733
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,080
like your researches.

1734
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,080
Our department

1735
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,080
has a close relationship

1736
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,080
with

1737
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,080
Engelsheim.

1738
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,080
They do

1739
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,080
schizophrenia.

1740
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,080
Oh.

1741
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,080
Right.

1742
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,080
They push patients

1743
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,080
into the brain.

1744
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,080
Your image.

1745
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,080
I remember

1746
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,080
there was a talk

1747
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,080
about functional MRI.

1748
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,080
Right.

1749
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,080
It's about ADHD.

1750
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,080
It's about

1751
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,080
image.

1752
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,080
They do

1753
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,080
function

1754
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,080
structure.

1755
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,080
In the past, MRI

1756
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,080
did anatomical

1757
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,080
structure.

1758
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,080
They did

1759
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,080
anatomical structure.

1760
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,080
Now they do

1761
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,080
firing pattern.

1762
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,080
It's called functional.

1763
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,080
Right.

1764
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,080
I remember.

1765
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,080
Right.

1766
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,080
It's 7.25 now.

1767
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,080
Any questions?

1768
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,080
If not,

1769
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
3, 2, 1.

1770
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,080
Thank you.

1771
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,080
Thank you.

1772
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,080
Thank you.

1773
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,080
Let's continue.

1774
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,080
If you have any ideas,

1775
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,080
you can

1776
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,080
share with us.

1777
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,080
Thank you.
