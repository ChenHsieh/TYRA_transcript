00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello everyone, I'm the host for today, Zhang Yanyong, and we're going to have our 21st Terra Talk.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Today's speaker is Xu Liyan.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Xu Liyan and I have known each other for almost two years.

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
It's really interesting because we're at Caltech, and Xu Liyan is studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
In 2016, we had a year-long visit to Caltech and IPAC.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
At that time, we met Xu Liyan.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Xu Liyan happens to be a senior in the Department of Physics at Caltech, but he was studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Did I say that correctly?

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm from the Department of Physics.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh, you're from the Department of Physics.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
But you're studying astronomy at Manoa University.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
My advisor is from Manoa University.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I see.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
It's interesting because he's from Hawaii, and they were surfing.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
I was surfing, so we became good friends.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Of course, his main job is still doing astronomy observation research in Hawaii.

01:10.000 --> 01:19.000
After returning from Caltech, in 2017, he recently obtained a Ph.D. degree, so he is a new doctor.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Liyan's research is mainly galaxy observation.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
In his doctoral career, he is going to talk to us about this big topic today.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
He published 34 papers, but today he will focus on the latest one.

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
If you are interested in learning more about the previous papers, you can contact him directly.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Without further ado, let's welcome Liyan to give us his speech.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I'll mute myself.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
I'd like to remind everyone to mute your microphone when you speak.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Thank you.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
You can start.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Okay, I'll start.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
If you have any questions, please mute your microphone.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm afraid people won't understand.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, sorry.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
We forgot something.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
We need to clap.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
We need to mute our microphone when we clap.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay, you can start.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay, thank you.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
As you can see, my title is Characterizing Faint Sub-millimeter Galaxies with Posture Lensing.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
If you don't read astronomy, you can only understand Characterizing, Faint, and Width.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I'll explain what they mean.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
In short, I'm studying a galaxy called Sub-millimeter Galaxy.

02:52.000 --> 03:02.000
The wavelength detected by this galaxy is called Sub-millimeter.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
Sub-millimeter is shorter than millimeter.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Millimeter is in kilometers.

03:10.000 --> 03:22.000
Traditionally, people use 850 micrometers to study Sub-millimeter Galaxy.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Now I'll explain why I'm studying this galaxy and what I'm studying.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Okay.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Why do we study this galaxy?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
It's related to the evolution of the universe.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
You can google the history of the universe.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
You'll see a similar picture.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
The age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Maybe you've heard of it.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
It started from the Big Bang.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
The history of the universe is shown here.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
It started from the Big Bang.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Then there was a period of time called Inflation.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
At that time, the temperature of the universe was still very high.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It was all gaseous gas.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Until the temperature dropped to the ground.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
The gaseous electrons in the universe were recombined with the gaseous atoms.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
They became neutral gas atoms.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
From then on, light can start to run freely in the universe.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Before that, any light would be scattered by those gaseous electrons.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
From then on, light can run freely in the universe.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
At that time, the universe was scattered by those gaseous electrons.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Okay.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
But the temperature of the universe was still very high.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
After the temperature dropped to the ground.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
The temperature of the gaseous atoms dropped to the ground.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
The temperature of the universe was still very high.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Before that, there was a period called Dark Age.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Basically, in the Big Bang, Inflation, and Cosmic Microwave Background.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
During this period, I basically think that this part of history belongs to physicists.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Like the theory of explosion, it's a physicist.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
This is very physical.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
And Big Bang.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
From the beginning of the formation of gravity.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
After the first gravity.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
This part can be done by astronomers.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Astronomers can do this part.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I said that the temperature of the universe.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Because the universe is constantly expanding.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The temperature slowly drops.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And these gaseous atoms.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
It can be further combined into gaseous atoms.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Gaseous atoms.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
If it's cold enough.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
After gravity collapses.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It will form a star.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Then the star will.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
You should have heard of the star.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Just like our sun.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It produces a fusion reaction.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
So it will glow.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Then it will produce gas.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Okay.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Then the star will not be one by one.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
They are produced in groups.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
That is to form the so-called galaxy.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Right.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
The galaxy is.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
A galaxy is basically.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
More than a billion of stars.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Okay.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It is a system of galaxies.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
So.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
From this time on.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
After the galaxy.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
It is.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Many galaxies.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
In this universe.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
More and more galaxies.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Okay.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Then.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
We study.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
I mean.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
This part.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
I study the so-called.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Galaxy formation and evolution.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
The formation of galaxies.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
And evolution.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Then.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
An important point is.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
My research.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
This research.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Is to study.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
This universe.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
The star formation.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
The history of star formation.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
This is the so-called.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Cosmic star formation.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Then.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
We want to use.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
That is to say.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
From this.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
From the first star to now.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
The evolution of this universe.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
One of them.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You have to understand the evolution of this universe.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
One of them.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
You have to understand.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It must be very important.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
How to say.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
One of the very important factors.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Is star formation.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Because.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
If you.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
From the perspective of astronomy.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
No matter what you are studying.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
No matter you are studying.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
The evolution of galaxies.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Galaxy formation and evolution.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Or.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
You want to study.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
What.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Stars.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
For example.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Like our solar system.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Or study.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
What.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Mars.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Small stars.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
In the universe.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
No matter what kind of weather you study.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
It must be.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Related to the stars.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Related to the stars.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Because.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
You have the star.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
You have the star formation.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
After.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
After the star formation.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
These stars.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Merge together.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Becomes.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Galaxy.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
So it's related to the galaxy.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Then.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
You.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Star.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Star system.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Like our solar system.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Is.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
After the star formation.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Then.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Some dust around this star.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Slowly.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Is formed.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Star.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Then the star.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Just go around the star.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Like the comet.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Small star.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
This is also.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
This is also.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
So.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
You can say.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Astronomy.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
No matter what you study.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Ah.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I said astronomy.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
If it's.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
The kind of physics in cosmology.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
It doesn't count.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Astronomy.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Basically.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Whatever you do.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
No matter what you do.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
It's related to.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Star formation.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
So star formation.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
History.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Star formation.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
History.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
So it's a very important.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Ah.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
You want to understand.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
This universe.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
This is a very important thing.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
OK.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Then.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
So.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I believe I have.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Convinced everyone.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Star formation.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
History.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
It's a very important thing.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
But.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Ah.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Star formation.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
History.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Ah.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
We.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
When we do research.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Found.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
This picture on the left.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
It's the so-called.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I put star formation.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
History.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
This thing.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Brighten it.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Then.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
This place.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Left.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
This axis.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Called.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Star formation.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Great.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Density.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Star formation.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Great.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Is.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Left.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
There is a green layer.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Is.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Every year.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
His unit is.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Ah.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Ah.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
The quality of the stars.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Out of.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Time.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Then.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
His unit basically.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Every year.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
You see.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Every year.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Can produce.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
How many solar qualities.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
This.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
This unit is the solar mass.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Is the solar mass.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
So in this part.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Calls.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Star formation.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Great.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
So if you are in the volume.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Is.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Star formation.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Great.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Then in the unit volume.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Then.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Don't.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
You don't care how he came.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Then he is a huge unit.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Then.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Three times.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
So he is this part.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Ah.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Gravitational law.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
In the unit volume.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
So called.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Star formation.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Great.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Density.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Very early.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Here is the lookback time.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
So the more to the right.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Is.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Longer ago.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
OK.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Then this lookback time.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Can correspond to the so-called.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Redshift.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Called.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Redshift.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Then this.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Redshift.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
What is it?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
I'll explain it later.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
But you can.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I can tell you now.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Is.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
The more to the right.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Is.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
The earlier.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
The.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Universe.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
That.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Zero.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
This place is now.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
OK.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
So the time travel.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Is from the right to the left.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Or from the left to the right.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
OK.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Then this picture.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Basically.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Is a star formation.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
History.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Then you want to.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Measure this picture.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Ah.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
You.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
We.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Ah.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Will find.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
There are two.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Ah.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Basically.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Can be.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Two kinds of observations.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Is very important.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Is.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Ah.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
When we used to.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Probably in the 90s.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
When.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
The end of the 90s.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
We have some.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Ah.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Ah.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Ah.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Ah.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Satellite.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Ah.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
It's the space telescope.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
We go to measure.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
The whole universe.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Background radiation.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
That.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
There are different.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Wavelength background radiation.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
That.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I just mentioned.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
The background radiation of the universe microwave.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Is called.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Cosmic Microwave Background.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Is here.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Ah.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Then this.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Is.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Is the intensity of light.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Then.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Horizontal.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Is wavelength.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
So this is basically.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Light wave.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
That.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
CMB is probably a place.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Then we will find.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
In this universe.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
There are two components.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
CMB does not count.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
There are two.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Very important components.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
One is called.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Cosmic.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Optical Background.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
It is visible.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Light.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Background.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Then the other part.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Is called.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Cosmic Infrared Background.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Is infrared background.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Then we found.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Then we found.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
These two.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Background.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Their amount.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Is almost.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Almost.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
So what does this tell us?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Because in this universe.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Horizontal.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
They will send out.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Ah.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Point light.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Visible light.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Or.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Infrared light.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
That.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Horizontal.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Direct light.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Basically.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Is this component.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Optical Background.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
OK.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
But.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
In this universe.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Star formation.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
OK.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
About half.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
The other half.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
About half.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Is not.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
We can directly observe.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
It is called.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Dusty Star Formation.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
What does it mean?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
That is.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
When you have.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
A lot of stars.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
In a region.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Then.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
A lot of.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
New.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Huge stars.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
They.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Very soon.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
They will age.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
And become so-called.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Supernova.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Supernova.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Then.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
These.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
These huge stars.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
They are produced.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
They are produced.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
A lot of.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Heavy objects.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Then.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
They become supernova.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
They will explode.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Then.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Those heavy objects.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
That is.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
That is.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Is talked about.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
In the space of the universe.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
And.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Heavy objects.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Heavy objects.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
For example, carbon.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Metal.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
These things.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
They will form.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
The dust of the star system.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
That is.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
So-called.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Dust.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
That particles.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Is.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Like dust.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Floating.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
In space.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
That.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Dust.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Will block.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
These stars.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Directly.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
The light emitted by the star system.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
As I said.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
It is.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Extraterrestrial light.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Radiation light.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
And.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Near-infrared.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
That is.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Near-infrared light.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Those dust.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Will absorb.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
This part of the light.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Then.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
From the perspective of.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
The observer on our planet.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
That is.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Blocking it.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Blocking that part of the light.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
But.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
After it is blocked.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
The energy is stored.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
After it is absorbed.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
It will radiate.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
These energy.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
The energy it absorbs.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Radiate out.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
But when it radiates out.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Is.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Absorbed.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
So we call.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Dusty star formation.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Or.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Dust.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Hidden star formation.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Or.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Dust obscured star formation.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Anyway.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
The meaning is.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
These star formation.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Will be.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Dust.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Gave.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Gave.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Gave.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000

Gave.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Gave.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Gave.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Gave.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Gave.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Gave.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Gave.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Gave.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000

As an example, this study paper

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:36.180
The green and blue

01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:40.940
are basically visible light or near-infrared light

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:43.740
So what they represent is the horizontal part

01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:47.060
And the red part is the result of OMAR observation

01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:49.060
So the result of OMAR observation is basically dust

01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:54.580
Then they found that the horizontal part is a messy piece

01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:55.580
That is, they have a wider distribution

01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:58.860
And their dust is very compact in the middle

01:59:58.860 --> 01:59:59.860
So what they found is that the horizontal part is a messy piece

01:59:59.860 --> 01:59:59.860
