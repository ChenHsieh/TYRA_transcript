1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
This is also a similar picture.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,080
This is the radius,

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,560
and this is the brightness distribution picture.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,360
So you find that this HSC, H-band

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,560
is the mirror infrared light,

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,280
so it's very new.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,720
Its distribution is wider,

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,320
and its distribution is more concentrated.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,000
Concentrated in a closer radius.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,040
So it tells you that

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,360
these dusts are more compact,

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,960
concentrated in the center of the galaxy.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,160
And the stars are running around.

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,280
What does this tell you?

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
It tells you that these SMGs

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,840
should be major mergers.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,480
As I said before,

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,400
it's two stars colliding.

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
When the two stars collide,

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,160
these stars are running around.

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,640
Because when the two stars collide,

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
the stars

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
can basically be regarded as collision.

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,640
They don't...

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,200
They only have gravity for each other.

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Because the two stars

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,400
don't collide.

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,800
Because the universe is very wide.

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,360
Very wide.

30
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,320
And the stars...

31
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,280
Imagine they're colliding one by one.

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,760
But there's a collision

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,040
with a collision on the left,

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,480
and a collision on the right.

35
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,080
Then you push each other.

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,280
But most collisions

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,480
just pass each other.

38
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,520
They don't collide with each other.

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,440
Because the space of the universe is very large,

40
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,840
and the frequency of the stars is very small.

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
So the stars

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
basically don't collide with each other.

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,400
So they run around in space.

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
It's like this.

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,680
They only have gravity

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
for each other.

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,760
But DOS doesn't.

48
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
DOS actually comes from...

49
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,040
At first, it comes from gas.

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,720
Gas...

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,920
When the two stars collide,

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,080
the gas will collide with each other.

53
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,560
Then they will lose their kinetic energy.

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,040
OK.

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,240
And after the gas loses kinetic energy,

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,080
they will...

57
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
fall to the center of the star

58
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,000
because of gravity.

59
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,640
Because of gravity,

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
they will fall into the gravitational well of the core.

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
And after the gas reaches the core,

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,000
they will form new stars.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
New stars.

64
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
They will produce star formation.

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
After star formation,

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
as I said at the beginning,

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,560
after star formation,

68
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,920
they will have supernova,

69
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,000
and then they will produce some gravity,

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,200
and then they will produce these dusts.

71
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,160
OK.

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,440
So that's why these dusts are gathered in the middle.

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
So basically, this paper tells you

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,320
what SMG is.

75
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,560
But what this paper doesn't have is

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
that it only has DOS and STAR components.

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,880
It doesn't have

78
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,640
gas components.

79
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
That is, you have to observe through

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
the plane of the molecule or the plane of the atom.

81
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
Because this part is still being developed.

82
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
We're still waiting for ALMA

83
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,440
to build more instruments

84
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,520
so that we can get this part of the observation.

85
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,200
This is also the focus of SMG

86
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
for the next few years.

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,320
After you have this component,

88
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,920
you can draw it on the map.

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,520
Then you can compare

90
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,680
the behavior of STAR, DOS, and gas.

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,120
You can learn more about their dynamics.

92
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,920
OK.

93
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
That's all I want to say.

94
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm going to briefly introduce

95
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,680
what this field is for,

96
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
and then talk about my little project.

97
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,920
And then the last few slides

98
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,520
talk about what ALMA can do in the future.

99
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,720
Thank you, everyone.

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Thank you, Xu Liyan.

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
I've been talking for two hours.

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Do you have any questions?

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
Yes, two hours.

104
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Do we have enough time?

105
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
You can ask a few more questions.

106
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Do you have any questions?

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm not in a hurry.

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
No, I...

109
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,640
No problem. We can record for five hours.

110
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
No, no, no.

111
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
I have a question.

112
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm more interested in engineering technology.

113
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
You mentioned that

114
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
some measurements are slower.

115
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
For example, SMA is slower than ALMA.

116
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Specifically,

117
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
in terms of engineering or technology,

118
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
which link

119
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
makes it slower?

120
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Basically, it's...

121
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Let me talk about my understanding

122
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
of astronomical telescope first.

123
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Then you help me see if it's right or wrong.

124
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
As far as I know,

125
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
the antenna

126
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
receives radio signals.

127
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
No matter what kind of wavelength it is,

128
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
it's basically an electromagnetic wave.

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
It receives electromagnetic wave signals

130
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
and processes them

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
through the computer.

132
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
For example,

133
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
it combines signals from different regions

134
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
to make some visualizations.

135
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
My understanding of astronomical telescope

136
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
is like this.

137
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
I don't know if it's wrong.

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Hello?

139
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Am I disconnected?

140
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Hello?

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Hello?

142
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
I'm disconnected.

143
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
Julian, did you mute yourself?

144
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Hello?

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Hello?

146
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Can you hear me?

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes, I can hear you.

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I just disconnected.

149
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Okay, continue.

150
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
So where did you hear it just now?

151
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
You said the antenna

152
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
receives all electromagnetic wave signals.

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
It receives electromagnetic wave signals

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
and then

155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
a large part of it

156
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
is processed by the computer

157
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
after receiving electromagnetic wave signals.

158
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
It combines signals from different regions

159
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
to make visualizations.

160
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
If my understanding is correct,

161
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
when you say

162
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
an astronomical telescope

163
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
is slower than another,

164
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
which part is slower?

165
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Basically,

166
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
SMA only has 8 dashes.

167
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
ELMA has more than 60 dashes.

168
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
That's basically it.

169
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
So it's like

170
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
more dashes

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
at the same time?

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
It's called

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
collecting area.

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
So...

175
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
I'm still online.

176
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
I can see you.

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
It's basically

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
collecting area.

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
It has more than 60 dashes.

180
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
I can hear you.

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
SMA only has 8 dashes.

182
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
But SMA can't add more dashes.

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Yeah.

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
To put it simply,

185
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
it can observe

186
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
a larger area.

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
So you have more dashes in total.

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
So effectively,

189
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
you collect

190
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
more electromagnetic waves.

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
I see.

192
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
That's it.

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
SMA

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
has been doing some upgrades.

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
It can't add

196
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
more dashes,

197
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
but it can collect

198
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
more electromagnetic waves.

199
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
What does that mean?

200
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
It means

201
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
how much electromagnetic waves

202
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
a telescope can collect.

203
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Now,

204
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
a telescope

205
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
can collect

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
32...

207
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
32 GHz

208
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
of electromagnetic waves.

209
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
On the other hand,

210
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
ALMA is not that big.

211
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
ALMA is only 8 GHz.

212
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Yeah.

213
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
But SMA can only

214
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
make up for it.

215
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
It doesn't add more dashes,

216
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
but it can increase

217
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
the frequency of each individual dash.

218
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
So it can collect

219
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
more electromagnetic waves

220
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
at the same time.

221
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Yeah.

222
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
But it's not enough.

223
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Yeah.

224
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
So...

225
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Is there anything else?

226
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
He's not here.

227
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
His signal

228
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
seems to be lagging.

229
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
No.

230
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
I'm here.

231
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Is there

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Jenny?

233
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Is there anything else?

234
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Is Jenny here?

235
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
She hasn't asked a question.

236
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
If possible,

237
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
I'd like to ask another question.

238
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
At the beginning,

239
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
you mentioned astronomy

240
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
and cosmology.

241
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
What's the difference?

242
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Astronomy is about the universe.

243
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
It's hard to define.

244
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Basically,

245
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
I think

246
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
astronomy and cosmology

247
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
can be seen as

248
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
two different areas

249
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
with overlapping.

250
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
But they are not the same

251
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
or completely different.

252
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
They overlap.

253
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
I can explain it this way.

254
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
For example,

255
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
if someone studies

256
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
the distribution of dark matter

257
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
in the universe,

258
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
to understand the evolution of the universe

259
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
to understand the distribution

260
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
of dark matter in the universe

261
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
and to influence

262
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
dark matter...

263
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Have you heard of dark matter?

264
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
The distribution of dark matter

265
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
affects the formation of the galaxy.

266
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
The formation of the galaxy.

267
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
This is basically cosmology.

268
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
But it's also astronomy.

269
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Because it's related to the evolution of the galaxy.

270
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
As long as it's related to the evolution of the galaxy,

271
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
it's related to our observations of the galaxy.

272
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
If you use a microscope

273
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
or a sub-millimeter or a radio,

274
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
you have to use astronomy to observe.

275
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
This is astronomy.

276
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Cosmology is also astronomy.

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
But some things

278
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
are purely cosmology.

279
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
For example,

280
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
pure cosmology

281
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
is basically physics.

282
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
For example,

283
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
the study of the explosion theory.

284
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I just...

285
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
For example,

286
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
the study of the early universe.

287
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
The explosion theory is

288
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
the early universe to the Big Bang.

289
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
After that,

290
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
there was a period of very crazy expansion.

291
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
This part

292
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
is very theoretical.

293
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
It's hard for us

294
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
to actually observe.

295
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
It's all physical models.

296
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
You have to understand very deep theoretical physics.

297
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
This kind of thing

298
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
I will classify it

299
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
as pure physics.

300
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Basically, it's cosmology,

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
but not astronomy.

302
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
You can say that.

303
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
The other part is astronomy,

304
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
but not cosmology.

305
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
It's a good example. For example,

306
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
some people study small stars,

307
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
study comets,

308
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
or study

309
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
very basic star formation.

310
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
But it's not my kind of star formation.

311
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
It's a star formation one by one.

312
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
It studies stars,

313
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
such as small stars and comets.

314
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
It studies these things

315
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
at a close distance.

316
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
It's not like

317
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
when I study galaxies,

318
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I will talk about redshifts.

319
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
If you study solar systems,

320
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
small stars and comets,

321
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
you won't use the concept of redshifts.

322
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Because they are too close to us.

323
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
I just said that redshifts are mainly...

324
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Of course, there are many kinds of redshifts.

325
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
They will use Doppler redshifts,

326
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
because they have Doppler redshifts as soon as they move.

327
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Cosmological redshifts,

328
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
because the universe is expanding,

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
they will observe this effect.

330
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
If you study

331
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
very close stars,

332
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
study comet formation,

333
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
they won't use cosmological redshifts.

334
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
They will observe that any

335
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
blue and redshifts are Doppler effects.

336
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Basically, when you study these things,

337
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
you don't need to consider

338
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
the evolution of our universe.

339
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
You don't need to consider

340
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
whether there is dark energy

341
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,080
or dark matter.

342
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,080
So,

343
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
these things will be classified as pure astronomy.

344
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
They don't have cosmological redshifts.

345
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
I feel a little bit

346
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
like that.

347
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Basically, this is what I want to say.

348
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Because people in this field

349
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
will have a better feeling.

350
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Okay, thank you.

351
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Because

352
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
the time is a bit late,

353
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
we will end here today.

354
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Okay, thank you.

355
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Can you still hear me?

356
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
I know I can hear you.

357
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
I'm just a little bit laggy.

358
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Okay, let's thank Xu Liyan again.

359
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Okay, thank you.

360
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Okay, that's it. See you next week.

361
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Okay, bye bye.

362
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Bye bye.
