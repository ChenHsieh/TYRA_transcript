00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Can you see me now?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Ok

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Can you see my screen now?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Yes?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Yes, yes, yes

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I will turn off my camera

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
So it will be smoother

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Ok

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Let me tell you

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
There are two more people here

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
One is here

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
One is over there

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
The camera may not be able to see

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
There are three people here

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
If they have any questions

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Don't be surprised if they are real people

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Sorry

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
There were some microphone issues

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
That's why we are delaying

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
The topic I am going to talk about

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
looks a bit

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
difficult to understand

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Functional connectivity and dynamics

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
and burn organization

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
In short

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
The main purpose of my research

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
is to look at the functional connections

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
between neural networks

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
The so-called functional connections

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
are the neural signals

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
generated by neurons

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
during activation

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
How these neural signals

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
are transmitted between different brains

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
This is the main thing

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I am going to talk about today

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I will divide it into two parts

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
The first part is introduction

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Introduction is a general

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
background idea

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
If you are not a neurologist

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
You need to know something

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
to make it easier for us to explain

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
This is one of the main research

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
The second part is

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
the current message

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It is about a

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
special project

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
The last part is all about that project

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
The first part is

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
a little bit

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
scientific

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
The second part is more about

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
that research

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I have seen

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
the comments

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Some people are just

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
talking about science

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
So I want to talk about

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
what is neuroscience

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I have seen

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
on the internet

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Neuroscience is a

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
comprehensive research

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It includes chemistry,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
medicine, physiology, medicine

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
even computer science and engineering

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
There are a lot of subjects

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
From the perspective of

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
modern neuroscience

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
There are

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
cells

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
and neurons

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
If you

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
enlarge the scale

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
There are cognitive science

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
and behavioral science

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Finally, there is transfer medicine

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
It is to apply the research

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
in the lab to clinical

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
If you want to

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
There are micro scale,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
mesoscale and macroscale

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
The last part is

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
about the research

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
The first part is

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
between neurons

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
The research topic is

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
between neurons

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Let me correct

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
The first part is

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
about single neurons

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
The second part is

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
between neurons

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
The last part is

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
between neurons

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
The biggest part

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
is what I have done

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
At the same time

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
What I have done

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
will cover the last part

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I will use

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
a simple sentence

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
It is about

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
neural connectivity

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
You will hear

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
functional connectivity

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It is about

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
the connectivity

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
of neurons

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
There is another point

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
We want to see

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
the connection of

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
human behavior

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
For example,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
their behavior

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
in clinical

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
or in cognitive science

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I will talk about

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
functional connectivity later

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I will talk about

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
functional connectivity later

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Some people

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
have studied

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
psychology or

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
cognitive science

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
They have heard about

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
some theories

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I will give you examples

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
The left one is

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Localization

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Scientists

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
are studying

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
brain function

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
or human behavior

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
They want to

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
find out which part of the brain

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
is responsible for which function

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
This is a result of

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
FMRI

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
You can see

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
the three colored areas

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
This means that

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
when the subject is doing something

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
the neurons in these three areas are active

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
This is a more

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
traditional theory

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
They think

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
they need to

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
classify

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
which part of the brain

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
is responsible for which function

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Another one is called

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Distributed Brain Network

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
These two schools

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
have been fighting for a long time

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
But recently

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
because of some new research methods

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Most people think

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
this is more like the human brain we expect

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
In this new school

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
their focus

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
is not on studying

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
a single brain area

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
but on the functionalities of the brain areas

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
This yellow arrow

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
For example, this brain area

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
may send a message to this area

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
and this area

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
may send a message to this area

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
So the brain area

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
receives feedback

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
and sends the signal

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
to this area

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
The picture on the right

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
is more like what I am doing now

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
This is the so-called

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Functional Connectivity

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
This is the so-called

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Functional Connectivity

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
This is the so-called

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Functional Connectivity

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
So how do we

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
study it?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
How can we measure

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
the so-called Functional Connectivity?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
In statistics

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
or basic definition

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Functional Connectivity

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
is like

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
describing two brain areas

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
or two different areas

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
in the same area

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
For example,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
the picture on the right

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
is a brain

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Let's say there are three areas

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
we call region of interest

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
1, 2, 3, 3

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
The blue, red, and green lines

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
refer to

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
the time course

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I am using the example of FMRI

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
This is the signal change

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
caused by the activation of neurons

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
This is the signal change

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
We use these signals

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
as the basic research

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It's a bit like the ingredients

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
of cooking

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
After you get these things

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
you start to use different methods

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
to see the relationship between them

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Of course, you don't have to use FMRI

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You can use many different machines

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
For example, the EEG of the brain

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
or the MEG of the brain

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
But I am using FMRI

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
for my research

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
So any so-called Functional Connectivity

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
based on FMRI

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
We call it

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
time course or time series

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We use this data to do the research

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Let's say you have three areas

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
of interest

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
The first thing you need to do

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
is to extract their signals

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Then

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
what you need to do is

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
to use different methods

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
to calculate the relationship

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
between two brain areas

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
The most common is

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Pairwise Correlation

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
If you use Pairwise Correlation

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
you will see a lot of values

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
For example

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
This is the relationship

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
between RI2 and RI1

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
If they are positive

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
For example, this is

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
about 0.5

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
This means that

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
this area and this area

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
are connected

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Don't look at the

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
diagonal one

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
It means that

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
they are connected

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
But this is not a normal situation

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
This is because we are calculating

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So usually after we calculate

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
and get this evidence

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
We will force the diagonal line

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
to become 0

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
This is mainly

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
the way we use

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Of course, in this part

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Many people use different methods

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
For example, Partial Correlation

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
There are many ways to use

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
It doesn't mean which method is better

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
It depends on

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
what you want to observe

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
After that

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
After we get

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
this evidence

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
we will be curious

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
what we are going to do next

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Many people

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
find a big problem

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
There are too many signals

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
and too much information

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
what I'm going to talk about next

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
is to use some new methods

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
so that you

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
can

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
report some data

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
to let everyone know

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
how different these numbers

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
represent the whole matrix

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Wait a minute

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Ok

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
So just now we have

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
got the evidence

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
What I'm going to talk about

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
today is

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Graph Theory

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and Dynamic Functional Connectivity

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Sorry

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Let me interrupt

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Ok

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I just want to tell you

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
If you have any questions

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
you can

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
put them in the chat

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and I will

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
find the time to ask

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Or if you have any questions

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
you can also ask

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
and I will answer

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
the questions

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I can't see the chat

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
so I don't know what you are asking

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
If you have any questions

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
you can ask

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Ok

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Before we talk about Graph Theory

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
do you have any questions?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
If not, let's continue

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Here we have a little bit

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
of abstract

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I will try my best

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
If you have any questions

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
we can continue later

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
If you have studied Maths

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
you will know that Graph Theory

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
is a part of Maths

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Its purpose is

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
to describe the relationship

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
between two points

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
to describe the relationship

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
between two points

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
In Neuroscience

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Graph Theory is a good tool

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
In Graph Theory

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
you can get a lot of different values

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Each value

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
represents a feature of the network

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
For example

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
we will talk about

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
some different values later

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Some values may represent

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
how well the signal is integrated

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
in the brain

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
or how well it is integrated

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
in a single system

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So there will be some different messages

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
When you are doing

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Graph Theory

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
there are two important things

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
that you must get

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
The first one is Node

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
The other one is Edge

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Node is the region of interest

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
On the right side

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
this is the information

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
of the actual recipient

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I have 36 RIs

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
so there are 36 brain areas

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Usually we put the left brain area

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
in the front

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and the right brain area

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
in the back

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So this whole matrix

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
represents the relationship

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
between each of the 36 brain areas

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
The so-called edge

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
is the connectivity matrix

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
which is this

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Usually we get this matrix

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
which is the one you saw before

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
which is the one you saw before

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
which is the one you saw before

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
which is the one you saw before

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
which is the one you saw before

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
The one above this threshold

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
we think it actually has a connection

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
The one below this threshold

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
we force it to become 0

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
we force it to become 0

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
We don't look at these connections

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
We think it is weaker

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
maybe because of some miscommunication

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
So with these two files

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
you can run Graph Theory

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
This is what we talked about

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
at the beginning

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
When you run Graph Theory

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
you can get a lot of different values

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
which represent a certain specialness on the Internet

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
With these values

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
you can get to know the Internet better

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
you can get to know the Internet better

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and you can also report

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
the differences between different things

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
For example, there are two groups

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
One is patient and the other is normal person

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
and you get this matrix

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
but if you just show this matrix to everyone

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
and say that the patient's matrix looks like this

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
and the normal person's matrix looks like this

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
But this matrix has too much information

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
It's hard for you to

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
find out which side is wrong

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
or which side is different

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
So if you use graph theory

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
So if you use graph theory

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
you can report a number

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
For example, how good is the overall information of the brain

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Then the number of patients may be lower

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
or the number of normal people will be higher

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
This is one of the benefits of using graph theory

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
This is one of the benefits of using graph theory

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
So below

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
This is an example

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
That is, what kind of value do we have?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
That is, what kind of value do we have?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Here you can see different colors

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Here you can see different colors

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
The green part is the so-called integration

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
The green part is the so-called integration

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
If you have this value

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
It represents integration

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It means that the signal

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
How well is it integrated in the brain

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
How well is it integrated in the brain

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Then the blue one

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It's called segregation

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
It's a bit like two different things

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
It's a bit like two different things

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It means that in a single system

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It means that in a single system

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
In a single system

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
how good the information is integrated

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
because you can see

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
If this is a system

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
This is another system

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
So-called integration is the relationship between the system and the system

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
So-called integration is the relationship between the system and the system

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
The yellow one is called loco majors

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
The yellow one is called loco majors

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
If you have 100 RIs

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
If you have 100 RIs

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Then you will have 100 numbers

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Each number represents this characteristic RI

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
The red one is called centrality

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
The red one is called centrality

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
In short, this is the importance of this point

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
In short, this is the importance of this point

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
In short, this is the importance of this point

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
These two

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
They are the same

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
If you have wrong graph theory today

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
If you have wrong graph theory today

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
A matrix will have several different numbers

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Suppose it has 36 RIs

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Suppose it has 36 RIs

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
So, this half side

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
is a matrix, only one number

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
no matter how many RIs it has

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
no matter how many RIs it has

15:26.000 --> 15:28.020
Also, there is a black one here, called Hubs

15:28.020 --> 15:28.020


15:28.020 --> 15:30.040
Also, there is a black one here, called Hubs

15:30.040 --> 15:32.040
as in the middle

15:32.040 --> 15:34.040
In the end, there will fastly be one

15:34.040 --> 15:36.040
About Hubs

15:36.040 --> 15:38.040
In short, you can have a lot

15:38.040 --> 15:40.040
It's a bit like

15:40.040 --> 15:42.040
connecting different systems

15:42.040 --> 15:44.040
For example, this is a system

15:44.040 --> 15:46.040
Here is another system

15:46.040 --> 15:48.040
You may find signals fromone system to another

15:48.040 --> 15:50.040
You may find signals fromone system to another

15:50.040 --> 15:52.040
So the importance of Hubs becomes very important

15:52.040 --> 15:54.040
So the importance of Hubs becomes very important

15:54.040 --> 15:56.040
Its role is like connecting different systems

15:56.040 --> 15:58.040
There is a picture at the end

15:58.040 --> 16:00.040
We will briefly introduce

16:00.040 --> 16:02.040
the Hubs that are recognized so far

16:02.040 --> 16:04.040
the Hubs that are recognized so far

16:04.040 --> 16:06.040
Here is the graph theory part

16:06.040 --> 16:08.040
Here is the graph theory part

16:08.040 --> 16:10.040
Next, this is called Dynamic Functional Converting Team

16:10.040 --> 16:12.040
Next, this is called Dynamic Functional Converting Team

16:12.040 --> 16:14.040
This is a bit newer

16:14.040 --> 16:16.040
This is about 5 or 6 years

16:16.040 --> 16:18.040
This is about 5 or 6 years

16:18.040 --> 16:20.040
It's been about 4 or 5 years

16:20.040 --> 16:22.040
More people are researching

16:22.040 --> 16:24.040
We have already mentioned that

16:24.040 --> 16:26.040
You can get a reference

16:26.040 --> 16:28.040
You can get a reference

16:28.040 --> 16:30.040
This reference represents

16:30.040 --> 16:32.040
the relationship between different RIs

16:32.040 --> 16:34.040
the relationship between different RIs

16:34.040 --> 16:36.040
In the early days

16:36.040 --> 16:38.040
In the early days

16:38.040 --> 16:40.040
Because this reference

16:40.040 --> 16:42.040
It's the same in time

16:42.040 --> 16:44.040
It won't change

16:44.040 --> 16:46.040
But with a new method

16:46.040 --> 16:48.040
You will find that it is constantly changing

16:48.040 --> 16:50.040
You will find that it is constantly changing

16:50.040 --> 16:52.040
The brain is not a stable system

16:52.040 --> 16:54.040
The brain is not a stable system

16:54.040 --> 16:56.040
It keeps changing

16:56.040 --> 16:58.040
It's called non-stationary

16:58.040 --> 17:00.040
This functional connectivity pattern

17:00.040 --> 17:02.040
This functional connectivity pattern

17:02.040 --> 17:04.040
It continues to change

17:04.040 --> 17:06.040
The time is about a few seconds to a few minutes

17:06.040 --> 17:08.040
The time is about a few seconds to a few minutes

17:08.040 --> 17:10.040
From 26 seconds to 86 seconds

17:10.040 --> 17:12.040
From 26 seconds to 86 seconds

17:12.040 --> 17:14.040
Its reference looks like this

17:14.040 --> 17:16.040
From 26 seconds to 162 seconds

17:16.040 --> 17:18.040
It will look different

17:18.040 --> 17:20.040
This is more than 400 seconds

17:20.040 --> 17:22.040
This is more than 400 seconds

17:22.040 --> 17:24.040
If you don't care about the time difference

17:24.040 --> 17:26.040
If you don't care about the time difference

17:26.040 --> 17:28.040
If you have less than 5 minutes

17:28.040 --> 17:30.040
If you have less than 5 minutes

17:30.040 --> 17:32.040
This is the average time difference

17:32.040 --> 17:34.040
It looks like this

17:34.040 --> 17:36.040
But you can find that they are all different

17:36.040 --> 17:38.040
In addition to the difference in time difference

17:38.040 --> 17:40.040
If you use the wrong graph theory

17:40.040 --> 17:42.040
You will find that there are many points

17:42.040 --> 17:44.040
Originally there is a connection

17:44.040 --> 17:46.040
But at a certain point in time

17:46.040 --> 17:48.040
There is no connection

17:48.040 --> 17:50.040
For example, the first one is the visual area

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
At this point in time

17:52.040 --> 17:54.040
It has a connection with the other two RIs

17:54.040 --> 17:56.040
But you will find here

17:56.040 --> 17:58.040
It has a connection with more RIs

17:58.040 --> 18:00.040
This is completely gone

18:00.040 --> 18:02.040
So you can know

18:02.040 --> 18:04.040
It continues to change

18:04.040 --> 18:06.040
It continues to change

18:06.040 --> 18:08.040
Time and space are different

18:08.040 --> 18:10.040
Time and space are different

18:10.040 --> 18:12.040
Here is the relationship of time

18:12.040 --> 18:14.040
Here is the relationship of space

18:14.040 --> 18:16.040
Here is a video

18:16.040 --> 18:18.040
Here is a video

18:18.040 --> 18:20.040
Here is a video

18:20.040 --> 18:22.040
Here is a video

18:22.040 --> 18:24.040
Here is a video

18:24.040 --> 18:26.040
You can see that it continues to change at different points in time

18:26.040 --> 18:28.040
So this graph is not fixed

18:28.040 --> 18:30.040
So this graph is not fixed

18:30.040 --> 18:32.040
It keeps changing

18:32.040 --> 18:34.040
It keeps changing

18:34.040 --> 18:36.040
This is 300 seconds

18:36.040 --> 18:38.040
This is 300 seconds

18:38.040 --> 18:40.040
The duration is more than 300 seconds

18:40.040 --> 18:42.040
The duration is more than 300 seconds

18:42.040 --> 18:44.040
So you can see

18:44.040 --> 18:46.040
At this point

18:46.040 --> 18:48.040
There is a connection between the two ris

18:48.040 --> 18:50.040
But it disappeared when we go to the next time

18:50.040 --> 18:52.040
We can prove that

18:52.040 --> 18:54.040
Functional connectivity continues to change

18:54.040 --> 18:56.040
Functional connectivity continues to change

18:56.040 --> 18:58.040
Why should we study this

18:58.040 --> 19:00.040
What are the advantages

19:00.040 --> 19:02.040
Some people have done research before

19:02.040 --> 19:04.040
Some people have done research before

19:04.040 --> 19:06.040
Sorry

19:06.040 --> 19:10.040
It's because the flow of function connectivity

19:10.040 --> 19:14.040
It's very much related to the human cognition

19:14.040 --> 19:16.040
For example

19:16.040 --> 19:18.040
Some people use cognitive features

19:18.040 --> 19:20.040
and invite the objects

19:20.040 --> 19:22.040
they ask them to do

19:22.040 --> 19:24.040
Work in memory taste

19:24.040 --> 19:26.040
when the brain of manabla

19:26.040 --> 19:26.040


19:26.040 --> 19:28.040
their functional connectivity

19:28.040 --> 19:30.040
is constantly changing

19:30.040 --> 19:32.040
and when fuctional connectivity

19:32.040 --> 19:34.040
become bigger

19:34.040 --> 19:38.040
the performance of the host is getting better and better

19:38.040 --> 19:40.040
So this is a piece of evidence

19:40.040 --> 19:42.040
that tells us

19:42.040 --> 19:44.040
Functional connectivity is constantly changing

19:44.040 --> 19:46.040
and this change is actually

19:46.040 --> 19:50.040
very much related to human cognition

19:50.040 --> 19:54.040
In addition to the host doing things

19:54.040 --> 19:56.040
When humans are resting

19:56.040 --> 19:58.040
You can also observe

19:58.040 --> 20:00.040
Functional connectivity is constantly changing

20:00.040 --> 20:02.040
This is actually a bit like

20:02.040 --> 20:04.040
the experiment I'm going to talk about

20:04.040 --> 20:06.040
Because when I'm doing experiments

20:06.040 --> 20:08.040
My data is mainly resting

20:08.040 --> 20:10.040
And then

20:10.040 --> 20:12.040
Next is

20:12.040 --> 20:14.040
Okay, so far

20:14.040 --> 20:16.040
I want to ask if there are any questions

20:16.040 --> 20:18.040
Because the next one is for a specific experiment

20:18.040 --> 20:20.040
Background

20:20.040 --> 20:22.040
Hello

20:22.040 --> 20:24.040
Hello

20:24.040 --> 20:26.040
Yes, I heard

20:26.040 --> 20:28.040
Hello, I would like to ask

20:28.040 --> 20:30.040
If you imagine each node as a time series

20:30.040 --> 20:32.040
Then the picture in front of you

20:32.040 --> 20:34.040
Its edge is a direction

20:34.040 --> 20:36.040
That thing should not be calculated by Pearson Correlation

20:36.040 --> 20:38.040
Which one

20:38.040 --> 20:40.040
You mean this one or the one in front

20:40.040 --> 20:42.040
The part of the graph theory in front

20:42.040 --> 20:44.040
It's like this direction in the brain

20:44.040 --> 20:46.040
How do you get it

20:46.040 --> 20:48.040
Oh yes

20:48.040 --> 20:50.040
In the front

20:50.040 --> 20:52.040
There is a picture of how we get the evidence

20:52.040 --> 20:54.040
There is a place to tell you

20:54.040 --> 20:56.040
Basically if you use

20:56.040 --> 20:58.040
Pairwise Correlation

20:58.040 --> 21:00.040
There is no so-called direction

21:00.040 --> 21:02.040
But if you use other

21:02.040 --> 21:04.040
For example, there is a so-called Bayesian Network

21:04.040 --> 21:06.040
If you use that method

21:06.040 --> 21:08.040
You can get the so-called

21:08.040 --> 21:10.040
Relation

21:10.040 --> 21:12.040
You see this one on the right

21:12.040 --> 21:14.040
This curve is actually symmetrical

21:14.040 --> 21:16.040
Because the method I use is Partial Correlation

21:16.040 --> 21:18.040
With Simple Correlation

21:18.040 --> 21:20.040
So here you can't see any relation

21:20.040 --> 21:22.040
But if I use today

21:22.040 --> 21:24.040
For example

21:24.040 --> 21:26.040
Bayesian Model Network

21:26.040 --> 21:28.040
It will tell you that I have two

21:28.040 --> 21:30.040
RIE and RIE2

21:30.040 --> 21:32.040
The relationship between them

21:32.040 --> 21:34.040
Is it from 1 to 2 or 2 to 1

21:34.040 --> 21:36.040
If you use Bayesian

21:36.040 --> 21:38.040
You can get this information

21:38.040 --> 21:40.040
But the one I use today

21:40.040 --> 21:42.040
I can't tell you the relation

21:44.040 --> 21:46.040
So it becomes

21:46.040 --> 21:48.040
It depends on how you get the evidence

21:48.040 --> 21:50.040
It will tell you

21:50.040 --> 21:52.040
You are

21:52.040 --> 21:54.040
In fact, there is also this

21:54.040 --> 21:56.040
Your evidence

21:56.040 --> 21:58.040
Can be used

21:58.040 --> 22:00.040
There is directionality

22:00.040 --> 22:02.040
There is no directionality

22:02.040 --> 22:04.040
You can also use weighted or unweighted

22:04.040 --> 22:06.040
That is

22:06.040 --> 22:08.040
Each value represents a different strength

22:08.040 --> 22:10.040
Or you can also turn it into

22:10.040 --> 22:12.040
A binary matrix

22:12.040 --> 22:14.040
There is only 1 and 0

22:14.040 --> 22:16.040
1 means it is not connected

22:16.040 --> 22:18.040
0 means it is not connected

22:20.040 --> 22:22.040
Any other questions

22:24.040 --> 22:26.040
Then I will continue

22:28.040 --> 22:30.040
Okay, next one

22:30.040 --> 22:32.040
It's more about

22:32.040 --> 22:34.040
The experiment I'm going to talk about

22:34.040 --> 22:36.040
Because I'm actually now

22:36.040 --> 22:38.040
In

22:38.040 --> 22:40.040
Our lab

22:40.040 --> 22:42.040
There is a called

22:42.040 --> 22:44.040
Pacific Parkinson's Research Center

22:44.040 --> 22:46.040
So our

22:46.040 --> 22:48.040
Most of the subjects are

22:48.040 --> 22:50.040
Patients with Parkinson's

22:50.040 --> 22:52.040
And some normal control

22:52.040 --> 22:54.040
What we are mainly talking about

22:54.040 --> 22:56.040
Is whether we can

22:56.040 --> 22:58.040
Use functional connectivity

22:58.040 --> 23:00.040
To find the so-called biological indicator

23:00.040 --> 23:02.040
We call it biomarker

23:02.040 --> 23:04.040
If we can find this biomarker

23:04.040 --> 23:06.040
The first one is

23:06.040 --> 23:08.040
Can increase the diagnosis rate

23:08.040 --> 23:10.040
If you don't know

23:10.040 --> 23:12.040
How sick this person is

23:12.040 --> 23:14.040
You can scan his brain

23:14.040 --> 23:16.040
Then use this method

23:16.040 --> 23:18.040
You can roughly classify

23:18.040 --> 23:20.040
Is he very serious

23:20.040 --> 23:22.040
For example, today

23:22.040 --> 23:24.040
There is a person

23:24.040 --> 23:26.040
The diagnosis is early

23:26.040 --> 23:28.040
But you want to know

23:28.040 --> 23:30.040
For example, after 10 years or 5 years

23:30.040 --> 23:32.040
How is his condition

23:32.040 --> 23:34.040
Do we need to take some preventive measures

23:34.040 --> 23:36.040
If we have this kind of information

23:36.040 --> 23:38.040
We can also predict

23:38.040 --> 23:40.040
What will happen in 5 or 10 years

23:40.040 --> 23:42.040
In short

23:42.040 --> 23:44.040
Because there were a lot of research

23:44.040 --> 23:46.040
Also using

23:46.040 --> 23:48.040
Racine state fMRI

23:48.040 --> 23:50.040
These studies have reported

23:50.040 --> 23:52.040
Whether you are using graph theory

23:52.040 --> 23:54.040
Or so-called dynamic functional connectivity

23:54.040 --> 23:56.040
You can find

23:56.040 --> 23:58.040
Some differences between patients and normal people

23:58.040 --> 24:00.040
These patients

24:00.040 --> 24:02.040
Not just limited to

24:02.040 --> 24:04.040
Parkinson's

24:04.040 --> 24:06.040
For example, Alzheimer's

24:06.040 --> 24:08.040
Or some depression

24:08.040 --> 24:10.040
Or bipolar disorder, etc.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.040
So what we mainly see today

24:12.040 --> 24:14.040
Is if

24:14.040 --> 24:16.040
We are purely talking about Parkinson's disease

24:16.040 --> 24:18.040
Can we use

24:18.040 --> 24:20.040
Racine state functional connectivity

24:22.040 --> 24:24.040
Find a so-called biomarker

24:26.040 --> 24:28.040
Before that, there are two important

24:28.040 --> 24:30.040
Concepts to introduce first

24:30.040 --> 24:32.040
Brain organization and dynamic functional connectivity

24:32.040 --> 24:34.040
So actually this

24:34.040 --> 24:36.040
I have talked about the previous background

24:36.040 --> 24:38.040
Brain organization

24:38.040 --> 24:40.040
You use graph theory

24:40.040 --> 24:42.040
Then get a lot of numbers

24:42.040 --> 24:44.040
Different numbers

24:44.040 --> 24:46.040
Will represent different network features

24:46.040 --> 24:48.040
These features

24:48.040 --> 24:50.040
Also represent

24:50.040 --> 24:52.040
So-called brain organization

24:52.040 --> 24:54.040
There are two points here

24:54.040 --> 24:56.040
For example, there are two principles

24:56.040 --> 24:58.040
The first one is

24:58.040 --> 25:00.040
Functional integration

25:00.040 --> 25:02.040
It means to look at the message

25:02.040 --> 25:04.040
Neural network message

25:04.040 --> 25:06.040
In the whole system

25:08.040 --> 25:10.040
Then the other one is

25:10.040 --> 25:12.040
Functional segregation

25:12.040 --> 25:14.040
In a single system

25:14.040 --> 25:16.040
In fact, we can say

25:16.040 --> 25:18.040
The human brain is in

25:18.040 --> 25:20.040
A balance between segregation and integration

25:20.040 --> 25:22.040
It's not all integration

25:22.040 --> 25:24.040
But it won't

25:24.040 --> 25:26.040
It's all segregation

25:26.040 --> 25:28.040
Then I think

25:28.040 --> 25:30.040
If you are doing

25:30.040 --> 25:32.040
For example, when you are doing

25:32.040 --> 25:34.040
Higher-level work

25:34.040 --> 25:36.040
You need integration

25:36.040 --> 25:38.040
Because you have different areas of the brain

25:38.040 --> 25:40.040
To cooperate with each other

25:40.040 --> 25:42.040
To complete this work

25:42.040 --> 25:44.040
If you do it very simply

25:44.040 --> 25:46.040
For example, I just need to reach out and get a drink

25:46.040 --> 25:48.040
This action may be

25:48.040 --> 25:50.040
Simpler, not too much effort

25:50.040 --> 25:52.040
Then it's more like segregation

25:52.040 --> 25:54.040
So we will say

25:54.040 --> 25:56.040
This is the balance between these two things

25:56.040 --> 25:58.040
The other one is the dynamic functional connectivity

25:58.040 --> 26:00.040
We usually

26:00.040 --> 26:02.040
We all say

26:02.040 --> 26:04.040
We will use the so-called time-varying method

26:04.040 --> 26:06.040
To measure dynamic functional connectivity

26:06.040 --> 26:08.040
This method

26:08.040 --> 26:10.040
There are many different

26:10.040 --> 26:12.040
Different methods

26:12.040 --> 26:14.040
One of the methods I will talk about later is called sliding window

26:14.040 --> 26:16.040
It is one of the many different methods

26:16.040 --> 26:18.040
Then that method is

26:18.040 --> 26:20.040
So far

26:20.040 --> 26:22.040
Most commonly used

26:22.040 --> 26:24.040
Just like we just said

26:24.040 --> 26:26.040
Because the brain is not a stationary system

26:26.040 --> 26:28.040
So you need to know

26:28.040 --> 26:30.040
How does it change in time?

26:30.040 --> 26:32.040
Then in our research today

26:32.040 --> 26:34.040
Do you want

26:34.040 --> 26:36.040
The most interesting thing is to know

26:36.040 --> 26:38.040
How does the brain connect with the disease?

26:38.040 --> 26:40.040
How does the brain connect with cognitive functions?

26:42.040 --> 26:44.040
Here is

26:44.040 --> 26:46.040
The main method of this experiment

26:46.040 --> 26:48.040
Let me adjust

26:48.040 --> 26:50.040
it

26:52.040 --> 26:54.040
There are a lot of parameters

26:54.040 --> 26:56.040
This is a simple experiment

26:56.040 --> 26:58.040
We have 10

26:58.040 --> 27:00.040
There are 12

27:00.040 --> 27:02.040
This is their

27:02.040 --> 27:04.040
Demographic

27:04.040 --> 27:06.040
Because

27:06.040 --> 27:08.040
PD patients are usually

27:08.040 --> 27:10.040
Old

27:10.040 --> 27:12.040
50

27:12.040 --> 27:14.040
More than 55 years old

27:16.040 --> 27:18.040
Older people are more likely to have this disease

27:18.040 --> 27:20.040
And

27:20.040 --> 27:22.040
There are more male patients

27:22.040 --> 27:24.040
So I usually see PD patients

27:24.040 --> 27:26.040
It is not surprising that there are more male patients

27:26.040 --> 27:28.040
And then

27:28.040 --> 27:30.040
UBTRS

27:30.040 --> 27:32.040
This thing

27:32.040 --> 27:34.040
It's a bit like

27:34.040 --> 27:36.040
From nature

27:36.040 --> 27:38.040
The indicator of the disease

27:38.040 --> 27:40.040
If this indicator is higher, it means that this patient

27:40.040 --> 27:42.040
More serious

27:42.040 --> 27:44.040
It's actually a bit like

27:44.040 --> 27:46.040
Bigger

27:46.040 --> 27:48.040
We actually

27:48.040 --> 27:50.040
After this, we can divide it into

27:50.040 --> 27:52.040
Many different indicators

27:52.040 --> 27:54.040
Each indicator represents a certain

27:54.040 --> 27:56.040
Symptoms

27:56.040 --> 27:58.040
This means

27:58.040 --> 28:00.040
How slow is the patient's action

28:00.040 --> 28:02.040
Trauma

28:02.040 --> 28:04.040
Tremor

28:04.040 --> 28:06.040
Rigidity

28:06.040 --> 28:08.040
PIGT

28:08.040 --> 28:10.040
Postural Instability

28:10.040 --> 28:12.040
And Gay Disorder

28:12.040 --> 28:14.040
It means

28:14.040 --> 28:16.040
His balance is not very good

28:16.040 --> 28:18.040
Coordination between actions

28:18.040 --> 28:20.040
HNY

28:20.040 --> 28:22.040
This is another

28:22.040 --> 28:24.040
If you want to know

28:24.040 --> 28:26.040
This patient

28:26.040 --> 28:28.040
How serious

28:28.040 --> 28:30.040
Stage 2 to 5

28:30.040 --> 28:32.040
2.5 is mild

28:32.040 --> 28:34.040
Not very serious

28:34.040 --> 28:36.040
The most serious is 5 to 6

28:36.040 --> 28:38.040
That's more serious

28:38.040 --> 28:40.040
Usually when we do the experiment

28:40.040 --> 28:42.040
We need someone to cooperate

28:42.040 --> 28:44.040
So we all follow the mild patient

28:44.040 --> 28:46.040
About 2 to 3

28:46.040 --> 28:48.040
And disease duration

28:48.040 --> 28:50.040
How many days have they changed

28:50.040 --> 28:52.040
This is their

28:52.040 --> 28:54.040
Out of a dosage

28:54.040 --> 28:56.040
Some people will

28:56.040 --> 28:58.040
Do research on drugs

28:58.040 --> 29:00.040
We usually record

29:00.040 --> 29:02.040
Their condition

29:02.040 --> 29:04.040
This is called apathy

29:04.040 --> 29:06.040
It actually describes

29:06.040 --> 29:08.040
Many patients with Parkinson's

29:08.040 --> 29:10.040
They lost their usual mood

29:10.040 --> 29:12.040
Become a couch potato

29:12.040 --> 29:14.040
Don't want to do anything

29:14.040 --> 29:16.040
Can't do anything

29:16.040 --> 29:18.040
We call this condition apathy

29:18.040 --> 29:20.040
Another one is depression

29:20.040 --> 29:22.040
Although it is not

29:22.040 --> 29:24.040
Mental disorder

29:24.040 --> 29:26.040
It will cause depression

29:26.040 --> 29:28.040
Or anxiety

29:28.040 --> 29:30.040
We all record

29:30.040 --> 29:32.040
The last one is

29:32.040 --> 29:34.040
Montreal Cognitive Assessment

29:34.040 --> 29:36.040
The main purpose is to measure

29:36.040 --> 29:38.040
Their cognitive function

29:38.040 --> 29:40.040
These are all the clinical data

29:40.040 --> 29:42.040
What we will do later

29:42.040 --> 29:44.040
Is to use

29:44.040 --> 29:46.040
Graph theory

29:46.040 --> 29:48.040
And dynamic function

29:48.040 --> 29:50.040
To measure

29:50.040 --> 29:52.040
Their

29:52.040 --> 29:54.040
Function

29:54.040 --> 29:56.040
And try to

29:56.040 --> 29:58.040
Compare this function

29:58.040 --> 30:00.040
With the clinical data

30:00.040 --> 30:02.040
To see which data

30:02.040 --> 30:04.040
Is related to their brain

30:04.040 --> 30:06.040
I think

30:06.040 --> 30:08.040
Let's talk about

30:08.040 --> 30:10.040
Parkinson's disease

30:10.040 --> 30:12.040
We call it

30:12.040 --> 30:14.040
Neurodegeneration disease

30:14.040 --> 30:16.040
It is caused by

30:16.040 --> 30:18.040
Neurodegeneration

30:18.040 --> 30:20.040
What is neurodegeneration

30:20.040 --> 30:22.040
Dopamine depletion

30:22.040 --> 30:24.040
It is caused by

30:24.040 --> 30:26.040
Neurodegeneration

30:26.040 --> 30:28.040
So

30:28.040 --> 30:30.040
There is not enough dopamine

30:30.040 --> 30:32.040
In the brain

30:32.040 --> 30:34.040
Dopamine is a very important neurotransmitter

30:34.040 --> 30:36.040
Without this substance

30:36.040 --> 30:38.040
There will be a lot of behavior

30:38.040 --> 30:40.040
Can't work normally

30:40.040 --> 30:42.040
And so on

30:42.040 --> 30:44.040
Where is this dopamine

30:44.040 --> 30:46.040
There is a place called

30:46.040 --> 30:48.040
Substantial Nigra

30:48.040 --> 30:50.040
It will be here

30:50.040 --> 30:52.040
The black part

30:52.040 --> 30:54.040
In the middle of the brain

30:54.040 --> 30:56.040
In a deep place

30:56.040 --> 30:58.040
If you zoom in

30:58.040 --> 31:00.040
It looks like this

31:00.040 --> 31:02.040
This is a normal person's

31:02.040 --> 31:04.040
Substantial Nigra

31:04.040 --> 31:06.040
You can see the black part

31:06.040 --> 31:08.040
Substantial Nigra

31:08.040 --> 31:10.040
Latin means black

31:10.040 --> 31:12.040
This is the place where dopamine is produced

31:12.040 --> 31:14.040
This is the patient

31:14.040 --> 31:16.040
You can see the black part

31:16.040 --> 31:18.040
There is not much black

31:18.040 --> 31:20.040
It means

31:20.040 --> 31:22.040
The patient who produces dopamine is dead

31:22.040 --> 31:24.040
So there is not much

31:24.040 --> 31:26.040
Dopamine

31:26.040 --> 31:28.040
The main symptoms

31:28.040 --> 31:30.040
You can see resting tremor

31:30.040 --> 31:32.040
If you tell them to relax

31:32.040 --> 31:34.040
It will move

31:34.040 --> 31:36.040
Even his shoulder blades will move

31:36.040 --> 31:38.040
Brachycardia is very slow

31:38.040 --> 31:40.040
For example, he walks very slowly

31:40.040 --> 31:42.040
Take things

31:42.040 --> 31:44.040
The whole action is not very slow

31:44.040 --> 31:46.040
Rigidity is stiff

31:46.040 --> 31:48.040
We usually bend our hands

31:48.040 --> 31:50.040
Then we will lose strength

31:50.040 --> 31:52.040
Then they bend back

31:52.040 --> 31:54.040
In this process

31:54.040 --> 31:56.040
You can feel that his action is very stiff

31:56.040 --> 31:58.040
Then the other side

31:58.040 --> 32:00.040
Postural problem

32:00.040 --> 32:02.040
There will be problems with their balance

32:02.040 --> 32:04.040
Many patients will fall easily

32:04.040 --> 32:06.040
The body is also very uncoordinated

32:06.040 --> 32:08.040
In addition, in recent years

32:08.040 --> 32:10.040
Many people are very interested in

32:10.040 --> 32:12.040
Non-motor symptoms

32:12.040 --> 32:14.040
In addition to these

32:14.040 --> 32:16.040
There are also some

32:16.040 --> 32:18.040
Not so related to exercise

32:18.040 --> 32:20.040
Not so related to action

32:20.040 --> 32:22.040
For example

32:22.040 --> 32:24.040
If you have seen

32:24.040 --> 32:26.040
I forgot if it was science or nature

32:26.040 --> 32:28.040
General scientific reports

32:28.040 --> 32:30.040
They mentioned

32:30.040 --> 32:32.040
Many people think Parkinson's disease

32:32.040 --> 32:34.040
Has a lot to do with gastrointestinal diseases

32:34.040 --> 32:36.040
There are many, many patients

32:36.040 --> 32:38.040
Complaining about gastrointestinal diseases

32:38.040 --> 32:40.040
Many people

32:40.040 --> 32:42.040
Many patients

32:42.040 --> 32:44.040
Complaining about gastrointestinal diseases

32:44.040 --> 32:46.040
So there is also a vote

32:46.040 --> 32:48.040
Researchers are now studying

32:48.040 --> 32:50.040
Related to gastrointestinal diseases and Parkinson's disease

32:50.040 --> 32:52.040
I am more interested in

32:52.040 --> 32:54.040
cognitive functions

32:54.040 --> 32:56.040
Although they

32:56.040 --> 32:58.040
The main problem you see

32:58.040 --> 33:00.040
Is action

33:00.040 --> 33:02.040
But their cognitive functions

33:02.040 --> 33:04.040
Changed a lot

33:04.040 --> 33:06.040
The most obvious is

33:06.040 --> 33:08.040
Concentration and execution

33:08.040 --> 33:10.040
If you ask them to do

33:10.040 --> 33:12.040
Very simple cognitive tasks

33:12.040 --> 33:14.040
They can do very well

33:14.040 --> 33:16.040
But if you ask them to do very complicated

33:16.040 --> 33:18.040
Need to keep switching

33:18.040 --> 33:20.040
Method

33:20.040 --> 33:22.040
They are easy to fail

33:22.040 --> 33:24.040
So this is a

33:24.040 --> 33:26.040
Proof

33:26.040 --> 33:28.040
Their cognitive functions

33:28.040 --> 33:30.040
There is a little degradation

33:30.040 --> 33:32.040
As for the data I used

33:32.040 --> 33:34.040
Resistive Function MRI

33:34.040 --> 33:36.040
A total of 8 minutes

33:36.040 --> 33:38.040
Then I

33:38.040 --> 33:40.040
There is one here

33:40.040 --> 33:42.040
Tell you

33:42.040 --> 33:44.040
How do we do the experiment

33:44.040 --> 33:46.040
What is the so-called data

33:46.040 --> 33:48.040
This picture is MRI

33:48.040 --> 33:50.040
You see

33:50.040 --> 33:52.040
MRI machine

33:52.040 --> 33:54.040
Usually we ask the patient to lie on the examination bed

33:54.040 --> 33:56.040
Then the doctor will put

33:56.040 --> 33:58.040
In the middle, this is a button

33:58.040 --> 34:00.040
Search for them

34:00.040 --> 34:02.040
Then the bed will rise

34:02.040 --> 34:04.040
Send the patient to the center of the entire machine

34:04.040 --> 34:06.040
Because the magnetic field in the middle is more stable

34:06.040 --> 34:08.040
Then we started

34:08.040 --> 34:10.040
Scan

34:10.040 --> 34:12.040
One thing you need to say

34:12.040 --> 34:14.040
MRI's noise is very loud

34:14.040 --> 34:16.040
So we will give the patient

34:16.040 --> 34:18.040
Earplugs

34:18.040 --> 34:20.040
Protect their hearing

34:20.040 --> 34:22.040
Because it is a magnetic field

34:22.040 --> 34:24.040
So there can be no metal on the body

34:24.040 --> 34:26.040
For example, keys, wallets, rings

34:26.040 --> 34:28.040
All have to be taken down

34:28.040 --> 34:30.040
Including women's underwear

34:30.040 --> 34:32.040
So for the time being

34:32.040 --> 34:34.040
How to change clothes

34:34.040 --> 34:36.040
Then this is the file

34:36.040 --> 34:38.040
The image we got

34:38.040 --> 34:40.040
In principle

34:40.040 --> 34:42.040
We will scan two images

34:42.040 --> 34:44.040
The most basic

34:44.040 --> 34:46.040
One is called T1 Weighted Imaging

34:46.040 --> 34:48.040
This is to provide you a structural image

34:48.040 --> 34:50.040
You can see it clearly

34:50.040 --> 34:52.040
This image will tell you where the brain is

34:52.040 --> 34:54.040
Gray is gray

34:54.040 --> 34:56.040
White is white

34:56.040 --> 34:58.040
The empty place in the middle

34:58.040 --> 35:00.040
There is water

35:00.040 --> 35:02.040
Brain

35:02.040 --> 35:04.040
These two are eyeballs

35:04.040 --> 35:06.040
The middle is the air

35:06.040 --> 35:08.040
This image provides you a very clear

35:08.040 --> 35:10.040
Information on the structure

35:10.040 --> 35:12.040
In addition, we will scan the functional imaging

35:12.040 --> 35:14.040
We call Bolt Signal

35:14.040 --> 35:16.040
Here is written

35:16.040 --> 35:18.040
This image is physical

35:18.040 --> 35:20.040
If you don't deal with it, you can't see anything

35:20.040 --> 35:22.040
You can only see the middle

35:22.040 --> 35:24.040
CSF

35:24.040 --> 35:26.040
Next to it

35:26.040 --> 35:28.040
You can't clearly define the brain

35:28.040 --> 35:30.040
Gray and white

35:30.040 --> 35:32.040
So when we analyze

35:32.040 --> 35:34.040
The point is to analyze this image

35:34.040 --> 35:36.040
Ok

35:36.040 --> 35:38.040
Because actually

35:38.040 --> 35:40.040
The principle of FMI is quite complicated

35:40.040 --> 35:42.040
This is what I have found so far

35:42.040 --> 35:44.040
I have seen the simplest and most powerful

35:44.040 --> 35:46.040
A picture can be introduced to everyone

35:46.040 --> 35:48.040
CSF is in

35:48.040 --> 35:50.040
When the nervous system is active

35:50.040 --> 35:52.040
It needs oxygen, oxygen and blood

35:52.040 --> 35:54.040
So here is

35:54.040 --> 35:56.040
Now the nervous system is active

35:56.040 --> 35:58.040
The blood vessels near the nervous system

35:58.040 --> 36:00.040
Start to increase blood flow

36:00.040 --> 36:02.040
Fresh blood

36:02.040 --> 36:04.040
To this place

36:04.040 --> 36:06.040
So here you will find

36:06.040 --> 36:08.040
A lot of fresh blood

36:08.040 --> 36:10.040
Because oxygen needs to enter the nervous system

36:10.040 --> 36:12.040
Fresh blood will come

36:12.040 --> 36:14.040
There are a lot of different

36:14.040 --> 36:16.040
There are a lot of new oxygen here

36:16.040 --> 36:18.040
Then in

36:18.040 --> 36:20.040
Exhaustive blood vessels

36:20.040 --> 36:22.040
When interchanging

36:22.040 --> 36:24.040
It will produce a signal

36:24.040 --> 36:26.040
We can produce a signal

36:26.040 --> 36:28.040
Because MRI is

36:28.040 --> 36:30.040
Strong magnetic field

36:30.040 --> 36:32.040
We used to learn that Faraday's law

36:32.040 --> 36:34.040
Magnetic field

36:34.040 --> 36:36.040
Because of the change in magnetic field

36:36.040 --> 36:38.040
It will produce an electric signal

36:38.040 --> 36:40.040
Will be just

36:40.040 --> 36:42.040
Receive the electric signal

36:42.040 --> 36:44.040
After that, it will go through a lot of

36:44.040 --> 36:46.040
Different image processing

36:46.040 --> 36:48.040
You will get it

36:48.040 --> 36:50.040
You will see this image

36:50.040 --> 36:52.040
In addition

36:52.040 --> 36:54.040
Exhaustive and

36:54.040 --> 36:56.040
Exhaustive blood vessels and

36:56.040 --> 36:58.040
The imbalance of the oxygen blood vessels

36:58.040 --> 37:00.040
Will cause the signal

37:00.040 --> 37:02.040
So

37:02.040 --> 37:04.040
The picture we just talked about

37:04.040 --> 37:06.040
The so-called Tom Cruise

37:06.040 --> 37:08.040
Is this thing

37:08.040 --> 37:10.040
After we get this thing

37:10.040 --> 37:12.040
We can start the follow-up analysis

37:12.040 --> 37:14.040
Of course the story is not that simple

37:14.040 --> 37:16.040
Because from you get the signal

37:16.040 --> 37:18.040
You can analyze

37:18.040 --> 37:20.040
There are a lot of things to do

37:20.040 --> 37:22.040
To correct the difference in time

37:22.040 --> 37:24.040
To correct the difference in space

37:24.040 --> 37:26.040
Sometimes it may shake your head

37:26.040 --> 37:28.040
You can't just take his data

37:28.040 --> 37:30.040
You have to correct these things first

37:30.040 --> 37:32.040
These things we call preprocessing

37:32.040 --> 37:34.040
I didn't talk too much today

37:34.040 --> 37:36.040
Just let you know

37:36.040 --> 37:38.040
The difference in time and space

37:38.040 --> 37:40.040
The focus part will be

37:40.040 --> 37:42.040
How do you analyze them

37:42.040 --> 37:44.040
Wait a minute

37:44.040 --> 37:46.040
Is there any

37:46.040 --> 37:48.040
Image acquisition

37:48.040 --> 37:50.040
Can i ask a question

37:50.040 --> 37:52.040
Is there any problem with the scene

37:52.040 --> 37:54.040
Is the scene

37:54.040 --> 37:56.040
Did you get this picture

37:56.040 --> 37:58.040
You got this picture

37:58.040 --> 38:00.040
Then you turn it like this

38:00.040 --> 38:02.040
Then you use

38:02.040 --> 38:04.040
Turn it into this picture

38:04.040 --> 38:06.040
After sending this picture in

38:06.040 --> 38:08.040
Then he will give you this

38:08.040 --> 38:10.040
His

38:10.040 --> 38:12.040
Regional interest

38:12.040 --> 38:14.040
You have to set a few points on the picture

38:14.040 --> 38:16.040
Then he will find it

38:16.040 --> 38:18.040
How do you know

38:18.040 --> 38:20.040
He asked you

38:20.040 --> 38:22.040
If we get this picture

38:22.040 --> 38:24.040
To this side

38:24.040 --> 38:26.040
Basically how to get there

38:28.040 --> 38:30.040
Because I omitted a lot of things

38:30.040 --> 38:32.040
So

38:32.040 --> 38:34.040
I'll talk about it now

38:34.040 --> 38:36.040
If we do it in our lab

38:36.040 --> 38:38.040
We will get this T1 and Bolt signal

38:38.040 --> 38:40.040
Then we will throw T1

38:40.040 --> 38:42.040
To a software called FreeSurfer

38:42.040 --> 38:44.040
The purpose is to do so-called

38:44.040 --> 38:46.040
That's why I got those

38:46.040 --> 38:48.040
RIERR333

38:48.040 --> 38:50.040
We take this T1

38:50.040 --> 38:52.040
We put each brain area

38:52.040 --> 38:54.040
Label up

38:54.040 --> 38:56.040
Give him an ID

38:56.040 --> 38:58.040
Then we put this at the same time

38:58.040 --> 39:00.040
The image obtained by FMI

39:00.040 --> 39:02.040
To do the pre-processing

39:02.040 --> 39:04.040
After the pre-processing

39:04.040 --> 39:06.040
We want to put this T1 with the label

39:06.040 --> 39:08.040
Two FMI in place

39:08.040 --> 39:10.040
Because they say

39:10.040 --> 39:12.040
The subject's head won't move too much

39:12.040 --> 39:14.040
But we still have to put these two images in place

39:14.040 --> 39:16.040
To make sure

39:16.040 --> 39:18.040
The one we see

39:18.040 --> 39:20.040
For example, the area seen on T1

39:20.040 --> 39:22.040
On FMI

39:22.040 --> 39:24.040
Is the same area

39:24.040 --> 39:26.040
So this is very important

39:26.040 --> 39:28.040
When we put T1 and FMI in place

39:28.040 --> 39:30.040
We told the computer

39:30.040 --> 39:32.040
Let's define a few RIERR333

39:32.040 --> 39:34.040
From T1

39:34.040 --> 39:36.040
If there are 100

39:36.040 --> 39:38.040
I told the computer

39:38.040 --> 39:40.040
I want 90

39:40.040 --> 39:42.040
All listed

39:42.040 --> 39:44.040
There is a step called

39:44.040 --> 39:46.040
Time course extraction

39:46.040 --> 39:48.040
After we put these two in place

39:48.040 --> 39:50.040
I said these 90 RIERR333

39:50.040 --> 39:52.040
You go get their time course

39:52.040 --> 39:54.040
For example, the first RIERR333

39:54.040 --> 39:56.040
Here

39:56.040 --> 39:58.040
I'll take his time course

39:58.040 --> 40:00.040
Take it out

40:00.040 --> 40:02.040
Then the second RIERR333

40:02.040 --> 40:04.040
I'll take his

40:04.040 --> 40:06.040
Just like this

40:06.040 --> 40:08.040
How big is that RIERR333

40:08.040 --> 40:10.040
How big can it be

40:10.040 --> 40:12.040
Actually this depends on you

40:12.040 --> 40:14.040
How to do cortical postulation

40:14.040 --> 40:16.040
Basically

40:16.040 --> 40:18.040
This

40:18.040 --> 40:20.040
The resolution is 1x1x1mm

40:22.040 --> 40:24.040
If there is

40:24.040 --> 40:26.040
Some areas will be bigger

40:26.040 --> 40:28.040
For example, if you have a prefrontal cortex

40:28.040 --> 40:30.040
It's a big piece

40:30.040 --> 40:32.040
If you want a very small one

40:32.040 --> 40:34.040
Anterior cingulate cortex will be smaller

40:34.040 --> 40:36.040
So that doesn't necessarily depend on your brain area

40:36.040 --> 40:38.040
What do you usually decide

40:38.040 --> 40:40.040
What do you usually decide

40:40.040 --> 40:42.040
Ha ha ha

40:42.040 --> 40:44.040
This is a very tricky question

40:44.040 --> 40:46.040
Ha ha ha

40:46.040 --> 40:48.040
If you look at this area

40:48.040 --> 40:50.040
There is no change at all

40:50.040 --> 40:52.040
It's in another area

40:52.040 --> 40:54.040
So now most people

40:54.040 --> 40:56.040
Tend to use

40:56.040 --> 40:58.040
It's a bit like watching you do postulation

40:58.040 --> 41:00.040
How many brain areas do you have

41:00.040 --> 41:02.040
Usually

41:02.040 --> 41:04.040
At least

41:04.040 --> 41:06.040
There should be more than 90

41:06.040 --> 41:08.040
I know there are more than 100 in FreeSurfer

41:08.040 --> 41:10.040
A lot of people take out more than 100 brain areas

41:10.040 --> 41:12.040
Because he doesn't know which one he wants to see

41:12.040 --> 41:14.040
Just take out all the brain areas

41:14.040 --> 41:16.040
Take out all the information

41:16.040 --> 41:18.040
Some people are very specific

41:18.040 --> 41:20.040
They assume

41:20.040 --> 41:22.040
Which brain area has a special relationship with which brain area

41:22.040 --> 41:24.040
They want to see

41:24.040 --> 41:26.040
They will have a purpose

41:26.040 --> 41:28.040
Select those brain areas first

41:28.040 --> 41:30.040
But indeed

41:30.040 --> 41:32.040
At the beginning, when I was writing articles

41:32.040 --> 41:34.040
You write articles

41:34.040 --> 41:36.040
The question that often comes back is why do you choose these brain areas

41:36.040 --> 41:38.040
Ha ha ha

41:38.040 --> 41:40.040
So now people

41:40.040 --> 41:42.040
Because I think it's a bit of a avoidance

41:42.040 --> 41:44.040
Plus you really don't know

41:44.040 --> 41:46.040
Where is the change

41:46.040 --> 41:48.040
All brain areas

41:48.040 --> 41:50.040
Ha ha ha

41:50.040 --> 41:52.040
Ha ha ha

41:52.040 --> 41:54.040
Ha ha ha

41:54.040 --> 41:56.040
Ha ha ha

41:56.040 --> 41:58.040
Ha ha ha

41:58.040 --> 42:00.040
Ha ha ha

42:00.040 --> 42:02.040
In fact

42:02.040 --> 42:04.040
It should be said that we already have

42:04.040 --> 42:06.040
Different software and different

42:06.040 --> 42:08.040
So-called templates

42:08.040 --> 42:10.040
You will get different brain areas

42:10.040 --> 42:12.040
In fact, this is indeed

42:12.040 --> 42:14.040
There is a big problem in doing imaging

42:14.040 --> 42:16.040
Generally speaking

42:16.040 --> 42:18.040
My answer will be

42:18.040 --> 42:20.040
You will

42:20.040 --> 42:22.040
We will have a defined brain area

42:22.040 --> 42:24.040
For example, you are doing free surfer

42:24.040 --> 42:26.040
You must know

42:26.040 --> 42:28.040
In FreeSurfer

42:28.040 --> 42:30.040
The brain areas in that list

42:30.040 --> 42:32.040
We want these

42:32.040 --> 42:34.040
There is another one called AAL

42:34.040 --> 42:36.040
Another template

42:36.040 --> 42:38.040
In another software

42:38.040 --> 42:40.040
If you say this is AAL template

42:40.040 --> 42:42.040
We probably know what brain areas

42:42.040 --> 42:44.040
In principle

42:44.040 --> 42:46.040
I don't think they are too different

42:46.040 --> 42:48.040
But there is a vote of people

42:48.040 --> 42:50.040
People who specialize in so-called postulation

42:50.040 --> 42:52.040
They will tell you which one

42:52.040 --> 42:54.040
Different templates will have different

42:54.040 --> 42:56.040
Disadvantages

42:56.040 --> 42:58.040
Last year

42:58.040 --> 43:00.040
I don't know if you have seen that report

43:00.040 --> 43:02.040
There was a paper last year

43:02.040 --> 43:04.040
Nature

43:04.040 --> 43:06.040
There is a Human Connectome Project in the United States

43:06.040 --> 43:08.040
They are a few thousand less

43:08.040 --> 43:10.040
Then they

43:10.040 --> 43:12.040
Use the information of those thousands of people

43:12.040 --> 43:14.040
And at the same time it also includes

43:14.040 --> 43:16.040
Different modalities

43:16.040 --> 43:18.040
For example, MIT1 image has functional images

43:18.040 --> 43:20.040
There is also T2

43:20.040 --> 43:22.040
Or Proton Density Modeling

43:22.040 --> 43:24.040
Many different images

43:24.040 --> 43:26.040
All modalities are put together

43:26.040 --> 43:28.040
Use all these modalities

43:28.040 --> 43:30.040
To build another template

43:30.040 --> 43:32.040
Then I remember

43:32.040 --> 43:34.040
More than 100 brain areas than we currently know

43:34.040 --> 43:36.040
More than 200

43:38.040 --> 43:40.040
So this becomes

43:40.040 --> 43:42.040
How do you define your brain area

43:42.040 --> 43:44.040
It's a bit tricky

43:44.040 --> 43:46.040
At present we can only say

43:46.040 --> 43:48.040
Which template you use

43:48.040 --> 43:50.040
Or which software you use

43:50.040 --> 43:52.040
We probably know what your so-called brain areas are

43:52.040 --> 43:54.040
Any other questions?

43:54.040 --> 43:56.040
For example

43:56.040 --> 43:58.040
For example, that area

43:58.040 --> 44:00.040
If you have big or small

44:00.040 --> 44:02.040
You can set big or small

44:02.040 --> 44:04.040
For example, when you are small

44:04.040 --> 44:06.040
Its signal is very strong

44:06.040 --> 44:08.040
But when you have a large area

44:08.040 --> 44:10.040
You have to remove the signal

44:10.040 --> 44:12.040
Actually there is

44:12.040 --> 44:14.040
I always don't believe

44:14.040 --> 44:16.040
For example, there are some things in the brain area

44:16.040 --> 44:18.040
Its signal is very, very bad

44:18.040 --> 44:20.040
Because it happens to be interconnected with the air

44:20.040 --> 44:22.040
You can see here

44:22.040 --> 44:24.040
There is still a brain area here

44:24.040 --> 44:26.040
This is the prefrontal cortex

44:26.040 --> 44:28.040
But it is already close to the sinus

44:28.040 --> 44:30.040
So it's very close to this place

44:30.040 --> 44:32.040
It looks okay in T1

44:32.040 --> 44:34.040
But in FMR, you can see it's super bad

44:34.040 --> 44:36.040
Half of the frontal area is gone

44:36.040 --> 44:38.040
For example, in the frontal area

44:38.040 --> 44:40.040
Some very small areas

44:40.040 --> 44:42.040
Such as the frontal pole

44:42.040 --> 44:44.040
That area is very small and close to the air

44:44.040 --> 44:46.040
So its FMR signal is super bad

44:46.040 --> 44:48.040
I usually

44:48.040 --> 44:50.040
My approach is

44:50.040 --> 44:52.040
I don't want to look at that area

44:52.040 --> 44:54.040
If your signal is already very bad

44:54.040 --> 44:56.040
You see it again

44:56.040 --> 44:58.040
What do you say

44:58.040 --> 45:00.040
This is because

45:00.040 --> 45:02.040
It's caused by the difference in FMR

45:02.040 --> 45:04.040
Or is it because your own signal is bad

45:04.040 --> 45:06.040
So my approach is

45:06.040 --> 45:08.040
Put those too small areas

45:08.040 --> 45:10.040
Or in that kind of signal

45:10.040 --> 45:12.040
I don't want those areas

45:12.040 --> 45:14.040
Is there any

45:14.040 --> 45:16.040
Is there any area

45:16.040 --> 45:18.040
Where the signal is bad

45:18.040 --> 45:20.040
Frontal

45:20.040 --> 45:22.040
The area closest to the frontal

45:22.040 --> 45:24.040
Because it's too close to the air

45:24.040 --> 45:26.040
There will be a so-called partial volume effect

45:26.040 --> 45:28.040
If you look at this picture

45:28.040 --> 45:30.040
The signal is bad in the front area

45:30.040 --> 45:32.040
And then there is the orbital frontal cortex

45:32.040 --> 45:34.040
This is close to the nasal cavity

45:34.040 --> 45:36.040
There is a lot of air there, so the signal is bad

45:36.040 --> 45:38.040
And then the other place is the temporal pole

45:38.040 --> 45:40.040
Just a little bit in front of the temporal

45:40.040 --> 45:42.040
And then there is the inferior temporal cortex

45:42.040 --> 45:44.040
At the very bottom of the temporal

45:44.040 --> 45:46.040
Because it's already close to the skull base

45:46.040 --> 45:48.040
So those places

45:48.040 --> 45:50.040
I usually see

45:50.040 --> 45:52.040
If you actually see it

45:52.040 --> 45:54.040
The whole information sharing

45:54.040 --> 45:56.040
If you find that there is an important change

45:56.040 --> 45:58.040
If it's there, I'll be a little hesitant

45:58.040 --> 46:00.040
Then go back and see if my image blurring is good

46:00.040 --> 46:02.040
Decide again

46:02.040 --> 46:04.040
Do I believe him

46:04.040 --> 46:06.040
Is there anything else

46:06.040 --> 46:08.040
Ok let's go next

46:08.040 --> 46:10.040
Ok this is a bit

46:10.040 --> 46:12.040
Be a little patient

46:12.040 --> 46:14.040
Because this is a bit

46:14.040 --> 46:16.040
It's the background I just talked about

46:16.040 --> 46:18.040
Background for this experiment

46:18.040 --> 46:20.040
Now I'm going to talk about

46:20.040 --> 46:22.040
The method used for this experiment

46:22.040 --> 46:24.040
Then you will see

46:24.040 --> 46:26.040
The first thing I want to talk about is

46:26.040 --> 46:28.040
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

46:28.040 --> 46:30.040
I use sliding window

46:30.040 --> 46:32.040
This blue is the so-called fMRI time core

46:32.040 --> 46:34.040
That's what we've been talking about

46:34.040 --> 46:36.040
The most important thing when doing sliding window

46:36.040 --> 46:38.040
The first step is that you have to define

46:38.040 --> 46:40.040
Your so-called window length

46:40.040 --> 46:42.040
How big is your window

46:42.040 --> 46:44.040
I use 20 time points here

46:44.040 --> 46:46.040
That is to say

46:46.040 --> 46:48.040
I only include

46:48.040 --> 46:50.040
The first 20 time points

46:50.040 --> 46:52.040
Then I do

46:52.040 --> 46:54.040
Correlation, I use Pearson's correlation here

46:54.040 --> 46:56.040
Then I will get a metric

46:56.040 --> 46:58.040
This metric means

46:58.040 --> 47:00.040
I have 54

47:00.040 --> 47:02.040
hri

47:02.040 --> 47:04.040
Is the relationship between these 54 hri

47:04.040 --> 47:06.040
After finishing here

47:06.040 --> 47:08.040
I will move my window forward

47:08.040 --> 47:10.040
Do the same thing

47:10.040 --> 47:12.040
You will get the second metric

47:12.040 --> 47:14.040
How long does a time point usually last

47:14.040 --> 47:16.040
It depends on your MRI

47:16.040 --> 47:18.040
Scanning parameters

47:18.040 --> 47:20.040
We have two seconds here

47:20.040 --> 47:22.040
Then you keep doing the same thing

47:22.040 --> 47:24.040
Until you finish

47:24.040 --> 47:26.040
All the fMRI time cores

47:26.040 --> 47:28.040
After that, I have a total of

47:28.040 --> 47:30.040
221 window correlation metrics

47:30.040 --> 47:32.040
Then the next

47:32.040 --> 47:34.040
One important thing is

47:34.040 --> 47:36.040
I got so many metrics

47:36.040 --> 47:38.040
Each one is not the same

47:38.040 --> 47:40.040
How do I report

47:40.040 --> 47:42.040
What is their variability

47:42.040 --> 47:44.040
Here we calculate 7

47:44.040 --> 47:46.040
I call it network feature

47:46.040 --> 47:48.040
According to these

47:48.040 --> 47:50.040
According to these metrics

47:50.040 --> 47:52.040
I calculate some numbers

47:52.040 --> 47:54.040
Each number represents

47:54.040 --> 47:56.040
Variability

47:56.040 --> 47:58.040
For example, the first one I call it

47:58.040 --> 48:00.040
Network variation

48:00.040 --> 48:02.040
The first one is very simple

48:02.040 --> 48:04.040
We want to see the overall variability

48:04.040 --> 48:06.040
The first one and the second

48:06.040 --> 48:08.040
Correlation metrics

48:08.040 --> 48:10.040
Take all the numbers and subtract them

48:10.040 --> 48:12.040
Then for each

48:12.040 --> 48:14.040
221 metrics

48:14.040 --> 48:16.040
Do the same thing on average

48:16.040 --> 48:18.040
So the numbers we get

48:18.040 --> 48:20.040
It's a bit like

48:20.040 --> 48:22.040
On average

48:22.040 --> 48:24.040
The variability of your entire brain

48:24.040 --> 48:26.040
Then the second

48:26.040 --> 48:28.040
Network power

48:28.040 --> 48:30.040
This is actually very simple

48:30.040 --> 48:32.040
It mainly adds all the

48:32.040 --> 48:34.040
On average

48:34.040 --> 48:36.040
The purpose of this is to get

48:36.040 --> 48:38.040
It's a bit like on average

48:38.040 --> 48:40.040
The strength of your connectivity

48:40.040 --> 48:42.040
Then here

48:42.040 --> 48:44.040
These are very similar from C to G and A

48:44.040 --> 48:46.040
But the difference is

48:46.040 --> 48:48.040
A is measuring the whole brain

48:48.040 --> 48:50.040
All numbers

48:50.040 --> 48:52.040
All elements in this metric

48:52.040 --> 48:54.040
But C to D

48:54.040 --> 48:56.040
C to G is

48:56.040 --> 48:58.040
For specific

48:58.040 --> 49:00.040
For example, this is called

49:00.040 --> 49:02.040
We only calculate

49:02.040 --> 49:04.040
The connection between the opposite brain areas

49:04.040 --> 49:06.040
Then

49:06.040 --> 49:08.040
This is

49:08.040 --> 49:10.040
Then this is

49:10.040 --> 49:12.040
Same on the same side

49:12.040 --> 49:14.040
Then divide it here

49:14.040 --> 49:16.040
On the left and on the right

49:16.040 --> 49:18.040
So you can see that the math

49:18.040 --> 49:20.040
Actually quite similar

49:20.040 --> 49:22.040
But when we count C to G

49:22.040 --> 49:24.040
The value we get is

49:24.040 --> 49:26.040
For example, when we count C

49:26.040 --> 49:28.040
We take the right angle

49:28.040 --> 49:30.040
Because the right angle represents

49:30.040 --> 49:32.040
Connectivity from left to right

49:32.040 --> 49:34.040
Then

49:34.040 --> 49:36.040
Here is the sliding window

49:36.040 --> 49:38.040
That's it

49:38.040 --> 49:40.040
The other graph theory

49:40.040 --> 49:42.040
I made it more fancy here

49:42.040 --> 49:44.040
I have a little bit

49:44.040 --> 49:46.040
The graph theory and the sliding window

49:46.040 --> 49:48.040
Combined together

49:48.040 --> 49:50.040
So in the front you will find that it is exactly the same as the sliding window

49:50.040 --> 49:52.040
Until this step

49:52.040 --> 49:54.040
All the same

49:54.040 --> 49:56.040
The difference is that when I got this metric

49:56.040 --> 49:58.040
I didn't just add or subtract it

49:58.040 --> 50:00.040
Do some processing to calculate

50:00.040 --> 50:02.040
The so-called network feature

50:02.040 --> 50:04.040
Instead, I first apply a threshold

50:04.040 --> 50:06.040
Above a certain threshold

50:06.040 --> 50:08.040
I determine that these connections are real connections

50:08.040 --> 50:10.040
Under this threshold

50:10.040 --> 50:12.040
It's not, it's an imprecision

50:12.040 --> 50:14.040
Then I put this

50:14.040 --> 50:16.040
Thresholded edges

50:16.040 --> 50:18.040
There is something called

50:18.040 --> 50:20.040
Brain Connectivity Toolbox

50:20.040 --> 50:22.040
This is a free download on the Internet

50:22.040 --> 50:24.040
You can run it with MATLAB

50:24.040 --> 50:26.040
After I throw it into the graph theory

50:26.040 --> 50:28.040
Every window I will get two

50:28.040 --> 50:30.040
Global Feature Measure

50:30.040 --> 50:32.040
And a Local Measure

50:32.040 --> 50:34.040
In fact, you can get more

50:34.040 --> 50:36.040
I just use these three for the time being

50:36.040 --> 50:38.040
The so-called Global Measure is

50:38.040 --> 50:40.040
There will be a number for each indicator

50:40.040 --> 50:42.040
Local Measure is

50:42.040 --> 50:44.040
See how many RRI it has

50:44.040 --> 50:46.040
How many numbers

50:46.040 --> 50:48.040
After all done

50:48.040 --> 50:50.040
I will have 221 stats

50:50.040 --> 50:52.040
Then there are three numbers for each window

50:52.040 --> 50:54.040
This is a bit complicated

50:54.040 --> 50:56.040
But in a nutshell

50:56.040 --> 50:58.040
I got a lot of different numbers

50:58.040 --> 51:00.040
Or the so-called network features

51:00.040 --> 51:02.040
Then the point is to see

51:02.040 --> 51:04.040
Between patient and normal control

51:04.040 --> 51:06.040
What's the difference

51:06.040 --> 51:08.040
Then the next one

51:08.040 --> 51:10.040
it is good

51:10.040 --> 51:12.040
In fact, this is a bit

51:16.040 --> 51:18.040
Is there a problem

51:18.040 --> 51:20.040
It's okay, I want to ask this one

51:20.040 --> 51:22.040
You can continue to talk

51:22.040 --> 51:24.040
Don't ignore me

51:24.040 --> 51:26.040
After the analysis of the RRI

51:26.040 --> 51:28.040
We got the so-called

51:28.040 --> 51:30.040
These are the numbers

51:30.040 --> 51:32.040
When using the sliding window

51:32.040 --> 51:34.040
We will get the power

51:34.040 --> 51:36.040
The other

51:36.040 --> 51:38.040
Specific connection

51:38.040 --> 51:40.040
This is inter-hemisphere

51:40.040 --> 51:42.040
Then here is cross-hemisphere

51:42.040 --> 51:44.040
And in the same brain

51:44.040 --> 51:46.040
The same brain

51:46.040 --> 51:48.040
Then there is left and right

51:48.040 --> 51:50.040
The so-called flexibility

51:50.040 --> 51:52.040
In fact, we take the correlation value

51:52.040 --> 51:54.040
The correlation value of two windows

51:54.040 --> 51:56.040
Two minus and then equal

51:56.040 --> 51:58.040
So

51:58.040 --> 52:00.040
In the sliding window value

52:00.040 --> 52:02.040
If the value is higher

52:02.040 --> 52:04.040
It means its connectivity is more dynamic

52:04.040 --> 52:06.040
The more mutable

52:06.040 --> 52:08.040
Then dynamic graphical approach

52:08.040 --> 52:10.040
Is what we just talked about

52:10.040 --> 52:12.040
Combined graph theory and sliding window

52:12.040 --> 52:14.040
It's the same global feature

52:14.040 --> 52:16.040
I have two

52:16.040 --> 52:18.040
One is global efficiency

52:18.040 --> 52:20.040
The other is modularity

52:20.040 --> 52:22.040
It may be difficult to explain here

52:22.040 --> 52:24.040
I can't explain

52:24.040 --> 52:26.040
If you don't know

52:26.040 --> 52:28.040
You may need to check

52:28.040 --> 52:30.040
I will show you a paper later

52:30.040 --> 52:32.040
There may be a complete

52:32.040 --> 52:34.040
It's easier to understand

52:34.040 --> 52:36.040
In short, global efficiency

52:36.040 --> 52:38.040
The way it is calculated

52:38.040 --> 52:40.040
The shortest distance between these two points

52:42.040 --> 52:44.040
Make them equal

52:44.040 --> 52:46.040
Do the math

52:46.040 --> 52:48.040
Then equal

52:48.040 --> 52:50.040
This global efficiency represents

52:50.040 --> 52:52.040
Information

52:52.040 --> 52:54.040
The information of the neural network

52:54.040 --> 52:56.040
In the whole brain

52:56.040 --> 52:58.040
How well it is integrated

52:58.040 --> 53:00.040
So it is also

53:00.040 --> 53:02.040
An indicator of integration

53:02.040 --> 53:04.040
Modularity is just the opposite

53:04.040 --> 53:06.040
It is an indicator of segregation

53:06.040 --> 53:08.040
Modularity is actually

53:08.040 --> 53:10.040
Under this network

53:10.040 --> 53:12.040
Will this network be

53:12.040 --> 53:14.040
Will it be divided into

53:14.040 --> 53:16.040
Several different

53:16.040 --> 53:18.040
Small networks

53:18.040 --> 53:20.040
Then it is

53:20.040 --> 53:22.040
An indicator of segregation

53:22.040 --> 53:24.040
This means

53:24.040 --> 53:26.040
If the modularity value is higher

53:26.040 --> 53:28.040
It means

53:28.040 --> 53:30.040
In a single system

53:30.040 --> 53:32.040
Will be better integrated

53:32.040 --> 53:34.040
These two points are the opposite

53:34.040 --> 53:36.040
Integration and segregation

53:36.040 --> 53:38.040
Then another local measure

53:38.040 --> 53:40.040
Betweenness centrality

53:40.040 --> 53:42.040
This is the brain area

53:42.040 --> 53:44.040
This RRI

53:44.040 --> 53:46.040
How important it is in the whole network

53:46.040 --> 53:48.040
That is to see

53:48.040 --> 53:50.040
How many

53:50.040 --> 53:52.040
The shortest path

53:52.040 --> 53:54.040
Through this

53:54.040 --> 53:56.040
This RRI

53:56.040 --> 53:58.040
If this number is higher

53:58.040 --> 54:00.040
It means that this brain area is more important

54:00.040 --> 54:02.040
It may be the hubs we just talked about

54:02.040 --> 54:04.040
After having these numbers

54:04.040 --> 54:06.040
The first thing we do is

54:06.040 --> 54:08.040
See the difference between the patient and the PD

54:08.040 --> 54:10.040
See if there is any difference

54:10.040 --> 54:12.040
In addition, these numbers

54:12.040 --> 54:14.040
Do a linear regression with clinical indicators

54:14.040 --> 54:16.040
See what happens

54:16.040 --> 54:18.040
Then the next one

54:20.040 --> 54:22.040
it is good

54:22.040 --> 54:24.040
I have to go to the bathroom

54:24.040 --> 54:26.040
This is the result

54:26.040 --> 54:28.040
I can tell you

54:28.040 --> 54:30.040
If you just do a two-sample t-test

54:30.040 --> 54:32.040
I can't see any difference

54:32.040 --> 54:34.040
Between the patient and the normal person

54:34.040 --> 54:36.040
Those numbers are completely the same

54:36.040 --> 54:38.040
But when we do simple

54:38.040 --> 54:40.040
Peterson's correlation

54:40.040 --> 54:42.040
You can find

54:42.040 --> 54:44.040
This is the result of sliding window

54:44.040 --> 54:46.040
Dynamic connectivity

54:46.040 --> 54:48.040
You can find

54:48.040 --> 54:50.040
Let's look at the above two

54:50.040 --> 54:52.040
Age and network power

54:52.040 --> 54:54.040
And I put a small picture

54:54.040 --> 54:56.040
You can know which connection it is

54:56.040 --> 54:58.040
Inter-dimensional connectivity is related

54:58.040 --> 55:00.040
But I can tell you

55:00.040 --> 55:02.040
I think this is more like

55:02.040 --> 55:04.040
Normal human aging will occur

55:04.040 --> 55:06.040
Because I see this on Parkinson's patients

55:06.040 --> 55:08.040
But I also see it on normal people

55:08.040 --> 55:10.040
So this one

55:10.040 --> 55:12.040
We won't do so much discussion for the time being

55:12.040 --> 55:14.040
But the more interesting thing is this

55:14.040 --> 55:16.040
This is the postural instability

55:16.040 --> 55:18.040
Gait disorder

55:18.040 --> 55:20.040
That is, the number of their balance and body coordination

55:20.040 --> 55:22.040
With

55:22.040 --> 55:24.040
On the right

55:24.040 --> 55:26.040
This is the right

55:26.040 --> 55:28.040
Dynamic functional connectivity

55:28.040 --> 55:30.040
Related to them

55:30.040 --> 55:32.040
That is to say, the more serious the patient

55:32.040 --> 55:34.040
His right connectivity

55:34.040 --> 55:36.040
The harder it is

55:36.040 --> 55:38.040
Can't change

55:38.040 --> 55:40.040
Then this is the dose of the drug

55:40.040 --> 55:42.040
It's the same

55:42.040 --> 55:44.040
When the drug dose is higher

55:44.040 --> 55:46.040
They are also with

55:46.040 --> 55:48.040
This one

55:48.040 --> 55:50.040
This connectivity is also more rigid

55:50.040 --> 55:52.040
You can find

55:52.040 --> 55:54.040
If it's based on these two relationships

55:54.040 --> 55:56.040
We can roughly think

55:56.040 --> 55:58.040
Parkinson's disease

55:58.040 --> 56:00.040
Their

56:00.040 --> 56:02.040
Connectivity is not so dynamic

56:02.040 --> 56:04.040
More rigid

56:04.040 --> 56:06.040
In addition, because this is just

56:06.040 --> 56:08.040
Simple correlation

56:08.040 --> 56:10.040
We want to do postural correlation

56:10.040 --> 56:12.040
Is to remove some

56:12.040 --> 56:14.040
Effect

56:14.040 --> 56:16.040
For example, age

56:16.040 --> 56:18.040
If our condition for age is

56:18.040 --> 56:20.040
We remove the age

56:20.040 --> 56:22.040
If we do correlation again

56:22.040 --> 56:24.040
In fact, you will find that only this value

56:24.040 --> 56:26.040
Related

56:26.040 --> 56:28.040
The same thing is significant

56:28.040 --> 56:30.040
Only this value

56:30.040 --> 56:32.040
With these dynamic features

56:32.040 --> 56:34.040
Related

56:36.040 --> 56:38.040
Then next

56:40.040 --> 56:42.040
This is what I just said

56:42.040 --> 56:44.040
Dynamic

56:44.040 --> 56:46.040
Graphical features

56:46.040 --> 56:48.040
Graph theory and dynamics

56:48.040 --> 56:50.040
Generally

56:50.040 --> 56:52.040
Red is PD

56:52.040 --> 56:54.040
Blue is normal control

56:54.040 --> 56:56.040
You can find that PD patients

56:56.040 --> 56:58.040
Generally

56:58.040 --> 57:00.040
Higher global efficiency

57:00.040 --> 57:02.040
This number also represents

57:02.040 --> 57:04.040
Signal

57:04.040 --> 57:06.040
How well the whole brain is integrated

57:06.040 --> 57:08.040
You will find that overall

57:08.040 --> 57:10.040
In fact, they are better than the patient

57:10.040 --> 57:12.040
This is a bit

57:12.040 --> 57:14.040
Make people feel

57:14.040 --> 57:16.040
Why is the patient better

57:16.040 --> 57:18.040
In fact, we think

57:18.040 --> 57:20.040
This is the so-called compensator effect

57:20.040 --> 57:22.040
Because

57:22.040 --> 57:24.040
We just said

57:24.040 --> 57:26.040
Because the patient's brain

57:26.040 --> 57:28.040
Their connectivity is more rigid

57:28.040 --> 57:30.040
Because it is more rigid

57:30.040 --> 57:32.040
So they become the existing

57:32.040 --> 57:34.040
Connectivity needs to be better integrated

57:34.040 --> 57:36.040
To maintain normal brain function

57:36.040 --> 57:38.040
Then next

57:38.040 --> 57:40.040
This is the so-called local measure

57:40.040 --> 57:42.040
That is, each subject

57:42.040 --> 57:44.040
There are several numbers

57:44.040 --> 57:46.040
Depends on how many RRI

57:46.040 --> 57:48.040
Each RRI will give you a number

57:48.040 --> 57:50.040
Because I am here

57:50.040 --> 57:52.040
Do dynamic graph theory

57:52.040 --> 57:54.040
So you can see that there are several different windows

57:56.040 --> 57:58.040
Generally you can see

57:58.040 --> 58:00.040
These brain areas

58:00.040 --> 58:02.040
PD and normal control

58:02.040 --> 58:04.040
There are significant differences

58:04.040 --> 58:06.040
Brain area

58:06.040 --> 58:08.040
A bit small

58:08.040 --> 58:10.040
Blue is normal

58:10.040 --> 58:12.040
Red is PD

58:12.040 --> 58:14.040
Normal people

58:14.040 --> 58:16.040
Most of them will show higher

58:16.040 --> 58:18.040
Centrality

58:18.040 --> 58:20.040
It means

58:20.040 --> 58:22.040
These brain areas

58:22.040 --> 58:24.040
Parkinson's patients

58:24.040 --> 58:26.040
Become less important

58:26.040 --> 58:28.040
Because between the centrality

58:28.040 --> 58:30.040
This brain area

58:30.040 --> 58:32.040
How important

58:32.040 --> 58:34.040
You can find that all of these

58:34.040 --> 58:36.040
Relatively low

58:36.040 --> 58:38.040
Then there are significant differences

58:38.040 --> 58:40.040
It is worth mentioning

58:40.040 --> 58:42.040
The red one

58:42.040 --> 58:44.040
They are called cortical hubs

58:44.040 --> 58:46.040
Blue

58:46.040 --> 58:48.040
The so-called cortical hubs

58:48.040 --> 58:50.040
So that's why

58:50.040 --> 58:52.040
I may have to jump out

58:52.040 --> 58:54.040
Tell you what hubs are

58:56.040 --> 58:58.040
The so-called hubs are actually

58:58.040 --> 59:00.040
It's important

59:00.040 --> 59:02.040
We are talking about

59:02.040 --> 59:04.040
If you are from Vancouver today

59:04.040 --> 59:06.040
Where we are now

59:06.040 --> 59:08.040
If you want to travel to Hamburg, Germany

59:08.040 --> 59:10.040
You have two options

59:10.040 --> 59:12.040
For example, this is Hansa Airlines

59:12.040 --> 59:14.040
You can take a plane to the most

59:14.040 --> 59:16.040
The simplest

59:16.040 --> 59:18.040
This is Zurich

59:18.040 --> 59:20.040
Frankfurt or Munich

59:20.040 --> 59:22.040
You transfer from there

59:22.040 --> 59:24.040
Just turn once and you can go to Hamburg

59:24.040 --> 59:26.040
Then the one below is

59:26.040 --> 59:28.040
Airbus

59:28.040 --> 59:30.040
If you take off from Vancouver

59:30.040 --> 59:32.040
It's a bit small

59:32.040 --> 59:34.040
But it's also Zurich

59:34.040 --> 59:36.040
Frankfurt and Munich

59:36.040 --> 59:38.040
You can go to Hamburg

59:38.040 --> 59:40.040
In this case

59:40.040 --> 59:42.040
Zurich, Munich and Frankfurt

59:42.040 --> 59:44.040
The so-called hubs

59:44.040 --> 59:46.040
On the plane

59:46.040 --> 59:48.040
It's the so-called hubs

59:48.040 --> 59:50.040
Because they have more

59:50.040 --> 59:52.040
They have more different

59:52.040 --> 59:54.040
Airways

59:54.040 --> 59:56.040
Can go to different cities

59:56.040 --> 59:58.040
Similarly

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.040
There are so-called hubs in the human brain

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.040
Here on the right

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.040
You can see

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.040
All of these points are cortical hubs

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.040
According to

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040
Previous research

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.040
Then the yellow one

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.040
Functional hubs

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.040
In fMRI or other functional images

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.040
Hubs obtained

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.040
The red one

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.040
Functional and structural

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.040
In functional studies

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.040
You will see

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.040
Structural studies

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.040
Structural images can also be seen

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.040
The bigger one

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.040
Rich club

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.040
These big hubs

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.040
Between each other

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.040
Stronger

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.040
Stronger

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.040
More links

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.040
The point is to tell everyone

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.040
These hubs

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.040
Play an important role in the entire brain network

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.040
Because they have to

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.040
Like a logistics center

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.040
It has to distribute these messages

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.040
Then direct them to

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.040
The destination they need to reach

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.040
Then we slightly

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.040
Functional hubs and structural hubs

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.040
What's the difference

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.040
Someone here asked

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.040
If I use fMRI today

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.040
Graph theory

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.040
I can find hubs

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.040
Functional hubs

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.040
If I use

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.040
Structural images

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.040
Diffusion-weighted imaging

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.040
Or

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.040
DWI or DSI

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040
Structural images

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.040
Hubs obtained

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.040
Structural hubs

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.040
The main difference is

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.040
One uses fMRI

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.040
Why

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.040
They are different

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.040
I asked someone

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.040
The researcher told me

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.040
His own suspicion is

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.040
fMRI

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.040
Very indirect measurement

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.040
The signal may contain

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.040
A lot of impurities

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.040
Blood vessels, breathing, heartbeats

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.040
He personally doubts

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.040
The signal in fMRI is too impure

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.040
So it will cause

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.040
Your hubs to be different

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.040
Hubs

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.040
Left and right symmetry

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.040
Another question

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040
Hubs are left and right symmetry

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.040
Most of us think

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.040
Hubs are left and right symmetry

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.040
For example

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.040
This is

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.040
Superior frontal cortex

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.040
They are symmetry

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.040
If you find the left

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.040
The area on the right will also be hubs

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.040
But there may be a little

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.040
Slightly different

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.040
The left may be less obvious

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.040
But we think hubs are symmetry

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.040
So which hub

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.040
Will connect

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.040
The other question is

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.040
Which hub will connect

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.040
So far

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.040
We think this big

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.040
Rich club

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.040
There is a thing called rich club

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.040
Organization

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.040
These hubs

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.040
Can be called super hubs

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.040
Very powerful

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.040
So many different

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.040
So in these big hubs

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.040
They form another

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.040
Powerful network

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.040
So this is what we call

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.040
There will be interconnection

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.040
Can

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.040
Another last thing

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.040
I want to tell you

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.040
We can go back a little

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.040
We just mentioned here

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.040
The red ones are all hubs

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.040
Insula, Precuneus

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.040
Thalamus and Hippocampus

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.040
The next one you can find

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.040
Thalamus, Hippocampus

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.040
Insula

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040
Just now

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.040
We saw on PDs patient

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.040
Those hubs are less important

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.040
So our result

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.040
Here is the whole conclusion

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.040
The first one we said

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.040
Can we use rich club function

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.040
As a bio-marker

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040
I wrote potentially

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.040
There are a lot of things we haven't measured

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.040
For the current result

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.040
This is possible

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.040
Just now

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.040
We did a linear regression

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.040
You will find

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.040
PDs patient

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.040
Their function

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.040
Reduce dynamics

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.040
Especially with this number

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.040
PIGD is related

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.040
In addition

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.040
Because PDs patient

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.040
Most of the time they show

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.040
Global efficiency

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.040
Their connectivity

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.040
Is better integrated

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.040
As I said

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.040
This is the so-called

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.040
Compensatory effect

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.040
This is the result of local measure

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.040
You can see

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.040
On PDs

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.040
A lot of hubs

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.040
Lose their importance

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.040
This is actually

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.040
Similar to other people's research

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.040
Because they mentioned before

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.040
These hubs are actually more sensitive

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.040
They are more likely to be affected by diseases

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.040
So our research

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.040
It's a bit like

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.040
Even on PDs

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.040
These cortical hubs

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.040
Easier to be affected by diseases

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.040
Because they lost their importance

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.040
The only one that is not a hub

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.040
Pre-SMA

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.040
Somato

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.040
Pre-SMA is another

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.040
A little bit in front of the motor cortex

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.040
Brain area

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.040
I found a paper

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040
A long time ago

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.040
This paper describes

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.040
Pre-SMA and SMA

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.040
The function of this area

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.040
Is to control

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.040
So-called body coordination

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.040
It's interesting that we found

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.040
Dynamics and body coordination

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.040
The PIGD indicator is related

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.040
So our final result

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.040
We proposed

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.040
It is possible

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.040
This pre-SMA

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.040
You can only see it on PD

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.040
Even if it is not a cortical hub

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.040
Its importance is also reduced

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.040
Maybe because it controls this function

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.040
On PD

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.040
Is affected

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.040
That's it

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.040
Thank you

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.040
Can I ask a question?

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.040
Yes

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.040
Thank you for your sharing

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.040
It's wonderful

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.040
I have a comment

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.040
On the conclusion

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.040
I have a comment

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.040
Ok

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.040
First of all

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.040
I am a EEG

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.040
I am not an FHI

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.040
But these

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.040
These analyses are quite common

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.040
I think it's quite interesting

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.040
But I think

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.040
Your first point

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.040
Your research

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.040
The fact is

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.040
You want to use this as a biomarker

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.040
In fact, I think

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.040
A little

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.040
A little bit of killing with a knife

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.040
What do you mean?

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.040
That is to say

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.040
In fact, the diagnosis method

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.040
All very clear

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.040
But if you continue to draw a

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.040
If you only pay attention to

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.040
If you only pay attention to the effect level

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.040
You have to spend so much energy

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.040
FMI

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.040
Then do these very complex analyses

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.040
Then

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.040
In fact, I think

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.040
A little bit of killing with a knife

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.040
That is

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.040
A simple thing

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.040
I think

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040
This kind of function

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.040
Especially for me

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.040
Is Parkinson's subpopulation

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.040
I think it should be easier

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.040
Easier to do

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.040
Psychology

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.040
Life Function

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.040
Then

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.040
Why is it important?

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.040
Because it seems to be my own

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.040
Related

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.040
Music

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.040
Wait a minute

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.040
I can't hear it now

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.040
There is a child

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.040
Talking

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.040
The child is not on my side

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.040
The child is not on my side

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.040
The child is not on my side

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.040
Ok

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.040
Let me continue

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.040
I think

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.040
Take this set of tools to do subpopulation

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.040
May be more interesting

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.040
Because like

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.040
Some people

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.040
For example, there is a rhythm

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.040
To help Parkinson's disease

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.040
To help them control

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.040
Action control

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.040
Although it works very well for some people

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.040
But on another group of people

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.040
Some Parkinson's disease people

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.040
The effect is very poor

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.040
Then this aspect

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.040
I don't know why

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.040
Then I think

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.040
There may also be such a problem

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.040
Then I think

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.040
You can find more

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.040
General neuropsychological

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.040
Can't do

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.040
Then I think

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.040
Rather than saying this is a biomarker

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.040
I think

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.040
This purpose will be stronger

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.040
For me

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.040
Ok

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.040
Let me talk a little bit

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.040
Because I'm a little lazy

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.040
So I only put

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.040
May be a biomarker

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.040
In fact, we do this thing

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.040
There are other purposes

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.040
The first one is that I said at the beginning

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.040
The so-called disease prediction

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.040
The original

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.040
The ideal state is

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.040
Then build a very powerful

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.040
Then we can

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.040
Because of this statistical power

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.040
Can

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.040
Produce a

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.040
It's a bit like a disease model

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.040
Then if we have new patients

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.040
When we come in

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.040
We can put his data into this disease model

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.040
To try

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.040
Can we predict

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.040
What is the situation after five or ten years

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.040
Because we can't really wait for him

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.040
After five or ten years

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.040
Use some drugs to control

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.040
If we find

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.040
I knew it was possible

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.040
Will become more serious

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.040
Can we take some

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.040
Preventive measures

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.040
Then another

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.040
The purpose is

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.040
So far

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.040
Although the drug results can be controlled

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.040
Such as tremor

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.040
These can be controlled quite well

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.040
But there are a lot of patients

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.040
In fact, there is no way to use drugs

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.040
So recently there are some people

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.040
Spent a lot of effort

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.040
In the study of so-called cognitive training

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.040
They hope to use non-invasive

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.040
No need to use drugs

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.040
Just use training

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.040
Can treat Parkinson's

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.040
Obstacle to cognitive function

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.040
But before doing this

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.040
You have to know their cognitive function first

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.040
Their whole

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.040
What is the Cognitive Profile

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.040
And even which domain is most likely to be affected

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.040
Or which brain area

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.040
The brain area responsible for those cognitive functions

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.040
Is the weakest

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.040
Will be attacked

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.040
So this is why

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.040
When we do local measures

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.040
These brain areas are actually in Parkinson's disease

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.040
It's more dangerous and less likely to be attacked

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.040
That is, if we want to develop

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.040
Non-invasive

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.040
Treatment

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.040
We can say

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.040
For example, pre-SMA

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.040
We target this area

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.040
Design some cognitive functions

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.040
To strengthen the neural network of this area

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.040
It is possible to use this way

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.040
We can improve

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.040
Its cognitive function

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.040
A bit like this

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.040
This is more interesting

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.040
In addition

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.040
I know

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.040
My own research is

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.040
When listening to a more recent pattern

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.040
Pre-SMA disease is active

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.040
This is an externalization

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.040
Another question is

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.040
For example

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.040
In terms of signal interpretation

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.040
You mentioned

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.040
For example, a patient with Parkinson's disease

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.040
Compared to a person with typical control

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.040
Their signal

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.040
Will be stronger

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.040
Am I right?

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.040
But you mentioned

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.040
This is a conversation hypothesis

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.040
But I don't know what you're talking about

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.040
Because I've heard this hypothesis many times

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.040
In fact, this hypothesis is true

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.040
You can talk about it in reverse

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.040
If the signal is strong, it is a conversation

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.040
Where is the accuracy?

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.040
Do you understand what I mean?

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.040
I believe this is not my first question

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.040
What do you think of this question?

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.040
In fact, you asked this question

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040
Many clinical researchers are asking

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.040
I would say

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.040
If you are single

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.040
For example, you only have fMRI data

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.040
Then you see

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.040
In theory, you expect patients to show

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.040
Lower value

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.040
But the result shows that the patient's value has risen

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.040
This may be a conversation effect

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.040
But if you want to talk about conversation effect

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.040
You need to have another piece of data

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.040
To support it

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.040
For example, you have behavior

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.040
When doing the same thing

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.040
The patient did better than normal people

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.040
In this case

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.040
Or there is no difference

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.040
We have another piece of data

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040
We can say it is a conversation effect

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040
In addition, in recent years

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.040
There is a rather popular topic

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.040
They are called male adaptation

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.040
When you see the value rise

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.040
It may not necessarily mean

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.040
It is just a so-called male adaptation

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.040
Maybe this connection

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.040
It is controlled by another network

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.040
But because of the disease

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.040
The network that controls this connection

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.040
It's not that good

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.040
It has no male function

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.040
It can't control that network

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.040
If you control that connection

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.040
Then you see the value of the connection

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.040
You think it may be

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.040
It may be a conversation effect

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.040
But maybe it's just because

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.040
The network that controls it

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.040
There is no way to do it properly

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.040
There may be a total pattern change

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.040
It's not just a problem with the connectivity

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.040
I think

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.040
The data dimension is very large

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.040
In fact, to explain

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.040
I think it's very difficult

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.040
I have another question

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.040
It's about signal processing

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.040
This is a more general connectivity issue

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.040
That is to say

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.040
If you use both signals

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.040
If you look at it

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.040
But since both signals are blood vessels

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.040
The signal at each point in the blood vessel

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.040
It's not independent

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.040
My blood vessels have upstream and downstream

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.040
My downstream signal is of course dependent

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.040
How do you know

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.040
How do you know

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.040
This is a neural signal

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.040
This is a neural connectivity signal

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.040
Not a blood vessel connectivity signal

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.040
I can tell you

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.040
I have no way to know

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.040
That's why I said before

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.040
It's a very dirty signal

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.040
It's very

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.040
Not direct

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.040
And very dirty

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.040
Its signal actually includes

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.040
For example, CBB, CBF

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.040
All these things will affect

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.040
Even the whole magnetic field

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.040
Homogeneity will also affect you

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.040
So frankly

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.040
I have no way to know

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.040
Many people use other

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.040
Mathematical models

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.040
For example, the balloon model

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.040
If you want to analyze more

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.040
More precise mathematical models

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.040
It's possible to tell you

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.040
In the end

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.040
If you split the whole signal into many parts

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.040
Which parts may not come from

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.040
Neural is from other

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.040
This is possible

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.040
But I didn't list the mathematical model

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.040
So at the moment I can only say

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.040
The changes I see

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.040
We can only assume

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.040
Most of it comes from neural

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.040
So we have to do a lot of pre-processing

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.040
To ensure that the signals we get

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.040
Are not artificial

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.040
Not fake

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.040
I have another

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.040
Sorry, the last signal question

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.040
Too often heard

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.040
I never had an expert to ask me

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.040
Sorry

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.040
In addition, the structural hub you mentioned

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.040
And the functional hub

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.040
Can be different

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.040
But I think there is a place

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.040
I find it difficult to understand

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.040
For example, if I have a functional hub today

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.040
There must be a neural connection in the middle

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.040
Right?

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.040
That means I'm in the structure today

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.040
For example, I went to scan the brain today

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.040
I scanned a bunch of highways

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.040
Then the neural highway does not go

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.040
They go to the local alley

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.040
Right?

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.040
You just say

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.040
I don't go to Taipei to Kaohsiung

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.040
I just cut from Taichung today

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.040
Cut to Hualien

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.040
Go there

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.040
Right

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.040
How do you explain

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.040
The difference between the two

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.040
In addition to the signal problem

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.040
How is it possible

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.040
Right

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.040
Actually, the question you asked

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:48.040
No, but this is a good question

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.040
There are a lot of things in this field

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.040
Unanswered

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.040
A lot of people spent a lot of effort to try to answer

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.040
Then this is one of them

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.040
Your question is actually discussing

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.040
The so-called

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.040
Connection between functional connectivity

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.040
Structural connectivity

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.040
This is a big

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.040
It's like a star and a big field

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.040
A lot of people are doing

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.040
Just like us

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.040
In theory

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.040
If A and B are these two points

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.040
There is a structural connection in the middle

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.040
For example, there is a connection in the middle of the white matter

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.040
So in theory

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.040
When you see the functional connection

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.040
In theory, you should also see the structural connection

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.040
This makes sense

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.040
Because you must have something to let you go

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:32.040
When doing analysis

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.040
We often see

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.040
For example, between A and B

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.040
There is a functional connection in the middle

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.040
But there is no functional connection in the middle

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.040
There are many different

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.040
There are many roles

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.040
There are many possibilities

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.040
For example, between A and B

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:50.040
For example, there is no white connection

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.040
But maybe

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.040
There is a third point C

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.040
It connects A and B

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.040
It is possible that the signal is from C

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.040
It is possible that the signal is from A to C

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.040
It is possible

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.040
In addition to the signal and the possibility

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.040
In addition to the signal and the possibility

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.040
We can't

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.040
We can't

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.040
Tell you why

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.040
This is why we have been trying

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.040
Want to understand the functional connection

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.040
The relationship between structural connection

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.040
I have an idea

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.040
Because like people

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.040
Generally outside

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.040
For example, our brain is being trained

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.040
General daily life training

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.040
For example, there will be a lot of complex visual and auditory scenarios

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.040
For example, there will be a lot of complex visual and auditory scenarios

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.040
You have to interact with a lot of people

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.040
These should be well

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.040
The brain has to deal with the most

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.040
But today you lie in the FMI

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.040
For example, it is a resting state

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.040
And listen to a bunch of noise

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.040
In fact, it is a very unnatural situation

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.040
In fact, it is a very unnatural situation

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.040
You just tell him

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.040
I just don't want you to walk the highway today

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.040
I just want you to walk a very strange one

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.040
Then lie down for a few minutes

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.040
So I think maybe

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.040
Is it because of this reason

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.040
Because it is not under the nature of nature

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.040
So I can't find the function

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.040
The same situation

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.040
This is also possible

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.040
This is also possible

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.040
There is a kind

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.040
In fact, when the resting state just came out

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.040
A lot of people are

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.040
There are a lot of discussions about this matter

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.040
There is another way

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.040
In addition to FMI

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.040
You can use EEG or MEG

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.040
Different modality

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.040
To measure its functional

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.040
EEG and MEG environment

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.040
Compared to functional MRI

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.040
Are closer to human normal living environment

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.040
So in this way

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.040
Maybe what you get

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.040
Will be closer to normal

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.040
Under the situation

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.040
I hope so. Thank you for your answer.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.040
Sorry

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.040
OK

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.040
Any other questions?

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.040
Can I continue to ask questions?

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.040
Can I ask a question first?

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.040
Follow Andrew's question

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.040
OK

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.040
Do you want to ask other questions?

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.040
I might ask some

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.040
Everyone's questions

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.040
Then I will follow Andrew

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.040
You just said

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.040
How do you know

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.040
Now the correlation

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.040
Or any association

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.040
The nerve

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.040
Not the blood

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.040
If

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.040
I am not

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.040
The expert in this area

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.040
But I am thinking

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.040
Is it possible

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.040
It's a little strange

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.040
Something big

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.040
Into the blood vessel

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.040
So this thing

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.040
Will flow with the blood

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.040
But this thing cannot be used by the nerve

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.040
Then you can

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.040
Measure this thing

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.040
And cut it off

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.040
In fact, this is a bit like

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.040
I know

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.040
In fact, this is a bit like what we are talking about

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.040
Contrast Enhancement

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.040
In any image

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.040
In fact, this is often used in hospitals

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.040
If it is MRI

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.040
They will play a contrast called gadolinium

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.040
This thing will not be

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.040
Nerve-absorbed

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.040
It mainly flows with the blood vessel

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.040
Different places in the body

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.040
But there is a problem

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.040
If you are talking about

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.040
Functional MRI

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040
You want to measure the nerve of the brain

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.040
But once you get to the brain

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.040
The so-called BBB is the blood vessel

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.040
There are a lot of drugs that can't get to the brain

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.040
So this is

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.040
The problem of contrast

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.040
In fact, another solution

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.040
There are a lot of people in the so-called multimodal modality

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.040
Because we all know

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.040
FMR has many shortcomings

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.040
So far we have not been able to

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.040
To overcome these shortcomings

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.040
Then we add another modality

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.040
The other modality

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.040
It has no FMR shortcomings

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.040
We hope to combine the advantages

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.040
For example, you often hear

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.040
The so-called FMR and EEG simultaneous recording

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.040
The so-called FMR and EEG simultaneous recording

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.040
That is, the veterinarian brings the EEG into the FMR at the same time

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.040
That is, the veterinarian brings the EEG into the FMR at the same time

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.040
Then you can go to the FMR signal at the same time

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.040
You can get EEG again

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.040
EEG signals are cleaner

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.040
It's less affected by the blood vessel

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.040
But at the same time

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.040
This method will cause the EEG signal to be very bad

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.040
Because as soon as you enter the FMR

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.040
It will often affect the signal

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.040
So I can only say

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.040
There is no absolute good way

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.040
But many people have tried

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.040
Want to solve the shortcomings of FMR

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.040
Okay, I'm done

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.040
My other question has nothing to do with this

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.040
So who asked first

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.040
My own background

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.040
Is doing machine learning and neuroscience

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.040
Then

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.040
I'm very curious about Mesoteli

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.040
I'm very curious about Mesoteli

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.040
Like you guys

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.040
For us

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.040
Because you use sliding windows

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.040
Then there is overlapping LAM

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.040
In a sense

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.040
You make the strong signal stronger

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.040
The weak signal becomes weaker

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.040
So the rest are those

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.040
Very strong connectivity nodes

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.040
Then you turn this connectivity

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.040
Then you turn this connectivity

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.040
Just look at the hub

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.040
You can catch some features

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.040
Then we have some cooperation here

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.040
The plan is to say

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.040
If we don't go to the feature part

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.040
We just use the connectivity matrix

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:18.040
To do features

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.040
Will it be better

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.040
So usually you will find this connectivity matrix very noisy

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.040
Then like we did

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.040
If we take the matrix between different patients

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.040
To do a distance computation

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.040
We wanted to predict the result

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.040
Is it possible to see it in our machine learning method

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.040
For example, people with Parkinson's

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.040
Brain activity will be more like

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.040
Then there is a non-connectivity

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.040
And distance will be farther

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.040
But it doesn't seem to have this effect

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.040
I want to ask you

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.040
Is there any theory

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.040
Or if it's different people, the brain operation is too different

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.040
So they all have Parkinson's

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.040
Their brain connectivity may not be the same

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.040
There is something called intersubject variability

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.040
This is actually

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.040
People who do clinical research often encounter

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.040
Headache problem

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.040
Although our current research is actually a bit

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.040
I think it's a bit oversimplified

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.040
We all say

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.040
A group of patients and a group of normal people

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.040
We often say that this is the patient group

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.040
We see this thing

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.040
But in fact, because of intersubject variability

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.040
Everyone's brain is different

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:20.040
Everyone is unique

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.040
The degree of illness

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.040
May not be the same

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.040
So this is a reason

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.040
Why you can't see

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.040
Because everyone is really different

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.040
This thing

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.040
In our lab and our research center

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.040
Many people encounter this problem

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.040
Another thing is

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.040
The method of sliding windows

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.040
Actually so far

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.040
Although sliding windows are the most commonly used

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.040
In fact, frankly, because it is the simplest

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.040
So everyone uses it, but it has a lot of problems

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.040
The first one is how long your window length is

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.040
Then the second one is if your overlap

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.040
How long is your overlap

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.040
These are all some problems

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.040
So now more and more people

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.040
Will propose different ways

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.040
To measure the so-called

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.040
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.040
For example, there seems to be one

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.040
What is it called

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.040
DCC

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.040
Conditional Correlation

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.040
I kind of forgot what it was doing

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.040
But a lot of people

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.040
Just go back

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.040
To use the so-called

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.040
Mathematical model

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.040
To calculate the so-called

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.040
Dynamic Functional Connectivity

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.040
Then I can ask

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.040
You said there is a step where you do some

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.040
Thresholding

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.040
What is the threshold

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.040
0.5 or something

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.040
Thresholding is a big problem

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.040
According to the information I showed you today

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.040
In fact, my threshold is 0.3

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.040
Because I use

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.040
Simple Correlation

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.040
Generally speaking, we think that 0.3 or more

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.040
Is the so-called mild

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.040
There is a correlation

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.040
0.3 or less is more like

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.040
It's hard to say

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.040
Is there really a correlation

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.040
But in fact, I have tried other methods

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.040
There is a

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.040
Proportional Thresholding

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.040
Its thresholding is actually not based on

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.040
Absolute value

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.040
It is based on the density of the entire matrix

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.040
That is, I take the front

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.040
For example, the front

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.040
30% density

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.040
In this case, it becomes

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.040
When you do graph theory

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.040
Every edge value

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.040
Every subject has the same value

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.040
This is actually

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.040
Strictly speaking, it is a fair way

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.040
But the drawback is

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.040
It may not be so sensitive

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.040
Some things it can't detect

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.040
Thank you

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.040
it is good

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.040
Have you tried

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.040
Is it better than treatment?

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.040
I'm doing this

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.040
Live

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.040
The question is

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.040
Is there a comparison of treatment before and after treatment?

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.040
Then I am currently running in the lab computer

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.040
That is, the information we receive

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.040
In fact, there will be

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.040
We will record

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.040
When they come

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.040
OnMedication and OffMedication

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.040
Ask them not to take medicine the night before

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.040
Come to us the next morning

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.040
Ask them to take medicine after scanning

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.040
Scan again in the afternoon

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.040
The purpose of this experiment is to see

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.040
Because they all take LipaDopa

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.040
It depends on this medicine

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.040
Will it affect their cognitive ability?

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.040
Then I just used

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:30.040
SlidingWindow method

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.040
I can tell you in a simple way

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.040
The simplest way

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.040
The result is

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.040
The result of taking medicine and not taking medicine

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040
If you take medicine

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.040
It's hard for me to see

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.040
The patient who takes medicine is different from the normal person

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.040
On the contrary, the patient who does not take medicine

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.040
See a lot of difference from the normal person

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.040
But this is the problem

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.040
It sounds very normal

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.040
Because the patient took the medicine

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.040
Theoretically, it is more similar to the normal person

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.040
But if I use different methods

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.040
The result I see is completely different

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.040
So I'm still thinking about it

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:04.040
Find out which one is the real result

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.040
The nerve

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.040
It weakens

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.040
Maybe it takes a while

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.040
Or maybe it doesn't take a while

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.040
For example

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.040
If you take medicine for a period of time

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.040
Then

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.040
Before you take any medicine

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.040
Just

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.040
Because I think

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.040
For example, the nerve

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.040
It will die

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.040
It's over

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.040
So if you go to take medicine

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.040
It's hard to say

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.040
For example, it can have a long-term effect the next day

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.040
No

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.040
For PT patients

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.040
Their dopamine is dead

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.040
Bye-bye

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.040
The so-called levodopa

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.040
It's just that the drug will produce

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.040
Something similar to dopamine

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.040
They are called left-handed dopamine

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:56.040
Use these things

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.040
To temporarily control his illness

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.040
Then they

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.040
The effect of the drug is really hard to say

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.040
Everyone is different

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.040
Is there a way

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.040
Or something

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.040
Let the cell regenerate

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.040
Oh this is that

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.040
Signal plasticity

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.040
Isn't that what you are doing?

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.040
You said I misunderstood you

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.040
The question on the spot

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.040
Is with that

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.040
The so-called regeneration

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:26.040
Cell regeneration is related

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.040
Because he is doing plasticity

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.040
So he asked this question

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.040
To be frank

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.040
I'm not very clear

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.040
But at least so far

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.040
On the PT patient

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.040
I heard I haven't heard anything like that

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.040
But I know

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.040
Because of my own research

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.040
In addition to Parkinson's disease

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.040
Another one called multiple sclerosis

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.040
Multiple sclerosis

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.040
The biggest problem with him is that the water is dead

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.040
We call demyelination

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.040
There is a vote of people who are studying very seriously

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.040
Is it possible to remyelination

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.040
Let him die of water

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.040
Then come back

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.040
It should be said

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.040
Maybe there are some drugs

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.040
Or some special

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.040
Genetic treatment or something

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.040
But this result has not yet been widely accepted

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.040
Um

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.040
If you use cognitive functions

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.040
Indeed now some people will think

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.040
He developed a set

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.040
The so-called cognitive training

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.040
Then let the patient test this cognitive training

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.040
After a long time

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.040
This cognitive training can strengthen his

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.040
One kind of neural connection

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:44.040
Even if you don't have so many multiple sclerosis

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.040
If that neural connection is strengthened

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.040
To some extent

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.040
It can maintain your basic brain function

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.040
That's another one

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.040
Kind of like

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.040
Another kind of training

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.040
Um

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.040
I haven't seen much

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.040
Ok

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.040
Any other questions

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.040
I think we seem to be talking for a long time

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.040
Ok

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.040
Let me take a look

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.040
Oh

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.040
Let me take a look at that

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.040
question

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:24.040
Someone asked me to take off the outlier

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.040
Um

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.040
I didn't take off the outlier

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.040
Because I

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:32.040
If you look at the picture directly

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.040
There is no patient

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.040
It feels like

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.040
Very different from others

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.040
But when we are

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.040
I didn't talk about this experiment today

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.040
But in other plans

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.040
We do leave one out

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.040
That is, when we take the patient's information

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.040
To do

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.040
Related to statistics

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.040
Another thing called leave one out

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.040
Let's say we have 10 patients today

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.040
Then we only put 9 in

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.040
And then after this calculation

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.040
Take one of them away

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.040
And then put another one in

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.040
Just throw one person away at a time

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.040
And then get a new one

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.040
So in this case, our final result

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.040
The result we report is

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.040
That effect is

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.040
You will see it every time

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.040
This kind of effect

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.040
Strictly speaking, it can be removed

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.040
Ok

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.040
Machine learning? Yes

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.040
We have a group of people doing machine learning

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.040
But I'm not so familiar with machine learning

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.040
So I'm still learning

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.040
Next door

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.040
But I have one of my own

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.040
It's called CCA

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.040
Canonical Correlation Analysis

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:40.040
That CCA is actually not

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:42.040
It has nothing to do with any image

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.040
It is purely related to clinical data

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.040
That is a little bit of the most basic machine learning

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:48.040
We are doing that

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.040
Multi-Modality

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.040
Multi-Modality

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.040
Multi-Variant Analysis

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.040
CCA is two data

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.040
Trying to project to the same domain

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.040
You have two different groups of data

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.040
Oh, I don't have that

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.040
If you want to merge it

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.040
Do you have CCA?

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:10.040
I'm doing CCA

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.040
There is actually no different

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.040
That is purely

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.040
Two different data for patients

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.040
One is their demographic

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.040
That is their age

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.040
The other set is their cognitive scores

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.040
Only these two have no impact

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040
Can I ask

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.040
Like we are doing machine learning

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.040
We have found some data before

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.040
It seems that this kind of data you are doing

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.040
I can't find it on the Internet

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.040
Is it very private?

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.040
Can't do anything

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.040
It's very protective

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.040
No

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.040
Now a lot of

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.040
Google

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.040
Human Connectome Project

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.040
UK Biobank

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.040
German National Cohort

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.040
These are actually

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.040
Thousands of people missing

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.040
All can be downloaded

01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.040
All FMRI

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.040
They all have

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.040
They have MRI

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.040
Some have EEG

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.040
Some have functional MRI

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.040
Structural MRI

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.040
Depends on their different

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.040
Labels

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.040
If you

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.040
Go to

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.040
Human Connectome Project

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.040
One of them

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.040
Human Connectome Project is mainly normal people

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.040
But they have other cooperative

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.040
Project

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.040
For example, there is autism

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.040
Or other diseases

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.040
If you

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:36.040
Interested in Parkinson

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:38.040
You can go online

There are files inside that you can download for free

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.040
But you have to register with them first

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.040
They want to know who you are

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.040
Then you can free download

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.040
Do you have any questions?

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:08.040
Is there any other questions?

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.040
Is there any other questions?

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.040
That's all

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.040
OK

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.040
