1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
Okay, I'll start now.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,360
I was scared.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,000
So what I'm going to talk about today is

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,920
I'm going to describe fluid mechanics,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,800
but I'm going to use quantum mechanics

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,760
to describe fluid mechanics.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,520
Before I start, I'm going to talk about

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,840
why fluid mechanics,

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,360
usually the Navier-Stokes equation or Euler equation,

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
is very non-linear.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,360
How could it be related to this linear equation?

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
In fact, this is not a discovery.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
As early as 1926,

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,360
Magnum had already discovered

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,360
that these two equations are closely related.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
I usually think like this.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,360
The Euler equation,

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,360
the physics behind it is like this.

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,360
It has a few postulates.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
The first one is that there is inertia.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,360
That is to say, if the particle has no force,

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,360
the speed is just following the speed of the particle.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
So the speed of the fluid is

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
the speed of the vector.

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
But in fact, there is an inner force in the fluid,

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
which is the pressure.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,360
And Euler's assumption is that

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
this is a conservative field,

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
so it is already a gradient of function.

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
And finally, this gradient of function,

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
which is the pressure force,

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,360
is the only constraint.

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,360
In fact, it is an incompressible flow.

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,360
And these assumptions are combined

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,360
to write the incompressible Euler equation.

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,360
And the most difficult part in this equation

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,360
is actually the inertia part.

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Because it has a non-linear effect in the equation.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
That is, U dot gradient U.

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,360
When you say P-lemming,

41
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,360
I also want to use these non-linear equations.

42
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Yes, just like dust.

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Do you know why?

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
If I have the first equation on the right,

45
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
will it be very simple?

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
It can be said to be simple or not simple.

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
It is not so direct.

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
It is also a non-linear method.

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
It is a Berger's equation.

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
If you want to simulate,

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
you can just throw a lot of particles

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
and let it fly.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
But in the end, you have to predict

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
what the final density is.

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
In fact, it can be clearly written down.

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Especially when it is Euler,

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
it can be clearly written down.

58
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
In fact, there are some interesting phenomena.

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
It is not very direct.

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
And those are all non-linear phenomena.

61
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
It looks like a very simple physics.

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
But in fact, because it is non-linear,

63
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
it just runs out of phenomena.

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Many non-linear phenomena,

65
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
such as shock wave and reflection wave,

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
will appear.

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Yes, it's a simple version,

68
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,360
but it's not so direct.

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
This non-linear phenomenon

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
can be written in different ways.

71
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Like Lagrange and Helmholtz.

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,360
A lot of people

73
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
write Euler's equation in the same way.

74
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
But the non-linear phenomenon

75
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
is always there.

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
It's all because of the law of inertia.

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
But in fact, there is a linear equation.

78
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Schrodinger's equation

79
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
is built into the law of inertia.

80
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Schrodinger's equation

81
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
for complex value wave function

82
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
is written like this.

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I will throw away the potential term.

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
This looks like a heat equation.

85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Yes, the mathematical convention

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
is that delta is the Laplacian.

87
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
It's usually a gradient equation.

88
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
It looks like a heat equation,

89
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
but there is an i.

90
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
h bar is a function

91
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
in my entire talk.

92
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
But this Schrodinger's equation

93
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
shouldn't be regarded as a heat equation.

94
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
It's actually a wave equation.

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
And it's a dispersive wave equation.

96
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
It has a dispersion phenomenon.

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,360
That is, different waves

98
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
travel at different speeds.

99
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
If I look at the group velocity

100
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
of this wave,

101
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
you can see the dispersion relation.

102
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
The group velocity is actually

103
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
equal to the wave number.

104
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
The wave number

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
is usually measured by

106
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
the IC time of the E2 wave.

107
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
It will show

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
the wave number

109
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
and

110
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
the point is that

111
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
the wave number and the

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
wave number of the wave

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
are actually all

114
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
measured by the group velocity.

115
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,360
The wave number itself is

116
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
the group velocity.

117
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
So you will get a

118
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
velocity-advected-by-velocity phenomenon.

119
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
That is, it only has

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
an internal

121
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
flying phenomenon.

122
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Because the speed is written as

123
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
So based on this variable

124
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,360
change, you can see that

125
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
the original non-linear things

126
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
may become linear, or the linear

127
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
may become non-linear.

128
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
After the Schrodinger equation

129
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
is logged, what you get

130
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
will be this

131
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
functional phenomenon.

132
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
This was actually done by

133
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Madelung in 1926.

134
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
In 1925, Schrodinger

135
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
just wrote the Schrodinger equation.

136
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
The next year, Madelung said

137
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
amplitude squared

138
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
is the density of the fluid.

139
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
That can be regarded as the probability

140
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
density of the particle.

141
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Then you

142
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
treat the whole system as a fluid.

143
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
The speed of the fluid is

144
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
gradient of theta, which is

145
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
the group velocity.

146
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
If you do this,

147
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
you bring these things in

148
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
and separate the actual area.

149
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Then it will be a

150
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
If you have seen fluid,

151
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
you will find that

152
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
this is the compressible Euler equation.

153
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,360
The first method is

154
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
conservation of mass.

155
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
The second is conservation of momentum.

156
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
The only difference between

157
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
compressible and classical fluid

158
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
is the bone potential.

159
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
In the end, this is also the key

160
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
to evolving into bone mechanics.

161
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
But this

162
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
won't appear later.

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Because you can know

164
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I will add a

165
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
compressible Euler equation

166
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
to make it incompressible.

167
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
In that case,

168
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
the density will become constant

169
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
and the bone potential will disappear.

170
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
So we don't have to worry about it later.

171
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
What I just said

172
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
is that these two

173
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
actually have a point of view.

174
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
The first one is

175
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
The first one is

176
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
The first one is

177
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
the continuity equation.

178
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
q is the density.

179
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
So this is

180
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
the quality conservation.

181
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
So when you say h bar equals 0,

182
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
it's completely true.

183
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
h bar equals 0.

184
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
If your h bar equals 0,

185
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
it looks very similar.

186
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
But the

187
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
fluid velocity

188
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
h bar equals 0,

189
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
the flow velocity disappears.

190
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Unless your theta

191
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
is infinitely large.

192
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Look at the third line.

193
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
The fluid velocity is u times h bar times the gradient.

194
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
If your h bar equals 0,

195
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
your theta will...

196
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
You can make h bar very small.

197
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
It will become

198
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
semi-classic continuity.

199
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
It will become very close to the fluid velocity.

200
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
But you can't measure it directly.

201
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Just treat it as a variable.

202
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
I only have u and theta left.

203
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Under this new variable,

204
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
I already have

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
q bar, q bar,

206
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
h bar equals 0.

207
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
But this implies that your theta

208
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
must be an infinite positive function.

209
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
So...

210
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Just treat it as...

211
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Let's say...

212
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Okay, that's it.

213
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
So my

214
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
overview is...

215
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
At the beginning,

216
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
I just simulated

217
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
to show you the simulation result.

218
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
And then...

219
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Next, I want to talk about

220
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
a theory that is

221
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
more advanced than the variable variation.

222
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
It's called Geometric Clutch Variables.

223
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
I don't know how much I can talk about it.

224
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
For the dynamics part,

225
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
I will talk about the result.

226
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
But

227
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
there may be some parts in the middle.

228
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
I will try to talk about it.

229
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
If you have any questions,

230
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,360
please feel free to ask.

231
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I will use some

232
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
more complicated math.

233
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
And then...

234
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
We published a paper

235
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
called Schrodinger's Smoke.

236
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
It's about cat when smoke.

237
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
It's about

238
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
doing some

239
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
utility simulation.

240
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
So if you google

241
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Schrodinger's Smoke, you will see our paper.

242
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
We use

243
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Madelung's idea.

244
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
We want to

245
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
treat fluid density...

246
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Instead of using

247
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
density and velocity.

248
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
We use the complex value

249
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
wave function.

250
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
And then use Madelung's variable variation.

251
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
And this fluid velocity

252
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
actually has this...

253
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
You can write gradient theta

254
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
as the square on the right.

255
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
If you

256
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
write it like this,

257
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
you will find that

258
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
minus i gradient is

259
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
the momentum operator.

260
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
So it just evaluates the momentum operator.

261
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
But

262
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
the point is

263
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
even though it looks great,

264
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
but velocity is just

265
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
a function of function.

266
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
It means that you don't have any vorticity.

267
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
When you take

268
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
velocity and curl,

269
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
look at the angular momentum,

270
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
you will find that it's zero.

271
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Your velocity

272
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
can only be this kind of potential flow.

273
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Or this kind of

274
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
no vortex fluid.

275
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
It's not interesting.

276
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,360
To solve this problem,

277
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
we consider

278
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
two components Schrodinger equation.

279
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
You can think of this

280
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
as spin half particle.

281
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Or you can think of it as

282
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
two components.

283
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Its Schrodinger equation is still the same.

284
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
It's component wise.

285
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
It's still the same

286
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
one component Schrodinger equation.

287
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
The variable variation

288
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
is the density of the fluid.

289
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
It's still the same.

290
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Amplitude squared.

291
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
But in this case,

292
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
it's the sum of

293
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
the density of two channels.

294
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
And

295
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
for velocity,

296
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
it's the same as the momentum operator.

297
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
If you write this down,

298
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
it will become

299
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
the velocity of two components.

300
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
But

301
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
it's a linear combination.

302
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
It depends on their density.

303
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
In this case,

304
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
you don't have to worry about curl.

305
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
It can

306
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
describe

307
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
more interesting

308
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
fluid states.

309
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
So we use one component

310
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
and two components

311
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
to describe the fluid.

312
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Now,

313
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
to describe the fluid,

314
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
we need to describe incompressible fluid.

315
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
We already have the inertial motion.

316
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
To describe

317
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
incompressible fluid,

318
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
we add a potential term

319
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
to make it correspond to the velocity.

320
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
It's the divergence tree.

321
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
It's like the Euler equation.

322
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
When you add the pressure,

323
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
the fluid becomes incompressible fluid.

324
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Then we

325
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
use the constraint Schrodinger equation

326
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
to describe the incompressible Schrodinger equation.

327
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
The solution is

328
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
the incompressible Schrodinger flow.

329
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Then

330
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
it's the same as

331
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
other incompressible flow.

332
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
As long as you have

333
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
continuity equation,

334
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
that is, the quality is constant,

335
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
and

336
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
it's incompressible fluid.

337
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
The volume will not change over time.

338
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
The density

339
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
will not change

340
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
over time.

341
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Initially, if density is constant,

342
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
it will always be constant.

343
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
My question is

344
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
you

345
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
turn it into

346
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
a two-component

347
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
vector.

348
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Are you a two-component?

349
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
If

350
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
the screen is zero,

351
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
there will be no velocity.

352
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
If you have two components,

353
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
you need at least two components.

354
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
What is the implication?

355
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
How do you turn it into a one-component?

356
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Actually,

357
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
at the beginning,

358
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
nComponent

359
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
and twoComponent.

360
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
After that,

361
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
twoComponent

362
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
is enough.

363
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
The meaning of enough

364
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
is

365
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
in

366
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
the middle,

367
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
at the end,

368
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
there is a question.

369
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Can you find

370
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
a two-component wave function

371
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
that matches

372
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
the velocity?

373
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Then I found that two-component

374
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
did a good job.

375
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
It means that it can be done

376
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
suddenly.

377
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Is it a two-component?

378
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Three-component.

379
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Do you mean domain?

380
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Is it a fluid domain?

381
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Is it a fluid space?

382
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Yes.

383
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Two-component or three-component?

384
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Sorry.

385
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
There are four variables

386
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
on your right hand side.

387
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Each size is different.

388
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
On the left hand side,

389
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
there are two

390
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
or three variables.

391
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
If there are two variables,

392
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
there is a redundancy on the right hand side.

393
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Do you know

394
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
what is redundancy?

395
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
You mean

396
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
four components

397
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
are like four-component,

398
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
but there are only three-component

399
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
to be described.

400
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Yes, there is redundancy.

401
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Then...

402
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Let me think about it.

403
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Is it a symmetry?

404
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
What?

405
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Yes, it is.

406
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
It is a bit complicated.

407
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
There is a symmetry.

408
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
It means

409
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
when you write the velocity field

410
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
like this,

411
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
in the end,

412
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
we will do an unshrinkable flow.

413
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
The unshrinkable flow is just

414
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
that the velocity field drops a little bit.

415
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
All the velocity fields

416
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
can be projected.

417
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
All the radians of pressure

418
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
can be shrinked.

419
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
After this,

420
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
this space

421
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
will only be dominated by

422
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
one particle.

423
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Given curl of u,

424
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
we can only decide how much u is.

425
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
The curl of u

426
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
will be mapped to

427
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
the two-component

428
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
wave function

429
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
corresponding to the spin vector

430
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
or block vector.

431
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
There is a gauge symmetry

432
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
which is the variable

433
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
of the unshrinkable area.

434
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
It will be

435
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
corresponding to the same velocity field.

436
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
In the end,

437
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,360
you will see a big

438
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
redundant degree of freedom.

439
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
So on the right,

440
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
the overall phase

441
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
of quantum mechanics

442
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
is not important.

443
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Is it physical or...

444
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
It's the same.

445
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
It just matches

446
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
the velocity field.

447
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
In the velocity field,

448
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
we need to do pressure projection.

449
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
The redundancy.

450
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
In the end, it will match.

451
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Yes.

452
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
In the velocity field,

453
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
we need to remove

454
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
some redundancy

455
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
to describe the

456
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
unshrinkable flow.

457
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
It's the phase shift

458
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
in Schrodinger's equation.

459
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Why can you use

460
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
both domain and three-dimensional?

461
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
This is...

462
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Actually,

463
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
domain can be done

464
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
in higher dimensions.

465
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,360
This is because...

466
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
I don't know how to explain.

467
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
It's...

468
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Simply put,

469
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
vorticity is a two-form.

470
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Only that thing

471
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
is used

472
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
to describe the flow.

473
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
It's...

474
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
It's...

475
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
If I say

476
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
the speed of unshrinkable flow

477
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
is equal to

478
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
the vorticity.

479
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
It's a two-form.

480
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
In the end,

481
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
you only need

482
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
a map.

483
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
At most, you only need

484
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
a map.

485
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
So, vorticity is a two-form.

486
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Yes.

487
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
If it's in the other direction,

488
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
it won't shrink.

489
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
It's not important.

490
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
It can shrink.

491
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Yes.

492
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
You can see

493
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
in the end.

494
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Now, let's say it's just a metronome.

495
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Will you talk about turbulence?

496
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I won't talk about turbulence.

497
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
But I will talk about

498
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
the dynamics of a normal vortex.

499
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
This is incompressible Schrödinger's flow.

500
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Then we...

501
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
The mathematical simulation

502
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
is very simple.

503
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
You just need to

504
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
make a circle and

505
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
solve the linear Schrödinger's equation.

506
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
It corresponds to

507
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
your field.

508
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
It's like a simulation

509
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
of inertia motion.

510
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Then you apply potential force

511
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
to make the field

512
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
become divergence-free.

513
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Then we started to do some simulations.

514
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,360
In the end, we found

515
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
that it was

516
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
very successful

517
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,360
in simulating

518
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
vortex dynamics.

519
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
What is vortex?

520
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
I just said curl of velocity.

521
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
That thing is called vorticity.

522
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
In the real fluid,

523
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
it only appears

524
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
from the boundary.

525
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
It appears from the boundary.

526
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
When it forms,

527
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
it's already low-dimensional.

528
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
It's two-dimensional geometry.

529
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
That's vortex sheet.

530
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Vortex sheet is not stable.

531
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
It will quickly curl into

532
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
vortex filaments.

533
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
It will become a vortex structure.

534
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
That structure will become very stable.

535
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
We see a lot of vortex in our daily lives.

536
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
That's what we call

537
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
vortex filaments.

538
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
Are those two real photos?

539
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Yes, they are.

540
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
They are not photoshopped.

541
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
They look like real photos.

542
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
The color is very bright.

543
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
You need to add a filter.

544
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
Yes, I need to add a filter.

545
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
This is a real video.

546
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
But vortex filaments

547
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
are hard to simulate

548
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
with a normal

549
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
fluid software.

550
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Because

551
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
these vortex motions

552
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
are very sensitive

553
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
to the

554
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
vortex thickness.

555
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
If the vortex becomes thicker,

556
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
it will become slower.

557
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
If it becomes thinner, it will become faster.

558
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
So if you really want to...

559
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
And the whole fluid is

560
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
the whole fluid motion

561
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
is dominated by

562
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
these

563
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
one-dimensional filaments.

564
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
So if you want to calculate the whole fluid

565
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
qualitatively correct,

566
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
you need to use a very high

567
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
resolution fluid to solve

568
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
those vortex.

569
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Otherwise, the thickness will be misinterpreted.

570
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
The whole

571
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
vortex dynamics

572
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
will be qualitatively wrong.

573
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
So you either need

574
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
a very expensive grid,

575
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
or you need to use some very complicated methods

576
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
to describe those vortex dynamics

577
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
using some real curves.

578
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Then you can do those simple reconnections.

579
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
But if you use Schrodinger's

580
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
equation...

581
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Let me talk about

582
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
the difficulties first.

583
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
You can see from some benchmark tests.

584
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
There is a phenomenon called leapfrogging vortex rings.

585
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
If you put two vortex rings

586
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,360
in front and back,

587
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
the vortex rings will be sucked

588
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
to the front.

589
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
This is a real video.

590
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,360
They will be exchanged.

591
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
Then you will see...

592
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Will the people on the line see

593
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
the same thing?

594
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Anyway,

595
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
two vortex rings will leapfrog.

596
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
But if you use

597
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,360
a general

598
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
mathematical method

599
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
to solve Euler's equation or Navier-Stokes equation,

600
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
even if you use a very advanced method,

601
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
but if you are in a very rough grid,

602
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
the two vortex rings will merge together very quickly.

603
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Then you won't see that leapfrogging phenomenon.

604
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Now we are solving...

605
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
We just

606
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
introduced incompressible Schrodinger flow.

607
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
It has the same resolution size.

608
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
You can see that

609
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
it can do this.

610
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
It can reproduce

611
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
this observed phenomenon.

612
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Then...

613
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Let me ask a question.

614
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
You just said

615
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
that it can reproduce this phenomenon.

616
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
It means that

617
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
you can see it like this.

618
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
But if you change it to a parameter,

619
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,360
it can really

620
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
change to

621
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
the gas you just saw.

622
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Yes.

623
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Because there are some parameters in it.

624
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
So if you want to do

625
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,360
further parameter

626
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
tuning,

627
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
of course you can match it.

628
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,360
It's actually very simple.

629
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,360
Just two rings.

630
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,360
It has a certain vortex.

631
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
When the ring is small enough,

632
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
its final dynamics is dominated by

633
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
the dynamics of the vortex filaments.

634
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
That thing is

635
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
mathematically...

636
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Even Schrodinger, you can push it out.

637
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Under that progressive behavior,

638
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
it's the same.

639
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
It's...

640
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
It's...

641
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
You can push it out.

642
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Then the two rings will jump like this.

643
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Yes.

644
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
This system is very robust.

645
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
If you put the two rings together,

646
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
it will jump.

647
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
It will jump according to

648
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
the evolution distance.

649
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
So we just put it anywhere and it will jump.

650
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Another phenomenon is also a very simple setup.

651
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
It means that you put two vortex rings

652
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
on each other.

653
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
But there is an angle.

654
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
Then they will recombine.

655
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Then it will separate from the other two directions.

656
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
This is a real experiment.

657
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
You can see the two rings.

658
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
It's like this.

659
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Then it separates.

660
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
If you use a normal

661
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
LTI

662
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
software,

663
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
it's hard to simulate this thing.

664
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
It really needs very high accuracy.

665
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
This is the same as

666
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
our method.

667
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
You can find this phenomenon

668
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
on a very thick network.

669
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Then

670
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
I just said that

671
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
when simulating LTI,

672
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
its grid resolution

673
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
dominates a large part.

674
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
So you can see that

675
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
using some traditional methods

676
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
to look at

677
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
the node.

678
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Then you will find that at different resolutions,

679
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
the result is the same.

680
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
So using our method

681
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
on a very thick network, it's close to the end.

682
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
It can simulate

683
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
some other interesting phenomena.

684
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
It can be used

685
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
in computer graphics.

686
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
For example, you can simulate a jet.

687
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
You can simulate an obstacle.

688
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,360
The vortex behind.

689
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
The vortex behind.

690
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Then you can simulate

691
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
a moving obstacle.

692
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
This video looks good when it looks smooth.

693
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Then there's

694
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
another

695
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
moving obstacle.

696
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,360
Because

697
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
in this kind of vortex dynamics,

698
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
if it can be calculated accurately,

699
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
you can see

700
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
a more realistic vortex

701
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
phenomenon.

702
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
This is really important

703
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
in computer graphics.

704
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
These are two

705
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,360
water-absorbing boxes.

706
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
It's called secondary small ring shoot-off.

707
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
What I'm doing here is

708
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
putting two

709
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
pieces of ink

710
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
on top of each other.

711
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
It will also

712
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
have a problem.

713
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
What is network complexity?

714
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Network complexity is

715
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
that

716
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
my computation grid

717
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
how many

718
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
pieces each side has to cut.

719
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
So usually

720
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
usually

721
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
you have to

722
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
cut 256

723
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
times 256 times 256.

724
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Or 512 times 512.

725
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
You often need

726
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
a very large memory

727
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
to eat.

728
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Or you need to use cluster to compute.

729
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
This is 64 times

730
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
64 times 64.

731
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Then you introduce it in these grids.

732
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Yes.

733
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
What is relative?

734
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
You can't say it's relative.

735
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
How big is the thing in the middle?

736
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Oh.

737
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
It's relative.

738
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Just look at this picture.

739
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
It's

740
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
64 times 64 times 64.

741
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
If you put it on the computer

742
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
you can see

743
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
that

744
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
the gray part at the bottom is the network.

745
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
You can see the grid.

746
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
That's the real

747
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
network on the

748
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
computation of Lisan.

749
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
So the length of the command

750
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,360
is actually normalized.

751
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Yes.

752
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
It has a physical size

753
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
which is 1m x 1m x 1m.

754
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
And

755
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
it has a resolution which is dimensionless.

756
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
It's 1 out of 64.

757
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Then you put it on that position.

758
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
It becomes the smallest length in the world.

759
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
At this length

760
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
we simulate the Lisan version

761
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
of this grid.

762
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Theoretically

763
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
at this length

764
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
when it's dimensionless

765
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
it will be

766
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
limited to the real

767
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
continuous world.

768
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
And this picture

769
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
is when I'm at 64 times 64 times 64

770
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
it's very close.

771
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
But in the traditional method

772
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
you need a higher resolution.

773
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Why did you choose this picture?

774
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
This is the community.

775
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
It's a little perverted.

776
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
You can actually add gravity.

777
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
It's a little bit

778
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
when the density is different.

779
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
That's because

780
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
there are two components.

781
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
You can play a trick.

782
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
For example, when the potential of two components

783
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
is a little different

784
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
you can make some effects.

785
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Because of the gravity

786
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,360
the gravity of the air

787
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
is pushed up.

788
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
And this is bar.

789
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,360
H bar

790
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
has a unit

791
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,360
which is meter square

792
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
meter square divided by second.

793
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
And

794
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
so

795
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
I usually

796
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
make it dimensionless.

797
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
So according to my real

798
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
density

799
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
it's 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 meter.

800
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
There is a

801
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
characteristic length

802
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
which is 1 meter.

803
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
And then you start to get rid of these variables.

804
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
Based on experience.

805
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Planck constant

806
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
has nothing to do with the real Planck constant.

807
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
My final analysis will say

808
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
you don't have to get close to 0.

809
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
That is to say

810
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
H bar can be very large.

811
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
The phenomenon you just saw

812
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
is the result when H bar is very large.

813
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Finally, we did a mathematical analysis

814
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
and found that

815
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
when H bar is very large

816
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
the result of Perturb

817
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
is the difference between it and the Euler equation

818
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
the effect

819
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
is only in the

820
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
vortex

821
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,360
and other places it will be very fast

822
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,360
to the Euler equation.

823
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
There is this kind of

824
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
argument.

825
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,360
In this case, you will find that

826
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
when H bar is very large,

827
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
it will get the vortex

828
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
dominated Euler equation.

829
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Then you will find

830
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
that

831
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
I will talk about this later.

832
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
I don't know what I'm talking about.

833
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
But

834
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,360
H bar

835
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
when it is very small

836
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
it will become exactly the Euler equation.

837
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
You just saw

838
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
when H bar is very large

839
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
I can simulate some phenomena

840
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
and it is matched.

841
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
I can see the phenomenon in the vortex.

842
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
It is the same as the vortex.

843
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
If H bar is very small

844
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
it will be the same.

845
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
It will be the same.

846
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
It can detect the Euler equation

847
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
on a very large network.

848
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Yes, if H bar is too small

849
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,360
I think H bar is a bit

850
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
too large.

851
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Yes.

852
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,360
In fact, it is H bar

853
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,360
that you have to choose.

854
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
H bar will correspond to

855
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
your

856
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
If you know the super fluid

857
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
there is an H bar inside.

858
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
That thing will cause the vortex

859
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
quantization.

860
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
That is, every vortex unit

861
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
can be quantized into H bar units.

862
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
In that case

863
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
you will see that

864
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
H bar is very small

865
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
you have to have the same strength

866
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
of vortex to detect

867
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
a lot of small vortices.

868
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
You can take the real fluid as

869
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
vortex becomes

870
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
a continuum.

871
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,360
That is, vortex can be any

872
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
number or size.

873
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,360
It can be taken as H bar is infinitely small

874
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
and there are a lot of vortices.

875
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
But when H bar is large

876
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
it still has some thicker vortices.

877
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
Those vortex dynamics

878
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
are similar to the vortex dynamics

879
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
in the fluid.

880
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
What is the advantage of simulation?

881
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
Is it because

882
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
we don't know what linear is?

883
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Or does it have some special properties?

884
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
There are two

885
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
advantages.

886
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
One is

887
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
that the method

888
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
becomes simpler.

889
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
You don't have to worry about

890
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
how to idealize.

891
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Because that thing is quite difficult.

892
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,360
You just need to idealize the linear system.

893
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,360
In Numerical Method

894
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
it becomes

895
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,360
an extreme simplification.

896
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
The other is

897
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,360
that even if I simulate

898
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,360
in a very advanced way

899
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
those non-linear OEVs

900
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
still can't simulate those phenomena.

901
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,360
In our method

902
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
I can simulate those phenomena

903
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
in a very early stage.

904
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,360
Especially on those

905
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,360
thin vortex dynamics.

906
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,360
These are the two advantages.

907
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Someone asked

908
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
what is the physics of H bar?

909
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Isn't it a high-level question?

910
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
The physics of H bar

911
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,360
in this fluid world

912
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
can be regarded as a parameter.

913
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,360
It will be connected to

914
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
for example

915
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,360
in this animation

916
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,360
you can see

917
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,360
a small amount of

918
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,360
in the end

919
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,360
the vortex will

920
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
cascade to a very low level

921
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
and look like turbulence.

922
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
But because of H bar

923
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,360
it will

924
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
go to a certain level and won't continue to fall.

925
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
That is the vortex concentration.

926
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Now that you mentioned it

927
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,360
you don't assume

928
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
that it will cascade.

929
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Will it?

930
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,360
No.

931
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,360
It will still cascade.

932
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
In the original fluid

933
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
the vortex will cascade.

934
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
H bar means

935
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
that at a certain level

936
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
H bar will dominate

937
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
and the fluid will disappear

938
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,360
at that level.

939
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
The vortex will not continue to cascade.

940
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
It will become diffusion and disappear.

941
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,360
It will eat up the energy.

942
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
So when we look at

943
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
turbulence

944
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
if H bar

945
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
is getting smaller and smaller

946
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
it will cause

947
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
turbulence.

948
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,360
It will look like turbulence.

949
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Without H bar

950
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
in theory

951
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
it will develop into

952
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
this is still an open problem

953
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
how is turbulence born.

954
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
A typical situation is that

955
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
it will continue to cascade from H bar

956
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,360
and then dominate into a spectrum

957
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
of different

958
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
things.

959
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,360
So you mean

960
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
if H bar is too large

961
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
if H bar is too large

962
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,360
you won't be able to see turbulence.

963
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,360
Because

964
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,360
it hasn't produced a new vortex yet

965
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
so it will dissipate.

966
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
I remember

967
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
in Sandwich

968
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
the cascading and reverse cascading

969
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
were very good.

970
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
We haven't done

971
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
that side yet.

972
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
We want to

973
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
use

974
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
a very large network

975
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,360
with high resolution

976
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,360
and then put

977
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
some random

978
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
velocity

979
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,360
and random wave function

980
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
and then use our method

981
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
to look at its energy spectrum

982
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
and then compare

983
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,360
the turbulence.

984
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
But we haven't done that yet.

985
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
But usually

986
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,360
if you want to see

987
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,360
if this thing can model

988
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,360
turbulence

989
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,360
you have to look at

990
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
the energy spectrum first.

991
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
I think

992
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
cascading versus reverse cascading

993
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
is the most important thing.

994
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
Is there a way?

995
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Yes.

996
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
One.

997
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
But there are still other ways.

998
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,360
So you mean

999
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
we don't need

1000
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
theory.

1001
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
I think reverse cascading

1002
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
is better.

1003
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Yes.

1004
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
We also

1005
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
have

1006
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
simulation on the left

1007
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,360
and real video on the right.

1008
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
This is what we often show to others

1009
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
that

1010
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
we can use our very simple algorithm

1011
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
to do some

1012
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
simulation of turbulence.

1013
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,360
This is the first part of the remark.

1014
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360
It means

1015
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
it breaks through our traditional

1016
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
imaginary fluid calculus

1017
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
what the usual framework looks like.

1018
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,360
Usually we will

1019
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
figure out how to simulate turbulence.

1020
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
But this framework

1021
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
doesn't have this problem.

1022
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Especially in Vortex Dynamics

1023
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,360
we can

1024
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,360
simulate those phenomena.

1025
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Usually we think

1026
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,360
we need to solve Euler's equation

1027
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
or Navier-Stokes equation.

1028
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,360
We need to be very advanced

1029
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
and have a very fine network

1030
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,360
to simulate those phenomena.

1031
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
There is also

1032
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,360
an interesting

1033
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
insight on math.

1034
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,360
This is

1035
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,360
incompressible Schrodinger flow equation.

1036
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
It looks like this.

1037
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Schrodinger equation

1038
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
restricted on

1039
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
a divergence-free constraint.

1040
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
This divergence-free constraint

1041
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,360
can be translated into

1042
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
wave function and

1043
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
Laplacian.

1044
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
The spatial derivative of the whole equation

1045
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,360
is Laplacian.

1046
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
This is a very special

1047
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,360
part of Schrodinger.

1048
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,360
You often need to talk about

1049
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
U dot grad U.

1050
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
You use a lot of mathematical structures.

1051
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
You often talk about 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional.

1052
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
Or

1053
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,360
you have to be on a manifold.

1054
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Laplacian can be set

1055
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
on a very low space.

1056
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
You can have a graph

1057
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,360
or a point cloud.

1058
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,360
You don't even need to use a dimensional concept.

1059
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,360
In that world,

1060
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
you can still discuss similar flow phenomena.

1061
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,360
This is a surface,

1062
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,360
so it's still a manifold.

1063
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Then we have this rabbit

1064
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,360
and its graph.

1065
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,360
A triangular graph.

1066
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
You can get the graph.

1067
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
That information is the only thing you need to know.

1068
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
You can solve the

1069
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
Schrodinger equation.

1070
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,360
You can easily

1071
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
use the same complexity

1072
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
to model the graph

1073
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,360
in this general space.

1074
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,360
That was

1075
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,360
my first part.

1076
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Next, I'm going to talk about

1077
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
the

1078
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
wave function

1079
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,360
and

1080
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
the

1081
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,360
encoded information.

1082
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,360
This is called

1083
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Clutch Variables.

1084
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,360
We developed

1085
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,360
this theory

1086
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,360
to connect the Schrodinger equation

1087
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,360
to the classical field.

1088
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,360
We have a side project

1089
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
to use this to do

1090
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
some

1091
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
vortex visualization.

1092
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Okay.

1093
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,360
Notation means

1094
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,360
that we often

1095
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
use vector field

1096
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
to represent the speed.

1097
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
On the right,

1098
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,360
there are many arrows in a fish tank.

1099
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Alternatively,

1100
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
you can consider its

1101
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,360
covector,

1102
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
or throw the index down.

1103
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Or it will

1104
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
become...

1105
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,360
You can imagine

1106
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,360
that the arrow

1107
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,360
is replaced by

1108
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,360
some hyperplane.

1109
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
This is called

1110
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,360
Differential Form.

1111
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,360
Differential Form

1112
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,360
means that

1113
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
it can be evaluated

1114
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,360
along some curves.

1115
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,360
If it is a one-form,

1116
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,360
it means that

1117
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,360
it can be evaluated

1118
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
along the curve.

1119
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,360
This is called

1120
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,360
Circulation.

1121
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,360
It is usually visualized

1122
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,360
as a hyperplane.

1123
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
When you see

1124
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,360
many hyperplanes,

1125
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,360
the curve is

1126
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
proportional to

1127
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,360
the density

1128
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
of these hyperplanes.

1129
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
The density

1130
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,360
of the banana

1131
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
is the value of the curve.

1132
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,360
So we often use

1133
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
this one-form.

1134
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,360
There is also

1135
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,360
a abstract concept called

1136
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,360
Pullback.

1137
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
If you have two spaces

1138
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,360
and you have a map

1139
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,360
from the space on the left to the space on the right,

1140
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,360
if there is a Differential Form

1141
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,360
on the right,

1142
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
you can pull it back

1143
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,360
into the Differential Form

1144
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
of the space on the left.

1145
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
The definition is that

1146
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,360
if there is a Differential Form

1147
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
on the right,

1148
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,360
you map it to the right

1149
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,360
and evaluate it to the right.

1150
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,360
The symbol is defined as

1151
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,360
f star alpha.

1152
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,360
If you don't use this symbol,

1153
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,360
you often write

1154
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,360
the rightmost space.

1155
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,360
We often write

1156
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
Pullback.

1157
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Pullback

1158
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,360
has some beautiful

1159
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
definitions.

1160
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
But that's only

1161
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,360
a very detailed introduction.

1162
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,360
So I won't talk about it here.

1163
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,360
Pullback

1164
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
has something called

1165
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
Exterior Derivative Commute.

1166
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
If you write it in a normal language,

1167
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
it will be very difficult to see.

1168
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
So we like to use

1169
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
this

1170
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
coordinate-free

1171
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
notation.

1172
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,360
There is a special pullback

1173
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,360
in the stream.

1174
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,360
Consider that the map

1175
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,360
is a flow map.

1176
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
When the stream is flowing,

1177
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
the map is from

1178
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,360
the space of time 0

1179
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,360
to the space of time t.

1180
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,360
In this way,

1181
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
you can naturally

1182
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,360
generate the map

1183
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,360
and

1184
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
the physical quantity

1185
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,360
in the world of time t

1186
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
can be pulled back to the space of time 0.

1187
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
That thing is called

1188
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
Lagrangian Coordinate.

1189
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,360
The physical quantity

1190
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,360
in the Lagrangian Coordinate.

1191
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,360
We often like to discuss

1192
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,360
the division of time

1193
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,360
in the Lagrangian Coordinate.

1194
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,360
That division is called

1195
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Lead Derivative.

1196
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,360
If the physical quantity

1197
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,360
changes with time,

1198
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,360
it will become

1199
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,360
the generalized

1200
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,360
material derivative.

1201
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,360
I often say that

1202
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,360
this physical quantity is just

1203
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,360
carried away by the stream.

1204
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,360
It means that

1205
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
after it is pulled back

1206
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,360
to the Lagrangian Coordinate,

1207
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,360
the world will not change.

1208
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,360
Do you understand?

1209
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,360
It doesn't matter.

1210
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,360
The Euler equation

1211
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,360
is written as

1212
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,360
in terms of velocity one form.

1213
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,360
That is to say,

1214
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,360
the one form of velocity

1215
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,360
is the hyperplane

1216
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,360
covector

1217
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,360
that I just visualized.

1218
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
It is purely a vector.

1219
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,360
There is a

1220
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,360
derivative of some function

1221
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,360
on the right.

1222
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,360
We often call that

1223
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
an exact form.

1224
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,360
The exact form

1225
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
means that

1226
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,360
the velocity form

1227
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,360
is divergence-free.

1228
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,360
The vorticity equation

1229
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,360
is purely a vector.

1230
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,360
The vorticity

1231
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,360
is a two-form.

1232
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,360
Vorticity is a two-form.

1233
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Vorticity

1234
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,360
is a quantity.

1235
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,360
It is not a vector.

1236
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
It is a quantity

1237
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,360
that is to be measured

1238
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
on a two-dimensional curve.

1239
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,360
We often say vorticity flux.

1240
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,360
In fact,

1241
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,360
what we can measure

1242
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,360
is the concept of flux

1243
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,360
that is to be measured

1244
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,360
on a two-dimensional curve.

1245
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,360
Then,

1246
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,360
if you see a curve

1247
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,360
that flows

1248
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,360
at any given time,

1249
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,360
you can pull it back

1250
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,360
to its zero-time state

1251
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,360
and put the evaluated

1252
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,360
vorticity flux

1253
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,360
back to the original space.

1254
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,360
You will find that it changes at any time.

1255
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,360
That is, vorticity is purely a vector.

1256
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,360
You want to ask...

1257
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,360
The meaning of vector

1258
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,360
is not that

1259
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,360
it has a

1260
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,360
zero-time state.

1261
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,360
You can ask again.

1262
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,360
The meaning of vector

1263
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,360
is not that

1264
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,360
it has a zero-time state.

1265
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,360
There is still a

1266
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,360
velocity field in the fluid.

1267
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,360
It is u.

1268
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,360
The relationship between u and eta

1269
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,360
and the velocity one-form

1270
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,360
is that

1271
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,360
eta is the velocity

1272
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,360
flat.

1273
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,360
It is the co-vector.

1274
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
It is the dual vector.

1275
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
Then,

1276
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,360
the physical quantity

1277
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,360
is directly

1278
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,360
purely a vector

1279
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,360
in this velocity field.

1280
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,360
It changes at any time.

1281
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,360
You see that

1282
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,360
L sub u

1283
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,360
depends on

1284
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,360
the velocity.

1285
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,360
Then, eta

1286
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,360
u depends on eta.

1287
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,360
So, it is a nonlinear function.

1288
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,360
The vorticity

1289
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,360
equation is the same.

1290
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,360
In fact, vorticity

1291
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,360
must be equal to d of eta

1292
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,360
or d of u

1293
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,360
flat. So, omega

1294
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,360
is coupled with velocity.

1295
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,360
In this case,

1296
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,360
vorticity is

1297
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,360
purely a vector

1298
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,360
in this equation.

1299
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,360
When they are coupled together,

1300
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,360
it increases.

1301
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,360
What are the benefits?

1302
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,360
I am just talking about

1303
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,360
the benefits.

1304
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,360
There is no benefit or

1305
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,360
disadvantage.

1306
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,360
It is just a different formulation.

1307
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,360
Since the time of Euler,

1308
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,360
we have been talking about

1309
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,360
purely a vector.

1310
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,360
This term is not invented by me.

1311
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,360
So, there is no disadvantage.

1312
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,360
I am just saying

1313
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,360
that

1314
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,360
I am just saying that

1315
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
the definition of purely a vector is

1316
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,360
the force derivative.

1317
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,360
It is just a general material derivative.

1318
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,360
It is just a quantity of u dot grad.

1319
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,360
I can imagine

1320
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
writing a general

1321
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,360
derivative.

1322
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
What is the general derivative?

1323
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,360
u dot grad.

1324
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,360
The u dot grad

1325
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,360
you mentioned

1326
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,360
is used for zero-form.

1327
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,360
Few people talk about

1328
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,360
how to generalize

1329
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,360
one-form, two-form, or other tensors.

1330
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,360
In this case,

1331
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,360
people can only write

1332
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,360
a basis for those tensors.

1333
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,360
For those

1334
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,360
previous functions,

1335
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,360
they become a zero-form function.

1336
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,360
You can do

1337
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,360
a partial division of time

1338
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360
plus u dot grad.

1339
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,360
But often the right-hand side won't do that.

1340
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,360
It should be taken care of.

1341
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,360
It should not be a function.

1342
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
It should be a tensor.

1343
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,360
It contains those things.

1344
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,360
So,

1345
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,360
sometimes people are surprised

1346
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,360
that the vorticity should not be written as

1347
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,360
zero on the right-hand side.

1348
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,360
So, I added an equation here.

1349
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,360
We often see vorticity as a vector.

1350
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
Or three components

1351
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,360
with some

1352
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
basis.

1353
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,360
Then we find that the right-hand side is not zero.

1354
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,360
Then it is regarded as a vortex stretching term.

1355
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,360
People often say that

1356
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,360
the difference between two-form and three-form is

1357
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,360
that sometimes there is

1358
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,360
a vortex stretching term.

1359
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
It's just because

1360
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,360
it's a co-dimension.

1361
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,360
When it's different,

1362
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,360
it should be a tensor,

1363
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,360
but it's a vector.

1364
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
When it's a purely vector,

1365
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,360
there is a difference.

1366
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,360
Then,

1367
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,360
I want to emphasize that

1368
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,360
I only use the above notation.

1369
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,360
I only use the simple notation

1370
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,360
to represent

1371
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,360
what I need to use.

1372
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,360
The first one is notation.

1373
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,360
Now I can talk about

1374
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,360
clebsch representation.

1375
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Clebsch is

1376
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,360
from 1850s.

1377
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,360
You may have heard of

1378
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,360
Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

1379
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,360
But most people may not know

1380
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,360
quantum mechanics.

1381
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,360
Who is the boss?

1382
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,360
Clebsch.

1383
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,360
They seem to be from the same era.

1384
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,360
But they

1385
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,360
are not used

1386
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,360
to describe quantum mechanics.

1387
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,360
They want to describe

1388
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,360
SU.

1389
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,360
That was in

1390
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,360
the mid-19th century.

1391
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,360
So people think

1392
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,360
Clebsch is a modernist.

1393
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,360
No, he is from

1394
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,360
the mid-19th century.

1395
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,360
But some of his work

1396
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,360
is in quantum mechanics.

1397
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,360
Before Clebsch,

1398
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
people only discussed

1399
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,360
potential flow.

1400
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,360
At first, people didn't know

1401
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,360
what to do with quantum mechanics.

1402
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,360
People didn't know curl operator.

1403
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,360
And there were no planes at that time.

1404
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,360
People were most concerned about

1405
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,360
the problem of quantum mechanics.

1406
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,360
So

1407
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,360
it was all about

1408
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
potential flow.

1409
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,360
In that case,

1410
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,360
velocity one form is

1411
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,360
d of some function.

1412
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,360
Velocity vector field is

1413
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,360
the gradient of some function.

1414
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,360
This is potential.

1415
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,360
But there was no vorticity.

1416
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,360
So Clebsch wrote a paper

1417
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,360
in Camp-Holt's

1418
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,360
first invention of

1419
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,360
vorticity.

1420
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,360
He immediately thought

1421
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,360
potential flow should be generalized.

1422
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Otherwise,

1423
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,360
the vorticity will be destroyed.

1424
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,360
So he considered

1425
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,360
two other potentials.

1426
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,360
One is lambda and the other is mu.

1427
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,360
He wrote velocity one form

1428
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,360
as lambda d mu plus d phi.

1429
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,360
And

1430
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,360
lambda d mu

1431
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,360
is generalized.

1432
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,360
It will have vorticity.

1433
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,360
This was very popular

1434
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360
at that time.

1435
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,360
You can see it in thermodynamics.

1436
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,360
It's not

1437
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,360
closed.

1438
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,360
It's

1439
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,360
TDS.

1440
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,360
At that time,

1441
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,360
it's easy to see

1442
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,360
lambda d mu as a consideration.

1443
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,360
It's natural.

1444
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,360
At that time,

1445
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,360
d phi can be used as

1446
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,360
potential flow.

1447
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,360
Lambda d mu is not necessarily

1448
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,360
divergence-free.

1449
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,360
As long as phi is good enough.

1450
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,360
If so,

1451
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,360
I will look at

1452
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,360
the vorticity two form.

1453
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,360
It's just lambda wedge d mu.

1454
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,360
Phi is not important.

1455
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,360
But

1456
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,360
it's like this.

1457
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,360
Any lambda mu

1458
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,360
can be solved

1459
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,360
by

1460
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,360
the fact that

1461
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,360
eta needs to be divergence-free.

1462
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,360
This is

1463
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,360
Helmholtz's

1464
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,360
decomposition theorem.

1465
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,360
Any

1466
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,360
three-dimensional field

1467
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,360
can be divided into

1468
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,360
divergence-free part and curl-free part.

1469
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,360
This is Helmholtz's decomposition theorem.

1470
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Is this the only part?

1471
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,360
No.

1472
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,360
It's not well-defined.

1473
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Potential flow is not well-defined.

1474
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,360
Phi can be any parameter.

1475
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,360
D phi is well-defined.

1476
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,360
The left part is well-defined.

1477
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,360
It's not well-defined or not well-defined.

1478
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,360
It can be represented by

1479
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,360
this equation.

1480
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Phi is not defined as

1481
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,360
d inverse of eta.

1482
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
It's not well-defined.

1483
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,360
I only consider

1484
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,360
the velocity field.

1485
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,360
It's the form of d of some function.

1486
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,360
Then we discuss how to

1487
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,360
describe the function.

1488
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,360
I want to have more potential.

1489
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,360
Three potentials.

1490
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,360
I deliberately put this form

1491
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,360
as curl-free.

1492
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,360
It's not

1493
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,360
orthogonal splitting.

1494
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,360
I don't claim this is

1495
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,360
a splitting.

1496
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,360
It's not unique splitting.

1497
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,360
It's not like this.

1498
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,360
You can also discuss

1499
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,360
what the gauge symmetry is.

1500
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,360
It can be short form lambda mu phi.

1501
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,360
It corresponds to the left side.

1502
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,360
There are a lot.

1503
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,360
It should be easy to see.

1504
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,360
Omega looks like this.

1505
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,360
It means

1506
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,360
you will see later

1507
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,360
it's the area form of

1508
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,360
lambda mu plane.

1509
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,360
It's like gradient mu.

1510
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,360
Gradient lambda cross gradient mu.

1511
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,360
It's a small area.

1512
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,360
If you want to use

1513
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,360
vector potential,

1514
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,360
can you use it?

1515
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,360
Yes.

1516
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,360
If you want to use

1517
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,360
vector potential,

1518
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,360
omega corresponds to

1519
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,360
magnetic field or curvature.

1520
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,360
I will use it later.

1521
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,360
Then

1522
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,360
So

1523
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,360
capstructure

1524
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,360
is described as

1525
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,360
three potentials.

1526
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,360
You can ask

1527
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,360
what the three potentials

1528
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,360
satisfy.

1529
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Then you will find

1530
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,360
those functions are purely reflected.

1531
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,360
Then phi

1532
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,360
lambda mu is purely reflected.

1533
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,360
Then phi

1534
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,360
is chosen at

1535
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360
each time point.

1536
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,360
Eta is divergence free and

1537
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,360
for all time.

1538
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,360
This is capstructure.

1539
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,360
But it's

1540
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,360
not that famous.

1541
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,360
Then

1542
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,360
There are still

1543
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,360
some works on it.

1544
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,360
For example, Marston

1545
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,360
found capstructure

1546
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,360
representation can make

1547
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,360
the fluid

1548
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,360
described as Hamiltonian system.

1549
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,360
Hamiltonian system is

1550
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,360
a generalized coordinate

1551
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,360
and the momentum corresponding to it.

1552
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,360
There will be a position and momentum

1553
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,360
relationship.

1554
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,360
But this is the infinite version.

1555
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,360
Because fluid has infinite freedom.

1556
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,360
Then

1557
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,360
lambda and mu

1558
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,360
correspond to

1559
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,360
position and momentum.

1560
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,360
Then

1561
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,360
there are some beautiful mathematical structures.

1562
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,360
However,

1563
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,360
people think it's too artificial.

1564
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,360
It's not practical.

1565
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,360
The main reason is

1566
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,360
there are a lot of fluid

1567
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,360
and a lot of momentum

1568
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,360
can't be written as lambda and mu plus phi.

1569
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,360
Then

1570
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,360
it doesn't mean

1571
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,360
it can't be...

1572
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,360
It doesn't mean

1573
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,360
some capstructure can be designed in a strange way.

1574
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,360
It is topologically

1575
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,360
separated.

1576
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,360
For example, if your eta is written as

1577
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,360
lambda and mu plus phi.

1578
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,360
Then there is a quantity called helicity.

1579
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,360
It is the

1580
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,360
velocity

1581
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,360
and velocity

1582
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,360
are integrated.

1583
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,360
Then

1584
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,360
its total points

1585
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,360
will be equal to

1586
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,360
the average

1587
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,360
of the vortex line in the fluid.

1588
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,360
It's like

1589
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,360
that

1590
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,360
if you have two vortex filaments

1591
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,360
and there is a linking,

1592
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,360
then the helicity is not linked.

1593
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,360
Then

1594
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,360
it can use points to describe.

1595
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,360
But if

1596
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,360
eta is written as lambda and mu plus phi,

1597
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
you can easily prove that

1598
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,360
its total helicity is linked.

1599
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,360
Then it will cause

1600
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,360
a lot of velocity

1601
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,360
that helicity can't be linked.

1602
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,360
It is topologically

1603
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,360
unable to be described

1604
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,360
as a capstructure.

1605
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,360
And if it is possible,

1606
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,360
it is difficult to find

1607
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,360
lambda and mu.

1608
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,360
And even if you find it, it is not unique.

1609
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,360
Just like what you just found.

1610
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,360
Does it have the same thing as trace-734?

1611
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,360
Yes.

1612
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,360
Trace-734.

1613
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,360
If it is a higher-dimensional fluid,

1614
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,360
for example, a 5D fluid,

1615
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,360
it has a slightly higher helicity.

1616
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,360
Yes.

1617
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,360
Does it have this effect?

1618
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,360
Yes.

1619
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,360
For example, a 2D fluid,

1620
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,360
no one will discuss its helicity.

1621
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,360
Then 3D, 5D, 7D,

1622
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,360
no, 4D fluid,

1623
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,360
you can still discuss

1624
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,360
its helicity in 3D.

1625
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,360
It will be purely a link

1626
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,360
with the fluid.

1627
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,360
It can be grouped into 3D.

1628
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,360
It is a 3D form.

1629
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,360
It is purely a link.

1630
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,360
Then if it is

1631
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,360
a 3D fluid,

1632
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,360
it is a closed space.

1633
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,360
It should be like this.

1634
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,360
Then a 5D fluid,

1635
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,360
it corresponds to trace-734.

1636
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,360
It depends on how high your helicity is,

1637
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,360
you can write a lot of

1638
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,360
concert content.

1639
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,360
With trace-734.

1640
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,360
Then because of these difficulties,

1641
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,360
some people want to write

1642
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,360
Clutch Representation.

1643
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,360
So they invented a thing called

1644
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,360
Multi-Component Clutch Variable.

1645
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,360
Lambda and mu,

1646
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,360
I made a lot of small ones,

1647
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,360
and then add them together,

1648
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,360
and then defi.

1649
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,360
Defi is the same as

1650
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,360
pressure projection.

1651
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,360
But this is actually

1652
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,360
a new insight.

1653
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,360
Because it is trivial.

1654
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,360
You can write it

1655
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,360
in 3D.

1656
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,360
Velocity 1 force

1657
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,360
is also very trivial.

1658
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,360
This is exactly Clutch Representation.

1659
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,360
Multi-Component Clutch Representation.

1660
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,360
So you don't have

1661
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,360
more new insights than Lagrangian.

1662
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,360
But there is

1663
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,360
an interesting paper in

1664
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,360
1980s.

1665
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,360
At that time,

1666
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,360
it used another

1667
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,360
new

1668
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,360
generalized Clutch Variable method.

1669
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,360
You put the lambda and mu,

1670
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,360
which is

1671
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,360
the key term.

1672
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,360
You put lambda and mu together

1673
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,360
as a map.

1674
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,360
It's from the floating domain to R2.

1675
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,360
Then omega equals

1676
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,360
lambda times mu,

1677
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,360
it means

1678
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,360
the area of the two-dimensional space

1679
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,360
is pulled back by the map.

1680
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,360
It means

1681
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,360
the variable is changed.

1682
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,360
You can think of it as

1683
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,360
you put the S,

1684
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,360
which is the lambda and mu

1685
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,360
together.

1686
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,360
R2 vector value

1687
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,360
function.

1688
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,360
From 3D to 2D.

1689
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,360
On the left,

1690
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,360
you can draw any 2D curve.

1691
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,360
Then you can discuss

1692
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,360
the vorticity flux on it.

1693
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,360
Its value is equal to the area

1694
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,360
on the right.

1695
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,360
How long did I spend?

1696
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,360
8 minutes.

1697
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,360
8 minutes.

1698
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,360
Oh.

1699
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,360
OK.

1700
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,360
This is a natural generalization.

1701
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,360
You can imagine that

1702
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,360
you put lambda and mu together.

1703
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,360
I don't think of it as R2.

1704
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,360
I can think of it as any two-dimensional manifold.

1705
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,360
There is a paper that

1706
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,360
I put it on the sphere.

1707
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,360
Then

1708
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,360
the vorticity can still be

1709
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,360
the area on the sphere

1710
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,360
from the pullback.

1711
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,360
You can't actually

1712
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,360
put lambda and mu together.

1713
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,360
You can only write it as a variable.

1714
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,360
Then

1715
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,360
you will find that

1716
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,360
the helicity is not the same.

1717
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,360
So you can find that

1718
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,360
most of the three-dimensional flux

1719
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,360
can be approximated.

1720
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,360
Yes.

1721
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,360
Yes.

1722
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,360
The dimension is not the same.

1723
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,360
This is a continuous map.

1724
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,360
SC continuous map.

1725
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,360
Then you can discuss its pullback.

1726
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,360
There is a tool form on the right.

1727
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,360
You can turn the pullback

1728
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,360
into a tool form.

1729
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,360
Then that tool form

1730
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,360
if you just put the area on the right

1731
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,360
from the pullback into

1732
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,360
vorticity,

1733
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,360
it is a

1734
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,360
it is a

1735
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,360
capture representation.

1736
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,360
Because the core of the capture representation

1737
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,360
is omega equals

1738
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,360
lambda which equals

1739
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,360
the area from the pullback

1740
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,360
into vorticity.

1741
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,360
Yes.

1742
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,360
I will say syntactic manifold.

1743
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,360
There is a

1744
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,360
non-degenerate tool form.

1745
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,360
Yes.

1746
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,360
Yes.

1747
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,360
Syntactic manifold value function.

1748
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,360
Then the induced

1749
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,360
non-degenerate version of

1750
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,360
syntactic structure

1751
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,360
is what Marston and others saw.

1752
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,360
Yes.

1753
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,360
So we think

1754
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,360
this approach is

1755
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,360
quite interesting.

1756
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,360
It turns the space on the right

1757
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,360
into a general manifold.

1758
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,360
So we find this route.

1759
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,360
But this

1760
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,360
is just a two-page paper.

1761
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,360
I didn't talk much about it.

1762
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,360
So we continue to develop this thing.

1763
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,360
But it only discusses vorticity.

1764
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,360
Velocity can also be

1765
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,360
generalized like this.

1766
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,360
Velocity is

1767
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,360
written as lambda

1768
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,360
dmu plus dv.

1769
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,360
You can also treat it as

1770
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,360
a map size.

1771
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Then

1772
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,360
it projects

1773
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,360
a one-form

1774
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,360
back to velocity.

1775
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,360
Just like the vorticity

1776
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,360
is a two-form.

1777
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,360
Its form is xdy plus dz.

1778
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,360
OK.

1779
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,360
You can imagine what it means.

1780
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,360
This is what Clebsch did.

1781
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,360
Before Clebsch, people

1782
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,360
only looked at the potential flow.

1783
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,360
Eta is equal to dv.

1784
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,360
You can treat it as

1785
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,360
pulling back the one-form dz.

1786
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,360
You can treat dz

1787
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,360
as a hyperplane field.

1788
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,360
This is a hyperplane field.

1789
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,360
It's all pointing in the same direction.

1790
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,360
A very trivial one-form.

1791
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,360
Then you pull it back like this.

1792
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,360
What Clebsch did

1793
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,360
is that he replaced

1794
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,360
this template field

1795
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,360
with a richer xdy plus dz

1796
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,360
form.

1797
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,360
What you see is that

1798
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,360
this hyperplane field is lower integrable.

1799
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,360
It's not just

1800
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,360
the tangent spaces

1801
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,360
of a family of surfaces.

1802
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,360
It's all separated like this.

1803
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,360
This is called contact geometry.

1804
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,360
Clebsch representation

1805
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,360
means that

1806
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,360
I have a size map,

1807
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,360
and I send it to this space.

1808
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,360
Then I pull these hyperplane fields back

1809
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,360
to become the velocity one-form

1810
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,360
To describe the flow,

1811
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,360
instead of saying

1812
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,360
how some one-forms change over time,

1813
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,360
he just said how this psi changes over time.

1814
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,360
Then this becomes a zero-form.

1815
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,360
So it's a little bit easier.

1816
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,360
In the case of Clebsch,

1817
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,360
remember lambda, mu, and phi.

1818
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,360
Actually, only lambda and mu determine the vorticity.

1819
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,360
So

1820
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,360
there's a natural projection

1821
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,360
to project z.

1822
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,360
Then

1823
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,360
you can say that

1824
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,360
the vorticity is just the first two parts.

1825
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,360
The pullback area is sent back.

1826
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,360
Then we call

1827
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,360
the psi velocity clebsch map.

1828
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,360
Then S is called

1829
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,360
vorticity clebsch map.

1830
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,360
The identity after the pullback

1831
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,360
is the velocity and vorticity.

1832
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,360
Then you will find that

1833
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,360
the right one

1834
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,360
is xdy plus dz

1835
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,360
and the bottom one

1836
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,360
is xdy plus dy.

1837
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,360
One is the area form,

1838
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,360
and the other is the form of Clebsch.

1839
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,360
The relationship between the two

1840
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,360
is actually quite important.

1841
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,360
It's very obvious.

1842
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,360
The result is

1843
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,360
that the relationship

1844
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,360
of theta

1845
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,360
is quite important.

1846
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,360
It's

1847
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,360
d theta equals pi star sigma.

1848
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,360
That is to say,

1849
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,360
these curves

1850
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,360
are just like a velocity field.

1851
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,360
A fixed velocity field.

1852
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,360
Then the curl

1853
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,360
corresponds to the vorticity

1854
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,360
in the template velocity field.

1855
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,360
The pullback is equal to

1856
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,360
the area form in the

1857
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,360
two-dimensional space below.

1858
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,360
Then

1859
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,360
this

1860
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,360
is to say

1861
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,360
the frame on the right

1862
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,360
plus the square on the left

1863
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,360
is called

1864
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,360
pre-quantum bundle

1865
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,360
in another field.

1866
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,360
I don't have much time,

1867
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,360
so I will

1868
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,360
try my best

1869
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,360
to

1870
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,360
not explain

1871
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,360
what each sentence means.

1872
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,360
I think it's not bad.

1873
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,360
It's not bad?

1874
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,360
Anyway, it's already like this.

1875
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,360
I just said

1876
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,360
that it can be any

1877
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,360
syntactic manifold.

1878
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,360
The two-dimensional space below me

1879
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,360
can also be a sphere,

1880
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,360
or a Riemann surface,

1881
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,360
or any syntactic manifold.

1882
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,360
Any two-dimensional space.

1883
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,360
Then

1884
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,360
there is actually

1885
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,360
a fiber bundle above it.

1886
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,360
I add one more.

1887
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,360
Each point below me

1888
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,360
grows a little bit of freedom.

1889
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,360
Then it becomes

1890
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,360
a three-dimensional space

1891
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,360
in the two-dimensional space below.

1892
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,360
There is an operator

1893
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,360
called projection.

1894
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,360
Go back to the two-dimensional space.

1895
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,360
There is a

1896
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,360
one-form

1897
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,360
in the three-dimensional space.

1898
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,360
It's like x, y, and z.

1899
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,360
But generally speaking,

1900
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,360
I can use any one-form

1901
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,360
as long as it meets the following conditions.

1902
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,360
Then

1903
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,360
there is

1904
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,360
a normalization.

1905
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,360
Then it will be

1906
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,360
a pre-quantum bundle.

1907
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,360
This word comes from geometric quantization.

1908
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,360
That is to say,

1909
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,360
there is a form that

1910
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,360
quantum mechanics

1911
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,360
generally

1912
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,360
quantizes from the classical system.

1913
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,360
We usually say

1914
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,360
to change momentum

1915
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,360
to space.

1916
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,360
There are some standard programs.

1917
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,360
But generally speaking,

1918
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,360
there is not only

1919
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,360
x and p in general space.

1920
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,360
There is only position and momentum.

1921
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,360
It is a general simplex manifold.

1922
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,360
How do you discuss it?

1923
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,360
Then the classical mechanics above

1924
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,360
how to change the quantum system.

1925
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,360
It actually lifts this thing here.

1926
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,360
There is more

1927
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,360
phase factor.

1928
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,360
Then the function above is called wave function.

1929
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,360
Then there is a

1930
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,360
The point is that you need

1931
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,360
the high star c.

1932
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,360
That c is a connection.

1933
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,360
Then you need

1934
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,360
the

1935
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,360
coverage of that connection

1936
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,360
to match the symplectic form

1937
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,360
of the manifold below.

1938
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,360
That is

1939
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,360
key for

1940
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,360
the Poisson equation.

1941
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,360
Poisson bracket will turn into

1942
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,360
b bracket.

1943
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,360
The original Hamiltonian equation

1944
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,360
will turn into

1945
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,360
that

1946
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,360
Poisson bracket equation.

1947
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,360
That has nothing to do with this.

1948
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,360
They will need

1949
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,360
a definition called pre-conform bundle.

1950
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,360
I just need the same definition here.

1951
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,360
So I call it pre-conform bundle.

1952
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,360
This is a one form.

1953
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,360
Then you can assume that it is the bundle above

1954
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,360
the connection.

1955
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,360
Connection means

1956
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,360
it defines

1957
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,360
the manifold below

1958
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,360
to another point.

1959
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,360
Then the position above the fiber

1960
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,360
is called parallel transport.

1961
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,360
Then you will see this hyperplane field.

1962
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,360
It means

1963
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,360
if it intersects

1964
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,360
this hyperplane, then it is parallel.

1965
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,360
If it intersects,

1966
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,360
it means that if I go around

1967
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,360
and then I do parallel transport,

1968
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,360
it may go to different heights.

1969
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,360
That is the definition of bugausable.

1970
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,360
If it intersects,

1971
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,360
there will be a gap.

1972
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,360
The size of the gap is

1973
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,360
how much

1974
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,360
is the distance

1975
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,360
inside.

1976
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,360
What is the library?

1977
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,360
What I mean is

1978
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,360
the phase.

1979
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,360
It is

1980
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,360
usually

1981
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,360
U1.

1982
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,360
Wave function is the definition

1983
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,360
for every x and p

1984
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,360
and every x and p.

1985
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,360
I define

1986
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,360
its

1987
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,360
amplitude.

1988
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,360
How many probabilities it has in that place.

1989
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,360
Plus a phase factor.

1990
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,360
I can have a quantum density,

1991
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,360
but I can only have an iterative IP.

1992
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,360
Then it can be parallel on this fiber.

1993
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,360
Then

1994
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,360
what is the difference between

1995
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,360
those two variables?

1996
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,360
That

1997
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,360
is

1998
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,360
another variable

1999
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,360
is the density.

2000
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,360
Because it is

2001
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,360
actually

2002
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,360
another number.

2003
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,360
But

2004
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,360
the bundle is a trivial bundle.

2005
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,360
It is just cross r.

2006
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,360
But this phase

2007
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,360
is complicated.

2008
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,360
Because it is cross s1.

2009
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,360
But in general, it may intersect.

2010
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,360
You have to write cross s1.

2011
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,360
So you have to write it in bundle language.

2012
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,360
So

2013
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,360
density is just

2014
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,360
a function

2015
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,360
of the manifold below.

2016
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,360
But if you want to talk about phase,

2017
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,360
it can't be well defined.

2018
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,360
You have to choose a gauge

2019
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,360
because this fiber

2020
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,360
is a compact.

2021
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,360
In quantum mechanics, it is usually compact.

2022
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,360
So how does it decide

2023
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,360
the fiber structure

2024
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,360
or the

2025
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,360
bundle structure?

2026
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,360
How do I

2027
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,360
choose sigma

2028
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,360
or q?

2029
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,360
How do you

2030
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,360
make a connection

2031
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,360
to the fiber

2032
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,360
of the bundle?

2033
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,360
I read

2034
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,360
Wikipedia.

2035
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,360
It only talks about

2036
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,360
U1 principle bundle

2037
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,360
over a syntactic manifold.

2038
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,360
I just generalize a little bit here.

2039
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,360
I just say that it is a one-dimensional fiber.

2040
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,360
So it can be

2041
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,360
not necessarily

2042
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,360
have U1 structure.

2043
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,360
I don't know why.

2044
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,360
What I mean is, even if you choose

2045
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,360
a manifold, I think your

2046
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,360
bundle will be free.

2047
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,360
Yes.

2048
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,360
I don't know how physicists

2049
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,360
usually choose this.

2050
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,360
When doing geometric composition,

2051
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,360
how to choose?

2052
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,360
How to choose?

2053
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,360
Sometimes

2054
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,360
there is a problem with the existence.

2055
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,360
But if there are many different structures,

2056
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,360
I don't know.

2057
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,360
As long as you have this pre-quantum structure,

2058
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,360
you can immediately discuss

2059
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,360
the velocity

2060
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,360
and vorticity

2061
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,360
capture map.

2062
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,360
That is, the domain of the fluid

2063
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,360
is the bundle above

2064
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,360
is called velocity capture map.

2065
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,360
It can be used to pull back

2066
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,360
the hyperplane field above

2067
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,360
which is the velocity.

2068
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,360
The area form or syntactic form

2069
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,360
is pulled back to the vorticity field.

2070
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,360
Like this.

2071
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,360
There is a very important

2072
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
combination.

2073
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,360
In fact,

2074
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,360
if my right

2075
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,360
syntactic manifold

2076
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,360
is only two-dimensional,

2077
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,360
and my fluid domain is only three-dimensional,

2078
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,360
there is an interesting phenomenon.

2079
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,360
If I draw an area on the right,

2080
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,360
its pre-image

2081
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,360
must be a vortex tube.

2082
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,360
The definition of a vortex tube is

2083
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,360
that it is a three-dimensional area,

2084
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,360
but the vorticity flux through

2085
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,360
its boundary is zero.

2086
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,360
In other words,

2087
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,360
the vortex line is like a flat tube.

2088
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,360
If you reduce these regions to a point,

2089
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,360
you will find that it is

2090
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,360
pre-image of point through S.

2091
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,360
It will be a vortex line.

2092
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,360
In application math,

2093
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,360
there is a well-known

2094
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,360
level set method.

2095
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,360
You can use a level set function

2096
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,360
to describe any

2097
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,360
combination shape.

2098
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,360
You can use an implicit function

2099
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,360
to describe it.

2100
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,360
S is like this implicit function.

2101
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,360
It is not mapped to R2,

2102
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,360
but to the general syntactic manifold.

2103
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,360
The geometry it describes

2104
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,360
is the vortex line.

2105
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,360
It is a very natural

2106
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,360
vortex line.

2107
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,360
It looks complicated,

2108
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,360
but if you have

2109
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,360
this geometric variable,

2110
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,360
it is a level set function.

2111
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,360
If you have this level set function,

2112
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,360
it is very easy to visualize

2113
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,360
these vortex structures.

2114
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,360
This motivates

2115
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,360
us to have a side project.

2116
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,360
Remember that

2117
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,360
if you want to have a level set

2118
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,360
interpretation,

2119
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,360
the syntactic manifold

2120
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,360
must have a side project.

2121
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,360
But if we choose R2,

2122
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,360
we know that there is no helicity,

2123
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,360
so it is too boring.

2124
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,360
We already know that S2

2125
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,360
is a two-page paper

2126
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,360
that describes general helicity.

2127
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,360
If the domain below is S2,

2128
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,360
you have to ask

2129
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,360
how to choose

2130
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,360
the helicity.

2131
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,360
We already know that there is a precondition bundle

2132
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,360
called half-vibration.

2133
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,360
The Q above is S3.

2134
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,360
S3 is the three-dimensional sphere

2135
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,360
in the four-dimensional space.

2136
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,360
The three-dimensional

2137
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,360
surface is also

2138
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,360
the three-dimensional.

2139
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,360
To understand the structure,

2140
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,360
the easiest way is to use

2141
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,360
the four-element.

2142
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,360
The four-element is

2143
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,360
a plus bi

2144
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,360
a plus bi is

2145
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,360
the negative number.

2146
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,360
You can add

2147
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,360
cj plus dk

2148
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,360
i, j, k are all negative numbers.

2149
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,360
There are three negative numbers in the space.

2150
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,360
Then

2151
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,360
satisfy some multiplication

2152
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,360
i square minus 1

2153
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,360
j square minus 1

2154
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,360
k square minus 1

2155
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,360
aj minus k

2156
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,360
polymatrix

2157
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,360
So you have four

2158
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,360
four-element helicity.

2159
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,360
The three-dimensional sphere

2160
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,360
is to satisfy the normalized.

2161
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,360
To satisfy the normalized,

2162
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,360
this is used

2163
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,360
to describe the three-dimensional rotation.

2164
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,360
When do I need to finish?

2165
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,360
I want to finish

2166
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,360
the second part.

2167
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,360
If you want to hear more,

2168
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,360
I will continue.

2169
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,360
OK.

2170
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,360
The three-dimensional rotation is like this.

2171
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,360
Any

2172
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,360
Q is a unit four-element.

2173
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,360
It describes the three-dimensional rotation

2174
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,360
like SU2.

2175
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,360
Because it is

2176
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,360
SU2 space.

2177
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,360
Its internal rotation

2178
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,360
is that any

2179
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,360
three-dimensional quantity to be rotated

2180
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,360
is written as

2181
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,360
the span of i, j, k.

2182
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,360
It is any point on the earth.

2183
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,360
It is written as

2184
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,360
a four-element helicity.

2185
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,360
If you put the left-hand side as Q

2186
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,360
and the right-hand side as Q

2187
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,360
as a unit four-element,

2188
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,360
the result is still a helicity.

2189
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,360
Still a three-dimensional helicity.

2190
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,360
So there is a R3 divided by R3.

2191
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,360
That is

2192
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,360
the three-dimensional rotation.

2193
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,360
If you put

2194
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,360
Q as a phase shift,

2195
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,360
which is the

2196
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,360
i, t,

2197
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,360
t is a number.

2198
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,360
You just multiply

2199
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,360
cosine something

2200
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,360
by i sine something.

2201
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,360
You will find that your rotation

2202
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,360
is just a rotation along

2203
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,360
the North Pole.

2204
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,360
That is, the North Pole

2205
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,360
is the invariant vector

2206
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,360
under this variation.

2207
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,360
The Q bar iQ

2208
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,360
is called

2209
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,360
pi of Q.

2210
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,360
pi is projection.

2211
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,360
The Q map of S3

2212
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,360
is the new location of the North Pole.

2213
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,360
This is the map of S3 to S2.

2214
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,360
This map is called

2215
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,360
half-map.

2216
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,360
From R3 to R2,

2217
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,360
the fiber direction

2218
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,360
is the projection.

2219
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,360
All are projected

2220
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,360
at the same point.

2221
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,360
The fiber

2222
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,360
is generated

2223
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,360
by the iQ of E2.

2224
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,360
The three-dimensional

2225
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,360
helicity looks abstract,

2226
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,360
but you can visualize it.

2227
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,360
You can use stereographic projections

2228
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,360
to project the three-dimensional helicity

2229
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,360
to R3.

2230
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,360
You can project the two-dimensional helicity

2231
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,360
to R2, which is the point projection.

2232
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,360
You can project S3 to R3.

2233
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,360
Almost everything on S3

2234
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,360
can be visualized

2235
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,360
as R3.

2236
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,360
It is a polyhedral variation,

2237
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,360
so you can see a lot of angles.

2238
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,360
This picture

2239
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,360
is...

2240
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,360
This picture

2241
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,360
is all...

2242
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,360
I put 1,000 fibers.

2243
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,360
The half-fiber

2244
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,360
I just mentioned

2245
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,360
looks like this.

2246
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,360
This is a fiber bundle.

2247
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,360
Each fiber

2248
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,360
is a

2249
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,360
circle of S1.

2250
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,360
It is mapped to a point on S2.

2251
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,360
The index set

2252
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,360
of these fibers

2253
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,360
is S2.

2254
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,360
It is the location of the point projection.

2255
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,360
The rest of the helicity

2256
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,360
is the rotation of the point projection.

2257
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,360
You can see that S3

2258
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,360
is this structure.

2259
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,360
Each fiber

2260
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,360
is generated by the IT of E2.

2261
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,360
Vertical direction

2262
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,360
is

2263
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,360
the action of multiplying I.

2264
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,360
If the IT of E2

2265
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,360
can go in this direction,

2266
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,360
then

2267
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,360
multiplying I by infinitesimally

2268
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,360
is going in this direction.

2269
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,360
Its helicity space

2270
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,360
is a one-form.

2271
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,360
We call it Theta.

2272
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,360
This is...

2273
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,360
You can think of it as...

2274
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,360
Because it is a helicity space,

2275
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,360
so

2276
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,360
the one-form of Theta

2277
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,360
is any infinitesimally motion

2278
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,360
projected to fiber direction.

2279
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,360
That is to say,

2280
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,360
multiply I by Q.

2281
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,360
This structure

2282
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,360
is generated at every point.

2283
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,360
Remember that the fibers are interlaced.

2284
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,360
So you can see that

2285
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,360
this is a no-wear integral.

2286
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,360
You can go through it.

2287
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,360
This is...

2288
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,360
You can open your personal camera.

2289
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,360
I printed out the 3D printer.

2290
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,360
You can see that it is a no-wear integral.

2291
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,360
This is the real...

2292
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,360
In S3,

2293
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,360
I drew a quaternion

2294
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,360
and stereographically projected it to R3.

2295
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,360
Then I printed it out

2296
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,360
with a 3D printer.

2297
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,360
So it became

2298
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,360
an S3 3D printer.

2299
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,360
A 4D printer.

2300
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,360
Actually, it satisfies

2301
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,360
a...

2302
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,360
This choice just satisfies

2303
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,360
the pre-quantum bundle.

2304
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,360
This is the pre-quantum structure.

2305
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,360
This thing

2306
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,360
can be visualized like this.

2307
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,360
In S3,

2308
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,360
in S3,

2309
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,360
in S3,

2310
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,360
there is a fiber direction.

2311
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,360
Just like in R3,

2312
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,360
there is a Z direction.

2313
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,360
Now it becomes a fiber direction in S3.

2314
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,360
So you can take that direction

2315
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,360
as the Z axis of the world,

2316
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,360
which is the direction of gravity.

2317
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,360
The vertical space is a platform.

2318
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,360
When you walk on that platform,

2319
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,360
you are standing still.

2320
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,360
The meaning of no-wear integral is

2321
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,360
if you want to...

2322
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,360
If you want to walk a circle,

2323
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,360
if you want to walk a circle back,

2324
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,360
you will find that you have to keep climbing up the stairs

2325
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,360
to get back to the red dot.

2326
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,360
This is the concept of

2327
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,360
the zeta and pi star zeta.

2328
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,360
In other words,

2329
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,360
the zeta is projected

2330
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,360
to the fiber direction.

2331
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,360
In other words,

2332
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,360
if you draw a circle,

2333
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,360
or if you draw a curve in S3,

2334
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,360
and then you take the zeta value,

2335
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,360
in other words,

2336
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,360
you will find that

2337
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,360
you are walking in that direction,

2338
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,360
but you are still in the fiber direction.

2339
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,360
So the physical force you produce

2340
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,360
is your total work,

2341
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,360
which is the work of climbing up the stairs.

2342
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,360
The zeta means

2343
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,360
if you walk a circle back,

2344
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,360
it is not equal to zero.

2345
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,360
If you walk to the red dot,

2346
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,360
you will find that your progress is not equal to zero.

2347
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,360
This is also

2348
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,360
produced in S3.

2349
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,360
So you will see

2350
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,360
this is the famous

2351
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,360
impossible stairs.

2352
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,360
Most people

2353
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,360
know that

2354
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,360
this is a visual illusion.

2355
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,360
But in R3,

2356
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,360
you have to use a visual illusion to understand.

2357
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,360
But in S3,

2358
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,360
everywhere is like this.

2359
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,360
Because the platforms in S3 are all low-end.

2360
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,360
So it must be like this.

2361
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,360
So you can

2362
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,360
put it in S3.

2363
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,360
Just now,

2364
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,360
there are a lot of abstract things.

2365
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,360
And we found that

2366
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,360
one of the good examples is

2367
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,360
half-vibration.

2368
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,360
So if we change the

2369
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,360
catch variable to S3

2370
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,360
to S2,

2371
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,360
the psi of catch

2372
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,360
corresponds to S,

2373
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,360
which happens to be

2374
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,360
the wave function

2375
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,360
in our Schrodinger equation.

2376
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,360
Then the

2377
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,360
velocity is pulled back.

2378
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,360
It happens to be the Madelung transform.

2379
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,360
In Madelung transform,

2380
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,360
we use C2 value wave function.

2381
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,360
You have a, b, c, d, i.

2382
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,360
You can expand it into four elements.

2383
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,360
Remember

2384
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,360
we normalized that

2385
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,360
because it is an incompressible case.

2386
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,360
So psi is

2387
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,360
an S3 value function.

2388
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,360
It is normalized.

2389
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,360
It is a quaternion or C2 vector.

2390
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,360
Notice that

2391
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,360
when we do phase shift,

2392
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,360
what is that?

2393
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,360
Oh, no.

2394
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,360
This is just a value.

2395
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,360
I want to expand

2396
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,360
a, b, i, c, d, i

2397
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,360
into a, b, i, c, j, d, k.

2398
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,360
There are many different ways.

2399
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,360
But I deliberately choose this way.

2400
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,360
It will cause my left layer

2401
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,360
is a complex scalar,

2402
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,360
and my right layer

2403
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,360
is a quaternion.

2404
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,360
Remember

2405
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,360
in Madelung transform,

2406
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,360
the momentum operator

2407
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,360
is evaluated.

2408
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,360
You will find that

2409
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,360
a quaternion is a deep sine.

2410
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,360
It is projected to the i-th direction.

2411
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,360
We can see

2412
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,360
that i-gradient

2413
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,360
is projected to

2414
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,360
the i-th direction.

2415
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,360
That is exactly

2416
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,360
what we did in C2.

2417
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,360
It is projected to the fiber direction.

2418
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,360
It is a pullback

2419
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,360
of the 1-form.

2420
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,360
The pullback of the 1-form

2421
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,360
is exactly the Clebsch representation.

2422
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,360
In S3,

2423
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,360
under the pre-quantum structure,

2424
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,360
the Clebsch variable

2425
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,360
is exactly

2426
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,360
the Madelung transform.

2427
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,360
Given velocity

2428
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,360
form,

2429
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,360
there is a vorticity

2430
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,360
Clebsch variable.

2431
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,360
The vorticity Clebsch variable

2432
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,360
is the sidebar i-th side.

2433
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,360
That is

2434
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,360
the block vector

2435
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:12,360
we learned in quantum mechanics.

2436
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,360
The block vector

2437
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,360
is the vorticity Clebsch map.

2438
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,360
Remember

2439
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,360
the vorticity Clebsch map has an amazing function.

2440
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,360
It is the level size function of the vortex line.

2441
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,360
If you have

2442
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,360
wave function,

2443
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,360
you can find the block vector.

2444
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,360
The block vector

2445
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,360
is the area drawn on the sphere.

2446
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,360
The pre-image is the vortex.

2447
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,360
Vortex

2448
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,360
Vortex2

2449
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,360
There is an interesting application.

2450
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,360
Given velocity field,

2451
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,360
you can find the wave function.

2452
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,360
You can visualize the vortex

2453
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,360
as an implicit function.

2454
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,360
I show some results here.

2455
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,360
This turns into

2456
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,360
a vortex detection

2457
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,360
application.

2458
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,360
Vortex detection is

2459
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,360
how to find

2460
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,360
where the vortex is

2461
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,360
in a velocity field.

2462
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,360
This is a

2463
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,360
flow data,

2464
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,360
a delta wing.

2465
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,360
You can see

2466
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,360
some vortex settings

2467
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,360
under

2468
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,360
the velocity field.

2469
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,360
You can

2470
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,360
calculate the vorticity

2471
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,360
and the threshold.

2472
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,360
You can see the vorticity is higher.

2473
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,360
Some more complicated

2474
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,360
methods are lambda2 method

2475
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,360
or cube criteria method.

2476
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,360
There are some heuristics.

2477
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,360
You can look at the local Jacobian

2478
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:46,360
and calculate the eigenvalue.

2479
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,360
Then you can determine

2480
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,360
where the vortex is.

2481
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,360
These methods are heuristic.

2482
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,360
These tubes are not vortex tubes.

2483
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,360
We developed

2484
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,360
a method to convert

2485
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,360
given velocity field

2486
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,360
into wave function.

2487
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,360
You can find the spin vector

2488
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,360
and

2489
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,360
the

2490
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,360
level set function

2491
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,360
for vortex tubes

2492
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,360
and vortex pipes.

2493
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,360
You can easily

2494
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,360
visualize

2495
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,360
the vortex structure.

2496
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,360
It can reveal

2497
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,360
much more information.

2498
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,360
These are the real vortex tubes

2499
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,360
and not heuristic.

2500
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,360
These are some operators.

2501
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,360
You can look at the eigenvalue

2502
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,360
and see if it is rotating or not.

2503
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,360
Most of the

2504
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:42,360
velocities can be approximated.

2505
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,360
For example,

2506
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,360
the vortex has a linking number

2507
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,360
which is 0.

2508
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,360
To solve this problem,

2509
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,360
we solve a

2510
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,360
image processing problem.

2511
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,360
It is a

2512
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,360
Ginsberg-Landau model.

2513
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,360
Usually,

2514
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,360
for image processing problems,

2515
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,360
I have some parameters

2516
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,360
that I want to match.

2517
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,360
My parameter is Psi.

2518
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,360
I want to find a Psi

2519
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,360
that

2520
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,360
is close enough

2521
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,360
to the

2522
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,360
given velocity field.

2523
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,360
This is called the fidelity term.

2524
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:22,360
There is a problem.

2525
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,360
As I mentioned,

2526
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,360
there is a

2527
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,360
redundant gauge symmetry.

2528
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,360
If

2529
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,360
my S

2530
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,360
is below the block vector,

2531
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,360
I post-compose

2532
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,360
an area-preserving differential coefficient.

2533
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,360
It is the same as

2534
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,360
the vortex.

2535
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:46,360
Vortex is a pull-back area.

2536
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,360
The right side is the

2537
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,360
mixed

2538
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,360
pull-back area.

2539
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,360
With this

2540
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,360
big redundant gauge

2541
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,360
symmetry,

2542
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,360
we still want to find

2543
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,360
a better one.

2544
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,360
So we add

2545
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,360
a symmetry breaking term.

2546
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,360
For example,

2547
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:10,360
I want to find

2548
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,360
the most smooth

2549
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,360
solution.

2550
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:16,360
With this solution,

2551
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,360
we get a better

2552
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,360
optimization problem.

2553
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:22,360
This is fidelity and regularization.

2554
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,360
This is usually

2555
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,360
the two terms in image processing.

2556
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,360
Fidelity and regularization.

2557
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,360
These two terms

2558
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,360
are the

2559
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,360
two directions

2560
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,360
of the

2561
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,360
re-quantum structure.

2562
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,360
If you have a deep Psi,

2563
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,360
the other direction

2564
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,360
is how fast

2565
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,360
you move

2566
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,360
in different fibers.

2567
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:50,360
The projection

2568
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,360
is how fast

2569
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,360
you move

2570
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,360
in the two-dimensional

2571
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,360
sphere.

2572
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,360
You will find that

2573
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,360
ds is the horizontal direction

2574
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:06,360
and the re-quantum direction is the speed direction.

2575
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,360
I want to see

2576
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,360
the fidelity term.

2577
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,360
You just need to change a gauge.

2578
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,360
I change d to

2579
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,360
d-i eta.

2580
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,360
As I mentioned earlier,

2581
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,360
the re-quantum connection

2582
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,360
is at the same speed.

2583
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,360
You can pick it up like this.

2584
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,360
After picking it up,

2585
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,360
this is my new covariant derivative.

2586
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,360
After picking it up,

2587
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,360
this nabla

2588
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,360
Psi is projected

2589
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,360
on the fiber direction.

2590
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,360
Then

2591
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,360
the horizontal direction

2592
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,360
is the original ds.

2593
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,360
What?

2594
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,360
It's non-zero.

2595
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,360
0 is the redundant gauge symmetry.

2596
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,360
That is to say,

2597
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,360
if I choose 0,

2598
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:02,360
the problem should be like this.

2599
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,360
I find a Psi that is closest to eta.

2600
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,360
It's 0.

2601
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,360
Oh, right.

2602
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:12,360
How do I choose eta?

2603
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,360
The way of optimization

2604
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,360
is that I choose eta at the beginning.

2605
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,360
Because the larger the selection,

2606
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,360
the easier it is to solve.

2607
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,360
The ds on the right is good.

2608
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:24,360
When I solve

2609
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,360
to the approximate solution,

2610
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:28,360
I reduce epsilon.

2611
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,360
At the end,

2612
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,360
when epsilon is almost 0,

2613
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,360
I trace

2614
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,360
to the suboptimal solution.

2615
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,360
When epsilon is 0,

2616
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,360
it will be traced to

2617
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,360
the minimized

2618
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,360
Psi star theta.

2619
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,360
The fidelity term

2620
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,360
will be minimized.

2621
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,360
And it's...

2622
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:52,360
Yes, it's...

2623
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,360
Is epsilon the size of a cat's tail?

2624
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,360
You can say that.

2625
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,360
You can see that

2626
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,360
there are two directions

2627
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,360
Yes.

2628
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,360
It's called a Bergers sphere.

2629
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,360
The metric of fiber

2630
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,360
and not fiber direction

2631
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,360
is anisotropic.

2632
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,360
The concept is

2633
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,360
used in Weibull's theorem

2634
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,360
to do collapse.

2635
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,360
S3 into S2.

2636
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,360
It happens to be used

2637
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,360
in different cases.

2638
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,360
So,

2639
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,360
according to the Pythagoras theorem,

2640
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,360
the square box above

2641
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,360
is just

2642
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,360
its...

2643
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,360
It's just

2644
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,360
the size of a knob.

2645
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,360
It's just anisotropic.

2646
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:42,360
As you mentioned.

2647
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,360
Visualize.

2648
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,360
Anisotropic norm

2649
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,360
is the same as the

2650
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,360
anisotropic theorem.

2651
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,360
It's called King-Splendor

2652
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,360
It's...

2653
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,360
Because it's a normalized

2654
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:04,360
psi.

2655
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,360
Directly energy.

2656
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:08,360
Deep psi

2657
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,360
norm squared.

2658
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,360
D is for covariability.

2659
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,360
It's like a magnetic field.

2660
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,360
At the bottom,

2661
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,360
some vortices appear.

2662
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,360
You can see it in the diagram.

2663
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:22,360
Then,

2664
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:24,360
those vortices are

2665
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,360
my visualized vortices.

2666
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:28,360
And,

2667
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,360
those are some particles.

2668
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,360
Then,

2669
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,360
this is what we learned in the

2670
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,360
survey.

2671
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,360
Is everyone okay?

2672
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,360
We also

2673
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,360
did some

2674
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,360
biological

2675
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,360
biotech calculations.

2676
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,360
We asked for some biotech data

2677
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:54,360
to help them

2678
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,360
with visualization.

2679
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,360
We found

2680
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,360
the velocity field

2681
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,360
near the bird.

2682
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,360
Convert it into wave function,

2683
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,360
set it as block vector,

2684
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:08,360
and pre-image of area.

2685
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:10,360
Visualization is better than

2686
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:12,360
using

2687
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,360
vorticity thresholding

2688
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,360
to get more data.

2689
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,360
This is my second part.

2690
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,360
I think

2691
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,360
we can stop here.

2692
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:24,360
I just want to show you

2693
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,360
some mathematical methods.

2694
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,360
Then,

2695
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,360
that's it.

2696
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,360
That's all.

2697
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,360
What?

2698
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,360
Did I finish my defense?

2699
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,360
All of them.

2700
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,360
I think there are

2701
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,360
some interesting things here.

2702
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,360
Coriolis force and

2703
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,360
quantum Hall effect.

2704
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,360
Quantum Hall effect is

2705
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,360
quantum mechanics

2706
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,360
plus magnetic field.

2707
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,360
Then,

2708
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,360
there will be

2709
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,360
Lorentz force

2710
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,360
and quantum Hall effect.

2711
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,360
Then,

2712
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,360
we put quantum mechanics

2713
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,360
into the

2714
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,360
power system.

2715
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,360
The Lorentz force

2716
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,360
in general is Coriolis force.

2717
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,360
So,

2718
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,360
I can simulate

2719
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,360
the fluid with Coriolis force.

2720
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,360
But my method

2721
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,360
is not to add

2722
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,360
Coriolis force.

2723
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,360
Instead, I solve the Schrodinger equation

2724
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,360
and add a magnetic field.

2725
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,360
The result is like this.

2726
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,360
You can see

2727
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,360
that it's all counterclockwise.

2728
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,360
Then,

2729
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,360
I didn't solve

2730
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,360
any fluid equation.

2731
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:42,360
I just solve the Schrodinger equation

2732
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,360
with magnetic field.

2733
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,360
Then,

2734
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,360
there are many open problems.

2735
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,360
This is just the beginning

2736
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,360
of a new framework.

2737
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,360
I didn't talk about

2738
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,360
whether I can get

2739
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,360
new insights

2740
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,360
from the open problems

2741
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,360
in the Euler equation.

2742
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,360
We can't make

2743
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:16,360
a big claim yet.

2744
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,360
But this is just the beginning.

2745
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,360
Then,

2746
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,360
I don't want to

2747
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,360
talk about Euler equation.

2748
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,360
I want to talk about general flow

2749
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,360
or conservation law.

2750
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:30,360
For example, traffic flow.

2751
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,360
Those are

2752
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,360
general flow.

2753
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,360
But it's not just

2754
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:38,360
a simple matter

2755
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,360
like quantum mechanics

2756
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:42,360
and a conservative field.

2757
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,360
There are some constants

2758
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:46,360
and some

2759
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:48,360
clebsch representations.

2760
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,360
Most of them are clebsch representations in MHD.

2761
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,360
We can talk about

2762
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,360
the quantum mechanics.

2763
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,360
That's all.

2764
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,360
If you have any questions,

2765
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,360
please feel free to ask.

2766
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,360
You should be able to hear me.

2767
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,360
Do you have any questions

2768
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,360
about image?

2769
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:20,360
What?

2770
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,360
About what?

2771
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,360
Image.

2772
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,360
I think so.

2773
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,360
But I think

2774
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,360
I need to know more

2775
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,360
about the problem.

2776
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,360
Then,

2777
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,360
I will do some benchmarking.

2778
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,360
Maybe climate simulation is better.

2779
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,360
The weather forecast.

2780
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,360
I think data-driven is better.

2781
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,360
I know that

2782
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,360
in the past,

2783
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,360
it's related to

2784
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,360
big companies.

2785
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,360
For example,

2786
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,360
when the stock price

2787
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,360
went up,

2788
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,360
the stock price

2789
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:06,360
will be affected.

2790
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,360
I've seen their

2791
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,360
state-of-the-art software.

2792
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,360
It's super hard.

2793
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,360
They are...

2794
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,360
I've seen some good...

2795
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,360
I mean...

2796
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:28,360
I mean...

2797
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:30,360
I've seen some

2798
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,360
crappy simulations.

2799
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,360
I've heard some talks

2800
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,360
that you can do it

2801
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,360
in the right way.

2802
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:40,360
Even though

2803
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,360
it's not a fluid,

2804
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,360
it's a conservation model.

2805
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:46,360
It's a simulation of a tsunami.

2806
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,360
It can match

2807
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,360
almost exactly.

2808
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,360
It's been around

2809
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,360
for a long time.

2810
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,360
But

2811
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,360
it's not a tsunami every day.

2812
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:00,360
So you need to verify.

2813
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,360
It matches

2814
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,360
with the Japanese tsunami.

2815
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:06,360
Is it a simulation of

2816
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,360
a tsunami?

2817
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,360
Non-linear.

2818
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:12,360
Because the tsunami's

2819
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,360
shadow water wave

2820
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,360
is a non-linear system.

2821
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,360
It's a simulation of a tsunami.

2822
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,360
Yes.

2823
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,360
From the physical model

2824
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,360
to the mathematical

2825
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,360
shadow water equation,

2826
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,360
there might be

2827
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,360
some errors.

2828
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,360
And the terrain

2829
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,360
is the input.

2830
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,360
In the end,

2831
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,360
the real time and height

2832
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,360
are the input.

2833
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:42,360
So I think

2834
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,360
as long as you...

2835
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,360
If you really want to

2836
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,360
make a prediction,

2837
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,360
you can do it well.

2838
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,360
I have a similar question.

2839
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,360
I've been thinking about applications.

2840
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,360
I've been thinking about

2841
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,360
TimeCube.

2842
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,360
Do you mean Gensperr?

2843
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,360
I've been thinking about it.

2844
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,360
I don't know

2845
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,360
if

2846
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,360
like Xiaoliu

2847
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,360
or DFT

2848
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:14,360
want to use

2849
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,360
First Person Coaching

2850
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,360
as a new material.

2851
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,360
Do you know what they are doing?

2852
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,360
I don't know.

2853
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,360
I want to

2854
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:28,360
compare

2855
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,360
what kind of terms

2856
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,360
they use.

2857
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,360
For example,

2858
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,360
I'll talk about

2859
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,360
the simplest Gensperr Landau model.

2860
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,360
It's not complicated.

2861
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,360
DFT.

2862
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,360
It's a Gensperr Landau model.

2863
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,360
Usually, you see

2864
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,360
where is it?

2865
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,360
I said this is Gensperr Landau.

2866
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,360
Usually,

2867
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,360
Gensperr Landau

2868
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:06,360
will say Psi

2869
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:08,360
is not sent to S3 map,

2870
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,360
but to D2 or R4 map.

2871
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,360
But it's not normalized.

2872
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,360
There's a non-linear image

2873
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,360
at the end.

2874
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,360
It means

2875
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:24,360
if Psi is not equal to E,

2876
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,360
it will want to go in the direction of E.

2877
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,360
It's a non-normal term.

2878
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:30,360
Of course, it's related to Psi norm.

2879
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,360
So it's a non-linear image.

2880
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,360
The image will also

2881
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:36,360
appear in

2882
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,360
the GP equation.

2883
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,360
It's a very popular GP equation.

2884
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,360
There are many non-linear

2885
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:44,360
Gensperr models.

2886
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,360
It's in the practical

2887
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:48,360
or electric field.

2888
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,360
Yes.

2889
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:52,360
If you want to model,

2890
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:54,360
it's very natural

2891
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,360
to fill in some symmetry.

2892
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,360
You can see

2893
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,360
the mathematical meaning of

2894
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:02,360
normalization term.

2895
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,360
You often see many models

2896
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,360
with multiple terms.

2897
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,360
Like 2, 4, 4, 4, 4.

2898
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,360
But this is a

2899
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:12,360
projection

2900
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:14,360
or constraint

2901
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:16,360
system.

2902
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:18,360
For example,

2903
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,360
the GP equation

2904
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,360
is an incompressible

2905
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,360
flow.

2906
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,360
So

2907
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,360
there's a different mathematical meaning.

2908
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:30,360
If it's going in that direction,

2909
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,360
I don't know if there's

2910
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,360
any new ideas.

2911
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,360
If there are no other questions,

2912
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,360
thank you again.
