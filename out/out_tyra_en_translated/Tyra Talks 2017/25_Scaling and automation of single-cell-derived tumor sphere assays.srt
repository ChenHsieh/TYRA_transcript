1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My PhD research is mainly in microfluidics for single-cell analysis.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the content of biology, I mainly focus on cancer research.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Because we generally believe that in cancer, the heterogeneity between cells is stronger.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
For example, when we treat cancer, there will always be some antibody cells that can be used for therapy.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So if we can use single-cell analysis to see the different characteristics of each cell,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and find those antibodies to lock them in for treatment,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we believe that it can improve the efficacy of the treatment.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My research is divided into two parts.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The first part is the phenotypic assay, which I will share with you today.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The second part is also what I'm doing now.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because I haven't published the paper yet, so I haven't put it up here yet.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But the whole direction is like what Jake just introduced.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As a sample preparation chip,

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
we can extract circulating tumor cells from the patient's blood.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We get gene expression information from the cancer cells in the blood.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This gene expression information can let us know

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
what kind of drugs we can use to treat these patients to get better results.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For now, to get this gene expression information,

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
we usually use the whole flow of chips.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
In other words, we need to use a knife.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's more invasive, and the cost will be higher.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Today, I will share with you the phenotypic assay.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In the technology development, I mainly focus on scaling and automation

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
in the high-throughput single-cell device sphere assays.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
First, I will tell you why we want to do this tumor sphere assay.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In fact, the purpose is to study these tumor-initiating cells.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
In this process, I will share with you

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
why we need to scale up this assay and automate this assay.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Next, I will tell you how I enable this thing.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then, I will use some experiments to show you the functions of my chip.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Finally, I will conclude my presentation today.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
OK.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, our motivation is to study these so-called cancer stem-like cells.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Our recent research shows that

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
there is a relatively small number of tumor-initiating cells.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They are called cancer stem cells.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Some people think the term cancer stem cells is too strong.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They prefer to call them cancer stem-like cells.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In fact, it is a biological mutation.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They are a group of antibodies

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
with some stem cell-specific cancer cells.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This tissue group has some characteristics.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The first one is that it has a relatively strong chemoresistance.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It will cause tumor relapse.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In this picture, you can see that this is a primitive tumor.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The yellow one is CSC, cancer stem cell.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The blue ones are normal cancer cells.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If we use traditional cancer treatment,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
these ordinary cells can be removed.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So, we can see that the tumor size is reduced in clinical trials.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But what we can't see is this cancer stem cell.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It has a way to stay quiescent

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and not be affected by the drug.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
After we stop giving drugs,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
the tumor relapse occurs.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, in the research scope of CSC,

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we hope to find cancer stem cell-specific therapy.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, I eliminated it for this CSC.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The rest of these normal CSC,

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
sorry, these normal cancer cells,

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
they don't have the ability to self-renew.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, they proliferate.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In the end, the tumor relapse occurs.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So, this is the first reason why we want to study CSC.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The second reason is that we generally believe that

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
CSC has a strong migration ability.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In other words, it is easier to metastasize to the secondary tumor.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We know that cancer transfer is the biggest challenge in cancer therapy

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and the biggest cause of death.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, if we can study CSC more,

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
it will be very helpful in therapy, tracking, and research.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The most traditional way to study CSC is to use surface membrane protein

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
or intracellular enzymatic markers.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
For gene expression or protein expression,

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
we use different methods, such as full cytometry,

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to separate these different types of cells.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then, we can study these CSC groups.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But the challenge is that

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
many of our new markers have not been discovered.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So, we hope to use other methods to study these CSC populations.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
As a substitute, cell behavior is a common choice.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We observe that CSC can survive in a suspension culture environment

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and grow into a single-cell-derived tumor sphere.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
In other words, if it is a normal cancer cell,

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
it cannot be adhered to the substrate environment.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It will produce apoptosis.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But CSC is different.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It can not only survive in a suspension environment,

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but also grow into a new tumor sphere.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, what is the traditional way to do the sphere assay?

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The method is to buy a whale plate,

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
as shown in the picture on the bottom right.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then, dilute the whale plate to a certain level of cell concentration.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The whale plate contains one cell.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
As you can see,

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the low-throughput is a distribution of the probability,

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
or more specifically,

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
96-whale plate contains 20-30 single-cells.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It is labor-intensive.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Someone may ask,

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
can I use automatic cell dispensing,

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
such as flow cytometry,

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to ensure that I can put a cell into a whale?

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
In fact, flow cytometry has a big problem.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because it is a flow-sorting process,

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
it will produce a lot of shear stress.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So, what is the impact of cell behavior assay on downstream?

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We need to observe if the cell is dead.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If the cell is dead,

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
it is not caused by the suspension environment.

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It is caused by the flow-sorting process.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The shear stress is too high,

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and the cell can not bear it.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So, the cell is dead,

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
not because it is not CSC.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
These are the existing technology limitations.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why do we think automation is important?

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
As we mentioned,

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
CSC is a relatively small sub-population.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In the past,

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
only 1-5% of tumor cells have this sphere formation tendency.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We hope this assay can start with a larger single-cell population.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
At least 1,000 single-cells.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Then we can have a reliable statistical power

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to make our assay conclusion.

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So, we think

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to achieve this throughput,

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
microfluidics is an ideal technology

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to make this assay.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, this is our chip schematics.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We want to develop a chip

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
with more than 1,000 single-cells.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because we have a very large throughput,

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
we also need an automatic image analysis.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Otherwise, we have to read it manually.

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It is a very difficult process.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Only in this way,

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
can we make the whole experiment

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
smoothly improve on hardware and software.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So, this is our motivation.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know if there is anything I didn't explain clearly.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Or you can go on.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Ok, let's continue.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I want to ask,

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
why CSC can survive in suspension culture environment?

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is a question.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Did you hear it?

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The question is,

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
why CSC can survive in suspension culture environment?

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is a very interesting question.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will answer it in two ways.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
First,

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the definition of CSC is

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
we only inject 10 cells into the mouse.

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Can these 10 cells

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
generate a new tumor on the mouse?

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If yes,

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we define it as CSC.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The predecessors defined CSC in this way.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then, they used this traditional conventional assay

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to find out

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the cell population of tumors

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
can survive in suspension culture environment.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is the first way to find it out.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why?

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Our idea is

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
CSC can survive in suspension culture environment

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
by moving through the local environment

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to the blood vessel.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The blood vessel is a suspension environment.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If these cells

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
die in the suspension environment,

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
they can't move to other places.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So, we believe

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
CSC can survive in the blood vessel

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and grow into a tumor in a new local environment.

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We simulate this in vivo environment.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is how we research CSC.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Firstly,

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
CSC was confirmed

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
through invisible experiment!

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why we developed this correlation experiment?

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It mimics the ways

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
how the muscle will survive in blood vessel

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and grow into a tumor in the new local environment!

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Does this answer your question?

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have a related question.

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When CSC is transferred in blood vessel,

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is it in the form of a single cell

191
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
or a sphere?

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is a very good question.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Most of the cells

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
are transferred in the form of a single cell.

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But in recent years,

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the research of circulating tumor cells

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
found that

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the real cause of the transfer

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
is the cluster.

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But the cluster is not a single cell

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that grows into a sphere

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and then transferred to other places.

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
People usually believe that

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
a small number of cells

205
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
fall from the original tumor

206
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and it can circulate.

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can imagine that

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
in a vast ocean,

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
is it a warship

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
or an aircraft carrier?

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
People think that

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the cluster is like an aircraft carrier.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It is very powerful

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and has a stronger metastasis ability.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But people think that

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the cluster fell from the original tumor

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and not a single cell

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
that grows into a sphere

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and then transferred.

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Does this answer your question?

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
OK.

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Are there any other questions?

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't think so.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can continue.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I want to ask a question about operation.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
For example,

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
if a worker

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
is holding a pipe and dripping,

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
can he get a single cell?

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Now,

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
what is the practical number?

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
For example, 10%? 20%?

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Or how many?

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The best theoretical limit

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is 20% to 30%.

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can think of it as

238
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
a cell suspension solution.

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's say I know

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that there are 10K cells

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
in this tube.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
How many of them are there?

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You can calculate

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
that there are one cell

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
per 100 or 10 microliters.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Microliters go one by one.

247
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The theoretical limit

248
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
of this operation model

249
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
is 20% to 30%.

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
In fact,

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the control of cell density

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
is not so ideal

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
when operating.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So it will be 20% to 30% worse

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
than the operating limit.

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It will be worse,

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
but it's almost the same, right?

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
For example,

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
is it 10% or what?

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Or is it less than 5%?

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If you have good skills,

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
it can be less than 5%.

263
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you don't have good skills,

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
it can be 5% or less.

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's basically difficult to do experiments.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So it's about 15% or so.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes,

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
so everyone usually...

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes,

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
so you want to see

271
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
if you have 96 well-planned,

272
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
you have Taipei almost 100 times,

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you have 15 cells,

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and you only have 1% to 5% single cell

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
that can grow into a sphere.

276
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That experiment is too difficult to do.

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes,

278
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
are there any other questions?

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't think so.

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You can continue.

281
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay,

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I will continue to present.

283
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So the first thing I want to discuss is

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
how we achieve single cell capture

285
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
in a high-throughput manner.

286
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The way we implement

287
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
is by microfluidics.

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The principle is quite simple.

289
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We capture single cells

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
by channel blocking.

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So you can imagine

292
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
this is a

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
microfluidics,

294
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
microwell or microchamber.

295
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is a capture site.

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The blue part is the channel,

297
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
where the water flows.

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The round part is the flowing cells.

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
When the cells come in,

300
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
they block to this place.

301
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So the flow basically stops.

302
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The next cell will go to the next place.

303
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So every well has only one cell.

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If we only have

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
10 or 20 chambers,

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
a simple design would be fine.

307
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But in this workbook,

308
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
we have to scale

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
up to tens of thousands of chambers.

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
At this time,

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
this simple duplication

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
will cause a big flow imbalance.

313
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In other words,

314
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
if the whole

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
flow cell comes in,

316
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
it will mostly be upstream or downstream.

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The capture rate

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
will be very, very low.

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
How do I make

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the cell uniformly distributed

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
on this

322
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
array?

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The method I use is

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
circuit modeling.

325
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
In fact, this whole microfluidics

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
is like a full circuit.

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Every channel

328
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
has a flow group.

329
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
This flow group

330
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
is dominated by the capture site.

331
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This flow group is the largest

332
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
because the size is the smallest.

333
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The entrance channel

334
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and the exit channel

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
are relatively small,

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but because they are long,

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the build-up resistance is also large.

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The build-up resistance

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
from 1 to 200

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
accumulates in each channel.

341
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
We just said that

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
simple duplication won't work.

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
If we want a good distribution,

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
every branch

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
has the same current.

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We know that

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
if the upper part

348
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
is short,

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the resistance here is small,

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the resistance here is also small,

351
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
this thing can happen.

352
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But if we put 200

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
negligible resistance here,

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
the performance of the current

355
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
will be much worse

356
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
than what we want.

357
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
How do we

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
balance the current?

359
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Flow resistance is actually

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
a function of channel geometry.

361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You can see

362
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
circular or rectangular

363
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
are different functions.

364
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In short, the longer the channel,

365
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
the higher the resistance.

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The wider the width,

367
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the smaller the resistance.

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So we use

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
microfabrication

370
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
to make the

371
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
opening

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
10 microns by 10 microns

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
in size.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
First,

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
this can achieve high flow resistance.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Second,

377
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
10 by 10 can block

378
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the cancer cell.

379
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We believe that

380
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the size of the cancer cell

381
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
is greater than 10 microns.

382
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I will explain this later.

383
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We have overcome

384
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the microwave flow resistance

385
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
we have defined here.

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What about the entrance channel

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and the NC channel?

388
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I use

389
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
microfabrication

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
to make a geometry

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
100 microns wide

392
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and 100 microns high.

393
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I can make the entrance channel

394
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and the NC channel

395
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
smaller than

396
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the cancer cells.

397
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
In short,

398
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
we use microfabrication

399
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
to control the flow resistance.

400
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So we have a good

401
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
flow circuit to achieve

402
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
single cell capture.

403
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This shows

404
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
three different sizes

405
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
of chips

406
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
from 800

407
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
to 12800

408
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
chamber chips.

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The size is shown

410
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
on the slide.

411
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is a

412
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
device mirror.

413
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Each chamber

414
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
can capture a single cell.

415
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
This is a microscope image.

416
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The cancer cell is labeled

417
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
as green fluorescent dye.

418
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The array

419
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
has a good single cell capture.

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Now we can

421
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
achieve high-throughput

422
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
single cell capture.

423
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
How do we analyze it?

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is a comic.

425
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I have

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
