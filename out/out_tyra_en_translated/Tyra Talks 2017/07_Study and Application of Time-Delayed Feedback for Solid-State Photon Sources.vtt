WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Wow, you should be able to see the screen now.

00:03.200 --> 00:05.000
I'm starting to record now.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
I can see it now.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.000
In 2011, I started, I worked on several projects before I joined Professor Citrin's lab in 2014.

00:41.000 --> 00:52.000
And mainly we have been focusing on two types of optics, two types of phenomena in optics.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Basically, nonlinear optics and quantum optics.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
So this is my talk is arranged.

01:02.000 --> 01:12.000
I'll first introduce my outline, why we care about this study and why we want to do this research.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Then I'm going to move on to two other setups.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
One is a semiconductor laser with feedback.

01:21.000 --> 01:31.000
And I'm going to introduce the setup and one of the applications that we have been working on last two years.

01:33.000 --> 01:45.000
The next I'm going to discuss a single photon emitters as we are now capable of generating one single photon at a time.

01:45.000 --> 01:54.000
And we're going to discuss when we place a single photon emitter in front of mirror with feedback, with time delay feedback,

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
but complex or maybe complex phenomena we are hoping to observe.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
So I'll just start with very, very basic discussions.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
So this is a most fundamental feedback system.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
It's very general use in maybe like mechanical engineering.

02:22.000 --> 02:31.000
When people study about the control theory, when they place a signal in front of anything,

02:31.000 --> 02:44.000
and then use the measurement result to feed it back into the system and see what's the phenomena they will observe.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Most of people want to control them.

02:47.000 --> 02:57.000
And this is a big deal in control theory when they try to study this dynamical systems.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
So here we see like very, I try to reduce the amount of equation that I have.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
So this is the most simple equations.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
This is equation of motions.

03:11.000 --> 03:21.000
So equation of motions, instead of just the original experimental parameters,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
there could be because we have feedback.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
So we'll have the delay time.

03:27.000 --> 03:38.000
We have the feedback strength or other things included in the study of the equation of motions.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
So this could be applying optics.

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
On these slides, I show two different setups for optics.

03:50.000 --> 04:10.000
One on the left is an integrated photonic circuit included inside this small optical electronic component.

04:11.000 --> 04:25.000
So basically they generate the photon within the wave intensity to generate random numbers.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
So I'll discuss this in more detail later.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
But it's a well-studied system.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
People can use it to generate entropies and or other entropy source.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
So the one on the right is a very similar setup.

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
If you imagine the semiconductor laser, a laser diode is now replaced with a single photon emitters.

04:52.000 --> 05:00.000
So if here anyone know about laser, you could imagine it's a cavity.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
And then you have a luminant source within the cavity and generate lights.

05:07.000 --> 05:17.000
And when the cavity has the same wavelength or they have the wavelength couples to this quantum dot.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Actually, this is a quantum dot in the system.

05:20.000 --> 05:32.000
They could able to generate very high, very pure and very identical indistinguishable photons once at a time.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
And we're now interested in placing this single photon emitter in front of a mirror.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
And study how we can, how we are able to control it.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And or maybe we cannot control it.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
And this will see very interesting dynamics.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
So this, so I began with the semiconductor with feedback.

06:01.000 --> 06:10.000
This is this system where typically we'll call this external cavity semiconductor laser.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
The system is shown on the right.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
We have a laser.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
We place it in front of the mirror.

06:20.000 --> 06:31.000
And we found a simple but I think quite clever way to control this feedback strength feeding back into the laser.

06:31.000 --> 06:41.000
And then we can measure the intensity using just a high speed photodiode.

06:41.000 --> 06:54.000
And while doing this, we're also measuring the voltage with the intensity.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So in here we see the external cavity length.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
So that's another critical parameters in our study.

07:05.000 --> 07:19.000
So that length, well, two times of this length divided by C is the delay time, which we'll discuss later in this slide in the presentations.

07:19.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay, so this is the theory describing the external cavity semiconductor laser.

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
Basically it's, well, obviously it's called, it's developed by Len and Kobayashi, these two guys.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
We basically describe the system with three parameters.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
We have electric field.

07:43.000 --> 07:51.000
We have optical phase when it's entering the, when the feedback light is entering semiconductors.

07:52.000 --> 08:02.000
And we have the carriers or carrier numbers, which related to voltage measurement as I described in the previous slides.

08:02.000 --> 08:18.000
So, in this system, there are, so we have, so basically with this model, we can, we have the three equations of motions.

08:19.000 --> 08:35.000
And typically when people study nonlinear dynamics, people will study the behavior near the equilibrium point or in near, well, yes.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
And in our case, it's called external cavity mode.

08:40.000 --> 09:00.000
Basically, when you set this three equations to zero, then you're able to solve a set of solutions that it's stable, or it's just equilibrium, it's equals to zero.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
So as I mentioned, we have the external cavity frequency.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
This is related to the delay time.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
And we have the relaxation oscillation frequency.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
That's some, that's related to the current, the drive current.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
And yes, we can move on.

09:30.000 --> 09:49.000
So, in the first step, one of the most interesting thing that we are looking for is looking for a bifurcation diagram bifurcation diagram is when we change one of the parameters.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
In the increasing or decreasing, we'll see the dynamics change according to these parameters.

09:55.000 --> 10:05.000
And the two parameters, two figures below, these are showing the intensity as a function of these parameters.

10:05.000 --> 10:20.000
These parameters could be the cup, the feedback strength, as I mentioned before, or you can change the external cavity length, or you can change the drive currents.

10:21.000 --> 10:29.000
And we see this bifurcation, you start very well, quite simple.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
This is we usually call this continuous wave.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
Basically, we have the laser, but it might increase or decrease the light a little bit.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Then we have a jump.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
Then we increase this to, we have this bifurcation branch.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
So this two branch, that's showing that there's two stable solutions.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
So in the intensity, we'll usually see periodic regions.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Basically, we have a sine wave.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
Then the next we'll have, we will enter two other branch.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
At this point, we'll usually see quasi-periodic.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
The next, we'll see chaotic intensity.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
Well, which is usually a big blur or very random thing.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
And that's how we use it for random number of generations.

11:38.000 --> 11:52.000
So as we discussed in the previous slides, we now have very well-studied models for a semiconductor laser.

11:52.000 --> 12:01.000
But as most of you must know that a laser is just a bunch of photons.

12:02.000 --> 12:12.000
Even though we can describe the model in very well in electric field and carrier numbers.

12:12.000 --> 12:23.000
But when we are generating a single photon at a time, we might see different behaviors.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
So changing from semiconductor lasers to a single photon emitters.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
That's the second part of my research.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
And the one I show on the right is a single photon emitters.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
We have a few layers of mirrors.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
They're called bright reflectors or just mirrors.

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
You have a quantum dot embedded in the center of this, of this pillar.

12:57.000 --> 13:07.000
And then, so we have the photons emitting or count very confined in three directions.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
And we can control the photon frequency a little bit, but not too much.

13:16.000 --> 13:28.000
We can control and how fast we want to excite or excite the quantum dot and get a very nice photon, a single photon.

13:31.000 --> 13:39.000
So I'll first start with some results I have for semiconductor lasers with feedback.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
I'll first describe the properties and then I'm going to discuss one.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
Only one of the applications that we have is called optoelectronic oscillators.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
So this is basically our experimental setup with the probe on the right.

14:03.000 --> 14:14.000
We can measure the voltage and the intensity at the same time, which is very, yeah, it's very interesting.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
But somehow it hasn't been studied in the last 10, 20 years.

14:22.000 --> 14:30.000
People usually focus on the intensity, not optical intensity, but not the carriers.

14:30.000 --> 14:37.000
So now with this, we'll be able to get voltage and intensity at the same time.

14:40.000 --> 14:48.000
So this is one of the first few bifurcation diagrams in experiments.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
The one I showed you before is theoretical bifurcation diagrams.

14:56.000 --> 15:05.000
So because we're only taking the AC signals, so there's not very change.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
There's not that much change in the in the vertical directions.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Only the oscillations are being observed here.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
So the parameters that we are changing is the feedback strength.

15:22.000 --> 15:30.000
As we can see, as we increase the feedback strength, we start from a laser, basically just a CW laser.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
And then we have a quasi-periodic regime and then we enter a periodic.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
Then the next we have chaotic signals.

15:43.000 --> 15:51.000
So we were also able to measure the optical spectra at the same time.

15:53.000 --> 16:04.000
We see that in the CW regions, there's only one optical frequency, meaning just the laser is very stable.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
You only have one frequency.

16:06.000 --> 16:19.000
The next we have quasi-periodic regimes, which more than one external cavity mode are being excited.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Then the next we enter the periodic regimes.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
When we see the period is separated by the relaxation oscillation frequency.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
The relaxation oscillation frequency, I probably haven't mentioned this.

16:35.000 --> 16:49.000
It's depending on the different semiconductor laser, depending on the laser diode and current that you're applying to.

16:49.000 --> 16:56.000
The last, when we increase the feedback strength, we enter a chaotic.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
Chaotic region when all of these external modes are being excited.

17:03.000 --> 17:17.000
Then in a later work, we'll have another slide showing other method when we characterize how chaotic it is.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
So I think I have...

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
So I have prepared a very short...

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Sorry, sorry.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Can you interrupt?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Okay.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
It's okay.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh, it's already running.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I think it's okay.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Is it?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I think it's okay.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I think it's okay.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I think it's okay.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Is it?

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
It's not very continuous, but I think it's okay.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Oh.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Okay.

18:06.000 --> 18:26.000
So basically, it's from what I just said, from CW to quasi-periodic to periodic, and then there are some different dynamical regimes.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Yeah.

18:28.000 --> 18:44.000
And this, the next one is, this is chaotic time series for both intensity and the voltage.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I think we have enough for this.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Okay, so can I ask a question?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Sure.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
So my question is actually for the previous, the prior slide.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
So in there, the previous one.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
So in there, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
So you have four, not really four, but four graphs, colorful graphs here.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
So the D, can you explain that a little bit?

19:09.000 --> 19:20.000
Because other three use amplitude for the Y, but this one, this D is for frequency, right?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
What does that mean?

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
Yes, so we have four graphs in here.

19:26.000 --> 19:38.000
So for part, for figure A and B, this figure A is the intensity, and figure B is for the voltage.

19:39.000 --> 19:55.000
So they have very similar behaviors, but some, because we have limited voltage resolutions, so some of the small features cannot be observed in the voltage.

19:55.000 --> 20:03.000
The C is just a zoom in of A.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
We've been from zero to 25%.

20:09.000 --> 20:25.000
So focusing on first half or first one third of the figure A, and we have, we also have the optical spectrum of the intensity at the same time.

20:25.000 --> 20:34.000
And yes, the four figures in the bottom are representing the optical frequency.

20:34.000 --> 20:49.000
So they are the optical frequency offset by the optical frequency of the laser.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Is that okay?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Sorry about that.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
So we have two amplitudes representing the intensity and the voltage.

21:02.000 --> 21:13.000
In C and D, we focus on the first half of the intensity and compare that to the optical frequency at the same time.

21:13.000 --> 21:32.000
So we have intensity changing, and also at the same time we can measure the optical frequency that's higher or below the, we usually call this CW frequency, but yeah.

21:32.000 --> 21:50.000
So, and also we see that this, there's a bright stripes that they are separate by the frequency of the relaxation oscillations, relaxation oscillation frequencies.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Hello.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Hello.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
Uh, I can, I can ask a question.

21:58.000 --> 22:06.000
Is this picture, is this the picture of the bifurcation when we solve the ODE?

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
Yes, yes, this is the bifurcation obtained in the experiment.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
Bifurcation, I remember because I learned it a long time ago.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
But I remember that there is a parameter that changes a little bit and then there is a completely different result.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Is that the thing?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
So what we have changed now is...

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
So what's changed in here?

22:33.000 --> 22:41.000
Uh, it's changed, it's feedback strength, which is how much you get back just by shooting.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Oh.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Oh.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
So it's, let me think about it, let me see if there's any of this, okay.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
Uh, can you see this electric field?

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Uh, is it E0 or Kappa?

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
There's a Kappa behind the electric field in the Copernicus model.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Oh.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
That's what we can actually change in the experiment.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Oh.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
We also changed a lot of things later on, but nothing else.

23:15.000 --> 23:23.000
This is the simplest, and I think it's the most controllable.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
Because you use that optical method, control is a very simple thing, right?

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Okay, okay, thank you.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
So basically, we control feedback strength.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
And we can see that the Bifurcation Diagram looks like this.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
This picture is...

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
Yeah, this picture took me a long time to make, because I'm very lazy.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It took me a long time to make it.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Anyway, okay.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
So next.

23:59.000 --> 24:07.000
So in this slide, I'm going to discuss only one of the applications of this system.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
So this is called an Optical Electronic Oscillator.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
This is typically used when we need to generate very high frequencies, but...

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Sorry.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
High frequency of RF signals.

24:23.000 --> 24:37.000
It's very difficult for us to use a quartz oscillator and use other multipliers to generate the same periodic frequencies.

24:37.000 --> 24:49.000
So on the top, this is for generating a periodic voltage signal, because we have direct access to the voltage now.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
We have very high...

24:51.000 --> 25:02.000
Well, we have pretty high quality factors, and then we can get the phase jitter less than...

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
I think 10 to the minus 4 microseconds.

25:07.000 --> 25:18.000
So the frequency now we're generating at this, it's almost 10 gigahertz.

25:18.000 --> 25:28.000
Okay, so the ones below, these are to generate chaotic signals.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
People usually ask, we usually want an RF signal, a periodic signal.

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
Why we care about chaotic waveform or chaotic signals?

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
So the answer is quite simple, actually.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
People are trying to use...

25:46.000 --> 25:57.000
In all the cryptographies, people use random number generations.

25:57.000 --> 26:07.000
But usually when we have the random number generations in electronic systems,

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
it's typically not a real random.

26:13.000 --> 26:21.000
There are still some type of trace that we can find, and usually they are much slower.

26:21.000 --> 26:32.000
So in here, we generate the chaotic signal, and then we can use it as a type of random number generations.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
There are other characterization methods for how randomness...

26:39.000 --> 26:46.000
What's the randomness or how chaotic we are for the signal.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
This is one of the results.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
So this is called largest Leopoldov exponent.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
As someone mentioned...

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

27:00.000 --> 27:12.000
As someone mentioned before, this is the separation when two signals at time equals zero and time equals sometimes.

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
And then the separation of these two signals in its state space.

27:20.000 --> 27:32.000
If this signal, the space or the distance they are separating is proportional to time,

27:32.000 --> 27:40.000
there is a very exponent, and you take the log, and then you can see if this is chaotic,

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
you will have a positive largest Leopoldov exponent.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
This is a very...

27:49.000 --> 28:01.000
One of the simple way, one of the well-studied way to study how chaotic a signal is.

28:01.000 --> 28:10.000
So next I'm going to discuss what happens if we place a single photon emitter with feedback.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
I think maybe Leo is here.

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
He also have few publications on feedback for waveguides.

28:22.000 --> 28:33.000
So for me, I'm just going to discuss feedbacks, a single photon feedback in optical regimes.

28:34.000 --> 28:41.000
I'll first discuss why feedback loop is important in quantum limits.

28:41.000 --> 28:49.000
As I showed before, this is basically how a feedback system looks like.

28:49.000 --> 28:58.000
There are two methods of feedback loops where we try to prepare quantum states.

28:58.000 --> 29:05.000
So the one in figure A, this is a measurement-based feedback loop.

29:05.000 --> 29:12.000
So you measure something, you want to prepare either 0 or 1, and then you measure it.

29:12.000 --> 29:24.000
And if it's not a target state, you just apply a Z gate or minus something times Z gate

29:24.000 --> 29:33.000
to feed it back into the quantum system and prepare the state as you wish.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
It has been done experimentally, shown in figure C.

29:39.000 --> 29:49.000
So this is just a feedback for, I think, single ions, I believe.

29:49.000 --> 29:56.000
So it's easy to prepare an ion within a cavity.

29:56.000 --> 30:05.000
So the other method, which I'm more interested in, or most people are more interested in,

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
is called coherent feedback.

30:09.000 --> 30:16.000
Without making the measurement, if we put a mirror in front of this photon source,

30:16.000 --> 30:23.000
we can actually prepare the quantum dot in one of the target states.

30:23.000 --> 30:31.000
So the important of this is, or the major difference is, with coherent feedback,

30:32.000 --> 30:39.000
we can actually prepare the dot in a superposition state.

30:39.000 --> 30:46.000
Unlike the measurement-based feedback, we can usually target in 0 or 1.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
I think not many people are.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Anyway, so again, we have

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
the equation of motions.

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
Feedback schemes are control schemes using time delay.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
So they are period-guess, type-feed control,

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
rhythmic control, and extended time-delay feedback.

31:18.000 --> 31:27.000
So here, the coherent feedback can be used as period-guess type control

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
to eliminate the unstable orbit.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Okay.

31:36.000 --> 31:46.000
So the advantage of period-guess type feedback is to provide, of course, feedback instantly.

31:47.000 --> 31:54.000
It can be applied in every regime to stabilize a system.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
It's non-invasive.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
And one of the best thing is, if the delay time,

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
which should be a controllable parameter,

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
the delay time, if it's matching the intrinsic orbital period,

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
it actually has a stabilizing effect.

32:12.000 --> 32:20.000
And the last is preserving the coherent state without making the measurement.

32:20.000 --> 32:28.000
This is probably one of the most important for quantum systems.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
So before we start on the study of feedback,

32:32.000 --> 32:40.000
I'm going to discuss a little bit, just introduce how a single emitter looks like.

32:40.000 --> 32:46.000
So this, the figure on the right, bottom right,

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
this is a single photon emitter that our collaborating,

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
that our collaborator manufactured in the laboratory.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Basically, it's three, five semiconductor materials

33:02.000 --> 33:08.000
with embedded quantum dot inside in the center.

33:08.000 --> 33:17.000
They have very clever way to etch out the parts that's outside of the regions.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
So all they left is very well-defined micropillars.

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
And they have the optical frequency matched to this frequency,

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
to the transition frequency of the quantum dots.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
And we have two other parameters,

33:40.000 --> 33:50.000
that's the coupling strength and the decay rate of the quantum dot.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
Basically, if the decay rate is too high,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
we call this a weak coupling regimes,

33:58.000 --> 34:06.000
that the photon emits,

34:06.000 --> 34:17.000
they emit the photon outside of the desired optical frequencies.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
So, okay.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
So for one single photon with feedback,

34:23.000 --> 34:32.000
we will have studied the behavior of a single photon feedback.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
So, on the right, we have three figures.

34:37.000 --> 34:43.000
The first is without the external cavity, without feedback.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
So that's emitting a single photon.

34:46.000 --> 34:57.000
The next, when we have certain condition match for the external cavity length,

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
or the delay time with the transition time,

35:01.000 --> 35:08.000
or the rapid frequency in the quantum dot,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
we can drive the system,

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
even though it's in weak coupling regimes,

35:17.000 --> 35:26.000
we can drive them in a very periodic way.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
So the one that I produce in the bottom is,

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
I use the same method to generate the same result,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
so I can compare with their result in the future.

35:39.000 --> 35:48.000
So we can generate very long periodic signals with feedback.

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
As I mentioned before, the way that,

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
so the figure on the left, this is classical.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
When we have the delay time,

36:03.000 --> 36:14.000
that is a multiple of the period,

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
intrinsic period of a system.

36:17.000 --> 36:23.000
When this system match to the frequency of the delay time,

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
they will have very high repetitions.

36:27.000 --> 36:34.000
Basically, the orbit is more or less stabilizing itself.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
So they have level one, two, three, four, five, something.

36:39.000 --> 36:50.000
That's the multiple of these two matching.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
The one on the right,

36:52.000 --> 36:58.000
this is, I use it for a quantum,

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
this is the same feedback in quantum regimes.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Basically, we have the similar process,

37:06.000 --> 37:14.000
but the decay or the repetition of two signals are decreasing

37:14.000 --> 37:23.000
much faster than periodic feedback.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
These are just a demonstration of how it looks like.

37:28.000 --> 37:43.000
We have the delay time at three different colors.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I don't know how to say this.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
The top in figure C,

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
we see that if the delay time is not multiple of this,

37:53.000 --> 38:01.000
the orbit is not very repetitive.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
As we increase the delay time,

38:03.000 --> 38:11.000
we see the orbit is trying to match to the intrinsic orbit.

38:11.000 --> 38:18.000
It's very, very repetitive.

38:18.000 --> 38:26.000
Yes, it's very repetitive as we change the delay time.

38:26.000 --> 38:32.000
Next, I'm going to discuss stability analysis.

38:32.000 --> 38:41.000
This is very common study to study any dynamical system,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
especially with feedback.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
When we have the feedback,

38:46.000 --> 38:56.000
we'll try to calculate if a system is stable or it's a repeller,

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
it's a stable, or it's a saddle point.

39:00.000 --> 39:07.000
The criteria or the typical method is first to find

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
the stationary state or equilibrium states

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
where all the equation of motions are being zero.

39:16.000 --> 39:22.000
The next is to find the Jacobian.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
Then to study the stability,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
we find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian.

39:30.000 --> 39:39.000
For a stable system,

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
the eigenvalue of the Jacobian will be the negative,

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
or the real part of is negative.

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
Repeller, we have a positive real part.

39:53.000 --> 39:59.000
The saddle point will have some of the eigenvalues being positive

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
and some of them being negative.

40:03.000 --> 40:11.000
Okay, so how do we study such system in a quantum system?

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
How do we study such dynamical behavior that we describe

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
usually in classical system, in a quantum system?

40:22.000 --> 40:31.000
First, it's simple because we already have the equation of motions.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
The one we have here,

40:34.000 --> 40:40.000
the phi is a superposition of three states.

40:40.000 --> 40:46.000
We have excited quantum dots being CE,

40:46.000 --> 40:55.000
and we have micro cavity photons being CG,

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
or I think I labeled CC here, sorry.

41:00.000 --> 41:07.000
We have a photon in the external cavity being CGK.

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
It's not that hard to,

41:13.000 --> 41:20.000
and then we have the Hamiltonian that describe these interactions.

41:20.000 --> 41:27.000
We can just apply this wave function to the Hamiltonian,

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
and then we can get, well, in Schrodinger's picture,

41:31.000 --> 41:37.000
and then we can get the equation three, well, equation of motions.

41:37.000 --> 41:47.000
Interestingly, because this G of KT is describing the coupling element

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
between each mode,

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
the population in, sorry, the population in the external cavity

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
is the superposition of infinite mode.

42:04.000 --> 42:11.000
This G of KT spans from negative infinity to positive infinity.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
Basically, it describes the coupling between the micro-pillar cavity

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
and the external cavity modes.

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
We think that we have only three equation of motions,

42:29.000 --> 42:37.000
but actually the third one is actually,

42:37.000 --> 42:44.000
it's like infinite dimension of equation of, sorry,

42:44.000 --> 42:52.000
of the modes that have very high dimensions.

42:52.000 --> 43:00.000
We see this in the denominators here, C of CK,

43:00.000 --> 43:10.000
and the summation of that going back into the micro-cavity.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
As I mentioned before, what's the steps that we have?

43:15.000 --> 43:20.000
First, we find the equilibrium point.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
Because we, so that's our showing here.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
If C of C, if the, oh, shit, sorry.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
If we design the initial conditions of CE, CG and CK

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
in this very specific ways,

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
we'll have them all being stationary.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
It's actually a stationary state,

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
and they have its own oscillating frequencies,

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
minus GT, minus GT,

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
and for this, for the state in the external cavity,

44:05.000 --> 44:14.000
each of them, they rotate along this K axis at different rate.

44:14.000 --> 44:22.000
But this is actually very easy to imagine if it's,

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
so, okay, sorry.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
So if you see the expression for C of CK,

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
for the stationary states, this is a sinc function.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
A sinc function is actually a Fourier transform

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
of a square function.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
So this is just a square,

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
a steady state in the external cavity length.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
It's have the same optical intensity

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
if you imagine in this way.

44:57.000 --> 45:03.000
So the next step is obviously try to find the Jacobian.

45:03.000 --> 45:09.000
For that, we apply small signal models.

45:10.000 --> 45:16.000
Again, this is a Jacobian of infinite dimensions.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
It's almost infinite dimensions.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Of course, in simulations,

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
I'll be able to only trace down a few of them.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
Well, many of them actually.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
So by applying a small signal models,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
we can find the Jacobians.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
With the Jacobians,

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
we'll be able to calculate the eigenvalues.

45:39.000 --> 45:44.000
Well, here we have make a small replacement

45:44.000 --> 45:52.000
by just letting us to calculate the eigenvalues more easily.

45:52.000 --> 46:00.000
The next step is actually to calculate the eigenvalues itself.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
So from the result that we have,

46:04.000 --> 46:10.000
we can write out the function of determinant of this Jacobian.

46:10.000 --> 46:16.000
Next, we can able to calculate the eigenvalues on the top.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
So there are three different case.

46:19.000 --> 46:28.000
The first case is we have the optical frequency of our photons.

46:28.000 --> 46:38.000
So if the external cavity length match to multiples of the wavelength of the photons,

46:38.000 --> 46:46.000
we'll have the Jacobian as a function of R,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
which I forgot to write here.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
R is you can imagine as a feedback rate.

46:53.000 --> 47:01.000
But R is actually the rate of decay,

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
of the decay rate over the coupling strength.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
So it's actually four gamma over G.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
Let me remind you and remind myself what's gamma and G is.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
So it's four, okay, sorry, four gamma over G.

47:19.000 --> 47:27.000
That's how we characterize a good or a bad cavity.

47:27.000 --> 47:35.000
So with that, we can plot all these eigenvalues.

47:35.000 --> 47:44.000
So the one on the, in case one, we have these conditions.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
We have, well, so they look very similar.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
But if you plot them in the same graph, they are different.

47:53.000 --> 48:04.000
So we can have, and this is the imaginary part of this Jacobian,

48:04.000 --> 48:12.000
of the J tilde, which is, we care about this because J,

48:12.000 --> 48:21.000
the eigenvalues of J tilde times C over L times the I,

48:21.000 --> 48:31.000
imaginary part, will have the real eigenvalues of the J delta.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
So, okay, so basically what I'm trying to say is,

48:36.000 --> 48:43.000
if we have eigenvalues in the,

48:43.000 --> 48:49.000
for imaginary tilde or pi, this value being positive,

48:49.000 --> 48:57.000
we'll have a stable system and vice versa, of course.

48:57.000 --> 49:08.000
The one on the bottom, this is the real part of the eigenvalues

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
and the imaginary part of the eigenvalues,

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
but plotted as different value of R,

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
different value of these R values.

49:22.000 --> 49:30.000
Again, when we have eigenvalues in the upper half,

49:30.000 --> 49:41.000
we have a stable and the ones in the bottom is unstable.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
What I'm trying to do here is to see if this is stable,

49:45.000 --> 49:52.000
then we're trying to see if this can work as a stabilizer.

49:52.000 --> 50:01.000
So if this has stabilizing effect for a state that's in superposition.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Sorry, I think I should mention here.

50:06.000 --> 50:14.000
As I briefly discussed in previous slides,

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
the coherent feedback are able to prepare the quantum states

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
in superposition states,

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
which is not accessible for measurement-based feedback loop.

50:27.000 --> 50:37.000
Okay, so this is typically how we draw,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
we call this black sphere,

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
but typically this is characterized how,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
what's the superposition of two states.

50:45.000 --> 50:54.000
If it's here on the black sphere,

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
it's well superposition states.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
And then, so we chose different initial conditions

51:03.000 --> 51:09.000
and we see that they are trying to stabilizing itself.

51:09.000 --> 51:15.000
Well, the red curve is help you,

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
just to help to guide the eyes.

51:18.000 --> 51:29.000
We see that this stabilizing or the rate that this probability is decaying

51:29.000 --> 51:36.000
match to the positive parts of the eigenvalues.

51:36.000 --> 51:43.000
So this values actually match perfectly with this decay rate.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
So we see that this,

51:46.000 --> 51:52.000
and we see this, we call this bit error.

51:52.000 --> 52:00.000
Usually we want half probability of a state,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
half probability for one state and half for the other.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
But most of the time when we cannot prepare them perfectly,

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
we have this bit error.

52:12.000 --> 52:20.000
In this study, I'm showing you that this bit error can be stabilized as time goes.

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
This bit error could be stabilized.

52:25.000 --> 52:33.000
And the next is to study the non-linearity of the excitation state

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
or Fock state.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Okay, anyway, it's called Fock state.

52:37.000 --> 52:45.000
Basically study how many photons are there in a quantum system.

52:45.000 --> 52:51.000
Because in here, I only study only one excited states.

52:51.000 --> 52:57.000
And the next step is obvious to study the different number of states.

52:57.000 --> 53:06.000
So at this point, I only have one single excitation and two excitation states.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
But good thing is we have the same Hamiltonians.

53:11.000 --> 53:21.000
So it is possible to write out the equation of motions as we did before

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
and to study the stability from there.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
But that hasn't been done.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
That's one of my future works.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
The other thing is if this stabilize the phase error,

53:37.000 --> 53:46.000
the phase error is demonstrated when all these initial states are aligned on the channel.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
And we see if the phase, so on the figure A,

53:51.000 --> 54:04.000
this is showing they start in equal probability, but they have different phase.

54:04.000 --> 54:11.000
What's the dynamics of this initial states?

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
We see that it doesn't look like it's stabilizing

54:15.000 --> 54:24.000
or it might have very slow stabilizing rate that's not shown here.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
Yes, so we reached the conclusions.

54:29.000 --> 54:35.000
I show two different types of optical feedbacks.

54:35.000 --> 54:42.000
First, I study the external cavity semiconductor lasers.

54:42.000 --> 54:49.000
And we show the voltage and the intensity bifurcations diagrams.

54:49.000 --> 54:54.000
We are able to demonstrate one of the applications.

54:54.000 --> 55:02.000
It's called optical electronic oscillators for generating periodic and chaotic waveform.

55:02.000 --> 55:08.000
And then we can plot the phase portrait as we change the feedback strength,

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
which also haven't been done before.

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
Then, yeah, I forgot to show the other slides.

55:17.000 --> 55:24.000
Then we move on to optical feedback in a single photon regimes.

55:24.000 --> 55:31.000
So we have very good results that match with other people's work.

55:32.000 --> 55:41.000
We're able to show a coherent feedback of a single photon in meters.

55:41.000 --> 55:59.000
We study the effect of external cavity length or the delay time as of the effect of the stabilizations.

55:59.000 --> 56:06.000
Next, we have studied nonlinearities for single photon emitters,

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
when we have maybe one or two photons at the same time.

56:11.000 --> 56:20.000
The next I show also show the stabilizing stability analysis for single excitation states.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
We can improve the theoretical models that we have,

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
mostly in the two excitation states,

56:29.000 --> 56:36.000
and see how we can get equilibrium states in that case.

56:36.000 --> 56:46.000
And we're looking to study the stability analysis for two excitation states.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
And we want to see possibly,

56:49.000 --> 56:56.000
well, we are hoping to see in two or more higher excitation numbers,

56:56.000 --> 57:02.000
are we going to transition to quantum chaos,

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
or maybe it's always stable.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Okay, thank you.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Yes, that's all.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
That's an hour and more.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Hi, everyone.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Thank you, Jianyuan.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Let me ask a question first.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Sorry, everyone.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Let me ask a question first.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
This question may be a bit...

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
Can you talk about the application of this?

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
Because I think when you're talking,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
you've been...

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Maybe I missed my feeling.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
You've been talking about how to stabilize it.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
But what does it do?

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Do you know what I mean?

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Yes, I do.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
What you want to ask is,

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
in quantum mechanics,

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
what are the benefits of stabilizing?

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Yes.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
What are the benefits of quantum mechanics?

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
The first one is,

58:07.000 --> 58:14.000
the way most people want to stabilize is this.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
The picture in the upper right corner.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
You can stabilize it,

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
but you may...

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
I'm not sure if you understand quantum mechanics.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
If you want to stabilize...

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
I don't understand.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I don't understand.

58:34.000 --> 58:39.000
You can only stabilize it in 0 or 1 state.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Hello?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Hello, I'm listening.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Okay.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
Usually, the state we need is called K-state.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
Or what is it called?

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
GHZ state.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
Anyway.

58:59.000 --> 59:05.000
Anyway, it wants to be in a superposition state.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
In quantum mechanics,

59:13.000 --> 59:19.000
a lot of things want to be in 0 or 1 superposition state.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
But if you use measurement-based,

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
you can't stabilize it.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
But now people say,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
let's use coherent feedback.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
But we don't know why coherent feedback can stabilize it.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
Or what kind of parameter does coherent feedback need to be in

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
for it to be stabilized.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
I understand.

59:42.000 --> 59:48.000
Our goal is to make it in 0 or 1 superposition state.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
This is 0 or 1 superposition state.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Yes.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
Okay, I understand.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Does anyone have any questions?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I also want to ask a low-level question.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Everyone...

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Do you have a low-level question?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
We need to stabilize it.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
But if I remember correctly...

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It's been a long time since I took this class,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
so I don't really remember.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
But if you use feedback,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
control theory should be...

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Hello?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Hello?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Am I still online?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Hello?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Can you hear me?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Use feedback to control theory.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Yes.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Feedback, control theory,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
and then correct.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Then get feedback and correct.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
But in quantum mechanics,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
the so-called state should be...

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You can get that state right away.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Is there a way to allow...

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
To correct, to keep correcting,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
to get the final state we want?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Because if it's in the calculation,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
when we want something in a certain state,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
shouldn't we want to get this state right away?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I know...

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I know a little bit about control theory.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But I know that in control theory,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
there are a lot of...

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I know...

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I know a little bit about control theory.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But I know that in control theory,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
it uses passive and active control.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I remember in passive control...

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
In fact,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
this should be considered

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
a kind of passive control.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
But because it's not...

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Because the point is,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
like I said,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
this coherent feedback,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
its advantage is...

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Active...

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
You may not know this.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
If this is active feedback,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
it measures how much...

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
It uses a PID loop.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It uses a PID loop.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Then add or subtract

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
how much you want

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
to make it

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
the state you want.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
But in quantum mechanics,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
basically,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
what it can use is...

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
What it can use is limited.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
So it's actually more...

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
The coherent feedback here

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
is more like

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
passive feedback.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
As long as you...

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
As long as you don't...

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You don't have this measurement process.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
You can't say you're measuring

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
positive 0.1 or negative 0.1

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
and then you feedback a negative 0.1 back.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Because the point is,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
if you do this measurement,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
it will affect

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
the type of superposition in it.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I think everyone

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
has heard of something like this.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
If you do a measurement,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
it will affect the state

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
of the type in it.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
So...

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
It's not a measurement,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
but there's feedback.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And then I hope I can

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
reach a stabilized method.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
This is what I've been

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
talking about in the second half.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I see.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Thank you.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I have a question.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Let me ask

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
the next question.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
If...

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
If you can

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
increase the

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
stability now,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
theoretically,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
can you calculate

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
the same...

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
the same...

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I can hear you.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
If...

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
If you can increase

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
the stability now,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
can you infer that

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
the same time,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
the calculation time,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
or whatever unit it is,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
how much certainty

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
can it increase?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Because I don't really understand

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
content information.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Increase the certainty.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Because you're now

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
between 0 and 1,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
right?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
In the past,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
you stabilized it at 0 and 1,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
so now it's a certainty.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Am I right?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
No,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
but here,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
it's...

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Yeah.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Let me think about

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
your question.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Right.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
But...

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Can you

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
repeat your question?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Sorry.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Maybe it's because I didn't

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
understand it correctly,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
but when I was talking

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
with other people,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
they said content information

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
has a nature

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
that you can't

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
calculate

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
exactly,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
but you can get

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
a certain chance.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Do you mean uncertainty?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Right.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
If I understand

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
what you said

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
correctly,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
this thing,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
they're talking about

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
how to measure

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
the final result.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Because you

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
measured 10 times,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and there are 7 times.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Let's say there are 7 times.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
If it's 1,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
you think it's...

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
You'll write it as

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
density matrix,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and you think it's 0.7.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But it's not true.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
This thing is called

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
quantum tomography.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
It's too detailed.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I don't know how to explain it.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Quantum tomography

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
uses maximum likelihood

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
method.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
In fact, it's not

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
a mathematical number.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Anyway, it has some methods

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
to measure

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
in quantum computation.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
It's a very difficult

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
problem.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But it's

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
different from what you asked.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
You have to ask

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
if its stabilization

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
can be reversed.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I think it can.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It's actually very easy.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
If you really

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
want to

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
realize it,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
you can...

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Let me think which picture

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
is better. This one.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You can measure...

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
You prepare a type,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and how long

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
do you measure?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
In fact, you just do a bunch of measurements

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
to see if it matches the service.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I think it can

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
reverse the type.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
In fact,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
it can verify

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
if what I do

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
is correct.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I hope it's correct.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
But

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
it depends on

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
whether someone can do it.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I think it can.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
OK. Thank you.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Hello.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Is this Yan Yong?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Who? Zhang Yong?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Zhang Yong is not here.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
OK.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Zhang Yong

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
just joined

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
and then disappeared.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I don't know what happened to him.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
OK. Ignore him.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
California.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
He hasn't woken up yet.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
California.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I tried to check

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
if California has woken up.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
California doesn't seem to have woken up.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's Taiwanese anyway.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Thank you.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Actually,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I just arrived in Taiwan

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
so I'm still awake.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I just returned to Taiwan today.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
What's your name?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Zhuang Ying.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
My name is Zhuang Biyue.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Biyue.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
OK. Where are you studying?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I'm in

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
DC, George Washington.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
George Washington University.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Which one?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
George Washington.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
George Washington.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
OK.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I happened to be there

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
a while ago.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
What are you studying?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Mechanical Engineering.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I've been watching a lot of

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
mechanical stuff lately.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I watched Control Theory

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
and I almost went crazy.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Control Theory

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
is a very important...

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Yeah.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
When I was

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
calculating the

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
controllability equation,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
and

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
studying those things,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I think Control Theory is really interesting.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Yeah.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I don't do control.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I do fluid mechanics.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So I did control

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
about 10 years ago.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I know.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I was thinking you should...

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Yeah.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I just found out

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
that Control Theory

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
has such a difficult problem.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
It's really interesting in math.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
But I just

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
heard that

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I was on

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Quantum Computing a while ago.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I remember he said

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
that now computers

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
are 1 and 0.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Quantum Computing

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
means that 70% is 0

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
and 31% is 1.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It's a superposition.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
That's right.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Is it like

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Quantum Computing at

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Keio University in Japan?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I don't think so.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I think it's from

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
a professor from

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
a university in the US.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So you mean

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
to stabilize

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
a set of states

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
that are 1 and 0

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
and 30% is 1.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I mean I want to

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
produce this state

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
accurately.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Is that what you mean?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
That's right.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
You're right.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Because it has a superposition

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
of what percentage is what.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
The first thing

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
in the feedback loop

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
is that if it's just

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
0 and 1,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
it's easy to do the feedback loop.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
But if you make it

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
50% is 0

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
and 50% is 1,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
there's nothing you can do.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Right?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
It's measurement-based.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
There's nothing you can do

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
if you measure it.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
So superposition

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
is a new way

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
to stabilize

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
this thing.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Stabilizing

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
quantum computing

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
requires a lot of

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
research.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Because

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I don't know if you

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
learned about error correction

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
in quantum computing?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
No, I just gave up after two weeks.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Okay.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Anyway, error correction

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
is a very difficult problem.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Because you can't

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
do both sides.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Because like

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
traditional computers,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
it's easy to do error correction.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
If you have a 1, you can

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
repeat it three times.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
If you pass it

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
at the end,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
if it becomes 101,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
you know the middle is wrong.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
But you can't do it like that.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Because you can't have

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
non-cloning theory.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
So you can't do

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
the copying.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So you need

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
quantum error correction.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It's a very big research.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
It has surface code,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
color code,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
super math.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Yeah.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I've seen some before.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I think it's super difficult.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yeah.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
But I haven't finished yet.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Error correction can only

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
correct

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
discrete errors.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
But here,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
what we need to do

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
is to correct

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
continuous errors.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It's not a difficult

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
thing to do.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So this thing can

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
do continuous stabilizing.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
This thing.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I can

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
continuously

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
stabilize it,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
instead of

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
doing something

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
to stabilize it.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Like this.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Like you said,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
quantum itself,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
if I remember correctly,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
can't be accurately measured.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
No matter how you do

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
this experiment today,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
you have to measure

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
to know what you get.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Or like quantum computing,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
the one who receives the signal

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
also needs to measure

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
to know what signal it receives.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
You have to measure

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
to know if it

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
receives the wrong signal.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Today, like you said,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
it's very difficult to measure.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Is there enough

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
technology

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
to apply

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
or is it still

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
lacking

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
in this area?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
If...

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Your question should be...

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
There are two parts.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
One is...

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Generally speaking,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
readout...

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
The result of readout

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
can be done.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
But if you use the result of readout

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
to reverse the state of superposition,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
this is very difficult.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
So I can say

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
that these two parts should be discussed separately.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Generally speaking,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
simply put,

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
readout is very simple.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I can't say that.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
It depends on your system.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
If you use superposition,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
or quantum dot,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
or ion trap,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
ion trap's readout is the simplest.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
The other two

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
are a bit more difficult.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But in fact,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
everyone knows

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
how to do it.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
But the result

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
you measure

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
is

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
0 and 1.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
But if you want

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
to calculate

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
the original state,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
you may have to do it

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
10 times,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and 7 times is 0.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But if 7 times is 0,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
you can't reverse it.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
The probability is 0.7

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
and 0.3.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Yes.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
This is...

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Because it is...

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And usually you don't measure

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
one by one.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
You don't just have a qubit.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Even if you have a qubit,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
it's not difficult.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
But you may need

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
thousands of qubits.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
You have to do the measurement

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
for each one.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
And you have to do it

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
enough times

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
to have enough confidence

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
that the result is right.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Then you have to

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
measure

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
the original state

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
100,000 times

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
or so.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Then you can reverse

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
the original state.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
This is very difficult.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And there will be some errors.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
OK.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
The error

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
is compared to the number of times

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
you have to measure.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Anyway.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
OK. Thank you.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Do you have any questions?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Do you have any questions?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
If you don't have any questions,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
let's give a round of applause.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Thank you.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Thank you.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Come on. Come on.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Come on, Taiwan.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
OK.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
That's it.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
You can leave the line.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
OK. Bye.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Thank you.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Nice to meet you.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Nice to meet you.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I'll post the video

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
in the blog.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Only the members can see it.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
If you have any questions,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
you can send them to me.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Or you can contact him directly.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Or you can leave a message.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
OK.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I'll check it out.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
If you want to add me

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
to my Facebook,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
it's not Jianyuan Chang.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
It's Kat Chang.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Or you can check

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
whether you can

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
tag me in the blog

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
or add me.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Yeah.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It's more convenient for everyone to contact.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
OK.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And...

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Sorry. I forgot.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Ping Yuan.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Bi Yuan.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Hello.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Hello.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
If you have any questions,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
we can discuss it.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
If you're interested in this,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I'll apply for a blog post.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I'm looking for a blog post

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
about quantum computing.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
If you have any questions,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
you can ask me.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
OK.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I'm doing...

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
It's not directly related,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
but I'm doing supercomputing.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
It's about supercomputing.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
So...

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It's really hard

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
to calculate the heat flow.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Yeah.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Basically, it's about money.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
In the future,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
quantum...

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Sorry.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
It's my wedding photo.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'll cover it.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
There's a big one called

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
quantum simulation.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I don't know if quantum simulation

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
can simulate

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
chemical molecules.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I don't know

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
if other systems

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
can simulate

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
it in the future.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Yeah.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
It's a big field.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
So...

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
OK.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
OK.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Talk to you later.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Bye.
