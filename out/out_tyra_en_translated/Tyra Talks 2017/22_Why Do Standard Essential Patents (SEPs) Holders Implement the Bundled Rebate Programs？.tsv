0	8000	Welcome to this week's Tera Talk. I'm your host, Yu-Wei Lin.
8000	11000	I'm pleased to welcome our speaker today, Louis.
11000	15000	He is currently a Ph.D. student at St. Louis University of Washington.
15000	21000	His main research projects include intellectual property rights, law, anti-Thorax law, and economic analysis.
21000	27000	Before he was a Ph.D. student, he was an intern at Winston & Stone, a law firm in Taiwan and abroad.
27000	34000	He also analyzed the legal process of Taiwan clients and non-authorized individuals in the U.S. and East Texas courts.
34000	37000	Louis is also passionate about entrepreneurship.
37000	42000	He is a member of the China Entrepreneurship and International Exchange Association.
42000	48000	He regularly holds conferences and talks in Taiwan to promote entrepreneurship.
48000	51000	Today's topic is based on his background in law and entrepreneurship.
51000	61000	Louis, please turn on your microphone.
61000	80000	Thank you, Yu-Wei, and thank you, Tera, for inviting me.
80000	104000	Last year, I also talked about copyright issues in my talk.
104000	107000	Today's topic is completely different.
108000	122000	This topic has a little to do with my graduate thesis, but it is not all of my graduate thesis.
122000	128000	Instead, I use different angles to analyze the case study of my graduate thesis.
128000	144000	As you can see on the screen, my graduate thesis is co-authored by a friend from Shanghai Fudan University's School of Management.
145000	167000	My thesis focuses on the use of bundling in the market.
167000	175000	The main details of my thesis will take about 30-40 minutes.
175000	184000	This topic has a background, so I will talk about it in detail.
184000	191000	I'm just curious about what kind of people are listening to my talk today.
215000	217000	I will talk about it in detail.
217000	223000	In fact, it is not so difficult to compare things in the Department of Sociology and Law.
223000	232000	Today, I will use some mathematical things, but I will not show you the whole process.
232000	234000	I don't think I need to show off.
234000	238000	I just want to show you what our results are.
238000	240000	I don't have much to say.
240000	245000	Some of the things I study need to be understood by everyone.
245000	255000	If some of you are interested in this industry or already know it very well, please add it if I am wrong.
255000	260000	What I want to talk about today is actually related to modern chip.
260000	264000	Modern chip is the so-called communication chip industry.
264000	269000	In fact, I found this Samsung Galaxy S4 on the Internet.
269000	274000	The structure of the picture is like this.
274000	277000	One of them is modern chip.
277000	279000	What are the benefits of modern chip?
279000	284000	The advantage is that after I installed this modern chip in my mobile phone today,
284000	295000	For example, as we all know, the communication standards of 2G, 3G, and 4G will not have the so-called problems that cannot be used in different countries.
295000	301000	Just imagine that if you buy an iPhone today, whether it is iPhone 4, iPhone 5, or iPhone 6,
301000	308000	The result may be that your communication standards are different today, or your communication bandwidth is different.
309000	314000	In fact, this is very blind.
314000	320000	How to solve this difference in bandwidth or communication standards?
320000	323000	Modern chip plays a very important role.
323000	326000	Another example is that everyone is in the United States.
326000	331000	I assume that everyone is in the United States.
331000	341000	For example, if you run to some remote places with your mobile phone, it is not 4G that covers the range, but 3G or even 2G.
341000	347000	But you can still make calls and you can still go online.
347000	349000	It's just that it's very slow.
349000	351000	How is this function done?
351000	353000	In fact, this is the function of modern chip.
353000	359000	It can still operate under different standards and under different levels.
359000	361000	However, its operating function is limited.
361000	363000	This is the function of modern chip.
363000	372000	It can be seen that a mobile phone has a lot of functionality.
372000	378000	But the value of a smart phone is to be online.
378000	382000	Modern chip plays a very important role.
383000	389000	What I want to discuss today is a small communication chip problem.
389000	394000	Let's take a look at the situation of this industry.
394000	399000	This is a total of 1.2 years.
399000	405000	From 2007 to 2012, there were several leading companies in the modern chip industry.
405000	415000	We can probably see that Qualcomm has been playing a leading role in this field.
415000	423000	Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2007 to the 4G in 2012.
423000	427000	Later, I will show the state of the 5G patent layout.
427000	431000	Qualcomm has been playing a leading role.
431000	445000	Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2012 to the 5G in 2012.
445000	448000	This is the current state of the industry.
448000	463000	From 2012 to now, we can see that the green part of the patent is high-speed communication.
463000	476000	In fact, it occupies a very high position in the patent layout of modern chip, including radio front, modulation, and core networking.
476000	482000	From these pictures, we can see the current state of the industry.
482000	490000	For example, InterDigital and BlackBerry have all disappeared.
490000	493000	These are all in the past.
493000	496000	The former dragon head is no longer in use.
496000	500000	You can see that there is a lot of communication in the green part.
500000	506000	The gray part is Intel, which we will discuss today.
506000	515000	In fact, it is not as good as Qualcomm in terms of patent layout, especially 5G.
515000	526000	So we can simply summarize that Qualcomm is almost in monopoly in the modern chip industry.
526000	536000	Because most of the chips are in the patent layout of most of the modern chip sales, and the quality of its products is maintained.
536000	539000	So the state of its maintenance is very good.
539000	560000	Most of the big manufacturers, including Apple users, mostly use Qualcomm's modern chip for their important suppliers from iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, and iPhone 7.
561000	574000	But the problem is that these so-called communication standards, which I just mentioned, such as 2G, 3G, and 4G standards.
574000	584000	In fact, these standards have a lot of patent layout behind them, and the negotiation process of each party.
584000	591000	You always have to decide which standard to use. It must be of good quality and easy to promote. I think everyone can understand this.
591000	598000	In fact, there are these international standard organizations behind the standard promotion.
598000	604000	So back to the picture just now, let's come here first.
604000	611000	I think this picture is very important in the background of my law school.
611000	618000	Why is it important? Because it explains the relationship between people of different levels.
618000	629000	Because on my left is IEEE, ITU, and ETSI. These three are very important technical standards organizations that designate 4G and even 5G.
629000	637000	These technical standards organizations play a role in promoting technical standards.
638000	651000	The core concept is that I want my 4G standard or 5G standard in the future to be able to be used by many people.
651000	657000	It's not that I only let a group of people use it. A small group of people using it is not a standard.
657000	665000	So it must be that everyone can recognize this thing. Yes, it's good, it's easy to use, and it's efficient.
665000	670000	The standard of 5G and 4G can be slowly promoted because the industry recognizes it.
670000	677000	But behind it, as I said before, it involves a lot of different patent layouts.
677000	682000	Because it is impossible for a company to have all the patents of technical standards.
682000	692000	It must be segmented. It must be cut into many segments. Some companies specialize in that.
692000	703000	For example, now everyone sees Radio Front End. Although the patents of Ericsson and Qualcomm are similar, it also means that there are many things that Qualcomm can't do.
704000	711000	So today I want to talk to you about this kind of industry.
711000	718000	Such patents are called SEP.
718000	727000	SEP stands for Standard Essential Patents.
727000	742000	Those who have SEPs, such as the manufacturers I mentioned earlier, including Ericsson, Qualcomm, and Intel, are considered SEPs.
742000	753000	Everyone will think that if everyone in the world uses this standard, then he can raise the price.
753000	757000	Because people all over the world use it, then I'm not turning over.
757000	763000	In order to prevent this from happening, it should be said that preventing it from turning over is one point.
764000	768000	Another point is that it can take advantage of the position of patents in the market.
768000	774000	Because patents are a kind of legal monopoly, everyone can understand it this way.
774000	777000	Most people may not study law.
777000	783000	If you ask me how to understand patents, the way to understand it is very simple.
783000	792000	A patent is a legal right for you to have this kind of monopoly.
792000	799000	It allows you to have the right to monopolize within a period of time for your technology and patent.
799000	802000	So it is a limited monopoly.
802000	814000	After these people have patents, if these patents or technologies are used as standards, then they can raise their prices indefinitely.
814000	822000	Isn't that against the purpose of these technical standards organizations that I just mentioned?
822000	825000	Because the price is too high, no one can use it.
825000	828000	If I want to pay so much, who will think about my rights?
828000	841000	So, in this atmosphere, in this concept, all technical standards organizations in the process of setting standards,
841000	854000	remember that this structural organization requires all SEPs to provide an LOA.
854000	860000	LOA is the condition that you have to accept the conditions provided by the technical standards organization.
860000	867000	For example, you want to become a 3G standard, or a 4G standard, or a 5G standard in the future.
867000	871000	But your patent price must be within a certain range.
871000	874000	But we call this range of conditions FRIEND.
874000	878000	Let me stop for a moment.
878000	881000	Because I really can't see everyone's conversation.
881000	884000	Does anyone have any questions now?
884000	887000	Let's take a look.
887000	890000	It seems that no one has asked me a question.
890000	893000	If you have any questions, you can ask me at any time, it doesn't matter.
893000	896000	If there are no questions, I will continue to talk.
896000	902000	Because I found that there is no social science background, I have to speak particularly slowly.
903000	913000	The full name of FRIEND is Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory Licensing.
913000	921000	FRAND is included in the conditions provided by all technical standards organizations.
921000	924000	This condition actually includes a lot.
924000	926000	If you are interested, you can check it.
926000	933000	One of the most important conditions is that your patent must be used as a standard.
933000	937000	Your technology must become my 5G standard.
937000	943000	You submit your patent application.
943000	947000	But you must accept the restrictions of FRAND.
947000	952000	Because, as I said, you can't raise the price too high.
952000	955000	If the price is too high, no one will use it.
955000	958000	Another point is the following box.
958000	960000	The following box is the implementer.
960000	966000	What I mean by implementer is, for example, our great HTC.
966000	970000	HTC may have some patents, but it is not a player.
970000	976000	HTC is not the patent holders we saw in the picture just now.
977000	985000	It's just that I'm an authorized person, and I use the technical standards they have, and I use the technology.
985000	987000	We call it implementer.
987000	990000	It is not a person who develops modern chips.
990000	992000	Simply put, HTC is also.
992000	993000	Apple is also.
993000	1000000	Of course, if you are concerned about this industry, Apple has already released a message that it wants to step in.
1000000	1002000	It also wants to make its own chips.
1002000	1004000	If you are interested in this in the future, you can talk to me.
1004000	1006000	It's a matter of whether you can do it or not.
1006000	1009000	There are still some entry barriers.
1009000	1018000	Back here, you have to accept that you have to become a technical standard.
1018000	1019000	You have to accept FRAND.
1019000	1027000	Second, the condition of FRAND will not be limited to the relationship between you and the technical standard organization.
1028000	1031000	It will have a third-party interest.
1031000	1034000	We call it a third-party interest contract.
1034000	1046000	This third-party interest contract means that after I make these terms with the technical standard organization today, the efficiency of these terms will affect the third person.
1046000	1053000	The meaning of the third person is that it includes HTC, because it is not an owner of SEP.
1054000	1058000	It is not an owner of SEP, but its efficiency will affect the third person.
1058000	1063000	So everyone can enjoy the benefits of FRAND.
1063000	1068000	In other words, the third party, for example, HTC, I also have to use these technical standard organizations.
1068000	1071000	These 3G, 4G, or 5G patents.
1071000	1078000	You can't because I'm not in this technical standard organization, or I'm not part of this technical standard organization.
1079000	1084000	So these SEP owners raise my price very high.
1084000	1103000	Basically, these SEP owners join the technical standard organization and submit their patents to the technical standard organization as a prerequisite for 5G standards.
1103000	1105000	The problem is that you have to accept these two conditions.
1105000	1111000	The first is that the price of your patent must be within a reasonable range.
1111000	1115000	The second is that it will affect the third party.
1115000	1123000	As long as everyone wants to use this technical standard, everyone can enjoy the benefits of FRAND.
1123000	1130000	Instead of saying that because you are in a technical standard organization, I will give you a discount, and no one else will.
1130000	1132000	But here I make a signal.
1132000	1137000	That is, my research is in this area.
1137000	1141000	The source of all the problems is here.
1141000	1146000	Because there will be so-called market monopoly problems.
1146000	1147000	Why?
1147000	1153000	Think about it, who are the members of all the technical standard organizations?
1153000	1156000	Isn't it the so-called industry leaders?
1156000	1158000	Because who sets the technical standards?
1158000	1160000	It must be the industry leaders, right?
1160000	1164000	Among these industry leaders, if everyone gathers together to have a meeting.
1164000	1167000	But Taiwanese people may not know much about this law.
1167000	1172000	It seems that many manufacturers sit in line together to eat and discuss things.
1172000	1174000	It seems very simple, there is no legal problem.
1174000	1177000	I tell you, the problem is here.
1177000	1187000	The problem is that the U.S. Anti-Trust Law and the so-called EU Competition Law strictly prohibit this matter.
1187000	1192000	Because this prohibition is actually the so-called joint pricing behavior.
1192000	1200000	Because the U.S. has a lot of different review standards in the so-called Anti-Trust Law.
1200000	1205000	In fact, the most taboo thing is like the joint pricing I just said.
1205000	1210000	A bunch of competitors in the same industry.
1210000	1213000	For example, we just said that Ericsson also has a patent.
1213000	1217000	It is also in the ETSI, ITU, and IEE.
1217000	1219000	Qualcomm is also a member.
1219000	1223000	Because everyone submits their patents and then joins their members.
1223000	1228000	So this group of people are all competitors in the same industry.
1228000	1230000	All set standards here.
1230000	1236000	Of course, as a government role, the government will be very worried about this matter.
1236000	1238000	Are you guys doing it?
1238000	1240000	Why? Think from another perspective.
1240000	1243000	Friend is what we just talked about.
1243000	1246000	The problem with Friend is that I promised you today.
1246000	1250000	I promised you to set the price of Friend.
1250000	1256000	But this is a requirement for all SEP holders.
1256000	1260000	And this technical standard organization is afraid.
1260000	1268000	For example, if I ask for 5%, I ask for the price of Friend.
1268000	1272000	It is called 5% of each product sale.
1272000	1273000	5% may be too high.
1273000	1275000	1% is called Friend.
1276000	1277000	Think about it.
1277000	1280000	If this is the case.
1280000	1283000	What is the price of Friend?
1283000	1286000	What is the price of reasonable and non-discriminatory?
1286000	1289000	All people can only charge 1%.
1289000	1293000	In fact, from the perspective of the government, you will find it strange.
1293000	1297000	Why did you all create this RATE together?
1297000	1299000	Is there a joint pricing behavior?
1300000	1304000	This problem is stuck in the technical standard organization.
1304000	1307000	I abbreviate SSO to make it easier for me to say.
1307000	1310000	SSO will be worried.
1310000	1312000	If everyone is investigating me.
1312000	1313000	Everyone is doubting me.
1313000	1315000	Am I doing joint pricing?
1315000	1317000	Because I said a sentence.
1317000	1319000	The price of Friend is called 1%.
1319000	1323000	Am I being investigated all day?
1323000	1325000	So the problem is here.
1326000	1329000	Although it is a very important organization.
1329000	1330000	It created Friend.
1330000	1333000	It requires everyone to accept Friend.
1333000	1337000	But it is not responsible for the so-called pricing behavior.
1337000	1340000	Because of this, what is Friend?
1340000	1343000	I can report to you.
1343000	1345000	What is Friend?
1345000	1347000	In the legal circle.
1347000	1351000	There are many discussions in the paper of the Chamber of Commerce.
1351000	1355000	Because no one dares to go to court.
1355000	1359000	The court itself or the government unit.
1359000	1363000	It has never dared to respond positively to this matter.
1363000	1365000	Includes its definition.
1365000	1367000	It has its own method of calculation.
1367000	1369000	But every court in the United States.
1369000	1372000	Are using different methods of calculation.
1372000	1377000	So this thing is actually complicated.
1378000	1382000	In fact, today I will introduce this kind of background to you first.
1382000	1386000	Because I think this thing needs to be explained to you first.
1386000	1388000	Then his background state.
1388000	1391000	Then I can get into what we are studying.
1391000	1395000	Because of this, everyone will have the so-called level playing field.
1395000	1397000	Everyone has a rough idea of ​​this matter.
1397000	1400000	I know what I am studying.
1400000	1402000	I'm getting into my stuff.
1402000	1404000	This is easier for everyone to understand.
1405000	1407000	Before we officially start talking.
1409000	1411000	Before this very interesting case.
1411000	1412000	Let me ask you first.
1412000	1414000	The simple industry I just introduced.
1414000	1417000	Or some knowledge background.
1417000	1419000	Is there any problem with the introduction?
1429000	1431000	5 seconds.
1431000	1433000	No problem so far.
1434000	1436000	No problem, very good.
1436000	1438000	But if you have any questions, you are welcome.
1438000	1440000	I also want to train.
1440000	1443000	Talk to people in the legal field.
1443000	1445000	See what you think.
1445000	1447000	After having such background knowledge.
1447000	1450000	We know that the technical standards have many patents.
1450000	1453000	It is authorized to be restricted by the FRIEND regulation.
1453000	1455000	Then it has a third-party regulation.
1455000	1457000	So everyone can enjoy FRIEND.
1459000	1460000	Then there is that we all know.
1461000	1463000	When selling, there are usually a lot of patents behind.
1467000	1469000	The problem has appeared.
1469000	1471000	We all know that I just mentioned.
1471000	1474000	Qualcomm is an industrial leader.
1474000	1477000	Its modern chip quality is very good.
1477000	1481000	It is also an Apple long-term supplier.
1481000	1488000	But at the beginning of 2017.
1488000	1492000	FTC, the Federal Trade Commission of the United States.
1492000	1494000	And Apple itself.
1494000	1497000	Apple is its downstream manufacturer.
1497000	1504000	It has sued Qualcomm for violating the Antitrust Law.
1506000	1509000	Specifically, it has many claims.
1509000	1511000	It has advocated many things.
1511000	1513000	What I want to focus on today is.
1513000	1516000	Qualcomm is on the so-called contract.
1517000	1519000	With everyone playing a so-called.
1519000	1521000	It uses its market position.
1521000	1524000	To achieve its goal of making profits.
1524000	1526000	How does it do this?
1526000	1528000	First of all, everyone sees this picture.
1528000	1532000	This picture is actually public.
1532000	1534000	I didn't do it, it's not so beautiful.
1534000	1538000	This picture is when Apple is suing Qualcomm.
1538000	1542000	It added its content of this lawsuit.
1542000	1544000	And its analysis chart.
1544000	1547000	How does Qualcomm violate the law?
1547000	1549000	Basically, Qualcomm.
1549000	1554000	Its practice is actually divided into two stages.
1554000	1556000	Today, because of a little more time.
1556000	1558000	I don't know how much time I have.
1558000	1560000	But I'll talk slowly.
1560000	1562000	It is actually divided into two stages.
1562000	1565000	Qualcomm's two-stage behavior is the first.
1565000	1567000	Qualcomm in 2007.
1567000	1570000	Before officially becoming an Apple supplier.
1570000	1572000	In fact, it is with Apple.
1572000	1574000	Uh, other assembly lines.
1574000	1576000	Uh, including the so-called.
1576000	1578000	We refer to this Fuskang.
1578000	1580000	I take Fuskang as an example.
1580000	1582000	Fuskang is Apple's.
1582000	1584000	This assembly line.
1584000	1586000	It is actually Qualcomm itself.
1586000	1588000	Uh, the assembly line of Apple.
1588000	1590000	There is already a contract.
1590000	1592000	Why? Because you want to assemble.
1592000	1594000	You will also use Qualcomm's patent.
1594000	1596000	Because Qualcomm's patent layout is very wide.
1596000	1597000	We just.
1597000	1598000	In fact, I just gave a simple example.
1598000	1600000	In fact, if you look at it.
1600000	1602000	Qualcomm's patent layout.
1602000	1604000	It has exceeded the scope of the modern chip itself.
1604000	1606000	It contains the entire technical standard.
1606000	1608000	OK, this is what he said.
1608000	1610000	Uh, I also believe that.
1610000	1612000	Because if you go to check Qualcomm.
1612000	1614000	This company was established in 1985.
1614000	1616000	Then continue to be in.
1616000	1618000	Uh, the communication chip industry continues.
1618000	1620000	To do research and development.
1620000	1622000	Then continue to.
1622000	1624000	Uh, expand his career.
1624000	1626000	So he actually.
1626000	1628000	The impact is not just in the modern chip itself.
1628000	1630000	It also includes the whole.
1630000	1632000	It also includes itself.
1632000	1634000	Uh, it also includes technical standards.
1634000	1636000	OK.
1636000	1638000	So he was originally Qualcomm.
1638000	1640000	He is cooperating with Apple suppliers.
1640000	1642000	Ah, because Apple suppliers.
1642000	1644000	For example, I just said Fuskang.
1644000	1646000	Fuskang, he actually does more than Apple products.
1646000	1648000	He also does other.
1648000	1650000	Do HP, right?
1650000	1652000	You do other products.
1652000	1654000	HP's, for example.
1654000	1656000	Will also use Qualcomm's chip.
1656000	1658000	Uh, it will also use Qualcomm's patent.
1658000	1660000	Or technology also needs to be done.
1660000	1662000	Uh, patent authorization.
1662000	1664000	So it becomes.
1664000	1666000	In fact, Qualcomm already has.
1666000	1668000	With other Apple suppliers.
1668000	1670000	To do cooperation.
1670000	1672000	So why did I mention Apple suppliers?
1672000	1674000	His complexity is here.
1674000	1676000	Because Qualcomm, he did one.
1676000	1678000	The fun thing is that he is.
1678000	1680000	Before becoming an Apple supplier.
1680000	1682000	He told this Apple supplier.
1682000	1684000	I just said.
1684000	1686000	I signed a contract with you.
1686000	1688000	I put this.
1688000	1690000	You want to assemble this Apple product.
1690000	1692000	Okay, I'll take this patent with you.
1692000	1694000	But what about the content of this patent?
1694000	1696000	The scope is not the content.
1696000	1698000	Specific details.
1698000	1700000	How is it?
1700000	1702000	Uh, it's NDA.
1702000	1704000	Non-disclosure agreement is not open.
1704000	1706000	OK, what about other things?
1706000	1708000	If I think I'm because of this.
1708000	1710000	The relationship is actually a bit complicated.
1710000	1712000	To put it simply.
1712000	1714000	Qualcomm, I'm with Apple today.
1714000	1716000	Uh, the assembly plant of Apple.
1716000	1718000	Ah, and then the patent authorization.
1718000	1720000	Ah, these assemblies.
1720000	1722000	He can actually come back and ask Apple for this.
1722000	1724000	Want this reimbursement.
1724000	1726000	That is to say, because the assembly plant.
1726000	1728000	He doesn't think he has to.
1728000	1730000	Take more of this responsibility.
1730000	1732000	Because this contract is actually negotiable.
1732000	1734000	But in the real world.
1734000	1736000	I can tell you.
1736000	1738000	Report to everyone.
1738000	1740000	In fact, most of the money.
1740000	1742000	Uh, there are a lot of parts.
1742000	1744000	A lot of money has become.
1744000	1746000	Apple to squeeze.
1746000	1748000	But of course Apple will say.
1748000	1750000	I didn't squeeze them.
1750000	1752000	Of course, in this case.
1752000	1754000	Qualcomm is Qualcomm.
1754000	1756000	Uh, Qualcomm claims.
1756000	1758000	Oh, I have been with these assemblies today.
1758000	1760000	Cooperation.
1760000	1762000	I asked them to pay these.
1762000	1764000	Give me the rights to patent authorization.
1764000	1766000	If you don't want to.
1766000	1768000	You can go back to Apple.
1768000	1770000	You don't have to pay for this.
1770000	1772000	Does Apple pay for you?
1772000	1774000	But the fun thing is here.
1774000	1776000	Qualcomm, I just said that Qualcomm.
1776000	1778000	He is SEP.
1778000	1780000	In fact, his SEP is a.
1780000	1782000	There must be a range.
1782000	1784000	His range is the so-called.
1784000	1786000	This friend.
1786000	1788000	He is more than that.
1788000	1790000	Fair and reasonable.
1790000	1792000	He must be reasonable.
1792000	1794000	And not discrimination.
1794000	1796000	I went to these assemblies.
1796000	1798000	Signed the NDA.
1798000	1800000	If you are Apple.
1800000	1802000	Then there is a result.
1802000	1804000	I want to use.
1804000	1806000	For example, I want to use Qualcomm chips.
1806000	1808000	Then the result.
1808000	1810000	I use Qualcomm chips.
1810000	1812000	All those assemblies below me.
1812000	1814000	Have been asking me for money.
1814000	1816000	Qualcomm has already collected more money from me.
1816000	1818000	Then you have to compensate me.
1818000	1820000	Then how much compensation.
1820000	1822000	Then how much according to the contract.
1822000	1824000	Why is this price?
1824000	1826000	Those assemblies.
1826000	1828000	Apple asked those assemblies.
1828000	1830000	Why is this price?
1830000	1832000	I can't tell you.
1832000	1834000	Because Qualcomm said this is NDA.
1834000	1836000	I can't tell you.
1836000	1838000	So this is wonderful.
1838000	1840000	The first stage is to say.
1840000	1842000	Qualcomm went to Apple's assembly plant.
1842000	1844000	Wanted a sum of money.
1844000	1846000	Then the source of this money is.
1846000	1848000	NDA is not public.
1848000	1850000	That becomes.
1850000	1852000	Because the account is there.
1852000	1854000	Qualcomm asked me for so much money.
1854000	1856000	Then Apple.
1856000	1858000	Transferred to Apple.
1858000	1860000	Then Apple.
1860000	1862000	I can only admit it.
1862000	1864000	Apple thinks it's strange.
1864000	1866000	Is this price reasonable?
1866000	1868000	Ask my assembly plant.
1868000	1870000	He can't say.
1870000	1872000	That's weird.
1872000	1874000	Apple actually wants to get rid of this.
1874000	1876000	How much did I pay Qualcomm?
1876000	1878000	I don't know.
1878000	1880000	I don't know my source.
1880000	1882000	I don't know my calculation method.
1882000	1884000	I just kept paying for it.
1884000	1886000	He thinks it's unreasonable.
1886000	1888000	Feel the price.
1888000	1890000	His internal manager.
1890000	1892000	Or lawyers or lawyers.
1892000	1894000	Think this price may be unreasonable.
1894000	1896000	Qualcomm wants too much money.
1896000	1898000	He decided to talk to Qualcomm directly.
1898000	1900000	So this picture is later.
1900000	1902000	Apple talked to Qualcomm.
1902000	1904000	After he talked.
1904000	1906000	Apple said I can sign a contract with you.
1906000	1908000	The gray part below.
1908000	1910000	BCPA, TA, FTA, SDA, ASDA.
1910000	1912000	These are all abbreviations of this contract.
1912000	1914000	BCPA, for example.
1914000	1916000	His full name is.
1916000	1918000	Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement.
1918000	1920000	TA is Transition Agreement.
1920000	1922000	Anyway, he is an abbreviation.
1922000	1924000	Anyway, he is an abbreviation.
1924000	1926000	In these contracts.
1926000	1928000	Qualcomm and Apple.
1928000	1930000	They went to talk.
1930000	1932000	Apple feels bad.
1932000	1934000	You go through the middle.
1934000	1936000	I want to talk to you directly.
1936000	1938000	I want to talk to you directly.
1938000	1940000	Qualcomm agreed.
1940000	1942000	After he agreed, he signed these contracts.
1942000	1944000	But he added some conditions in these contracts.
1944000	1946000	But he added some conditions in these contracts.
1946000	1948000	These conditions are fun.
1948000	1950000	What you see now.
1950000	1952000	Rebate Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement.
1952000	1954000	These two.
1954000	1956000	It sounds very simple.
1956000	1958000	In fact, the specific content looks like this.
1958000	1960000	This is the lawsuit.
1960000	1962000	This is mentioned in Apple's lawsuit.
1962000	1964000	Of course, it contains a lot of confidential documents.
1964000	1966000	I don't know what confidentiality is.
1966000	1968000	I don't know what confidentiality is.
1968000	1970000	Mainly these two.
1970000	1972000	One is that you have to promise me.
1972000	1974000	You want me to provide.
1974000	1976000	You want me to provide you with chips.
1976000	1978000	You want me to provide you with chips.
1978000	1980000	He is the US Federal Trade Commission.
1980000	1982000	He is the US Federal Trade Commission.
1982000	1984000	No license.
1984000	1986000	No chip.
1986000	1988000	No license.
1988000	1990000	No license.
1990000	1992000	He said.
1992000	1994000	You want me to supply my high-quality modern chip.
1994000	1996000	But you have to accept the price.
1996000	1998000	But you have to accept the price.
1998000	2000000	But you have to accept the price.
2000000	2002000	You have to accept the price of my SEP.
2002000	2004000	You have to accept the price of my SEP.
2004000	2006000	Then he found out inside Apple.
2006000	2008000	It seems to be a bit higher than the market.
2008000	2010000	But Qualcomm said.
2010000	2012000	But Qualcomm said.
2012000	2014000	What can you do?
2014000	2016000	If you don't accept this price.
2016000	2018000	Then I can't provide you with this modern chip.
2018000	2020000	These two are bundled together.
2020000	2022000	The so-called bundled together.
2022000	2024000	I'm going to sell you a modern chip today.
2024000	2026000	But you have to accept.
2026000	2028000	Apple's own claim.
2028000	2030000	In fact, this case is still running.
2030000	2032000	In fact, this case is still running.
2032000	2034000	The so-called price is not FRIEND.
2034000	2036000	The so-called price is not FRIEND.
2036000	2038000	The so-called price is not FRIEND.
2038000	2040000	But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.
2040000	2042000	But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.
2042000	2044000	But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.
2044000	2046000	But because Qualcomm has good quality.
2046000	2048000	And then he is a market leader.
2048000	2050000	And then there's a lot of patent planning.
2050000	2052000	So Apple has to accept this.
2052000	2054000	So Apple has to accept this.
2054000	2056000	This is the first point.
2056000	2058000	The so-called no license, no chip policy.
2058000	2060000	The so-called no license, no chip policy.
2060000	2062000	Apple must accept his contract terms.
2062000	2064000	Apple must accept his contract terms.
2064000	2066000	In exchange, you say, okay, you want me to use his.
2066000	2068000	I use Qualcomm's modern chip.
2068000	2070000	I use Qualcomm's modern chip.
2070000	2072000	But I have to accept a higher FRIEND price.
2072000	2074000	But I have to accept a higher FRIEND price.
2074000	2076000	You want me to supply this, right?
2076000	2078000	But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel.
2078000	2080000	But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel.
2080000	2082000	I didn't treat you badly.
2082000	2084000	He provides a rebate.
2084000	2086000	He provides a rebate.
2086000	2088000	This rebate is a fixed amount of price.
2088000	2090000	This rebate is a fixed amount of price.
2090000	2092000	Because you've been my client for a long time.
2092000	2094000	Because you've been my client for a long time.
2094000	2096000	Use my communication chip.
2096000	2098000	Then I'll give you a discount.
2098000	2100000	Then I'll give you a discount.
2100000	2102000	Then I'll give you a discount.
2102000	2104000	Because everyone is not learning law or business.
2104000	2106000	Because everyone is not learning law or business.
2106000	2108000	All the discounts in the mall.
2108000	2110000	All the discounts in the mall.
2110000	2112000	I'll give you a sum of money.
2112000	2114000	In fact, there are conditions.
2114000	2116000	Qualcomm said yes.
2116000	2118000	Apple said yes.
2118000	2120000	You give me a discount.
2120000	2122000	But Qualcomm said yes.
2122000	2124000	I'll give you a discount.
2124000	2126000	But you have to accept the following conditions.
2126000	2128000	The following conditions are two.
2128000	2130000	The following conditions are two.
2130000	2132000	The following conditions are two.
2132000	2134000	What are the conditions?
2134000	2136000	You have to use my communication chip.
2136000	2138000	You have to use my communication chip.
2138000	2140000	You can't jump the grass.
2140000	2142000	You can't use Intel.
2142000	2144000	You can't use Samsung.
2144000	2146000	You can't use Samsung.
2146000	2148000	You can't use my competitor's chip.
2148000	2150000	You can't use my competitor's chip.
2150000	2152000	It sounds reasonable.
2152000	2154000	It sounds reasonable.
2154000	2156000	The second point is that it's fun.
2156000	2158000	You can't go to any government unit.
2158000	2160000	You can't go to any government unit for investigation.
2162000	2164000	You can't make a lawsuit.
2172000	2174000	Let's start the debate.
2174000	2176000	First, I provide a discount
2176000	2178000	First, I provide a discount
2178000	2180000	But you have to use my chip.
2180000	2182000	But you have to use my chip.
2184000	2186000	Second, he says,
2186000	2188000	Second, I provide a discount
2188000	2190000	Second, I provide a discount
2190000	2192000	But you can't sue me.
2192000	2194000	But you can't sue me.
2194000	2196000	These are two points.
2196000	2198000	One is that you can't investigate me.
2198000	2200000	Completely lock you up.
2200000	2202000	The other point is that
2202000	2204000	You can't jump to another place.
2204000	2206000	You can't jump to another place.
2208000	2210000	You can't make a patent lawsuit.
2210000	2212000	You can't make a patent lawsuit.
2212000	2214000	This makes Apple very upset.
2214000	2216000	I can't use other people's chip.
2216000	2218000	I can't use other people's chip.
2218000	2220000	I can't use other people's chip.
2220000	2222000	Qualcomm uses the so-called
2222000	2224000	Qualcomm uses the so-called
2224000	2226000	No license, no chip.
2226000	2228000	The price is so high.
2228000	2230000	I don't know what you're doing.
2230000	2232000	I don't know what you're doing.
2232000	2234000	You are a market monopoly.
2234000	2236000	You are a market monopoly.
2236000	2238000	The whole thing is mixed up.
2238000	2240000	The whole case is mixed up.
2240000	2242000	Let Apple jump.
2242000	2243500	And caused a lot of
2243500	2245500	And caused a lot of
2245500	2247500	European Union.
2247500	2249500	And China-Taiwan.
2249500	2251500	Taiwan, you probably heard of it.
2251500	2253500	He was also investigating this case.
2253500	2255500	US and the U.S.
2255500	2257500	The United States Trade Commission is investigating the whole thing.
2257500	2259500	What is his legitimacy?
2259500	2261500	What is his legitimacy?
2267500	2269500	We want to investigate.
2269500	2271500	Qualcomm is doing this.
2271500	2273500	What is the reason behind this?
2273500	2275500	Why does Qualcomm
2275500	2277500	Why does Qualcomm
2277500	2279500	Bundle Rebate?
2279500	2281500	Bundle Rebate?
2281500	2283500	You can think about it.
2283500	2285500	If Qualcomm's quality is so good.
2285500	2287500	If Qualcomm's quality is so good.
2287500	2289500	Good quality, good market monopoly status.
2289500	2291500	Why does he provide a return to Apple?
2291500	2293500	Why does he provide a return to Apple?
2293500	2295500	Because I'm lying down.
2295500	2297500	Apple is coming.
2297500	2299500	You can think about it.
2299500	2301500	If you are a market monopoly status.
2301500	2303500	If you are a market monopoly status.
2303500	2305500	Basically, everyone's products
2305500	2307500	Almost use my modern chip.
2307500	2309500	Almost use my modern chip.
2309500	2311500	People can't catch up with me.
2311500	2313500	People can't catch up with me.
2313500	2315500	For example, he mentioned Intel.
2315500	2317500	For him, Intel is nothing.
2317500	2319500	He can't catch up with me at all.
2319500	2321500	He can't catch up with me at all.
2321500	2323500	I don't know if you have learned this.
2323500	2325500	I don't know if you have learned this.
2325500	2327500	The cost of investment is very high.
2328500	2329500	So this question has always been a question of ours.
2329500	2331500	So this question has always been a question of ours.
2331500	2333500	So this question has always been a question of ours.
2333500	2335500	The core question is if Qualcomm
2335500	2337500	If Qualcomm is in a market monopoly status.
2337500	2339500	If Qualcomm is in a market monopoly status.
2339500	2341500	In market leadership.
2341500	2343500	He is so wide in his specialist.
2343500	2345500	OK, and the quality of products is also very good.
2345500	2347500	Why does he provide this return to Apple?
2347500	2349500	What's going on in society?
2349500	2351500	What's going on in society?
2351500	2353500	And provided with this return.
2353500	2355500	And provided with this return.
2355500	2357500	This period is not just a year or two,
2357500	2359500	Perhaps a period of 3 to 5 years.
2359500	2361500	Perhaps a period of 3 to 5 years.
2361500	2363500	So he's actually still providing this rebate.
2363500	2365500	So he's actually still providing this rebate.
2365500	2367500	Then provide such a return to Apple.
2367500	2369500	Then the two requirements are that
2369500	2371500	Then the two requirements are that
2371500	2373500	And then you can't investigate me.
2373500	2375500	And then you have to accept mine.
2379500	2381500	Then issue
2381500	2383500	Is the value of Friends justified?
2383500	2385500	I'm not in today's report.
2385500	2387500	I'm not in today's report.
2387500	2389500	Because you say everything.
2389500	2391500	Apple says you are not a friend.
2391500	2393500	Qualcomm says I am a friend.
2393500	2395500	Because I have the whole patent I authorize to you.
2395500	2397500	Because I have the whole patent I authorize to you.
2397500	2399500	This know-how
2399500	2401500	And this so-called technical standard.
2401500	2403500	Of course, the price is so high.
2403500	2405500	Of course, the price is so high.
2405500	2407500	This is the problem of the industry.
2407500	2409500	This is the problem of the industry.
2409500	2411500	Today's problem is on this rebate.
2411500	2413500	So today I will tell you briefly.
2413500	2415500	That is to say, today I focus on the point.
2415500	2417500	Also this paper.
2417500	2419500	The point I studied with that classmate is.
2419500	2421500	Why Qualcomm
2421500	2423500	He will be so persistent.
2423500	2425500	To provide rebate this matter.
2425500	2427500	OK
2427500	2429500	I'm pausing again.
2429500	2431500	I'm pausing again.
2431500	2433500	See if you have any understanding of this case.
2433500	2435500	See if you have any understanding of this case.
2435500	2437500	Do you understand this story I just said?
2437500	2439500	Do you understand this story I just said?
2439500	2441500	Do you understand this story I just said?
2461500	2463500	Does anyone not understand?
2463500	2465500	What is the link that you don't understand?
2465500	2467500	If you don't understand.
2467500	2469500	Can you tell me which link you don't understand?
2497500	2503500	OK, no one responded.
2503500	2505500	Just pretend to understand.
2505500	2507500	On the basis of this knowledge,
2507500	2511500	we know that the hatred between Apple and Qualcomm has spread like this.
2511500	2513500	I was sued like this last year.
2513500	2523500	For me, this paper is a cross-sectional, cross-field cooperation paper.
2523500	2525500	I am responsible for the part of legal analysis.
2525500	2530500	My partner is responsible for the study of the Gantt theory model,
2530500	2536500	and the analysis of this whole thing from a commercial and economic perspective.
2536500	2539500	First of all, everyone is very curious.
2539500	2541500	From my point of view,
2541500	2543500	is there a similar case in the past?
2543500	2548500	Or how did they judge this rebate case?
2548500	2551500	Or what is the result of their judgment?
2551500	2553500	Let me report to you.
2554500	2557500	Simply put, this thing, this problem,
2557500	2561500	even the court itself is difficult to handle.
2565500	2568500	The red part you see on the screen
2568500	2571500	represents that the court is the red part.
2571500	2575500	The red case is the court's judgment.
2575500	2582500	The defendant, a company like Qualcomm, is illegal.
2582500	2584500	The black part is that I didn't mark it.
2584500	2587500	The black part of these cases
2587500	2590500	is considered legal by the court.
2590500	2592500	It's like a bond rebate.
2592500	2594500	You have to accept this.
2594500	2596500	If you want to use it,
2596500	2598500	just like the state of communication I just talked about.
2598500	2601500	If you want to use my stuff,
2601500	2604500	you want to become my supplier,
2604500	2606500	or I want to supply you with good stuff,
2606500	2608500	but you have to accept my conditions.
2609500	2611500	You can buy it,
2611500	2613500	but you have to buy a certain amount.
2613500	2614500	After you buy a certain amount,
2614500	2616500	I'll give you a rebate.
2616500	2617500	It's a similar concept.
2617500	2620500	It's a similar trading model.
2620500	2622500	I've sorted out these six cases.
2622500	2625500	Since none of them are legal,
2625500	2627500	I won't go over them one by one.
2627500	2629500	In fact, based on the results,
2629500	2631500	the results are divided.
2631500	2633500	The reasons are also divided.
2633500	2634500	The three red dots
2634500	2637500	are the different courts
2637500	2641500	for these cases.
2641500	2642500	So you can see
2642500	2644500	a very special phenomenon.
2644500	2647500	On the issue of rebate,
2647500	2649500	or bond rebate,
2649500	2651500	different courts have different reasons
2651500	2653500	and different results.
2655500	2656500	I'll talk about it later.
2656500	2658500	Qualcomm actually used this point.
2658500	2660500	It's not a use.
2660500	2662500	It should have seen this point.
2662500	2664500	We infer that he saw this point
2664500	2667500	and it may have become his reason
2667500	2672500	to continue to use his bond rebate to Apple.
2672500	2674500	This is our inference.
2674500	2676500	I'll talk about it later.
2676500	2677500	This is my preliminary investigation.
2677500	2679500	I found that
2681500	2682500	if the defendant
2682500	2685500	is illegal in the red case,
2685500	2687500	and legal in the black case,
2687500	2688500	I'll see
2688500	2689500	what common features
2689500	2691500	the red case has.
2691500	2693500	First, those illegal cases
2694500	2695500	in the red part.
2695500	2697500	I just showed you the red part.
2697500	2698500	These defendants
2698500	2703500	actually have some market monopoly.
2703500	2709500	So if you are a market monopolist,
2709500	2712500	it is likely to violate the antitrust law.
2712500	2715500	This is in our legal school.
2715500	2718500	If you learn this antitrust law,
2718500	2721500	basically this probability is very high.
2721500	2723500	If you have this market monopoly,
2723500	2727500	it is basically easy to violate the antitrust law.
2727500	2730500	This is very normal.
2730500	2731500	OK.
2731500	2733500	In the context of this bond rebate,
2733500	2735500	it is not an exception.
2735500	2737500	But we have seen
2737500	2739500	the second point is very interesting.
2739500	2740500	We see legal.
2740500	2742500	We compare these legal cases.
2742500	2745500	In the black cases,
2745500	2746500	we found that
2746500	2749500	the defendant may still be legal.
2749500	2750500	Why?
2750500	2752500	Just imagine.
2752500	2757500	In the black cases,
2757500	2760500	why do some judges
2760500	2762500	think they are legal
2762500	2764500	in the same situation?
2764500	2766500	Because they do not have
2766500	2768500	the effect of exclusion.
2768500	2769500	OK.
2769500	2770500	In general,
2770500	2771500	let's put it simply.
2771500	2773500	Antitrust law is actually
2773500	2777500	a law of corporate behavior.
2777500	2778500	OK.
2778500	2779500	It is the law of market economy
2779500	2780500	and corporate behavior.
2780500	2782500	So the market economy
2782500	2784500	should maintain a competitive attitude
2784500	2786500	instead of letting a person monopolize
2786500	2788500	or show a state of monopoly.
2788500	2789500	But imagine
2789500	2791500	if he was originally today.
2791500	2792500	Although he is a
2792500	2795500	through his sales behavior
2795500	2797500	and then his innovative business model
2797500	2799500	to achieve his market leadership position
2799500	2801500	but not monopoly leadership position
2801500	2803500	and then he wants to continue
2803500	2805500	to increase his market share
2805500	2808500	he may let other competitors
2808500	2811500	have some problems
2811500	2812500	or what is the situation.
2812500	2814500	The effect of his exclusion
2814500	2815500	may make some
2815500	2816500	for example,
2816500	2817500	competition or something
2817500	2820500	he may let other competitors
2820500	2821500	he can not come in
2821500	2823500	or potential competitors
2823500	2824500	for example,
2824500	2825500	as I just mentioned
2825500	2826500	Intel
2826500	2828500	Intel in the so-called
2828500	2830500	this computer CPU
2830500	2831500	everyone should know
2831500	2832500	are doing very well
2832500	2833500	this Pentium
2833500	2834500	Pentium series are doing very well
2834500	2835500	and then with this
2835500	2836500	Microsoft
2836500	2838500	in the late 90s
2838500	2839500	is almost
2839500	2840500	this is almost
2840500	2842500	very few computers
2842500	2843500	but he is in
2843500	2844500	the communication chip inside
2844500	2846500	he just can not stand
2846500	2847500	he is not
2847500	2849500	the so-called position
2849500	2852500	that he is coming in today
2852500	2854500	but in fact
2854500	2855500	he wants to come in
2855500	2857500	as long as he invests enough money
2857500	2858500	in fact, Intel
2858500	2859500	if you go to check
2859500	2860500	in fact, he is also doing
2860500	2861500	just keep doing bad
2861500	2862500	OK
2862500	2863500	but not to say
2863500	2864500	he can not do
2864500	2865500	this is the difference
2865500	2866500	that is
2866500	2867500	I'll talk about
2867500	2868500	this is the difference
2868500	2869500	that is the so-called can not do
2869500	2870500	that is to say
2870500	2871500	I used some business behavior
2871500	2872500	for example, I
2872500	2873500	I join all the people
2873500	2874500	I do not provide you material
2874500	2875500	you can not do
2875500	2876500	this is not
2876500	2877500	this must be against
2877500	2878500	this anti-trust law
2878500	2879500	because this is against
2879500	2880500	this
2880500	2881500	this market competition
2881500	2882500	that is
2882500	2883500	the current situation
2883500	2884500	is to say
2884500	2885500	we observed
2885500	2886500	the first few
2886500	2887500	black cases
2887500	2888500	we found that
2888500	2889500	those cases
2889500	2890500	Why is it legal
2890500	2892500	because those potential competitors
2892500	2893500	he was not excluded
2893500	2894500	into this market
2894500	2895500	he can still
2895500	2896500	enter this market
2896500	2897500	competition
2897500	2898500	means that
2898500	2899500	his entry barrier
2899500	2900500	is low
2900500	2901500	that entry barrier
2901500	2902500	low, then
2902500	2903500	the court saw
2903500	2904500	low entry barrier
2904500	2905500	that is to say
2905500	2906500	that you
2906500	2907500	may come in today
2907500	2908500	but you choose not to come in
2908500	2909500	or you
2909500	2910500	may have other
2910500	2911500	commercial considerations
2911500	2912500	but not come in
2912500	2913500	so
2913500	2914500	before
2914500	2915500	I go back
2915500	2916500	before
2916500	2917500	these black cases
2917500	2918500	Why would be
2918500	2919500	legal
2919500	2920500	these Bundle
2920500	2921500	Rebate
2921500	2922500	because
2922500	2923500	other competitors
2923500	2924500	he
2924500	2925500	was not excluded
2925500	2926500	he still came in
2926500	2927500	he still joined
2927500	2928500	this industry
2928500	2929500	continue to compete
2929500	2930500	with these defendants
2930500	2931500	for example,
2931500	2932500	if the defendant
2932500	2933500	is Gaotong
2933500	2934500	he still
2934500	2935500	come in
2935500	2936500	this industry
2936500	2937500	to compete
2937500	2938500	that is
2938500	2939500	like we
2939500	2940500	discussed today
2940500	2941500	Gaotong
2941500	2942500	is not the only
2942500	2943500	one
2943500	2944500	to provide
2944500	2945500	Samsung
2945500	2946500	also has
2946500	2947500	Huawei
2947500	2948500	also has
2948500	2949500	OK
2949500	2950500	so
2950500	2951500	you
2951500	2952500	know
2952500	2953500	that
2953500	2954500	although Gaotong
2954500	2955500	in this market
2955500	2956500	is based on
2956500	2957500	monopoly status
2957500	2958500	based on this
2958500	2959500	leadership position
2959500	2960500	and then
2960500	2961500	may have
2961500	2962500	some monopoly
2962500	2963500	power on
2963500	2964500	sales
2964500	2965500	because
2965500	2966500	the quality of
2966500	2967500	his product
2967500	2968500	is good
2968500	2969500	but
2969500	2970500	other people
2970500	2971500	are still
2971500	2972500	inside
2972500	2973500	right
2973500	2974500	other players
2974500	2975500	are also
2975500	2976500	inside
2976500	2977500	other
2977500	2978500	manufacturers
2978500	2979500	are also
2979500	2980500	inside
2980500	2981500	but
2981500	2982500	you get
2982500	2983500	this market
2983500	2984500	leadership position
2984500	2985500	is my
2985500	2986500	development ability
2986500	2987500	is strong enough
2987500	2988500	my innovation is enough
2988500	2989500	my patent
2989500	2990500	quality is good enough
2990500	2991500	so everyone
2991500	2992500	likes to use my
2992500	2993500	product
2993500	2994500	and produce
2994500	2995500	this normal
2995500	2996500	market leadership
2996500	2997500	position
2997500	2998500	you can't
2998500	2999500	punish this
2999500	3000500	behavior
3000500	3001500	otherwise
3001500	3002500	if antitrust
3002500	3003500	if this
3003500	3004500	antitrust law
3004500	3005500	is operated
3005500	3006500	like this
3006500	3007500	who wants to
3007500	3008500	innovate
3008500	3009500	this
3009500	3010500	antitrust law
3010500	3011500	in the United States
3011500	3012500	is actually a
3012500	3013500	very sensitive
3013500	3014500	law and sensitive
3014500	3015500	topic
3015500	3016500	because
3016500	3017500	a
3017500	3018500	accident
3018500	3019500	may
3019500	3020500	have a
3020500	3021500	competitive
3021500	3022500	market
3022500	3023500	attitude
3023500	3024500	and
3024500	3025500	the aftermath
3025500	3026500	is actually
3026500	3027500	very big
3027500	3028500	because
3028500	3029500	you may
3029500	3030500	accidentally
3030500	3031500	punish
3031500	3032500	the right
3032500	3033500	person
3033500	3034500	if you
3034500	3035500	punish
3035500	3036500	the right
3036500	3037500	person
3037500	3038500	so
3038500	3039500	I
3039500	3040500	personally
3040500	3041500	think
3041500	3042500	Taiwan
3042500	3043500	can't
3043500	3044500	judge
3044500	3045500	antitrust
3045500	3046500	so soon
3046500	3047500	the reason
3047500	3048500	is here
3048500	3049500	I
3049500	3050500	want to
3050500	3051500	share
3051500	3052500	with
3052500	3053500	you
3053500	3054500	I
3054500	3055500	don't
3055500	3056500	know
3056500	3057500	if
3057500	3058500	this
3058500	3059500	is
3059500	3060500	good or
3060500	3061500	not
3061500	3062500	but
3062500	3063500	I
3063500	3064500	think
3064500	3065500	it's
3065500	3066500	worth
3066500	3067500	talking
3067500	3068500	about
3068500	3069500	since
3069500	3070500	there are
3070500	3071500	so many
3071500	3072500	people
3072500	3073500	in this
3073500	3074500	industry
3074500	3075500	and
3075500	3076500	why
3076500	3077500	they are
3077500	3078500	punished
3078500	3079500	you have
3079500	3080500	to give
3080500	3081500	a
3081500	3082500	legitimate
3082500	3083500	reason
3083500	3084500	the
3084500	3085500	United
3085500	3086500	States
3086500	3087500	is a
3087500	3088500	public
3088500	3089500	country
3089500	3090500	so
3090500	3091500	this
3091500	3092500	thing
3092500	3093500	has not
3093500	3094500	been
3094500	3095500	judged
3095500	3096500	even
3096500	3097500	as I
3097500	3098500	said
3098500	3099500	the red
3099500	3100500	case is
3100500	3101500	still
3101500	3102500	illegal
3102500	3103500	so
3103500	3104500	it has
3104500	3105500	legal
3105500	3106500	risk
3106500	3107500	under
3107500	3108500	this
3108500	3109500	legal
3109500	3110500	risk
3110500	3111500	why
3111500	3112500	will
3112500	3113500	it
3113500	3114500	continue
3114500	3115500	to
3115500	3116500	implement
3116500	3117500	this
3117500	3118500	bundle
3118500	3119500	rebate
3119500	3120500	this is
3120500	3121500	our
3121500	3122500	cooperation
3122500	3123500	paper
3123500	3124500	to
3124500	3125500	use
3125500	3126500	so-called
3126500	3127500	competition
3127500	3128500	theory
3128500	3129500	model to
3129500	3130500	do
3130500	3131500	that
3131500	3132500	this is
3132500	3133500	from him
3133500	3134500	I
3134500	3135500	will briefly
3135500	3136500	introduce
3136500	3137500	you
3137500	3138500	can leave
3138500	3139500	me a
3139500	3140500	message
3140500	3141500	to me
3141500	3142500	and
3142500	3143500	I will
3143500	3144500	explain
3144500	3145500	not
3145500	3146500	explain
3146500	3147500	is that
3147500	3148500	I will
3148500	3149500	ask my
3149500	3150500	friends
3150500	3151500	and see if
3151500	3152500	I can
3152500	3153500	answer
3153500	3154500	this
3154500	3155500	question
3155500	3156500	and
3156500	3157500	then
3157500	3158500	we will
3158500	3159500	see what
3159500	3160500	we see
3160500	3161500	in the
3161500	3162500	model and
3162500	3163500	then we
3163500	3164500	will
3164500	3165500	say
3165500	3166500	maybe
3166500	3167500	behind these
3167500	3168500	models
3168500	3169500	what kind
3169500	3170500	of behavior
3170500	3171500	is possible
3171500	3172500	so
3172500	3173500	this
3173500	3174500	model is
3174500	3175500	such a
3175500	3176500	situation
3176500	3177500	and
3177500	3178500	from the
3178500	3179500	business
3179500	3180500	point of
3180500	3181500	view
3181500	3182500	and
3182500	3183500	MD
3183500	3184500	cry
3184500	3185500	ah
3185500	3186500	yes
3186500	3187500	MD
3187500	3188500	cry
3188500	3189500	ok
3189500	3190500	MD
3190500	3191500	does not seem to
3191500	3192500	be within
3192500	3193500	this
3193500	3194500	range of
3194500	3195500	modern
3195500	3196500	chip
3196500	3197500	ok
3197500	3198500	so
3198500	3199500	he
3199500	3200500	I do not know
3200500	3201500	MD
3201500	3202500	is not really
3202500	3203500	doing
3203500	3204500	modern
3204500	3205500	chip
3205500	3206500	may not
3206500	3207500	have
3207500	3208500	ok
3208500	3209500	not at all
3209500	3210500	in the
3210500	3211500	patent
3211500	3212500	so
3212500	3213500	I just
3213500	3214500	simply talk about
3214500	3215500	this math
3215500	3216500	we use
3216500	3217500	some of the
3217500	3218500	math because
3218500	3219500	we just
3219500	3220500	finished listening to
3220500	3221500	our story
3221500	3222500	so
3222500	3223500	listen to
3223500	3224500	our story
3224500	3225500	after
3225500	3226500	these
3226500	3227500	mathematical
3227500	3228500	model
3228500	3229500	assumptions
3229500	3230500	I think
3230500	3231500	it should
3231500	3232500	not be
3232500	3233500	very complicated
3233500	3234500	ok
3234500	3235500	first of all
3235500	3236500	we design
3236500	3237500	this game
3237500	3238500	for the
3238500	3239500	theory of

3587500	3588500	which
3588500	3589500	device
3589500	3590500	I
3590500	3591500	started
3591500	3592500	complaining
3592500	3593500	about
3593500	3594500	is because
3594500	3595500	Apple
3595500	3596500	but it
3596500	3597500	breaks the
3597500	3598500	rule
3598500	3617500	went to

3655500	3656500	most important
3656500	3657500	role
3657500	3658500	it
3658500	3659500	is there a reason
3659500	3660500	to provide
3660500	3661500	this rebate
3661500	3662500	is our basic
3662500	3663500	GAP
3663500	3664500	and
3664500	3665500	that
3665500	3666500	math model
3666500	3667500	we have a few
3667500	3668500	assumptions

3669500	3670500	based on our

3671500	3672500	so actually
3672500	3673500	quite intuitive
3673500	3674500	first
3674500	3675500	we assume
3675500	3676500	it is a

3677500	3678500	market
3678500	3679500	quality
3679500	3680500	and
