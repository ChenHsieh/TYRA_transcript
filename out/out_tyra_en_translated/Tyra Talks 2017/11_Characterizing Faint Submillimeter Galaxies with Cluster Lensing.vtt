WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.680
This is also a similar picture.

00:01.680 --> 00:04.080
This is the radius,

00:04.080 --> 00:06.560
and this is the brightness distribution picture.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.360
So you find that this HSC, H-band

00:09.360 --> 00:10.560
is the mirror infrared light,

00:10.560 --> 00:11.280
so it's very new.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.720
Its distribution is wider,

00:12.720 --> 00:16.320
and its distribution is more concentrated.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.000
Concentrated in a closer radius.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.040
So it tells you that

00:25.360 --> 00:27.360
these dusts are more compact,

00:27.360 --> 00:28.960
concentrated in the center of the galaxy.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.160
And the stars are running around.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.280
What does this tell you?

00:33.280 --> 00:35.920
It tells you that these SMGs

00:35.920 --> 00:37.840
should be major mergers.

00:37.840 --> 00:38.480
As I said before,

00:38.480 --> 00:40.400
it's two stars colliding.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.400
When the two stars collide,

00:42.400 --> 00:46.160
these stars are running around.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.640
Because when the two stars collide,

00:48.640 --> 00:50.320
the stars

00:50.320 --> 00:52.320
can basically be regarded as collision.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.640
They don't...

00:54.640 --> 00:57.200
They only have gravity for each other.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.200
Because the two stars

00:59.200 --> 01:00.400
don't collide.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.800
Because the universe is very wide.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.360
Very wide.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.320
And the stars...

01:04.320 --> 01:07.280
Imagine they're colliding one by one.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.760
But there's a collision

01:09.760 --> 01:11.040
with a collision on the left,

01:11.040 --> 01:12.480
and a collision on the right.

01:12.480 --> 01:16.080
Then you push each other.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.280
But most collisions

01:17.280 --> 01:18.480
just pass each other.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.520
They don't collide with each other.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.440
Because the space of the universe is very large,

01:21.440 --> 01:23.840
and the frequency of the stars is very small.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.240
So the stars

01:26.240 --> 01:28.240
basically don't collide with each other.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.400
So they run around in space.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.600
It's like this.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.680
They only have gravity

01:33.680 --> 01:36.560
for each other.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.760
But DOS doesn't.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.120
DOS actually comes from...

01:39.120 --> 01:41.040
At first, it comes from gas.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.720
Gas...

01:42.720 --> 01:43.920
When the two stars collide,

01:43.920 --> 01:46.080
the gas will collide with each other.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.560
Then they will lose their kinetic energy.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.040
OK.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.240
And after the gas loses kinetic energy,

01:50.240 --> 01:52.080
they will...

01:52.080 --> 01:54.080
fall to the center of the star

01:54.080 --> 01:56.000
because of gravity.

01:56.080 --> 01:56.640
Because of gravity,

01:56.640 --> 02:00.640
they will fall into the gravitational well of the core.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.560
And after the gas reaches the core,

02:02.560 --> 02:06.000
they will form new stars.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.120
New stars.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.800
They will produce star formation.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.840
After star formation,

02:09.840 --> 02:11.840
as I said at the beginning,

02:11.840 --> 02:12.560
after star formation,

02:12.560 --> 02:13.920
they will have supernova,

02:13.920 --> 02:16.000
and then they will produce some gravity,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.200
and then they will produce these dusts.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.160
OK.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.440
So that's why these dusts are gathered in the middle.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.760
So basically, this paper tells you

02:25.760 --> 02:28.320
what SMG is.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.560
But what this paper doesn't have is

02:30.560 --> 02:33.120
that it only has DOS and STAR components.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.880
It doesn't have

02:34.880 --> 02:36.640
gas components.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.000
That is, you have to observe through

02:38.000 --> 02:40.160
the plane of the molecule or the plane of the atom.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.920
Because this part is still being developed.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.920
We're still waiting for ALMA

02:43.920 --> 02:47.440
to build more instruments

02:47.440 --> 02:49.520
so that we can get this part of the observation.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.200
This is also the focus of SMG

02:51.200 --> 02:52.720
for the next few years.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.320
After you have this component,

02:54.320 --> 02:55.920
you can draw it on the map.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.520
Then you can compare

02:57.520 --> 02:59.680
the behavior of STAR, DOS, and gas.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.120
You can learn more about their dynamics.

03:03.120 --> 03:03.920
OK.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.680
That's all I want to say.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.640
I'm going to briefly introduce

03:08.640 --> 03:09.680
what this field is for,

03:09.680 --> 03:11.680
and then talk about my little project.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.920
And then the last few slides

03:13.920 --> 03:17.520
talk about what ALMA can do in the future.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.720
Thank you, everyone.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.280
Thank you, Xu Liyan.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.280
I've been talking for two hours.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.280
Do you have any questions?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.640
Yes, two hours.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.640
Do we have enough time?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.640
You can ask a few more questions.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.640
Do you have any questions?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.640
I'm not in a hurry.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.640
No, I...

03:46.640 --> 03:50.640
No problem. We can record for five hours.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.640
No, no, no.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.960
I have a question.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
I'm more interested in engineering technology.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
You mentioned that

03:58.960 --> 04:00.960
some measurements are slower.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.960
For example, SMA is slower than ALMA.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.960
Specifically,

04:04.960 --> 04:06.960
in terms of engineering or technology,

04:06.960 --> 04:08.960
which link

04:08.960 --> 04:10.960
makes it slower?

04:10.960 --> 04:12.960
Basically, it's...

04:12.960 --> 04:14.960
Let me talk about my understanding

04:14.960 --> 04:16.960
of astronomical telescope first.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.960
Then you help me see if it's right or wrong.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.960
As far as I know,

04:21.280 --> 04:23.280
the antenna

04:23.280 --> 04:25.280
receives radio signals.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.280
No matter what kind of wavelength it is,

04:27.280 --> 04:29.280
it's basically an electromagnetic wave.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.280
It receives electromagnetic wave signals

04:31.280 --> 04:33.280
and processes them

04:33.280 --> 04:35.280
through the computer.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.280
For example,

04:37.280 --> 04:39.280
it combines signals from different regions

04:39.280 --> 04:41.280
to make some visualizations.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.280
My understanding of astronomical telescope

04:43.280 --> 04:45.280
is like this.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.280
I don't know if it's wrong.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.280
Hello?

04:53.280 --> 04:55.280
Am I disconnected?

05:03.280 --> 05:05.280
Hello?

05:05.280 --> 05:07.280
Hello?

05:07.280 --> 05:09.280
I'm disconnected.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.280
Julian, did you mute yourself?

05:17.280 --> 05:19.280
Hello?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.600
Hello?

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
Can you hear me?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
Yes, I can hear you.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.600
I just disconnected.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.600
Okay, continue.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.600
So where did you hear it just now?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.600
You said the antenna

05:35.600 --> 05:37.600
receives all electromagnetic wave signals.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.600
It receives electromagnetic wave signals

05:39.600 --> 05:41.600
and then

05:41.600 --> 05:43.600
a large part of it

05:43.600 --> 05:45.600
is processed by the computer

05:45.600 --> 05:47.600
after receiving electromagnetic wave signals.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.920
It combines signals from different regions

05:49.920 --> 05:51.920
to make visualizations.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.920
If my understanding is correct,

05:53.920 --> 05:55.920
when you say

05:55.920 --> 05:57.920
an astronomical telescope

05:57.920 --> 05:59.920
is slower than another,

05:59.920 --> 06:01.920
which part is slower?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.920
Basically,

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
SMA only has 8 dashes.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.920
ELMA has more than 60 dashes.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.920
That's basically it.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
So it's like

06:13.920 --> 06:15.920
more dashes

06:16.240 --> 06:18.240
at the same time?

06:18.240 --> 06:20.240
It's called

06:20.240 --> 06:22.240
collecting area.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.240
So...

06:24.240 --> 06:26.240
I'm still online.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.240
I can see you.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.240
It's basically

06:30.240 --> 06:32.240
collecting area.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.240
It has more than 60 dashes.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.240
I can hear you.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.240
SMA only has 8 dashes.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.240
But SMA can't add more dashes.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.560
Yeah.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.560
To put it simply,

06:46.560 --> 06:48.560
it can observe

06:48.560 --> 06:50.560
a larger area.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.560
So you have more dashes in total.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.560
So effectively,

06:54.560 --> 06:56.560
you collect

06:56.560 --> 06:58.560
more electromagnetic waves.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.560
I see.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.560
That's it.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.560
SMA

07:06.560 --> 07:08.560
has been doing some upgrades.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.560
It can't add

07:10.880 --> 07:12.880
more dashes,

07:12.880 --> 07:14.880
but it can collect

07:14.880 --> 07:16.880
more electromagnetic waves.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.880
What does that mean?

07:18.880 --> 07:20.880
It means

07:20.880 --> 07:22.880
how much electromagnetic waves

07:22.880 --> 07:24.880
a telescope can collect.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.880
Now,

07:28.880 --> 07:30.880
a telescope

07:30.880 --> 07:32.880
can collect

07:32.880 --> 07:34.880
32...

07:34.880 --> 07:36.880
32 GHz

07:36.880 --> 07:38.880
of electromagnetic waves.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.200
On the other hand,

07:41.200 --> 07:43.200
ALMA is not that big.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.200
ALMA is only 8 GHz.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.200
Yeah.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.200
But SMA can only

07:49.200 --> 07:51.200
make up for it.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.200
It doesn't add more dashes,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.200
but it can increase

07:55.200 --> 07:57.200
the frequency of each individual dash.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.200
So it can collect

07:59.200 --> 08:01.200
more electromagnetic waves

08:01.200 --> 08:03.200
at the same time.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.200
Yeah.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.200
But it's not enough.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.520
Yeah.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.520
So...

08:17.520 --> 08:19.520
Is there anything else?

08:19.520 --> 08:21.520
He's not here.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.520
His signal

08:23.520 --> 08:25.520
seems to be lagging.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.520
No.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.520
I'm here.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.520
Is there

08:31.520 --> 08:33.520
Jenny?

08:33.520 --> 08:35.520
Is there anything else?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.840
Is Jenny here?

08:37.840 --> 08:39.840
She hasn't asked a question.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.840
If possible,

08:43.840 --> 08:45.840
I'd like to ask another question.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.840
At the beginning,

08:47.840 --> 08:49.840
you mentioned astronomy

08:49.840 --> 08:51.840
and cosmology.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.840
What's the difference?

08:53.840 --> 08:55.840
Astronomy is about the universe.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.840
It's hard to define.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.840
Basically,

08:59.840 --> 09:01.840
I think

09:01.840 --> 09:03.840
astronomy and cosmology

09:04.160 --> 09:06.160
can be seen as

09:06.160 --> 09:08.160
two different areas

09:08.160 --> 09:10.160
with overlapping.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.160
But they are not the same

09:12.160 --> 09:14.160
or completely different.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.160
They overlap.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.160
I can explain it this way.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.160
For example,

09:22.160 --> 09:24.160
if someone studies

09:24.160 --> 09:26.160
the distribution of dark matter

09:26.160 --> 09:28.160
in the universe,

09:30.160 --> 09:32.160
to understand the evolution of the universe

09:32.480 --> 09:34.480
to understand the distribution

09:34.480 --> 09:36.480
of dark matter in the universe

09:36.480 --> 09:38.480
and to influence

09:38.480 --> 09:40.480
dark matter...

09:40.480 --> 09:42.480
Have you heard of dark matter?

09:42.480 --> 09:44.480
The distribution of dark matter

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
affects the formation of the galaxy.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.480
The formation of the galaxy.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
This is basically cosmology.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.480
But it's also astronomy.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.480
Because it's related to the evolution of the galaxy.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.480
As long as it's related to the evolution of the galaxy,

09:58.480 --> 10:00.480
it's related to our observations of the galaxy.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.800
If you use a microscope

10:02.800 --> 10:04.800
or a sub-millimeter or a radio,

10:04.800 --> 10:06.800
you have to use astronomy to observe.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.800
This is astronomy.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.800
Cosmology is also astronomy.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.800
But some things

10:12.800 --> 10:14.800
are purely cosmology.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.800
For example,

10:16.800 --> 10:18.800
pure cosmology

10:18.800 --> 10:20.800
is basically physics.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
For example,

10:22.800 --> 10:24.800
the study of the explosion theory.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.800
I just...

10:30.800 --> 10:32.800
For example,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.800
the study of the early universe.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.800
The explosion theory is

10:36.800 --> 10:38.800
the early universe to the Big Bang.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.800
After that,

10:40.800 --> 10:42.800
there was a period of very crazy expansion.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
This part

10:44.800 --> 10:46.800
is very theoretical.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
It's hard for us

10:48.800 --> 10:50.800
to actually observe.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.800
It's all physical models.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.800
You have to understand very deep theoretical physics.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.800
This kind of thing

10:56.800 --> 10:58.800
I will classify it

10:59.120 --> 11:01.120
as pure physics.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.120
Basically, it's cosmology,

11:03.120 --> 11:05.120
but not astronomy.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.120
You can say that.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.120
The other part is astronomy,

11:09.120 --> 11:11.120
but not cosmology.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.120
It's a good example. For example,

11:13.120 --> 11:15.120
some people study small stars,

11:15.120 --> 11:17.120
study comets,

11:17.120 --> 11:19.120
or study

11:19.120 --> 11:21.120
very basic star formation.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.120
But it's not my kind of star formation.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.120
It's a star formation one by one.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.120
It studies stars,

11:27.440 --> 11:29.440
such as small stars and comets.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.440
It studies these things

11:31.440 --> 11:33.440
at a close distance.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.440
It's not like

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
when I study galaxies,

11:37.440 --> 11:39.440
I will talk about redshifts.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.440
If you study solar systems,

11:41.440 --> 11:43.440
small stars and comets,

11:43.440 --> 11:45.440
you won't use the concept of redshifts.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.440
Because they are too close to us.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.440
I just said that redshifts are mainly...

11:49.440 --> 11:51.440
Of course, there are many kinds of redshifts.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.440
They will use Doppler redshifts,

11:53.440 --> 11:55.440
because they have Doppler redshifts as soon as they move.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.760
Cosmological redshifts,

11:57.760 --> 11:59.760
because the universe is expanding,

11:59.760 --> 12:01.760
they will observe this effect.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.760
If you study

12:03.760 --> 12:05.760
very close stars,

12:05.760 --> 12:07.760
study comet formation,

12:07.760 --> 12:09.760
they won't use cosmological redshifts.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.760
They will observe that any

12:11.760 --> 12:13.760
blue and redshifts are Doppler effects.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.760
Basically, when you study these things,

12:15.760 --> 12:17.760
you don't need to consider

12:17.760 --> 12:19.760
the evolution of our universe.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.760
You don't need to consider

12:21.760 --> 12:23.760
whether there is dark energy

12:24.080 --> 12:26.080
or dark matter.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.080
So,

12:28.080 --> 12:30.080
these things will be classified as pure astronomy.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.080
They don't have cosmological redshifts.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.080
I feel a little bit

12:36.080 --> 12:38.080
like that.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.080
Basically, this is what I want to say.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.080
Because people in this field

12:42.080 --> 12:44.080
will have a better feeling.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.080
Okay, thank you.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.080
Because

12:56.080 --> 12:58.080
the time is a bit late,

12:58.080 --> 13:00.080
we will end here today.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.080
Okay, thank you.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.080
Can you still hear me?

13:04.080 --> 13:06.080
I know I can hear you.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.080
I'm just a little bit laggy.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.080
Okay, let's thank Xu Liyan again.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.080
Okay, thank you.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.080
Okay, that's it. See you next week.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.080
Okay, bye bye.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.080
Bye bye.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.080
