0	29000	Ok, welcome everyone to today's Tara Talk. I'm today's host, Zhang Yanyong. We are very honored to be able to invite our speaker today, Lu Yi, which is a very special field. Because most of our Tara Talks are based on material science or science, but today we invited Lu Yi to talk about the topic of material science.
29000	42000	The topic that Lu Yi will talk about is the discussion of copyright in streaming, a comparison of the U.S. and European regimes, understanding streaming and copyright.
42000	53000	Lu Yi is currently a candidate for the doctorate of law at the University of Washington. His main field is the law of intellectual property rights, anti-Thorax and economic analysis.
53000	68000	At the same time, he also served as a legal advisor to the 2H online store during his time at school. He is now in the doctoral class. Before he was in the doctoral class, he was an intern at the U.S. and European law firms in Washington.
69000	79000	He is also very interested in the spirit of entrepreneurs, so he joined the China Entrepreneurship Interaction Association to serve as a counselor.
80000	92000	He regularly holds meetings and talks to promote the spirit of entrepreneurs in Taiwan. Before he came to the United States, he was an intern at the U.S. Department of Justice.
92000	104000	During his time at school, he represented Taiwan in the international business dialogue in Germany and the Harvard-Asia International Relations Conference.
105000	110000	He also has a very handsome photo on my bio. If you are interested, please take a look.
110000	124000	Before he came to the United States, he represented Taiwan in the international business dialogue in Germany and the Harvard-Asia International Relations Conference. He also has a very handsome photo on my bio. If you are interested, please take a look.
124000	129000	If you are interested, please take a look.
154000	172000	The online streaming service we use now is also part of the online streaming service. In fact, the online streaming service has changed a lot of human privacy habits, including YouTube and Hulu.
172000	189000	I think this is all streaming and Netflix. These are all things in streaming. What I want to share with you today is the controversy of streaming in the production industry, especially in the United States and Europe.
189000	205000	This is my outline today. I will share with you briefly. Because today's PowerPoint is shared by me in the seminar at the Department of Justice, so the content may be a bit deep for everyone.
205000	224000	First, if you have any questions, you can interrupt me at any time. Second, because I am thinking about everyone's state, I will not talk so deeply in each session. If you have any more detailed questions, you can ask me in person or leave a message to ask me.
224000	240000	This is the order of my speech today. First, I will tell you why I am doing this research and how I do it. Next, I will start with a little bit of technology.
240000	257000	This technical aspect is not as much data as Li Gong-ge. I will only briefly talk about the background structure of the streaming service. Fourth, I will take some European and American cases related to streaming and compare them.
257000	280000	In the end, I will find that some companies are often neglecting certain things. I hope to make some suggestions. If the audience here is interested in this field in the future, you can listen to it and refer to my thoughts.
281000	299000	There are many online streaming services, including music streaming, video streaming, audio streaming, and news streaming. As everyone knows, there are Amazon, Spotify, Hulu, and Netflix.
299000	316000	This is the background. In addition to doing wireless TV, traditional media is now jumping in to do streaming, such as NBC and ABC.
316000	333000	Next, I will talk about why we should pay attention to streaming. In the lower right corner, there is a name called Cleaning Perkins. This is one of the most famous startups in the U.S. and is dedicated to the so-called network industry or network entrepreneurship.
333000	350000	At the beginning of this year, Cleaning Perkins published a research report. It shows that consumers are using the internet, and companies are investing in it. This is a very interesting intersection.
350000	365000	This shows the perspective of corporate investment. In the past, corporate investment has been invested in traditional media, such as TV or large-screen advertising.
365000	383000	At the end of this year, net investment will exceed the investment of traditional media. What does this show?
383000	402000	It shows that companies are slowly shifting their investment in advertising or marketing budgets from traditional media to the internet. At the end of this year, net investment will exceed the investment of traditional media.
402000	416000	Let's talk about corporate investment first, and then look at it from the perspective of the market.
416000	444000	In 2017, when the market was estimated, this report is from McKinsey, a well-known management company. McKinsey predicts that in terms of consumer consumption, the year-on-year growth rate is still increasing compared to 2014.
444000	466000	If you look at the three numbers, the North American market, North America, Western Europe, and Central Eastern Europe, in 2017, they still accounted for about half of the total number.
466000	486000	This is why I choose to compare the European and American systems. This is from the perspective of per capita consumption. From the perspective of the company, the investment is slowly increasing, and the per capita consumption is increasing.
486000	501000	The market is still concentrated in the North American and European markets. This is one of the main reasons why I want to research. I will focus on the US and European markets.
501000	519000	Next, I will talk about my core research. First is the structure. The structure of streaming is mainly divided into three parts. The first part is the aggregation on the far left.
519000	536000	The aggregation means that if the structure of streaming is used as a metaphor for television, it only changes the signal of streaming from wireless or wired to the Internet.
536000	553000	To put it simply, the structure of the background is actually divided into three parts. The first part is aggregation. Aggregation is to create content from television or major media companies.
553000	566000	These streaming will collect these signals and put them on the cloud. I think everyone has heard of the storage format on the cloud, which is called MP4.
566000	593000	MP4 compresses the storage process, allowing the original wireless or wired signal to become a cloud storage format. MP4 allows the streaming to be relatively stable.
593000	609000	MP4 is also a technology standard that has always been in the spotlight. Maybe in a few years, it will no longer be MP4. It may be faster and more fluid. Of course, there are many reasons why the Internet media will lag.
609000	624000	The storage format is one of them. MP4 becomes a very important part of the entire structure of streaming in the second stage of storage. After storage, it is sent.
624000	644000	In fact, in the part of the delivery, it will also be converted from the storage format to the delivery format. I won't go into detail about the delivery format. If you are interested, you can check on the Internet what HLS is, what MPEG-DASH is, and what Smooth Streaming is.
644000	659000	Basically, it is converted from the storage format to the delivery format. There is a thing called Streaming Endpoint in the middle. Streaming Endpoint is a bit like a Chinese book concept.
659000	679000	It means that when it is converted from storage to delivery, Streaming Endpoint allows consumers to watch these videos without lagging. This is the main structure of streaming. I converted the original signal into a storage format and then sent it out.
679000	699000	In the process, it is smooth, but there is a storage in the middle and the so-called gathering process. The question will appear at the very beginning, which is gathering. Why is gathering a common problem in streaming?
700000	704000	Let's go back to the paper itself.
705000	726000	Sorry, let me interrupt. There is a question about this page. The feature of streaming is that it can store the data in the cloud and then have a distribution. You mentioned today that you want to focus on areas, such as the United States and Europe.
726000	745000	But if today you can imagine that someone is in Asia and he can somehow use VPN to watch Netflix data in areas other than Asia. In this case, where should we focus on the discussion of the law or how to define the area itself?
746000	768000	This question is quite interesting. From my perspective, if the storage is in another country, but if you look at the legal aspect, you have to choose a country to sue him, right?
769000	782000	If the storage is in another country, but you sue him in the United States, this question will appear in the issue of evidence collection.
783000	792000	You can say goodbye to someone, but if the storage is in another country, there will be an issue of evidence collection.
792000	808000	For example, we may have heard of a very famous case before, which is that Mega Upload was sacked by the United States. I don't know if you know about Mega Upload.
808000	822000	Mega Upload is an online sharing platform, which is a bit like P2P file sharing, which is very similar to Grokster. After he was sacked in the United States, he moved his server to Australia.
823000	832000	You can't catch him in the United States. The United States does not have the authority to catch him, and only Australia can catch him.
832000	849000	So that's Mega Upload. I think the interesting thing about streaming is the aggregation part, which sometimes uses different methods to collect signals.
849000	855000	I don't know if this answers your question, because this question is quite interesting.
856000	867000	I don't know if this answers your question, because this question is quite interesting.
867000	873000	He said yes. OK, thank you. I guess I'll talk more about it later.
874000	888000	But I think this question is interesting. If you put it in another country, the structure is the same in Europe and the United States.
888000	898000	But in different regions, there are different technical restrictions, as just mentioned by the questioner.
898000	912000	For example, I am in the United States, so I can't let Asians see it. This is stipulated in the contract.
912000	925000	The contract comes from the front end, which is the so-called media company. He will stipulate that if you are downstream, such as streaming, you can play my media.
925000	932000	Then I have to have regional restrictions. If I don't do it, then you violate the contract. That's another question.
932000	942000	I hope this answers your question. Next, let's talk about the legal part.
942000	954000	I will talk about these two cases. I think the first case in the copyright industry is that ABC sued Aureo.
954000	968000	Aureo has fallen because of this case. After half a year, Fox sued Dish Network. If you are in the United States, you must have heard of Dish Network.
968000	980000	What happened to the two of them? ABC sued Aureo because Aureo was still alive.
980000	993000	I emphasize that because Aureo is no longer alive. When Aureo was alive, he provided a very powerful service. He opened a platform on the Internet, and each consumer paid $12 per month.
993000	1009000	After paying $12, you can choose the channels you want. After choosing these channels, Aureo will catch the signal according to the list you choose.
1009000	1020000	If you are sensitive, you should be able to catch the signal. Did Aureo give money to these broadcasters? No.
1020000	1033000	He used technology to catch these signals. After catching the signal, he stored it on his cloud. After storing the cloud, he sent it to the consumer and received $12 per month.
1033000	1045000	This is how Aureo made money. Of course, it's funny that Aureo sued Dish Network in January 2013.
1045000	1059000	This is a very obvious violation. Because you didn't pay money at all. The problem is back to the aggregation part. The source of the signal is illegal.
1059000	1073000	You didn't give money to these broadcasters. Of course, these broadcasters will be angry and jump. Because they can't get a dime. Your client paid money to Aureo, but Aureo did not give money to them.
1073000	1085000	This is a very obvious violation. The problem is back to the aggregation part. The source of the signal is illegal. The problem is back to the aggregation part.
1085000	1105000	This is a very obvious violation. The source of the signal is illegal. The problem is back to the aggregation part. The source of the signal is illegal.
1105000	1120000	The name of the previous broadcaster is that you did not pass my authorization to steal my signal and play it today, so it violates my right to broadcast publicly.
1120000	1137000	Most people here do not know the status of the U.S. law. The status of the U.S. law is similar to that of Taiwan's constitutional court.
1137000	1160000	The U.S. Constitutional Court will only accept less than 50 cases a year. The U.S. Supreme Court will only accept cases that have a serious legal explanation.
1161000	1175000	The U.S. Supreme Court will only accept cases that have a serious legal explanation.
