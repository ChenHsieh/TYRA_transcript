0	3000	If you have any questions, you can just type them in the chat box.
4000	6000	No, he just said to start recording.
7000	9000	Because when I pressed it, he told me that my memory was full.
9000	11000	Okay, I'm going to turn off the microphone now.
11000	12000	Okay, bye bye.
15000	20000	Yeah, so if you have any questions later, you can just type them in the chat box.
20000	23000	Or you can just turn on your microphone and ask questions.
23000	24000	It doesn't matter.
24000	31000	Because in fact, this video, if I were to talk to a person who does biological math, it would be about 20 minutes.
32000	35000	But in fact, I think it should be far more than that.
35000	43000	Because I hope to let everyone, even if it's not a biological math background, to get a little bit of an idea of what I'm doing.
43000	44000	At least have a concept.
45000	47000	Okay, I'm going to start.
47000	56000	My topic today is mainly to discuss how a cell decides to extend itself in one direction.
57000	63000	As you can see, the nerve cell on the left side of the projection film, it only extends in one direction.
64000	66000	Or it extends in many directions.
66000	69000	Like the nerve cell on the right, it extends in many directions.
70000	73000	So how does it control such a mechanism?
74000	76000	This is actually a very, very big problem.
76000	81000	And in different biological systems, they may use different methods to control it.
81000	87000	But no one has actually asked this question yet.
88000	98000	So today I'm going to use the mechanism that we already know, the mechanism that the organism extends in a certain direction.
98000	108000	Let's understand this mechanism and then study what kind of nature it has to decide whether it extends in one direction or in many directions.
109000	116000	So my topic today is Principles that Govern Competition or Coexistence in Rho-GTPase Driven Polarization.
117000	120000	Rho-GTPase is a protein.
121000	122000	It's a very interesting protein.
122000	124000	We're going to go all over it today.
124000	127000	What does polarization mean?
127000	129000	Let me explain it to you now.
130000	132000	First of all, for a cell,
133000	137000	Modeling people often think about how to model a cell.
140000	144000	Generally, you would imagine that you have a cell membrane.
145000	146000	There's a cell tissue inside.
147000	148000	There's a cell box inside.
149000	151000	There's DNA in the cell box.
151000	152000	We don't care about DNA.
152000	156000	All the protein is floating in your cell tissue.
158000	164000	If someone asks me how much of the protein in the cell tissue is dense,
167000	168000	Different proteins are different.
169000	175000	For example, I'll tell you that the density of the protein in the cell tissue is about this much, a fixed number.
176000	177000	Let's make an assumption.
178000	180000	The whole cell is uniform.
181000	186000	The density of the same protein in the cell tissue is basically the same.
188000	194000	In this situation, a cell can't tell which side is the head and which side is the tail.
195000	200000	For a person, it is very important to distinguish between the head and the tail.
200000	202000	Because first of all, you need to know where your head is.
203000	206000	You even need to distinguish between the front and the back.
207000	208000	Front and back.
208000	209000	Back and side.
209000	210000	Left and right.
211000	215000	So a lot of this kind of asymmetry is very important to the cell.
216000	219000	It's not just a whole individual thing for humans.
220000	222000	For a cell, it's the same thing.
223000	226000	For example, if this is a mobile cell,
227000	228000	For example, if this is a tissue,
229000	230000	It needs to know where it's going.
232000	233000	It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.
233000	235000	The tail will shake and it will swim to the other side.
237000	239000	Even if it's not a mobile cell,
240000	245000	It could be, for example, your intestinal mucosa cell.
246000	252000	It needs to know which side is the side with food or poop.
253000	254000	And which side is the side with blood vessels.
255000	258000	Because it's trying to get nutrients from one side to the other.
258000	261000	So it needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.
262000	264000	It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.
265000	267000	So for biological cells,
268000	273000	It's very important to establish this front and back axis.
274000	277000	Usually, the way this is done is
278000	283000	A certain protein may have a completely uniform distribution in the cell.
284000	286000	It needs to go through a certain process.
286000	288000	It needs to gather at the same end of the cell.
289000	291000	And then from that end,
292000	294000	For example, it starts from that end.
295000	297000	The skeleton of the cell grows from there.
298000	301000	For example, if it wants to secrete protein,
302000	305000	The secretion ball will move forward along the cell skeleton.
306000	307000	So it needs to gather the protein to that side first.
308000	310000	After the cell skeleton, it will let everyone go that way.
311000	313000	If this is a long-term cell,
313000	315000	It obviously needs to grow a cell skeleton first.
316000	318000	After the direction of this axis, it needs to go.
319000	324000	The source of all this is that we need to polarize a certain protein.
325000	327000	That's what we call polarization.
328000	330000	It needs to be gathered to the same end.
334000	336000	In the process of polarization,
337000	339000	In fact, it's not just a problem of building an axis.
339000	341000	Another problem is,
342000	344000	Do you want to build an axis, or do you want to build a lot of axes?
345000	347000	Let's say you want to transport something out.
348000	350000	Do you want to transport it to one place at a time,
351000	353000	Or do you want to transport it to a lot of places at a time?
354000	356000	For example, what you see now is
357000	359000	The nerve cells of the hippocampus.
360000	361000	In fact, no matter what nerve cells,
362000	363000	That's pretty much how it grows.
364000	366000	In the beginning, it only grew to one end.
367000	368000	It only grew to one end when it was very small.
369000	371000	Then it started to grow to a lot of places.
372000	374000	These things that grow to a lot of ends,
375000	377000	Things like trees, we call them trees.
378000	382000	The tree is the place where the nerve cells receive information.
383000	386000	After the tree grows, it starts to grow the axis.
387000	388000	It only grows to one end.
389000	391000	A nerve cell has a lot of trees, but it only has one axis.
392000	395000	So it needs to switch from growing to a lot of ends to only one end.
396000	398000	Then the axis will grow very, very long.
399000	400000	So the information that the nerve cells receive
401000	404000	The same information is passed to the same axis.
406000	407000	So obviously, for the nerve cells,
408000	409000	When it grows to one end, when it grows to a lot of ends,
410000	411000	It's a very important thing.
412000	413000	This is the main problem I have today.
414000	416000	Our lab is not actually doing nerve cells.
417000	418000	Our lab is doing hemoglobin.
419000	423000	Hemoglobin is the only thing on top.
424000	427000	It's called Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
428000	429000	In short, hemoglobin,
430000	431000	Hemoglobin is what we brew beer,
432000	433000	Or beer yeast,
434000	436000	Or yeast for making bread.
437000	438000	We often encounter it because
439000	440000	If you put it in a non-oxidative space,
441000	445000	When it eats sugar, it will dilute it into alcohol.
446000	447000	People are a kind of wild creature,
448000	449000	So they love to drink.
450000	451000	So we like hemoglobin very much.
452000	453000	In addition, we often use hemoglobin
454000	455000	It produces a lot of carbon dioxide.
455000	457000	Then it will make the bread fluffy.
458000	459000	Anyway, this is cold knowledge.
460000	461000	I just want to tell you what is hemoglobin.
462000	463000	Hemoglobin is the one we see above.
464000	465000	What hemoglobin does is it will sprout.
466000	467000	If you have read biology in high school,
468000	471000	You will learn the name of sprout growth.
472000	473000	That is to say,
474000	475000	The way hemoglobin gives birth to children is
476000	479000	It will first try to gather a certain protein to one end.
480000	481000	That end will become its head.
482000	484000	It will grow a tooth from the head.
485000	487000	The tooth will become its baby.
488000	489000	Then the tooth will split out again.
490000	491000	It will become a baby.
492000	493000	This is the way hemoglobin gives birth.
494000	495000	So for hemoglobin,
496000	498000	It is very important that it only grows one head.
499000	500000	What is the reason?
501000	502000	Because when it is split up,
503000	504000	Its DNA will be divided into two parts.
505000	506000	Then the average one part is divided to the child,
507000	508000	One part is kept by itself.
509000	510000	If it grows two heads today,
511000	512000	It will have two children.
513000	514000	At this time, it does not know how to divide its DNA.
515000	517000	Many times, the child will only get half of the DNA.
518000	519000	Then it will die.
520000	521000	So for hemoglobin,
522000	523000	It is very important that it only grows one head.
524000	526000	But at the same time,
527000	529000	The one below is also another kind of sprout.
530000	532000	But it is the kind of sprout that grows spores.
533000	534000	But hemoglobin is very close relatives.
535000	536000	They basically use the same system
537000	538000	To decide how to grow their heads.
539000	541000	But the sprout that grows spores
542000	544000	We call it Aspia gossypia.
545000	546000	Aspia gossypia
547000	549000	It does not only grow one part at a time.
550000	551000	Because if it grows like this,
552000	553000	It will grow into a pipe.
554000	556000	It will become a very useless sprout.
557000	558000	One important thing for it is that
559000	560000	It needs to split up.
561000	562000	If it can grow today,
563000	564000	Then grow forward, split up,
565000	566000	Everyone splits up,
567000	568000	It can grow into a secret net.
569000	570000	That secret net can absorb
571000	574000	The nutrients of the whole land or tree trunk.
575000	576000	So for these sprouts,
577000	578000	It is important to grow many heads at a time.
579000	581000	But controlling how they grow their heads
582000	584000	Is to decide the protein at the end of their heads
585000	587000	Is the same kind of protein.
589000	593000	This kind of protein is called Rho-GTPase.
594000	595000	It is called Rho.
596000	597000	This kind of protein is called Rho.
601000	602000	The most important question today is
602000	605000	This Rho-GTPase protein
606000	607000	Why does it have the same mechanism
608000	610000	To decide these two different results?
611000	612000	What kind of method
613000	615000	Can control it to grow one part or two parts?
618000	621000	Today, my speech will be divided into two parts.
622000	624000	One part is my theory
625000	626000	To discuss
627000	628000	This Rho-GTPase protein
628000	630000	How does it
631000	633000	From a state of uniformity in a cell
634000	635000	To a state of uniformity in a cell
636000	637000	How does this mechanism
638000	639000	Decide whether it grows one part or two parts?
640000	641000	This is the first part.
642000	643000	This part is mainly used for
644000	646000	Phenolphthalein and some other things.
647000	648000	The second part is
649000	651000	I want to start from the actual biological body
652000	653000	Actually, I'm using yeast.
654000	657000	To verify the knowledge I got from the previous theory
658000	659000	Whether some rules
660000	662000	Are applicable to this biological body.
663000	664000	So I'm going to divide it into two parts.
665000	666000	One part is very mathematical.
667000	668000	You'll see me shaking there.
669000	670000	But you'll see me showing the persimmon
671000	672000	And see my cat running.
673000	674000	The other part
675000	676000	You'll see the video of yeast.
679000	681000	So far, are there any questions?
685000	686000	I have one
686000	687000	Maybe I missed it.
688000	689000	I feel a little weird.
692000	693000	I think you're talking about
694000	695000	These bacteria have
696000	697000	Have consciousness
698000	699000	It can decide what it wants to do.
702000	703000	It's not a bacteria.
704000	705000	It's a cell.
705000	706000	Anyway, you know what I mean.
713000	715000	It decides where it grows.
716000	717000	Is it active?
720000	721000	Actually, it is.
723000	724000	For example, a yeast
725000	726000	There are two ways it grows.
727000	728000	But anyway
733000	734000	Yes, it is active.
735000	736000	The so-called active means
737000	738000	It's not random.
742000	743000	I know it's not random.
743000	744000	Because from the outside
745000	746000	It doesn't look like it's random.
747000	748000	I mean, it decides where it's going to grow.
749000	750000	For example
752000	753000	Let's say there's a plant today.
754000	756000	It's going to grow in the opposite direction of gravity.
757000	758000	Or grow in the direction of gravity.
759000	760000	And then you turn it 90 degrees.
761000	762000	It will find the direction of gravity again.
764000	765000	So it's actually
766000	767000	In the direction of gravity
768000	769000	It's passively deciding where it's going to grow.
770000	771000	Maybe in the middle is some very simple
772000	773000	Some underlying mechanisms of physics
775000	776000	It may not be a conscious process.
780000	781000	But if it's a cell
782000	783000	I can't imagine
784000	785000	It can decide
786000	787000	I want to put all the proteins in the same direction today.
788000	789000	And then it goes in the same direction.
790000	791000	OK
792000	793000	I think I'll answer a simple question first.
794000	795000	If your passive and active definition is like this
796000	797000	If it is
798000	799000	It's a very simple
799000	800000	Today there is a
801000	802000	There is a source of information.
803000	804000	And then it reacts to that source of information.
805000	806000	And then if this simple process is passive
807000	808000	That's right.
809000	810000	It's a passive mechanism.
811000	812000	This is the easy part.
814000	815000	But the hard part
816000	817000	It's not my major.
818000	819000	Maybe it's
820000	821000	So you think consciousness is
822000	823000	It's not a chemical reaction.
824000	825000	Or consciousness
826000	827000	Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.
828000	829000	Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.
830000	831000	With some biological cells
832000	833000	The combination of reactions
834000	835000	It may also
836000	837000	The same pattern
838000	839000	It's the same as getting a message and then reacting.
840000	841000	It's just that this process is very simple.
842000	843000	Or it's a very difficult question.
844000	845000	That's right.
846000	847000	It's hard to answer that part of the question.
848000	849000	And then that part is what I can't answer.
850000	851000	But I think it's an interesting question.
852000	853000	But just the simple part
854000	855000	Yes, it is
855000	856000	You can use a set of message transmission systems
857000	858000	To
859000	860000	To react to external messages
861000	862000	For example, this serum
863000	864000	It's
865000	866000	It's going to be with another kind of
867000	868000	Gender serum
869000	870000	Then it will try to grow there.
871000	872000	The reason is that the other one will release pheromones.
873000	874000	Then it will grow there.
875000	876000	If you think this is passive
877000	878000	That's right. All the processes I talked about today are passive.
879000	880000	OK, thank you.
883000	884000	Are there any other questions?
885000	886000	If not, I'll go down.
887000	888000	Otherwise there is a question.
889000	890000	OK
891000	892000	So
893000	894000	Let me say first that I haven't been on any creatures.
895000	896000	So what I mean is that
897000	898000	It's not like a serum.
899000	900000	For example, you just said that there is a
901000	902000	Gender
903000	904000	Does the serum have a gender?
905000	906000	It's just that you said you want to match that example.
907000	908000	Someone releases pheromones
909000	910000	So this one will grow over there.
911000	912000	So what you mean is that
913000	914000	He can't decide for himself
915000	916000	Contact that
917000	918000	Sexuality
919000	920000	Is that right?
921000	922000	Is that what it means?
923000	924000	As long as someone releases pheromones, he will
928000	929000	not
930000	931000	It should be said
932000	933000	This is what we see.
934000	935000	That is to say, if you give him a group of serum today.
936000	938000	Then you put a group
939000	940000	So the gender of the serum
941000	942000	We will divide A and Alpha.
943000	944000	A and Alpha can be matched
945000	946000	That's it.
947000	948000	So if you put a group of A and a group of Alpha today.
949000	950000	If you mix them together
951000	952000	You can imagine it as a group of boys.
953000	954000	A group of girls all mixed together
955000	956000	At this time, some people will run to
957000	958000	Match with others
959000	960000	Some people will not match with others
961000	962000	Some people don't match
963000	964000	It's because they're in the wrong direction.
965000	966000	Some people are because they
967000	968000	It's not right at all
969000	970000	Pheromones
971000	972000	But
973000	974000	So this is a phenomenon
975000	976000	Is this his decision?
977000	978000	Or did he decide not to say that?
979000	980000	Because I would think
984000	985000	If this environment is for him
986000	987000	It's his mating that's more beneficial to him.
988000	989000	After this mating
990000	991000	After giving birth to a child
992000	993000	If you can adapt to the environment
994000	995000	Those who did not mate successfully
996000	997000	They are likely to be killed by the gods.
998000	999000	Then gradually
1000000	1001000	This group of cells that will react
1002000	1003000	So they are in the process of evolution
1003000	1005000	Learn to react to pheromones
1006000	1007000	Is this a proactive process?
1008000	1009000	I think it's a big question
1010000	1011000	This is how we understand the process
1012000	1013000	But how do you determine
1014000	1015000	Is this a conscious thing?
1016000	1017000	I think it's a big question
1018000	1019000	I just said I can't answer
1020000	1021000	OK, thank you
1025000	1026000	Are there any other questions?
1028000	1029000	Then I'll go down
1030000	1031000	it is good
1034000	1035000	In the past, there have been several studies
1036000	1037000	We gradually realized that
1038000	1039000	These
1040000	1041000	I just talked about
1042000	1043000	It creates a front and back
1044000	1045000	The principle of this polarity
1046000	1047000	Is a
1048000	1049000	This mechanism of our so-called Turing text
1052000	1053000	Turing
1054000	1055000	Everyone should have heard a little bit
1056000	1057000	Because there was a movie a while ago
1057000	1058000	It's called
1059000	1060000	The Mutation Game
1061000	1062000	The handsome guy in it
1063000	1064000	Is playing Alan Turing
1065000	1066000	So everyone should know who Alan Turing is
1067000	1068000	Everyone may know
1069000	1070000	He does computer
1071000	1072000	And he is
1073000	1074000	So-called mechanical consciousness
1075000	1076000	Contribution in this area
1077000	1078000	In fact, he is a super genius
1080000	1081000	I am studying this whole field
1082000	1083000	Biomathematics
1084000	1085000	Basically all
1085000	1086000	What is Turing text?
1087000	1088000	Before
1089000	1090000	Everyone has always had a doubt
1091000	1092000	For example, you see a tiger today
1093000	1094000	It has a pattern
1095000	1096000	You see a leopard, it has a pattern
1097000	1098000	You see some fish
1099000	1100000	It may have a pattern on it
1101000	1102000	The pattern becomes a pattern
1103000	1104000	These patterns
1105000	1106000	How did it come out?
1107000	1108000	How did these patterns come out?
1109000	1110000	If you say there is something
1111000	1112000	To control these patterns
1113000	1114000	That controls its thing
1115000	1116000	So you have to go forward
1117000	1118000	Then found
1119000	1120000	It seems
1121000	1122000	It seems to be in a certain step
1123000	1124000	That pattern will need
1125000	1126000	There is a way to self-release
1127000	1128000	From a completely uniform state
1129000	1130000	Pattern comes out
1131000	1132000	It does not need to be controlled at all
1133000	1134000	It will automatically grow a pattern
1135000	1136000	So everyone is very confused
1137000	1138000	What does this machine look like?
1139000	1140000	Alan Turing
1141000	1142000	First, with a very simple partial equation
1142000	1143000	This conclusion
1145000	1146000	He said
1147000	1148000	If this cell is good
1149000	1151000	Or a piece of land
1152000	1153000	If it has two chemical substances
1154000	1155000	One is activator
1156000	1158000	Then the other is substrate
1159000	1160000	One is
1163000	1164000	How to say activator?
1165000	1166000	Activator should be easy to understand
1167000	1168000	What it does is activate
1169000	1170000	The other thing is substrate
1170000	1171000	This is its value
1172000	1173000	What does activator do?
1174000	1175000	Once there is this activator
1176000	1177000	It will have a positive feedback
1178000	1179000	Then let more activators grow
1180000	1181000	Activator in the process of growing
1182000	1184000	It absorbs the value and becomes activator
1185000	1186000	For example
1187000	1188000	There may be an activator today
1189000	1190000	The process of its positive feedback
1191000	1192000	He went to catch another substrate
1193000	1194000	Then turn that substrate into activator
1195000	1196000	So in this process
1197000	1198000	Once activator grows
1198000	1199000	He will have a positive feedback
1200000	1201000	To make himself more and more
1202000	1203000	But at the same time
1204000	1205000	In this process
1206000	1207000	It will absorb the substrate
1208000	1209000	So the substrate will become less and less
1210000	1211000	If there is such a process
1212000	1213000	With activator
1214000	1215000	It spreads very slowly
1216000	1217000	Then substrate
1218000	1219000	If it spreads very quickly
1220000	1221000	In this way, it will
1222000	1223000	Such a system can make
1224000	1225000	Point
1226000	1227000	A whole piece
1228000	1229000	It can also make a strip
1230000	1231000	It can make a very interesting pattern
1232000	1233000	It can make a counterpoint
1234000	1235000	It can even make a piece
1236000	1237000	No substrate part
1238000	1239000	So the same system
1240000	1241000	As long as you give it different parameters
1242000	1243000	It can run
1244000	1245000	Different pattern results
1246000	1247000	So this is a very interesting thing
1248000	1249000	The picture on the right
1250000	1251000	Is that we took one
1252000	1253000	Entering its black and white photo
1254000	1255000	Then take the photo
1256000	1257000	Its brightness
1258000	1259000	That model will automatically
1260000	1261000	According to the brightness above
1262000	1263000	To run
1264000	1265000	Its pattern is all white
1266000	1267000	Or dot or semicolon
1268000	1269000	In short, this is a very cool thing
1270000	1271000	Everyone realized
1272000	1273000	It turns out that such a system
1274000	1275000	Can make a piece
1276000	1277000	Nothing
1278000	1279000	Run out of the pattern
1280000	1281000	That such a system
1282000	1283000	What does it have to do with the activator I just talked about?
1284000	1285000	The activator is probably like this
1286000	1287000	That is to say
1288000	1289000	Rho-GTPase
1290000	1291000	It is a protein
1292000	1293000	It has two forms
1294000	1295000	One is when it sticks to GTP
1296000	1297000	This form is activator
1298000	1299000	This form is active
1300000	1301000	It can guide the downstream
1302000	1303000	All biological reactions
1304000	1305000	To go to it
1306000	1307000	Then there is another form
1308000	1309000	It is a non-living form
1310000	1311000	It is Rho-GDP
1312000	1313000	It is Rho-GDPase
1314000	1315000	So this protein
1316000	1317000	It has a non-living form of GTP
1318000	1320000	Then it switches between these two forms
1321000	1322000	That
1323000	1324000	When the active Rho-GDP
1325000	1326000	It spreads very slowly
1327000	1328000	Then the active Rho-GDP
1329000	1330000	If it spreads very quickly
1331000	1332000	This becomes a
1333000	1334000	Healing mechanism
1338000	1339000	So actually in the cell
1340000	1341000	The way it works is like this
1342000	1343000	That is to say, we have a Rho-GDP
1344000	1345000	It is stuck on the cell membrane
1346000	1347000	Because it has a tail
1348000	1349000	It is stuck on the cell membrane
1350000	1351000	That
1352000	1353000	Once there is a Rho-GDP
1354000	1355000	It will try to
1356000	1357000	Turn other Rho-GDP
1358000	1359000	Into Rho-GDP
1360000	1361000	So everyone sees that the red arrow
1362000	1363000	Is a positive feedback
1364000	1365000	At the same time, it also has another form
1366000	1367000	Called Rho-GDP
1368000	1369000	I just told you that it is a living form
1370000	1371000	Its tail is wrapped
1372000	1373000	So it can be in the cell
1374000	1375000	Happy in the cell
1376000	1377000	It spreads quickly in the cell
1378000	1379000	There is an
1380000	1381000	Activator substrate system
1382000	1383000	It just happens to be its activator
1384000	1385000	It spreads very slowly
1386000	1387000	Then its substrate spreads very quickly
1388000	1389000	And its activator
1390000	1391000	It has a positive feedback
1392000	1393000	The way we model this thing
1394000	1395000	Is that we have a partial differential equation
1396000	1397000	That is to say
1398000	1399000	If we put the active form
1400000	1401000	Called U
1402000	1403000	The inactive form is called V
1404000	1405000	That
1405000	1406000	The change in time
1407000	1408000	Will determine
1409000	1410000	How fast it spreads
1411000	1412000	And its
1413000	1414000	I just put three arrows on it
1415000	1416000	To give it a reaction
1417000	1418000	At the same time
1419000	1420000	Its V
1421000	1422000	The change in time
1423000	1424000	It depends on how fast it spreads
1425000	1426000	And its chemical reaction
1427000	1428000	It's just a little bit special here
1429000	1430000	Because the reactor
1431000	1432000	That part
1433000	1434000	It's basically
1435000	1436000	If anything grows out of U
1437000	1439000	It must have disappeared from V
1440000	1441000	It can only be exchanged between V and U
1442000	1443000	So its
1444000	1445000	That term
1446000	1447000	It's positive and it's negative
1448000	1449000	What this means
1450000	1451000	Is that the whole system is qualitatively consistent
1452000	1453000	There is no term in here
1454000	1455000	It will automatically
1456000	1457000	Grow out of
1458000	1459000	Rho GDP
1460000	1461000	Or U
1462000	1463000	There is no term
1463000	1464000	Any particle
1465000	1466000	Disappears from the system
1467000	1468000	I have a question
1469000	1470000	Okay
1471000	1472000	That is
1473000	1474000	What is the unit of UV?
1477000	1478000	Is it density?
1479000	1480000	Or something like that
1481000	1482000	Yes, it should be
1483000	1484000	It should be concentration
1485000	1486000	But because it is
1487000	1489000	For example, the concentration on the entire cell membrane
1490000	1491000	So it is
1491000	1493000	It is the change in position and time
1494000	1495000	But it is concentration
1501000	1502000	So this is weird
1503000	1504000	There is a problem with this
1505000	1506000	I think your big D
1507000	1508000	U and big D
1509000	1511000	It's not a dimensionless value
1514000	1515000	That is to say
1516000	1517000	You are discussing
1518000	1519000	A
1519000	1520000	Rho GDP
1521000	1522000	With a Rho GDP
1523000	1524000	Interaction
1525000	1526000	Discuss with you once
1527000	1528000	Ten Rho GDP
1529000	1530000	With ten Rho GDP
1531000	1533000	It won't be the same
1534000	1536000	Because your big D is not dimensionless
1541000	1542000	Do you understand? It can't be multiplied by ten
1543000	1545000	Because it is not a value without units
1550000	1551000	I don't understand
1555000	1556000	Yes, I don't understand
1559000	1560000	I don't understand
1562000	1563000	So U and V are equal
1564000	1565000	You said concentration
1566000	1567000	It's actually a concept of density
1568000	1569000	For example, unit volume
1570000	1571000	At this time
1572000	1573000	At this time, at this position
1574000	1575000	Its density
1576000	1577000	Then DU and DV are the rate of expansion
1578000	1579000	For example, the unit may be
1580000	1581000	The unit should be
1582000	1583000	Every second
1584000	1585000	Then the molecule should be
1586000	1587000	For example, square meters or square meters
1588000	1589000	It should be similar to this concept
1590000	1591000	That is to say
1591000	1592000	DU and DV
1592000	1593000	Its concept should be
1593000	1594000	Every second it can
1594000	1596000	It should be one square meter per second
1597000	1598000	It should be like this
1598000	1600000	How much can it move outward every second
1601000	1602000	Is this outward expansion
1603000	1604000	OK, confirm
1605000	1606000	Yes, that's right
1606000	1607000	But like this
1607000	1608000	What did you just say
1608000	1609000	One U
1609000	1610000	One rho gdp
1610000	1611000	OK, good
1611000	1613000	You remove the big F first
1613000	1615000	Because don't worry about the big F
1616000	1617000	Both sides of this square
1618000	1620000	There is this small U or small V, right?
1621000	1622000	So the two of them
1622000	1623000	The units in this place
1623000	1624000	Will be the same
1625000	1626000	Then you put
1627000	1628000	What is the right side of the square?
1629000	1630000	Divided by two X
1631000	1632000	Then X is the unit of length
1632000	1633000	Then on the left
1633000	1635000	Divided by a T is the unit of time
1636000	1638000	So your unit of big D is actually
1640000	1643000	Distance per square unit time
1646000	1647000	Yes, yes
1647000	1648000	So the dimension on both sides
1648000	1649000	Is it right?
1650000	1653000	But the distance per square unit time
1653000	1654000	This value
1654000	1655000	In your change
1656000	1657000	You discussed
1658000	1660000	This whole distance
1661000	1662000	For example, the size of your change
1663000	1664000	Or you only look at one at a time
1664000	1665000	Or you only look at ten at a time
1665000	1666000	This value will keep running
1666000	1667000	It won't be unchanged
1668000	1669000	Unless you take data
1669000	1671000	Time also changes
1672000	1673000	But it won't
1673000	1674000	Because you take data
1674000	1675000	You keep looking at it every second
1675000	1676000	Keep looking
1676000	1678000	So your value will change
1678000	1679000	From that
1681000	1682000	From that
1683000	1684000	From you
1686000	1687000	OK, all the way to that
1687000	1688000	All the way to that
1688000	1690000	The unit of the expansion constant
1690000	1691000	I followed up
1692000	1694000	And then you said
1694000	1695000	So why does it
1696000	1697000	Why does it change
1698000	1699000	It's a fixed value
1700000	1701000	Then
1702000	1703000	You said why does it change
1703000	1704000	I really don't understand
1705000	1706000	Wait a minute
1706000	1707000	I'm the only one who doesn't understand
1707000	1708000	Is there anyone who can help me
1710000	1711000	Say
1711000	1712000	What does this mean
1713000	1715000	I think it sounds a bit strange
1715000	1716000	Because it
1716000	1717000	Yeah, I understand
1717000	1718000	It's a rate of expansion
1718000	1721000	The rate of expansion should be related to the environment
1721000	1723000	Instead of GDP or GDP
1724000	1726000	For example, you say the rate of expansion
1726000	1727000	Yeah
1727000	1730000	The rate of expansion has nothing to do with GDP or GDP
1730000	1732000	Yeah, if you look at this rate of expansion
1733000	1734000	It should be said that
1734000	1735000	On the cell membrane
1735000	1737000	The rate of expansion is a slower value
1737000	1738000	And then in the cell nucleus
1738000	1740000	The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus
1740000	1741000	The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus
1741000	1743000	It's another faster value
1743000	1744000	But
1744000	1745000	But in
1746000	1747000	In different locations
1747000	1749000	Different time points
1749000	1750000	As long as it is
1751000	1752000	As long as it is on the cell membrane
1752000	1753000	The rate of expansion is the same
1753000	1754000	As long as it is in the cell nucleus
1754000	1755000	The rate of expansion is the same
1756000	1757000	Oh, okay, I know
1757000	1758000	I know how to ask
1758000	1759000	Then I change a question
1760000	1761000	This big D
1762000	1763000	Big D U or big D V
1763000	1764000	These two values
1765000	1767000	What does it have to do with
1771000	1772000	It will be with
1772000	1774000	It will be with the nature of these two cells
1774000	1775000	What kind of cell is it?
1775000	1776000	Right?
1777000	1778000	Correct
1778000	1780000	Is there anything else?
1782000	1783000	No more
1783000	1784000	It's basically
1784000	1785000	Theoretically, you should
1785000	1787000	Theoretically, when you write this governing equation
1787000	1789000	You should hope these two
1789000	1792000	These two numbers are basically used to present
1792000	1793000	To some extent
1793000	1796000	It's just about the relationship between this interaction
1796000	1797000	Right?
1798000	1799000	Just the two of them
1799000	1801000	But if you do
1801000	1803000	No, I mean the two of them
1805000	1807000	If one is a stone
1807000	1808000	Or one is a protein
1808000	1810000	Obviously that D will be very different
1810000	1811000	I can't even write
1811000	1812000	Correct
1812000	1813000	So it is
1813000	1814000	Correct
1814000	1816000	Characterize the nature of your system
1816000	1818000	Or the nature of the unit in the system
1818000	1819000	But
1819000	1820000	It looks like your persimmon
1820000	1821000	Dimension
1822000	1823000	Will still be with
1823000	1825000	For example, how big do you put these cells
1825000	1826000	It doesn't matter to cultivate
1826000	1827000	It looks weird
1827000	1829000	Wait, why am I
1829000	1830000	It looks weird
1830000	1832000	I think I can understand it
1832000	1833000	Then I also know
1833000	1834000	I understand your question
1834000	1836000	I think I understand the question
1836000	1837000	But why
1838000	1839000	That D
1839000	1841000	I guess what you mean is that
1841000	1842000	That D
1842000	1843000	I said Zhang Aiyong
1843000	1844000	What you mean is that
1844000	1845000	That D is not a constant
1845000	1846000	It's actually a variable
1846000	1847000	Right?
1848000	1850000	Will change according to the unit you choose
1850000	1851000	Correct
1851000	1852000	So why is this a problem?
1852000	1853000	So why is this a problem?
1858000	1860000	I can know what that thing is
1860000	1862000	It is a constant
1862000	1863000	Yes, you set a system
1863000	1864000	It is a constant
1864000	1865000	Then you change a system
1865000	1866000	You change a constant
1866000	1868000	So why is this a problem?
1868000	1869000	Yes
1869000	1870000	This is equivalent to
1870000	1871000	Your expansion equation
1871000	1873000	In fact, it is the same as the general heat transfer
1873000	1875000	The expansion equation is the same
1875000	1876000	Yes, it's exactly the same
1876000	1878000	Heat transfer coefficient is related to temperature
1878000	1879000	It changes with temperature
1879000	1881000	No matter what it does
1881000	1883000	It won't be a problem
1883000	1884000	So I don't understand
1884000	1885000	I don't understand what the problem is
1885000	1887000	My feeling is that
1887000	1888000	This thing is not
1888000	1889000	I won't say it's a problem
1889000	1890000	But I will say it's not enough
1892000	1894000	Is it not beautiful enough?
1894000	1895000	Because it actually
1895000	1897000	Yes, it's actually a heat transfer
1897000	1899000	This is a matter of aesthetics
1901000	1902000	Because it's not enough
1902000	1903000	Generalize
1903000	1906000	I think I have to think about it
1906000	1908000	Because I think we've been stuck for a long time
1908000	1910000	It will take up a lot of your time
1912000	1914000	I basically understand this equation
1914000	1916000	Because this is actually
1916000	1918000	It's a heat diffusion equation
1918000	1919000	It's an expansion equation
1919000	1921000	Then add the heat diffusion
1921000	1922000	Yes
1922000	1923000	Ok, let's continue today
1923000	1924000	Thank you, I'm sorry
1925000	1926000	No
1929000	1930000	So
1931000	1932000	That expansion constant
1932000	1933000	It's only two kinds
1933000	1934000	One is
1934000	1936000	One is the expansion constant of U
1936000	1938000	It will be on the film
1938000	1939000	It's a slower value
1939000	1942000	But it's the same in different positions
1943000	1944000	Then
1944000	1946000	The expansion constant of V is faster
1946000	1947000	Bigger
1947000	1949000	Speaking of this, I suddenly thought of
1949000	1950000	You just said
1950000	1952000	Their number
1952000	1954000	Anyway, you just said that
1954000	1956000	Magnitude is called magnitude
1956000	1958000	So you don't need to add another
1958000	1960000	Magnitude equation
1960000	1962000	For example, the total number must be zero
1964000	1965000	No, because he himself
1965000	1966000	He himself
1966000	1968000	I write it like this now
1968000	1969000	He will already be constant
1969000	1971000	The reason is good first
1972000	1973000	The expansion side
1973000	1974000	He will only run to the side
1974000	1975000	He won't
1975000	1976000	He won't disappear, right?
1976000	1978000	So the expansion is already constant
1978000	1980000	What about the part of the reaction?
1982000	1983000	You just disappear
1983000	1985000	Because his reaction rate on the V side
1985000	1987000	Is negative f of uv
1987000	1989000	Then the reaction rate on the U side is
1989000	1990000	f of uv
1990000	1991000	So
1991000	1993000	Anything disappears from V
1993000	1994000	He will use the same rate
1994000	1996000	Come out from U
1996000	1998000	So he will automatically say
1998000	1999000	Yes, I understand
1999000	2000000	OK, thank you
2008000	2009000	What about this system
2009000	2011000	Basically
2011000	2012000	You will see that
2012000	2014000	Rho gtp
2014000	2015000	He is
2015000	2016000	If he is anywhere
2016000	2017000	He has a little bit
2017000	2019000	More rho gtp
2019000	2020000	He will
2020000	2022000	Cause a positive feedback
2022000	2024000	Then he will suck a lot of
2024000	2025000	Substrate
2025000	2026000	Then it becomes
2026000	2028000	Just suck a lot of rho gtp
2028000	2029000	Then it becomes a lot of rho gtp
2029000	2031000	Gathered in that position
2031000	2033000	The problem is now rho gtp
2033000	2034000	At this time it causes a
2034000	2035000	Rho gtp vacuum
2035000	2037000	But in that cell
2037000	2038000	Part of it is
2038000	2039000	It doesn't seem to have
2039000	2041000	Is rho gtp
2041000	2042000	The concentration is very low
2042000	2043000	But at this time
2043000	2044000	Because in the cell
2044000	2045000	His expansion rate is very fast
2045000	2047000	So this concentration vacuum
2047000	2048000	Will be quickly
2048000	2051000	It's the rho gtp in other places
2051000	2053000	Once it's subtracted
2053000	2054000	It will be quickly sucked
2054000	2055000	To the cell membrane
2055000	2057000	So such a mechanism
2057000	2059000	Will quickly put
2060000	2062000	The whole cell
2062000	2063000	Rho gtp
2063000	2064000	All gathered
2064000	2066000	To the same cell membrane
2066000	2067000	To the same cell membrane
2067000	2068000	To the same cell membrane
2068000	2069000	To the same cell membrane
2074000	2076000	This is basically the
2076000	2078000	Turing mechanism
2078000	2079000	In my special example
2079000	2080000	In my special example
2081000	2083000	More intuitive explanation
2085000	2087000	If I plot it directly
2087000	2088000	It will be like this
2088000	2089000	That is to say
2089000	2090000	What you see today
2090000	2092000	The orange text you see here
2092000	2094000	The orange is
2096000	2097000	The x-axis is the position
2097000	2099000	Then the y-axis is
2099000	2100000	The y-axis is the concentration
2102000	2103000	Anyway, this mechanism
2103000	2104000	It will basically let you
2107000	2108000	Random
2108000	2109000	It will automatically grow out
2109000	2111000	All of these objects
2111000	2112000	Will try to gather
2112000	2114000	To the same location
2114000	2115000	Then it will form a
2115000	2116000	Concentration peak
2120000	2122000	According to our understanding of the Turing system
2122000	2123000	That is to say
2123000	2126000	How long is this cell
2126000	2128000	Today is 3 microns
2128000	2129000	If I am today
2129000	2130000	On top of 3 microns
2132000	2133000	Model this system
2133000	2134000	It will grow out a peak
2134000	2136000	But if I use 6 microns today
2136000	2138000	It will grow out
2138000	2140000	It will grow out two peaks
2142000	2143000	But we found
2143000	2144000	The next thing that happens is
2144000	2145000	These two peaks
2145000	2146000	They will
2146000	2147000	There is a bit of competition between them
2147000	2149000	Because they are both
2149000	2152000	Absorbing the same pool value
2152000	2153000	Then so
2153000	2154000	When a peak
2154000	2155000	He grabbed
2155000	2156000	That is, he
2156000	2157000	He will grab another peak
2157000	2158000	When the peak
2158000	2159000	He will put
2160000	2161000	He will absorb
2161000	2162000	Faster than the other
2162000	2163000	Then
2163000	2164000	So he put
2164000	2165000	Another peak
2165000	2166000	Things inside
2166000	2167000	All grabbed
2167000	2168000	So he
2168000	2169000	Although
2169000	2170000	A Turing system
2170000	2171000	Theoretically
2171000	2172000	Like the picture we just saw
2172000	2173000	The same
2173000	2174000	It can grow out a lot of dots
2174000	2175000	But actually
2175000	2176000	In a
2176000	2177000	Energy
2177000	2178000	Quality
2178000	2179000	In the system
2179000	2180000	If you grow a lot of dots
2180000	2181000	A lot of dots
2181000	2183000	They will compete with each other
2183000	2184000	In the end
2184000	2185000	There will only be one
2190000	2191000	So
2191000	2192000	In a quality
2192000	2193000	He will
2193000	2194000	There will be competition
2194000	2196000	That competition will decide
2196000	2197000	He has only one peak
2200000	2201000	We can understand it this way
2201000	2202000	That is to say
2204000	2205000	This part
2205000	2206000	You may have to
2206000	2207000	Just believe me first
2207000	2208000	Just
2208000	2209000	A peak
2209000	2210000	He absorbs
2210000	2211000	Absorbing these
2211000	2212000	The ability of the pool value
2212000	2213000	Actually determines
2213000	2214000	His
2214000	2215000	Concentration of the peak
2215000	2216000	That is
2216000	2217000	The height of his peak
2217000	2218000	Basically
2218000	2219000	Decided
2219000	2220000	His ability to absorb
2220000	2221000	Like the one on the right
2221000	2222000	The one on the right
2222000	2223000	He has a stronger ability to absorb
2223000	2224000	So if you look at his
2224000	2225000	Under the pool value
2225000	2226000	He will also cause
2226000	2227000	A relatively large
2227000	2228000	Valuation vacuum
2228000	2229000	And then
2229000	2230000	He will be more over there
2230000	2231000	That is the concentration of the cell value
2231000	2232000	Will be lower
2232000	2233000	At the same time
2233000	2234000	If you look at the small one
2234000	2235000	Because he has a poor ability to absorb
2235000	2236000	So he won't be so fast
2236000	2237000	Take
2237000	2238000	All the cells under him
2238000	2239000	Grabbed
2239000	2240000	So the cell value under him
2240000	2241000	That one
2242000	2243000	The concentration is higher
2244000	2245000	At this time he caused
2245000	2246000	Say
2248000	2249000	At this time he caused
2249000	2250000	Say here
2250000	2251000	There is a
2251000	2252000	The concentration of the cell value
2252000	2253000	Because in the cell value
2253000	2254000	His
2254000	2255000	His expansion is very fast
2255000	2256000	At this time
2256000	2257000	The substance will be very fast
2257000	2259000	From the small peak on the left
2259000	2260000	Run to the right
2260000	2261000	And then
2261000	2262000	This is what happens at this time
2262000	2263000	That is
2263000	2264000	Everyone
2264000	2265000	Run over
2265000	2266000	Then he will be sucked to the other side
2269000	2270000	This is probably
2270000	2271000	Why two peaks
2271000	2273000	Will compete with each other
2273000	2274000	A
2274000	2275000	Rationale
2278000	2279000	In fact
2279000	2280000	We are in the real
2280000	2281000	There is such a phenomenon
2281000	2282000	In the school drama
2282000	2283000	That is
2283000	2284000	In fact, like me
2284000	2285000	Of course not only
2285000	2286000	One
2286000	2287000	Rho GDP
2287000	2288000	One Rho GDP
2288000	2289000	Between him
2292000	2293000	There are other molecules involved
2293000	2294000	But basically
2294000	2295000	The concept is still the same
2295000	2296000	That is, everyone can still see
2296000	2297000	Say
2297000	2298000	I helped him point
2298000	2299000	Great
2299000	2300000	That is
2302000	2303000	Basically everyone was here
2303000	2304000	See that
2304000	2305000	That positive feedback
2305000	2307000	He is not going to
2307000	2309000	Promote his own activation
2309000	2310000	He is
2310000	2311000	He will catch one
2311000	2312000	One
2312000	2313000	Scaffold
2313000	2314000	Is a framework
2314000	2315000	Protein
2315000	2316000	That protein
2316000	2317000	Will stick to another
2317000	2318000	A protein called GAP
2318000	2319000	But this GAP
2319000	2320000	Its role is
2320000	2322000	It is used to put
2322000	2323000	Rho GDP
2323000	2324000	Becomes Rho GDP
2324000	2325000	So once there are so many
2325000	2326000	Rho GDP
2326000	2327000	After that
2327000	2328000	He will call out this green
2328000	2329000	And this yellow
2329000	2330000	Then this yellow
2330000	2331000	Will try to turn blue into yellow
2331000	2332000	So this
2332000	2333000	This one
2333000	2334000	Is a positive feedback
2334000	2335000	So basically
2335000	2336000	In the school drama
2336000	2337000	We can see
2337000	2338000	I was just modeling
2338000	2339000	That thing
2340000	2341000	In the school drama
2341000	2342000	We do see
2342000	2343000	If today
2343000	2344000	Don't let that
2344000	2345000	Green
2345000	2346000	This protein
2346000	2347000	It's the one you'll see later
2347000	2348000	The black part
2348000	2349000	Is this green
2349000	2350000	Green protein
2350000	2351000	Or you let this
2351000	2352000	Red red protein
2352000	2353000	He is
2353000	2354000	That Rho GDP
2354000	2355000	In the school drama
2355000	2356000	It's called CC42
2357000	2358000	This protein
2358000	2359000	If you let it shine
2359000	2360000	You'll see later
2361000	2362000	First
2362000	2364000	It will grow out of a lot of points
2364000	2365000	But
2365000	2367000	There will be competition between these different points
2367000	2368000	And then there's only one point left
2368000	2369000	And then there's only one point left
2372000	2373000	Everyone can see
2373000	2374000	These two are the same cell
2374000	2375000	Different proteins
2376000	2377000	There are two
2377000	2378000	And then it becomes one
2378000	2379000	And the one below
2379000	2380000	It's the same
2380000	2381000	It's
2381000	2382000	At first
2382000	2383000	There will be two points
2383000	2384000	And then these two points
2384000	2385000	Finally it becomes a point
2387000	2388000	Excuse me
2388000	2389000	So this competition
2391000	2392000	This is not a simulation
2392000	2393000	This is real
2395000	2396000	Yeah, this is from the microscope
2396000	2397000	See below
2397000	2398000	If
2398000	2399000	If you put that protein
2399000	2401000	If you put a fluorescent protein on top
2401000	2402000	And then it's under the microscope
2402000	2403000	Recording
2403000	2404000	Recording the fluorescence
2407000	2408000	And then
2408000	2409000	Yeah, I'm turning black and white now
2409000	2410000	So
2410000	2411000	The fluorescent part is black
2413000	2414000	Hi, I have a question
2416000	2417000	I've been looking
2417000	2418000	I've been looking for trouble
2418000	2419000	It's
2419000	2420000	My question is
2420000	2422000	It's the time under the video
2422000	2423000	Is that unit a second?
2425000	2426000	It's a second
2426000	2427000	A few minutes, a few seconds
2427000	2428000	So it's time under the video
2429000	2430000	So
2431000	2432000	This whole video
2432000	2433000	It's probably
2433000	2434000	What ten minutes or something
2435000	2436000	Yeah
2436000	2437000	And then he competed
2437000	2438000	This process is probably
2438000	2439000	It will end in less than three minutes
2439000	2441000	How much is the distance between the two points
2443000	2445000	The diameter of the entire cell
2445000	2446000	It's about
2446000	2447000	Five
2447000	2448000	Millimeters
2449000	2450000	No, no, no
2450000	2451000	Millimeters
2452000	2454000	It's ten to the sixth square meter
2454000	2455000	Millimeters
2456000	2457000	It's the diameter
2457000	2459000	So the distance between the two points is about
2460000	2461000	Two meters
2461000	2463000	So this kind of cell
2463000	2464000	In the spread
2465000	2466000	Speed
2467000	2468000	Will
2468000	2469000	In this ten-odd minutes
2470000	2471000	Will be less than
2471000	2473000	The distance between the two points
2476000	2477000	Otherwise
2477000	2478000	Your F
2478000	2480000	The parameters should have time
2481000	2482000	It won't be
2482000	2483000	Because you wait
2483000	2484000	Interaction is infinite
2487000	2488000	It's not
2488000	2489000	Every moment
2489000	2490000	To achieve its effect
2490000	2491000	Like this
2493000	2495000	The F inside
2495000	2496000	Is
2497000	2499000	The parameters of the reaction rate inside
2499000	2500000	There is time
2502000	2503000	It's
2503000	2504000	It's in the F
2504000	2505000	Will be
2505000	2506000	Every second
2506000	2507000	How much
2507000	2509000	How much more can be generated every second
2509000	2510000	How much
2510000	2511000	The concentration of U
2511000	2512000	Directly like this
2512000	2513000	The parameter in front
2513000	2514000	There is time
2516000	2517000	OK
2519000	2520000	I also have a question
2521000	2522000	That is
2522000	2524000	GTP will consume GDP
2524000	2526000	That consumption is
2526000	2527000	Will
2527000	2528000	As long as there is GDP
2528000	2530000	It will definitely consume it
2530000	2531000	Or
2531000	2532000	It has a certain criteria
2532000	2533000	To a certain extent
2533000	2535000	Even if it has GDP around it
2535000	2536000	It doesn't care
2539000	2540000	No, we are
2540000	2541000	We are
2541000	2542000	We didn't imagine
2542000	2543000	It has a threshold
2543000	2544000	That is
2544000	2545000	As long as it
2548000	2549000	That is
2549000	2550000	GTP will consume
2550000	2551000	That is
2551000	2552000	GDP will consume GDP
2552000	2553000	Right?
2553000	2554000	Then
2555000	2556000	Then I mean
2556000	2557000	This consumption is
2557000	2558000	There is actually one less
2558000	2559000	That is
2559000	2560000	It has a key
2560000	2561000	For example, you can see
2561000	2562000	There are two keys here
2562000	2563000	Right?
2563000	2564000	So it is
2566000	2567000	For example, this one
2567000	2568000	This key rate
2568000	2569000	With
2569000	2570000	Road GDP
2570000	2571000	Is related
2571000	2572000	Then come back
2572000	2573000	The rate is related to
2573000	2574000	Road GDP
2574000	2575000	So today if there is
2575000	2576000	Very little road GDP
2576000	2577000	A lot
2578000	2579000	A lot of road GDP
2579000	2581000	Very little road GDP
2581000	2582000	That
2582000	2583000	Then this positive feedback
2583000	2585000	It will work hard to put the value
2585000	2586000	That is road GDP
2586000	2587000	All become
2587000	2588000	It keeps becoming road GDP
2588000	2589000	Right?
2589000	2590000	Then but
2590000	2591000	Road GDP
2591000	2592000	It is also going back
2592000	2593000	It will also run back
2593000	2594000	So this is a bit
2594000	2595000	Depends on
2596000	2597000	This middle balance
2597000	2598000	So
2598000	2599000	So
2599000	2600000	So GTP
2600000	2601000	That is the pink one
2601000	2603000	Will also have a chance to turn blue
2603000	2604000	It is not
2604000	2605000	Right
2605000	2606000	It is a
2606000	2607000	It is reversible
2607000	2608000	Right
2608000	2609000	Got it
2609000	2610000	Thank you
2611000	2612000	Right
2612000	2613000	So in this
2613000	2614000	In this complex amount
2614000	2615000	It is a two-way arrow
2615000	2616000	In the original simple amount
2616000	2617000	It is also a two-way arrow
2617000	2618000	That is
2618000	2619000	It can run on the model
2619000	2620000	It will fall back
2621000	2622000	But because
2622000	2623000	Because
2623000	2624000	Because if at that point
2624000	2626000	There are a lot of road GDP
2626000	2627000	The positive feedback will keep running
2627000	2628000	It is easy to be sucked
2628000	2629000	Hiding on the model
2635000	2636000	Ok
2637000	2638000	That
2639000	2640000	That's right
2640000	2641000	So we are in the project
2641000	2642000	Sometimes found
2642000	2643000	Indeed this system
2643000	2644000	It will indeed
2644000	2645000	At the beginning
2645000	2646000	Several different
2647000	2648000	Peak
2648000	2649000	That is
2649000	2650000	Several different
2650000	2651000	Different blocks of road GDP
2651000	2652000	But they will compete with each other
2652000	2653000	Until the end
2653000	2654000	There is one
2656000	2657000	That
2657000	2658000	The next question is coming
2658000	2659000	Ok
2659000	2660000	If I told him
2660000	2661000	Um
2662000	2663000	These two road GDP
2663000	2664000	Peak
2664000	2665000	They will definitely compete with each other
2666000	2667000	That
2667000	2668000	Then we solve it
2668000	2669000	Why only get a
2669000	2670000	A
2670000	2671000	A front end
2671000	2672000	Such a question
2672000	2673000	That
2673000	2674000	In this case
2674000	2675000	Those that will grow
2675000	2676000	How does it differ
2676000	2677000	In the end
2677000	2678000	Under what circumstances
2678000	2679000	These road GDPs
2679000	2680000	Peak
2680000	2681000	It will not compete
2681000	2682000	This is my main question
2683000	2684000	And then I found
2684000	2685000	In fact, a very simple thing
2685000	2686000	You just need to increase the length of the cell
2686000	2687000	Long enough
2688000	2689000	That is
2689000	2690000	If it is a short cell
2691000	2692000	It will be over soon
2692000	2694000	But if it is a long cell
2694000	2695000	It actually started
2695000	2697000	It will also compete very quickly
2697000	2698000	But the competition
2698000	2699000	It seems to be competing
2699000	2700000	The speed becomes super slow
2703000	2704000	There is no
2704000	2705000	There will be a little competition at the beginning
2705000	2706000	So it disappeared
2706000	2707000	Just a few
2707000	2708000	This peak and this peak disappeared
2708000	2709000	But in the end
2709000	2710000	These four
2710000	2711000	They seem to stay there all the time
2711000	2712000	Then it lasted
2712000	2713000	A very long time
2716000	2717000	it is good
2717000	2718000	That
2718000	2719000	So why is it like this
2719000	2720000	I slightly
2720000	2722000	Let me confirm
2722000	2724000	If my understanding is not wrong
2724000	2725000	Between them
2725000	2727000	There should still be a rise
2727000	2729000	It's just that it's an equilibrium
2729000	2730000	Does that mean
2731000	2733000	Of course there is a rise between each other
2733000	2734000	That is
2734000	2735000	Yes, they are actually
2735000	2736000	Still competing between each other
2736000	2737000	The speed of that competition
2737000	2739000	Becomes very, very slow
2740000	2741000	That is, the competition at the beginning is very fast
2741000	2742000	I don't know why the competition at the end
2742000	2743000	Very slow
2743000	2745000	If my own understanding
2745000	2746000	According to that
2746000	2748000	If you look at the expansion formula
2748000	2749000	Because it
2749000	2750000	Blue turns red
2750000	2751000	And red turns blue
2751000	2752000	It's two-way
2752000	2754000	So if your distance is long enough
2754000	2757000	If they each reach the local balance
2757000	2758000	Then they are the last
2758000	2759000	Those few peaks
2759000	2760000	Will not compete anymore
2760000	2761000	because
2761000	2762000	Ah yes
2762000	2763000	I mean this
2763000	2764000	It should be like this, right
2764000	2765000	Yes yes
2765000	2766000	It should be like this
2766000	2767000	This meaning
2767000	2768000	Yes
2768000	2769000	I guessed it myself
2769000	2770000	I am
2770000	2771000	Confirm
2771000	2772000	Yes
2773000	2775000	But according to what we said earlier
2775000	2777000	If there are two peaks over there
2777000	2778000	They should compete in the end
2778000	2779000	That is
2779000	2780000	They are right
2780000	2781000	They are indeed
2781000	2782000	Local has reached an equilibrium
2782000	2783000	That is to say
2783000	2784000	You will see this on top
2784000	2785000	There is a small peak
2785000	2787000	There will be a small
2787000	2789000	Concentration
2789000	2790000	There will be a place
2790000	2791000	Is
2791000	2792000	It's more concentrated
2792000	2793000	Then this
2793000	2794000	This value
2794000	2795000	On this side
2795000	2796000	It's a little bit
2796000	2797000	It's a little bit
2797000	2798000	It's a little bit
2798000	2799000	It's a little bit
2799000	2800000	It's a little bit
2800000	2801000	This value
2801000	2802000	With
2802000	2803000	Its activator
2803000	2804000	This is itself
2804000	2805000	Equal
2805000	2806000	Then this side
2806000	2807000	Equal
2807000	2808000	But under this balance
2808000	2809000	The concentration here
2809000	2810000	Will be higher
2810000	2811000	Under this balance
2811000	2812000	The concentration here
2812000	2813000	Will be lower
2813000	2814000	Leading to
2814000	2815000	It will still compete in the end
2815000	2816000	Theoretically
2816000	2817000	This mechanism
2817000	2818000	Should be
2818000	2819000	How long
2819000	2820000	Still have to
2820000	2821000	Have a way
2821000	2822000	To do
2822000	2823000	But if it looks like
2823000	2824000	If the distance is long enough
2824000	2825000	Indeed they
2825000	2826000	The blue line
2826000	2827000	Will have a slope
2827000	2828000	So it will lead to
2828000	2829000	Flow from high
2829000	2830000	But at the same time
2830000	2831000	The orange line
2831000	2832000	Will return
2832000	2833000	Return to blue
2833000	2834000	So it's possible
2834000	2835000	The orange line
2835000	2836000	It will turn blue
2836000	2837000	Speed ​​higher than
2837000	2838000	Blue
2838000	2839000	High place
2839000	2840000	Flow to low place
2840000	2841000	Then they will reach
2841000	2842000	A kind of balance between each other
2842000	2843000	A kind of balance between each other
2843000	2844000	If the distance is long enough
2844000	2845000	If the distance is long enough
2845000	2846000	Ah
2846000	2847000	But because
2847000	2848000	In this system
2848000	2849000	Its blue
2849000	2850000	Its blue
2850000	2851000	Sorry
2851000	2852000	Because in this system
2852000	2853000	Its blue
2853000	2854000	Its blue
2854000	2855000	Its blue
2855000	2856000	Its blue
2856000	2857000	Its blue
2857000	2858000	Its blue
2859000	2860000	So it becomes
2860000	2861000	The effect of blue expansion
2861000	2862000	Will
2863000	2864000	Far greater than red
2864000	2865000	Should say so
2866000	2867000	OK
2867000	2868000	Then
2868000	2869000	Caused
2869000	2870000	Theoretically
2870000	2871000	It should run like this
2871000	2872000	Yes
2872000	2873000	Theoretically it should be competitive
2873000	2874000	Then everyone wait for me
2874000	2875000	It seems that someone
2875000	2876000	Because I'm going to argue
2876000	2877000	Want to enter our house
2877000	2878000	Wait for me
2879000	2880000	Sorry
2881000	2882000	Pervert
2882000	2883000	Pervert
2887000	2889000	Ask them to come in and listen to the speech
2891000	2892000	He is not here now
2892000	2893000	Can't hear it
2894000	2895000	They have a speech
2895000	2896000	They want to talk about that today
2896000	2897000	Just said
2897000	2899000	They want to talk about Maya culture
2904000	2906000	And there is food to eat outside
2906000	2908000	Why do you think they will come in
2913000	2914000	Speaking of this
2914000	2915000	That one
2915000	2917000	Discuss a topic with everyone
2918000	2919000	That is
2919000	2920000	We are now
2920000	2921000	Tara
2921000	2922000	That is the fund
2923000	2925000	In fact, it can explode
2925000	2926000	That is food
2926000	2927000	There is food
2927000	2928000	Because
2929000	2930000	Ah
2930000	2931000	We are now with
2931000	2933000	The education department wrote the grant
2933000	2934000	Is
2934000	2935000	It can be written up to 400 yuan at most
2935000	2937000	But it has to be reported in time
2937000	2938000	That
2939000	2940000	That
2940000	2942000	We only buy this city now
2942000	2944000	So it actually costs more than 100 yuan
2944000	2945000	Less than 200 yuan
2946000	2947000	Then
2949000	2950000	If everyone wants
2950000	2951000	In fact, we think
2953000	2954000	What what
2956000	2957000	No
2957000	2960000	He should be talking to other people outside the door
2960000	2961000	Don't care about him
2961000	2962000	Oh ok
2962000	2963000	Then I will tell him quickly
2965000	2966000	Wait for me
2966000	2967000	We are discussing another thing
2967000	2969000	So if everyone wants to say
2969000	2970000	Every time I open Tara
2970000	2972000	Buy some donuts or something
2972000	2974000	In fact, you can
2975000	2976000	Send me some votes
2977000	2978000	Then
2978000	2980000	I will transfer this money to you
2981000	2983000	Then those votes can be used to report the education
2983000	2985000	Is the account of our project
2985000	2986000	Then everyone can
2986000	2987000	Save a little money
2987000	2988000	Every time you have a meeting
2988000	2989000	You can buy some donuts
2990000	2991000	Then you think about it
2991000	2992000	If you are interested
2992000	2993000	We can discuss
2993000	2994000	Sorry
2994000	2995000	Then you can continue
2997000	2998000	Should
2998000	2999000	Why did you go to find other people
3000000	3001000	Correct
3002000	3003000	Correct
3007000	3008000	Where was I just now
3008000	3010000	Just now everyone is talking about
3010000	3012000	There should be an equilibrium here
3012000	3013000	Then
3013000	3015000	If the distance is too long
3015000	3016000	It should be said
3016000	3018000	If the distance is long to a certain extent
3018000	3019000	Between him
3019000	3020000	Why is there an equilibrium
3020000	3021000	Actually, I don't understand
3022000	3023000	But
3023000	3024000	Let's leave it alone
3024000	3025000	Because now I think
3025000	3026000	Maybe it will be a bit difficult to explain
3026000	3027000	why
3027000	3028000	There will be no equilibrium
3028000	3029000	But
3029000	3030000	Actually we
3030000	3031000	There is a way
3031000	3032000	Directly from
3034000	3035000	This is called
3035000	3036000	Stability Analysis
3036000	3037000	That is to say
3037000	3038000	If I look today
3039000	3040000	Two
3040000	3041000	Exactly the same
3041000	3042000	Peak
3042000	3043000	Then go to see this
3043000	3044000	Peak solution
3044000	3046000	If there is stability in math
3046000	3047000	Will find
3047000	3048000	He
3048000	3049000	In fact, it will never be unstable
3049000	3050000	He will always compete
3050000	3051000	This is already
3051000	3052000	Is
3052000	3053000	This is what we
3053000	3054000	Directly use math to prove
3054000	3055000	Say
3055000	3056000	He will always compete
3056000	3057000	This thing
3057000	3058000	Just me in this speech
3058000	3059000	I usually don't put that
3059000	3060000	Take out the math
3061000	3063000	So I hope everyone can believe me first
3063000	3064000	Say they will definitely compete
3064000	3065000	This thing
3069000	3070000	But I know this is a bit
3070000	3071000	Excessive thing
3071000	3072000	It becomes
3072000	3073000	Everyone just have to believe me
3073000	3074000	But
3074000	3075000	But anyway
3082000	3083000	Yes
3083000	3084000	Then it becomes
3084000	3085000	This is very strange
3085000	3086000	In the end
3086000	3087000	If it is already mathematical proof
3087000	3088000	He just
3088000	3089000	He will definitely compete
3089000	3090000	That is in the end
3090000	3091000	Is
3091000	3092000	In the end
3092000	3093000	Why are they competing
3093000	3094000	The speed will become so slow
3096000	3097000	Later found
3097000	3098000	It's like this
3098000	3099000	That is to say
3099000	3101000	Because at first we guessed the distance
3101000	3102000	Because we are very obvious
3102000	3103000	We just made the distance longer
3103000	3104000	So we guessed the distance at first
3104000	3105000	Then I guess the distance
3105000	3106000	They did it for about half a year
3106000	3107000	I found out later
3107000	3108000	Oh, it's not the distance
3109000	3110000	In fact
3110000	3111000	In fact
3111000	3112000	Will affect the most
3112000	3113000	Is the amount of protein in it
3114000	3115000	Ask us today
3115000	3117000	If we are modeling this system
3117000	3118000	That is to say
3118000	3119000	If it is a small cell today
3119000	3121000	And a big cell
3121000	3122000	Then we all assume
3122000	3123000	At the beginning
3123000	3125000	The concentration of protein in the cell
3125000	3126000	If it's the same
3126000	3127000	Then when I put that cell
3127000	3128000	When it gets longer
3128000	3129000	At the same time
3129000	3130000	I also added all the protein
3132000	3133000	So if
3133000	3134000	Then
3134000	3135000	This is the first thing
3135000	3136000	The second thing
3136000	3137000	The first thing is more trivial
3137000	3138000	The second thing is to say
3138000	3140000	We suddenly found this thing
3140000	3141000	That is
3141000	3143000	If there was a peak
3143000	3145000	You keep stuffing protein in it
3145000	3146000	Keep stuffing protein
3146000	3147000	The amount of protein
3152000	3153000	Damn
3153000	3154000	The amount of protein
3158000	3159000	The mouse is gone
3159000	3161000	If the amount of protein becomes more
3162000	3163000	That peak will increase
3163000	3164000	That is, it will become more
3164000	3166000	More concentrated
3168000	3170000	But it doesn't grow to a certain extent
3170000	3171000	It just grows horizontally
3172000	3174000	That means
3174000	3175000	It actually has a boundary
3175000	3177000	You can't go beyond that boundary
3177000	3179000	You can't grow higher than it
3181000	3184000	The reason for this boundary is actually because
3184000	3188000	If you are a little more familiar with this system
3188000	3189000	If you realize this thing
3189000	3192000	This is actually a bi-stable reaction
3192000	3193000	That is to say
3195000	3196000	The concentration of U
3196000	3198000	At the highest point
3198000	3199000	Is stable
3199000	3200000	Then the lowest point
3200000	3201000	Is also stable
3201000	3203000	So if it goes beyond that point
3203000	3204000	It will come back by itself
3204000	3206000	Then it stops at that point
3209000	3211000	Then this bi-stability
3211000	3212000	This nature
3212000	3214000	It actually comes from
3214000	3216000	Every time a peak comes out
3216000	3218000	It will cause a value vacuum
3218000	3220000	Value vacuum will
3220000	3223000	The higher the peak, the more serious the value vacuum
3223000	3224000	But it can't get worse infinitely
3224000	3226000	Because it can't get negative
3226000	3228000	So it will stop at a certain point
3228000	3229000	Then it limits
3229000	3230000	You basically can't grow that high anymore
3230000	3232000	Because it will become lower when it grows higher
3232000	3234000	The value will not be able to support the peak
3234000	3235000	Will grow higher
3235000	3237000	Basically such a concept
3237000	3239000	If you look at it from a mathematical point of view
3239000	3242000	If we plot f of u, v
3242000	3244000	Assuming that this f of u, v is
3244000	3247000	a u square b minus b u square
3247000	3249000	It is a
3249000	3252000	As far as I know
3252000	3253000	As far as I know
3253000	3255000	The simplest
3255000	3256000	This system
3256000	3258000	Polarized reactor
3258000	3260000	a and b are a constant
3260000	3261000	Is a reaction constant
3261000	3262000	There is time in it
3262000	3265000	Then u and v are density
3265000	3267000	If it is such a reactor
3267000	3270000	It actually looks like a green curve
3272000	3273000	It's not right at first glance
3273000	3274000	This is obviously a 2-dimensional
3274000	3276000	Why does it look like a 3-dimensional
3276000	3278000	That's because
3278000	3282000	In
3282000	3284000	Steady-state
3284000	3285000	How to say steady-state
3285000	3287000	In steady-state
3287000	3289000	d u d t is 0
3289000	3290000	So these two things
3290000	3291000	Now it becomes like this
3291000	3293000	If you add the two things
3293000	3296000	That f of u, v will just disappear
3297000	3298000	Then
3298000	3300000	If f of u, v just disappears
3300000	3302000	You are on both sides at the same time
3302000	3305000	If you do two points for x
3305000	3307000	This thing will come out
3308000	3311000	So the density of v and the density of u
3311000	3313000	It's actually a linear relationship
3313000	3315000	This is actually a reaction
3315000	3317000	This is the reaction
3317000	3319000	That is to say
3319000	3320000	q is a constant
3320000	3322000	It's basically the level of the basal
3322000	3324000	The density of the basal value
3324000	3326000	Then there will be one in the middle
3326000	3328000	The vacuum of the value
3328000	3329000	This vacuum of the value
3329000	3331000	It will actually react directly to that u
3331000	3333000	That is
3333000	3335000	How high is the density of the activator
3336000	3337000	This can be solved directly
3337000	3338000	After solving
3338000	3340000	v is equal to this u plus q
3340000	3342000	If you bring this in
3342000	3344000	You will find that it is actually a three-dimensional
3344000	3346000	This three-dimensional means
3346000	3349000	Today everyone will see this f of u, v term
3349000	3353000	Then I need a mouse now
3356000	3359000	This f of u, v term means
3359000	3362000	In fact, if x is u
3363000	3365000	The axis is f of u, v
3365000	3366000	Now there is no f of u, q
3366000	3368000	Because v is replaced by q
3368000	3369000	OK
3369000	3371000	There are two points in it
3371000	3373000	These two points are all stable state
3373000	3375000	That is to say
3375000	3377000	If the density is slightly deviated
3377000	3379000	It will run this way
3379000	3382000	Then if it is slightly deviated on both sides
3382000	3383000	It will run to the middle
3383000	3385000	Then this is an unstable state
3385000	3387000	In short, if both sides are
3387000	3390000	When it is almost zero in density
3390000	3392000	It is directly zero in this world
3392000	3393000	When the density is zero
3393000	3395000	It is a stable state
3395000	3397000	Then its density
3397000	3399000	When it is in this position
3399000	3400000	It is also a stable state
3400000	3402000	So it will cause
3406000	3407000	It will cause
3407000	3409000	Your peak rose to a certain extent today
3409000	3411000	It stops here, it will not rise anymore
3411000	3412000	This is a stable state
3412000	3414000	The following is also a stable state
3417000	3419000	So in such a system
3419000	3421000	In fact, everyone will find that
3421000	3423000	If there are two peaks today
3423000	3424000	And this big peak
3424000	3427000	It must be higher than the small peak
3427000	3428000	It will have a density gradient
3428000	3429000	Because of the relatively narrow peak
3429000	3431000	Its density here will be higher
3431000	3433000	The higher the peak, the lower the density
3433000	3435000	But in fact, if today there are two
3435000	3438000	Different big peaks
3438000	3439000	But it's just a wider one
3439000	3440000	One is narrower
3440000	3442000	If the height of the two is almost the same
3442000	3445000	At the same time, the base density
3445000	3447000	The height will be almost the same
3447000	3449000	At this time, the middle one
3449000	3451000	That density gradient
3451000	3453000	It becomes very, very small
3453000	3454000	Because the density gradient is too small
3454000	3457000	So this competition will become very, very fast
3462000	3463000	Follow up here
3466000	3467000	Have
3468000	3471000	Ok, let's assume that everyone has followed up
3471000	3473000	If you don't follow up
3473000	3475000	You can directly accept this conclusion
3475000	3477000	That is to say, we found out
3477000	3478000	Because
3478000	3479000	First two things
3479000	3482000	One thing is because there is a U peak
3482000	3484000	It will cause a V vacuum
3484000	3486000	This vacuum can't run down infinitely
3486000	3488000	This will definitely decide
3488000	3490000	A peak height limit
3490000	3492000	We call saturation point
3492000	3494000	It is saturated there
3494000	3497000	So in such a system
3497000	3498000	Saturation point must exist
3498000	3499000	This is the first one
3499000	3500000	Then there is
3500000	3502000	If the height of the peak
3503000	3506000	When it is close to the saturation point
3506000	3508000	At this time, even if the two peaks are not the same
3508000	3510000	The competition between them
3510000	3512000	Because the density gradient is very, very small
3512000	3514000	So it becomes very, very, very slow
3516000	3518000	Except for that part
3518000	3519000	I also did this thing directly
3519000	3521000	I'm in my model
3521000	3523000	Change all the parameters I can change
3523000	3525000	Then I go
3525000	3527000	So in each one
3527000	3529000	The two axes are different parameters
3529000	3530000	This is the total value
3530000	3531000	Or this is the length
3531000	3533000	Or this is the reaction length
3533000	3535000	Or this is the expansion length
3535000	3536000	Can be changed
3536000	3538000	After I changed it
3538000	3541000	I put the time between the two peaks
3541000	3543000	Plot out with color
3543000	3547000	At the same time, I put the saturation index between them
3547000	3549000	Not the saturation index between them
3549000	3551000	This is the peak saturation index
3551000	3552000	The so-called saturation index
3552000	3554000	Its definition is
3556000	3558000	The closer the peak height
3558000	3560000	The closer it is to the saturation point
3560000	3563000	Its color is more yellow
3563000	3565000	Then everyone will find
3565000	3568000	Competition time and saturation index
3568000	3570000	It's almost completely correlated
3570000	3573000	If I put the competition time
3573000	3575000	Plot in the y-axis
3575000	3579000	Then the x-axis is basically the height of the peak
3579000	3581000	I will get this dot
3581000	3583000	Every simulation here
3583000	3584000	If you turn it into a dot
3584000	3586000	You get a trend like this
3588000	3590000	Trend
3594000	3596000	This trend means
3596000	3601000	If I have two peaks competing today
3601000	3603000	They compete very fast
3603000	3606000	So there is a group of dots here that is very fast
3606000	3607000	In addition, there is a group of dots
3607000	3608000	It will become very, very slow
3608000	3611000	Because this curve
3611000	3613000	It basically becomes like this
3613000	3615000	It is a very dramatic switch
3615000	3619000	So it's almost a switch-like response
3619000	3621000	As long as it protrudes a little bit
3621000	3622000	It will become very, very slow
3622000	3624000	So today it's like a cell
3624000	3626000	It's in this state
3626000	3628000	Look at this state
3628000	3630000	Between the growing dots
3630000	3632000	Make a choice
3640000	3643000	Then we found this kind of
3643000	3648000	In fact, it is not limited to the f of uv that I just showed
3648000	3652000	That is, its f of uv can be replaced with various f of uv
3652000	3654000	For example, I just used this picture
3654000	3656000	That is to say, there are three arrows
3656000	3658000	One up, one down, and then a positive feedback
3658000	3661000	Today we can make that positive feedback smaller
3661000	3663000	Make that positive feedback bigger
3663000	3666000	Today we can add an additional negative feedback on that positive feedback
3666000	3669000	Or we can make that positive feedback
3669000	3672000	The positive feedback is actually
3672000	3676000	Active form to suppress the speed of its own fall
3676000	3678000	This is also another kind of positive feedback
3678000	3682000	We can change these f of uv in any way
3682000	3684000	They will get the same conclusion in the end
3684000	3687000	That is, the more saturated the two peaks
3687000	3689000	Their competition will be slower
3689000	3691000	Then this is a switch-like response
3695000	3698000	So to make a conclusion
3700000	3704000	First of all, if there are several clusters today
3704000	3707000	That is, several different peaks of low-GTPS
3707000	3709000	They will definitely compete
3709000	3710000	Then that is to say
3710000	3713000	If these several peaks are all saturated
3713000	3715000	Their competition will be very, very slow
3715000	3716000	If it's very, very slow
3716000	3719000	Basically in a biological system
3719000	3722000	You can almost say that they are two non-competing peaks
3722000	3725000	They may have to spend billions of years
3725000	3726000	To be able to compete
3726000	3727000	Then we are in the biological system
3727000	3729000	So we just think it's not going to compete
3730000	3732000	This is part of my theory
3734000	3735000	Any questions?
3738000	3740000	Okay, if not
3741000	3743000	The key question is actually
3743000	3745000	Whether those mathematics can be reflected
3745000	3746000	In the biological system, right?
3747000	3750000	At this time we did something called
3750000	3752000	Septim Mutant
3752000	3754000	That is to say, this is also a small
3754000	3756000	I have a question
3756000	3759000	So can I make the same conclusion
3759000	3763000	So your experiment can't go
3763000	3765000	That is, you can't go from the results of the experiment
3765000	3766000	To probe
3766000	3770000	What is the content of that big F
3774000	3776000	Yes, because in fact
3776000	3779000	My model only has U and V
3780000	3781000	Then a real model
3781000	3784000	It actually needs more protein in it
3784000	3788000	Then I cut it into a simple form
3788000	3790000	So in this simple form
3790000	3792000	What should the F of U and V look like
3792000	3794000	In fact, it's hard for me to say
3794000	3797000	But I just said a very important point
3797000	3799000	No matter what form the F of U and V looks like
3799000	3800000	It doesn't matter
3800000	3802000	The point is that no matter what form it looks like
3802000	3803000	They will actually compete
3803000	3805000	And they will switch to non-competing
3805000	3807000	Because I think you will compete
3807000	3811000	Then it will reach the Global Equilibrium
3811000	3812000	The biggest reason is
3812000	3813000	If you go back to the front
3813000	3816000	That partial T U is equal to big D
3816000	3820000	Then that is partial partial U plus F
3820000	3822000	Then the other one is minus F
3822000	3825000	In fact, if you add the first line and the second line
3825000	3827000	Then you can get rid of F
3827000	3831000	And your big F doesn't depend on T or X
3831000	3833000	So you can just get rid of it
3833000	3835000	So the whole Global Dynamics
3835000	3838000	It's only related to U, V, X, T
3838000	3840000	It has nothing to do with F itself
3840000	3842000	So from here, can I conclude
3842000	3843000	In fact, from this equation
3843000	3847000	Theoretically, it shouldn't have anything to do with the connotation of F
3848000	3850000	Because it's an elliptical equation
3850000	3852000	I just spent an hour talking about this
3852000	3853000	That's right
3853000	3854000	OK
3854000	3855000	OK
3855000	3856000	OK
3856000	3857000	I just have
3858000	3859000	OK
3860000	3861000	So
3861000	3865000	So your experiment will focus on
3865000	3866000	Is
3866000	3868000	It's a bit like the diffusion itself
3868000	3869000	Can this be verified
3869000	3870000	Instead of F
3870000	3872000	You can test the content of F
3872000	3873000	Is that right?
3873000	3875000	I don't want to test what the content of F is
3875000	3876000	OK
3876000	3879000	But if what I just inferred is right
3879000	3880000	No matter what the content of F is
3880000	3881000	First of all
3882000	3883000	A system
3883000	3884000	If they peak
3884000	3886000	They can compete at the beginning
3886000	3888000	But they may become a
3888000	3889000	Can't compete
3889000	3891000	It's a very, very slow competition
3891000	3892000	This
3892000	3893000	This
3893000	3895000	Then this will depend on a saturation point
3895000	3897000	Then I have to prove that the saturation point exists
3897000	3900000	So this is what experiments need to test
3900000	3901000	OK, I see
3901000	3902000	OK
3902000	3903000	OK
3903000	3904000	Thank you
3904000	3905000	I have always
3905000	3906000	Who else just now
3906000	3907000	Is it
3907000	3909000	I have always wondered about the so-called competition
3909000	3910000	This word
3910000	3912000	Because from your equation
3912000	3913000	Your
3913000	3914000	Your source term is that F
3914000	3916000	It doesn't have time
3916000	3918000	It doesn't have time to be its
3918000	3919000	What do you call it?
3919000	3920000	Self-variable
3920000	3921000	So this is an elliptical equation
3921000	3923000	Then it's only related to the boundary conditions
3923000	3924000	It will always reach a
3924000	3926000	Steady state solution
3926000	3928000	So just now your data proved
3928000	3929000	It will eventually have a
3929000	3930000	Steady state
3930000	3932000	That is, a stable solution
3932000	3933000	That has a stable solution
3933000	3935000	It means that it won't change at any time
3935000	3937000	That won't change at any time
3937000	3938000	It means that
3938000	3940000	There will be no so-called competition between them
3940000	3941000	Relationship
3941000	3942000	So I have always been
3942000	3944000	I can't understand why
3944000	3946000	Math can prove
3946000	3947000	They will have a competition
3947000	3949000	Because there is a competition
3949000	3950000	Because
3950000	3952000	Can I interrupt you first?
3952000	3953000	OK
3953000	3954000	So that's it
3954000	3955000	Today
3955000	3956000	But indeed
3956000	3957000	It can reach a
3957000	3958000	Stable state
3958000	3959000	That is, the steady state solution
3959000	3961000	It may have two peaks
3961000	3962000	Right
3962000	3963000	But that doesn't mean
3963000	3965000	That steady state solution is stable
3967000	3968000	So this solution
3968000	3969000	It may be
3969000	3971000	Noise in any cell
3971000	3972000	Just
3972000	3973000	Get a bigger one
3973000	3974000	A smaller one
3974000	3975000	If it is unstable
3975000	3977000	This situation will make them compete
3977000	3978000	Then
3978000	3979000	Let it from a
3979000	3981000	Two-peak steady state solution
3981000	3983000	Becomes only one-peak steady state solution
3983000	3985000	Because there is only one
3985000	3986000	Steady state means
3986000	3988000	It won't change at any time
3992000	3993000	Yes
3993000	3994000	Steady state means
3994000	3996000	It won't change at any time
3996000	3998000	But if you leave the steady state
3998000	4000000	It may go to another steady state
4000000	4001000	At this time we will say
4001000	4004000	The original steady state is unstable
4004000	4006000	So this deviation
4006000	4007000	Must be in
4007000	4008000	Initial condition
4008000	4009000	It appeared
4009000	4011000	It can't say that this system is halfway
4011000	4012000	It reached
4012000	4014000	The current system reached the steady state
4014000	4015000	Then you have to say
4015000	4016000	It has a noise
4016000	4018000	Caused it to go to another place
4018000	4019000	Because when you have this noise
4019000	4020000	When it appears
4020000	4022000	Your system is completely different
4023000	4024000	Yes yes
4024000	4025000	This system is different
4025000	4026000	So
4026000	4027000	So you can't use
4027000	4028000	When I wrote this system
4028000	4030000	I should add a noise term later
4030000	4031000	That's right
4031000	4032000	Because in the cell
4032000	4034000	Noise is something that exists at any time
4035000	4036000	But if
4036000	4037000	Your source term
4037000	4039000	Source term should not only be f
4039000	4040000	Then uv
4040000	4041000	Should be f, uv
4041000	4042000	Then there is a time t
4043000	4044000	Then this system
4044000	4046000	May be a noise of time
4047000	4049000	It doesn't have to be a noise of time
4049000	4051000	That noise term doesn't need to be a noise of time
4052000	4053000	Oh
4053000	4055000	Just turn it into a snow machine
4055000	4056000	It will be in
4056000	4057000	It's a snow machine
4057000	4058000	Take data
4058000	4060000	You are in your take data
4060000	4062000	Throughout the history
4062000	4063000	There will be a moment suddenly
4063000	4064000	There will be a moment suddenly
4064000	4065000	There will be fluctuation
4065000	4067000	I think that's what that t means
4067000	4068000	Yes
4068000	4069000	So actually I think
4069000	4070000	I probably know what you two are going to say
4070000	4071000	In fact, that is to say
4072000	4074000	If you just look at this value
4074000	4076000	It will actually reach the equilibrium at the end
4076000	4078000	Regardless of the equilibrium
4078000	4080000	That is
4080000	4082000	Is stable or unstable
4082000	4084000	It just shouldn't change
4084000	4086000	But if there is a fluctuation
4086000	4088000	It may suddenly fluctuate
4088000	4090000	Then put the unstable equilibrium
4090000	4092000	The whole is biased to another place
4092000	4094000	But this
4094000	4096000	This fluctuation should actually be written
4096000	4098000	There is a t in that F
4098000	4099000	But you didn't write it now
4099000	4101000	I think that's what it means
4101000	4103000	Yes
4103000	4105000	I understand what you are talking about
4105000	4107000	Theoretically, that's right
4107000	4109000	But anyway
4109000	4111000	Because I am now
4111000	4113000	Just because it's simple
4113000	4115000	I didn't write that noise term
4115000	4117000	But if
4117000	4119000	If its initial condition is noise
4119000	4121000	In fact, it won't really run to two peaks
4121000	4123000	Stay
4123000	4125000	That is
4125000	4127000	Like this
4129000	4131000	It's just that there is noise
4131000	4133000	It won't grow two exactly the same peaks
4133000	4135000	Then as long as they are two
4135000	4137000	These two peaks are a bit different
4137000	4139000	They will definitely compete
4139000	4141000	The only stable or steady state at the end
4141000	4143000	I can understand what you want to say
4143000	4145000	But what I want to say is that this picture
4145000	4147000	Can't represent what you want to say
4147000	4149000	Because this picture only shows
4149000	4151000	Its solution has not yet reached
4151000	4153000	Steady state
4153000	4155000	But I understand what you mean
4155000	4157000	I know
4157000	4159000	Yes
4159000	4161000	It did not reach the steady state at the beginning
4161000	4163000	If you put the steady state at the beginning
4163000	4165000	It won't
4165000	4167000	It will be stuck there
4167000	4169000	Then you have to give it a little bit of noise
4169000	4171000	It can only run to one
4171000	4173000	So what I mean is that this picture
4173000	4175000	There is no way to explain what you are talking about
4175000	4177000	But I can understand what you want to say
4177000	4179000	Sorry
4179000	4181000	Because I am doing the value simulation
4181000	4183000	So I have always been
4183000	4185000	Strange
4185000	4187000	That
4187000	4189000	Some strange
4191000	4193000	Yes
4193000	4195000	What we do is to solve
4195000	4197000	Solve two peaks
4197000	4199000	Then solve a peak
4199000	4201000	Then
4201000	4203000	Prove that the two peaks are not stable
4203000	4205000	In this case
4205000	4207000	Once we know that the two peaks are not stable
4207000	4209000	In fact, when we run the simulation
4209000	4211000	Even if the solution is there
4211000	4213000	The simulation will not run to that solution
4213000	4215000	It is not an attractor
4215000	4217000	It will run to the stable
4217000	4219000	Steady state solution
4219000	4221000	So they almost never really go
4221000	4223000	Unstable solution
4223000	4225000	From a mathematical point of view
4225000	4227000	It will definitely
4227000	4229000	It's what you just said
4229000	4231000	Put two peaks, one peak
4231000	4233000	As long as there is no noise
4233000	4235000	Your equation is always that group
4235000	4237000	Then its source term noise is exactly the same
4237000	4239000	It will definitely become the same solution
4239000	4241000	Because it is an elliptical equation
4241000	4243000	In terms of numbers, that's another problem
4243000	4245000	Because you can't prove
4245000	4247000	The numerical method you use
4247000	4249000	No numerical
4249000	4251000	Numerical noise
4251000	4253000	Because I just mentioned it
4253000	4255000	Ok that's it
4255000	4257000	I think
4257000	4259000	The simulation I just showed
4259000	4261000	The main noise term
4261000	4263000	Is my initial condition
4263000	4265000	Sorry, let me wipe it
4265000	4267000	How many more in your head
4268000	4270000	I just said
4270000	4272000	7.30 right
4272000	4274000	Yes
4274000	4276000	And 1, 2, 3, 4
4276000	4278000	But there are a lot of animations here
4278000	4280000	Otherwise I can walk faster
4280000	4282000	Then basically
4282000	4284000	I want everyone to watch the movie
4284000	4286000	Then
4286000	4288000	Otherwise we are like this
4288000	4290000	You finish it first
4290000	4292000	If we have time at the end, let's ask questions together
4292000	4294000	Thank you all
4294000	4296000	Deal
4298000	4300000	Ok
4300000	4302000	So now the situation is
4302000	4304000	I want to see in the game
4304000	4306000	Can really see this
4306000	4308000	Is
4308000	4310000	Composition from fast to slow
4310000	4312000	So it can grow two buds
4312000	4314000	First of all, we do one thing
4314000	4316000	When we were simulating
4316000	4318000	Let the composition
4318000	4320000	From fast to slow
4320000	4322000	The fastest way is to put that
4322000	4324000	The distance is long, right
4324000	4326000	So now we make a longer cell
4326000	4328000	This longer cell
4328000	4330000	What actually happens is
4330000	4332000	A real yeast
4332000	4334000	You should see two cells in the picture
4334000	4336000	Is a large cell
4336000	4338000	After the small cell
4338000	4340000	They will break
4340000	4342000	They are now broken
4342000	4344000	But after that
4344000	4346000	I let one of its proteins
4346000	4348000	Is responsible for breaking it
4348000	4350000	This protein is basically
4350000	4352000	Very unstable at 37 degrees
4352000	4354000	But stable at 24 degrees
4354000	4356000	So that protein
4356000	4358000	It is invalid
4358000	4360000	The result is that it can't be separated
4360000	4362000	The result is like this
4362000	4364000	You can look at the top cell first
4366000	4368000	It first grew a tooth
4368000	4370000	At this time, only one tooth grew
4370000	4372000	At this time, two teeth grew
4372000	4374000	At this time, two teeth grew
4378000	4380000	OK
4380000	4382000	The following one
4382000	4384000	It grew a tooth
4384000	4386000	It grew a tooth
4386000	4388000	It grew a tooth
4388000	4390000	It grew three teeth
4390000	4392000	It grew three teeth
4392000	4394000	At this time, we can almost guess
4394000	4396000	When it only grows one tooth
4396000	4398000	Because it's not broken here
4398000	4400000	So its entire cell is all connected
4400000	4402000	It obviously has two
4402000	4404000	It looks like a cell, but it's not broken
4404000	4406000	But at this time, it only grew a tooth
4406000	4408000	We can almost be sure that
4408000	4410000	This is probably what we did before
4410000	4412000	But it grew to a certain length
4412000	4414000	But it found that it would grow a lot at this time
4414000	4416000	But it found that it would grow a lot at this time
4416000	4418000	But it found that it would grow a lot at this time
4424000	4426000	If we use the same method
4426000	4428000	Let's go inside
4428000	4430000	The one I just talked about
4430000	4432000	Is that the protein emits a silver light
4432000	4434000	You'll see
4434000	4436000	For example, let's say this one
4436000	4438000	This cell cycle is over
4438000	4440000	It seems to be happening too fast
4442000	4444000	It stopped growing
4444000	4446000	At this time, a bunch of them would grow at the beginning
4446000	4448000	A few of them disappeared
4448000	4450000	Only these two remain
4450000	4452000	After these two remain, they no longer compete
4452000	4454000	Then it becomes two teeth
4456000	4458000	At the same time, there are many of them growing at the same time
4458000	4460000	At the same time, there are many of them growing at the same time
4460000	4462000	But in the end, these two compete
4462000	4464000	So it only grows one
4464000	4466000	This is the same situation
4468000	4470000	So we see that in the same group of cells
4470000	4472000	So we see that in the same group of cells
4472000	4474000	There are a bunch of cells here
4474000	4476000	And each cell actually
4476000	4478000	Some of them will grow on both sides
4478000	4480000	Some of them will grow on one side
4480000	4482000	In a population
4482000	4484000	About 65% of the population
4484000	4486000	It will grow two teeth
4486000	4488000	It looks like
4488000	4490000	I ran out of the previous solution
4490000	4492000	At the beginning, many different peaks came out
4492000	4494000	Then the small peak was quickly competed
4494000	4496000	After the big peak stayed
4496000	4498000	The competition became very slow
4498000	4500000	Then they will move forward
4500000	4502000	Then there are about 65% of the cells
4502000	4504000	It's two teeth
4506000	4508000	If I just said
4508000	4510000	The conclusion of the mathematical side is correct
4510000	4512000	If we put the whole system
4512000	4514000	If the amount of protein in the system is adjusted
4516000	4518000	Then my peak should be from saturated
4518000	4520000	It's not saturated
4520000	4522000	So it has to go from compete very slowly to compete very quickly
4522000	4524000	Right?
4524000	4526000	Then we should see less
4526000	4528000	Two-button cells
4528000	4530000	So what we do is
4530000	4532000	We are now comparing
4532000	4534000	The first bar is wild type
4534000	4536000	Except
4536000	4538000	Normal, non-separable yeast
4538000	4540000	Then the second bar is
4540000	4542000	Normal yeast
4542000	4544000	But it's inside
4544000	4546000	That red or blue guy
4546000	4548000	It only has half the amount
4548000	4550000	Then the third bar is
4550000	4552000	The yellow guy inside
4552000	4554000	The yellow protein has only half the amount
4554000	4556000	Then the fourth bar is
4556000	4558000	Both red and yellow have only half the amount
4558000	4560000	Then
4560000	4562000	The last bar is
4562000	4564000	All proteins in this cell have only half the amount
4564000	4566000	Then when we do this comparison
4566000	4568000	We found that
4568000	4570000	The more protein
4570000	4572000	It will have more cells
4572000	4574000	On both sides
4574000	4576000	Then the less protein
4576000	4578000	The less population
4578000	4580000	It grows on both sides
4580000	4582000	This means
4584000	4586000	This is pretty much
4586000	4588000	In line with our experiment
4588000	4590000	Our theory
4594000	4596000	Then
4596000	4598000	But then people will say
4598000	4600000	Maybe it's not a matter of distance
4600000	4602000	Maybe it's not a matter of protein quality
4602000	4604000	Maybe the distance plays a bigger role
4604000	4606000	Like you see the cell on the left
4606000	4608000	Is it longer
4608000	4610000	So it's slower
4612000	4614000	Because
4614000	4616000	Because of the spread
4616000	4618000	Because the longer the distance, the slower the spread
4618000	4620000	Then it will be more unbalanced
4620000	4622000	This is another assumption
4622000	4624000	But we found
4624000	4626000	If we go to the two-body cell and the one-body cell
4626000	4628000	Then measure the length of their cells
4628000	4630000	Then we found that they didn't have much difference
4632000	4634000	So this time I put this alternative hypothesis
4634000	4636000	Rejected
4636000	4638000	My own hypothesis is better
4638000	4640000	Then another hypothesis
4640000	4642000	Is a mathematical hypothesis
4642000	4644000	I said you talked so much math in front
4644000	4646000	It's really a bit boring
4646000	4648000	Because in fact we don't need this math
4648000	4650000	To explain this
4650000	4652000	Today if our competition process
4652000	4654000	Is a peak to put another peak
4654000	4656000	To compete
4656000	4658000	That is to suck dry
4658000	4660000	Let's say we have two peaks today
4660000	4662000	They don't need to saturate
4662000	4664000	Then these two peaks are higher
4664000	4666000	But there are more things inside
4666000	4668000	So it takes longer to suck dry
4668000	4670000	So if we are
4670000	4672000	Fixed at a certain time
4672000	4674000	It's going to start growing
4674000	4676000	At that time it will start to grow two
4676000	4678000	See, you don't need a saturation
4678000	4680000	Such an explanation
4680000	4682000	Then I want to reject this hypothesis
4684000	4686000	So I did this
4686000	4688000	In fact, in a math system
4688000	4690000	In addition to the positive feedback I just mentioned
4690000	4692000	It actually has a negative feedback
4692000	4694000	In a normal system
4694000	4696000	It still has a negative feedback
4696000	4698000	In the model
4698000	4700000	If we remove this negative feedback
4700000	4702000	It will increase the saturation point
4702000	4704000	The result of increasing the saturation point
4704000	4706000	That is to say
4706000	4708000	If the original amount of protein
4708000	4710000	Is the same
4710000	4712000	If you just increase the saturation point
4712000	4714000	At this time it will become less saturated
4714000	4716000	At this time it should
4716000	4718000	Compete faster
4718000	4720000	Because it's sharper
4720000	4722000	So it depends on
4722000	4724000	In the actual cells
4724000	4726000	If you remove this negative feedback
4726000	4728000	Is it like we thought
4728000	4730000	It will become faster
4730000	4732000	We found that
4732000	4734000	This cell
4734000	4736000	It is less saturated
4736000	4738000	I'll close the door
4746000	4748000	In this state
4748000	4750000	We found
4750000	4752000	In fact, if we compare
4752000	4754000	These two genes
4754000	4756000	There is a negative feedback
4756000	4758000	If there is no negative feedback
4758000	4760000	In fact, there is a negative feedback
4760000	4762000	It is
4762000	4764000	The amount of protein in the patch
4764000	4766000	Is relatively small
4766000	4768000	But even so, it still looks like it competes slower
4768000	4770000	Such a phenomenon
4770000	4772000	With my alternative hypothesis
4772000	4774000	I didn't explain it
4774000	4776000	So I rejected this alternative hypothesis
4778000	4780000	Okay
4780000	4782000	So far
4782000	4784000	The experiments I have done
4784000	4786000	It seems to be quite
4786000	4788000	It seems to be quite
4788000	4790000	In line with my math
4790000	4792000	The hypothesis
4792000	4794000	Instead of other possible hypotheses
4794000	4796000	So we got
4796000	4798000	To sum up
4798000	4800000	Three conclusions
4800000	4802000	One is
4802000	4804000	When I make the pathogen
4804000	4806000	Longer
4806000	4808000	It will become more
4808000	4810000	Its competition
4810000	4812000	The competition between the low-GTPS
4812000	4814000	It will become slower
4814000	4816000	So it becomes
4816000	4818000	It can increase by 2.5
4818000	4820000	Or even 3.5 or more
4820000	4822000	This is quite in line with my model
4824000	4826000	Then again
4826000	4828000	The saturation point can be moved
4828000	4830000	If we can move the saturation point
4830000	4832000	It means that basically
4832000	4834000	We can support the saturation point
4834000	4836000	In addition to the saturation point
4836000	4838000	In addition to this hypothesis
4838000	4840000	I can't think of any other hypothesis
4840000	4842000	To explain my last data
4846000	4848000	So I will end it here
4848000	4850000	I am basically in a lab of the military
4850000	4852000	And everyone is doing experiments
4852000	4854000	So on the left
4856000	4858000	This is my teacher
4858000	4860000	This is my senior
4860000	4862000	She has gone to Boston
4862000	4864000	They are doing experiments
4864000	4866000	This group is mathematicians
4866000	4868000	I can't write the proof
4868000	4870000	The proof part
4870000	4872000	These two guys wrote it for me
4872000	4874000	Thank you very much
4874000	4876000	I don't know how to write the proof
4876000	4878000	The following is my experiment
4878000	4880000	Thank you
4884000	4886000	Before entering Q&A
4886000	4888000	Because our time is late
4888000	4890000	So if you have any questions
4890000	4892000	You can leave
4892000	4894000	No need to force
4894000	4896000	In the dialogue room
4896000	4898000	I will post it again
4898000	4900000	There is a feedback form
4900000	4902000	You can fill in this video
4902000	4904000	Today
4904000	4906000	I am the host
4906000	4908000	How is the meeting
4908000	4910000	Then the quality of the connection
4910000	4912000	Then the quality of the speech
4912000	4914000	And so on
4914000	4916000	Then if you are interested in
4916000	4918000	The research of Jiangen
4918000	4920000	You can leave a message to him
4920000	4922000	Then I will help you forward it to Jiangen
4922000	4924000	If you want to
4924000	4926000	Leave your contact information
4926000	4928000	Then discuss it in depth
4928000	4930000	Then I will put it in the dialogue box
4930000	4932000	Everyone can please click
4932000	4934000	If you don't have any special
4934000	4936000	If you have any comments, please click
4936000	4938000	Because this information
4938000	4940000	We will apply for all kinds
4940000	4942000	This
4942000	4944000	Support or
4944000	4946000	That proposal
4946000	4948000	May use my data
4948000	4950000	Thank you for your help
4950000	4952000	Do you have any questions?
4960000	4962000	You can ask directly
4962000	4964000	Thank you for the chat box
4964000	4966000	Because I just
4966000	4968000	Can't see the chat box
4968000	4970000	Let me ask first
4970000	4972000	Is
4972000	4974000	Does anyone take this model
4974000	4976000	To study social phenomena
4976000	4978000	Because I always feel
4978000	4980000	If we take the cell membrane
4980000	4982000	As the territory of the United States
4982000	4984000	Then you use red and blue lines
4984000	4986000	Then this matter recently
4986000	4988000	Red and blue
4988000	4990000	And you see
4990000	4992000	What is mentioned in the video
4992000	4994000	Including
4994000	4996000	Basically not
4996000	4998000	Protein
4998000	5000000	Think of it as a person
5000000	5002000	Or something
5002000	5004000	Such a model
5004000	5006000	Can be used to simulate
5006000	5008000	Or predict social phenomena
5008000	5010000	Do you know anyone doing this?
5010000	5012000	What I know is
5012000	5014000	First of all, I will talk about the limit
5014000	5016000	That limit is first
5016000	5018000	I didn't model any highway
5018000	5020000	Or flying
5020000	5022000	So that diffusion
5022000	5024000	Basically
5024000	5026000	In real life
5026000	5028000	Will be defeated by a lot of this kind of fast transportation
5028000	5030000	So he can't
5030000	5032000	Model a lot of things
5032000	5034000	At least in today's society
5034000	5036000	I know someone doing
5036000	5038000	Turing pattern
5038000	5040000	Research on social science
5040000	5042000	Is about crime
5042000	5044000	More like in a local
5044000	5046000	Little city
5046000	5048000	Which point
5048000	5050000	For example
5050000	5052000	For example
5052000	5054000	A certain area in downtown
5054000	5056000	Then it is easy to produce criminals
5056000	5058000	Then the criminals will assume
5058000	5060000	Can spread out
5060000	5062000	But at the same time there is another group of people outside
5062000	5064000	For example
5064000	5066000	I don't know if he is a policeman
5066000	5068000	Or a resident who is not a criminal
5068000	5070000	He can be a witness
5070000	5072000	Anyway, he is in the model
5072000	5074000	Dynamics between the two
5074000	5076000	He will have unknown changes at the same time
5076000	5078000	Then there are some
5078000	5080000	Criminals and witnesses
5080000	5082000	These interactions between the police
5082000	5084000	Some are like this
5084000	5086000	But in fact we have seen a lot
5086000	5088000	Purely with a
5088000	5090000	Deterministic
5090000	5092000	Model
5092000	5094000	I haven't seen a lot
5094000	5096000	Or at least
5096000	5098000	Because I'm looking
5098000	5100000	This is related to Turing pattern
5100000	5102000	Then I haven't seen a lot
5102000	5104000	Maybe a lot is related to Turing pattern
5104000	5106000	Ok very cool
5106000	5108000	Thank you everyone
5110000	5112000	I want to confirm
5112000	5114000	My understanding
5114000	5116000	This model
5116000	5118000	The most important thing should be
5118000	5120000	Between two species
5120000	5122000	The rate of spread is very large
5122000	5124000	This is the first point
5124000	5126000	The second point is
5126000	5128000	Because
5128000	5130000	In theory, this model should be
5130000	5132000	In the chemical field
5132000	5134000	Their molecular
5134000	5136000	Spreading
5136000	5138000	Between two different chemical substances
5138000	5140000	Then they
5140000	5142000	I am more curious about why
5142000	5144000	Their chemical
5144000	5146000	Expansion
5146000	5148000	Did not mention any
5148000	5150000	So-called Turing
5150000	5152000	Turing
5152000	5154000	How do you say it in English?
5154000	5156000	Because Turing
5156000	5158000	At the beginning of this
5158000	5160000	His imagined activator and substrate
5160000	5162000	Are chemical reagents
5162000	5164000	Then he imagined
5164000	5166000	In fact, this application is a lot
5166000	5168000	In the case of non-living things
5168000	5170000	Someone even found some chemical reactions
5170000	5172000	One is Diffuse slower
5172000	5174000	One is Diffuse faster
5174000	5176000	Of course they will have a rate of spread
5176000	5178000	So it won't be
5178000	5180000	It won't be mass conserved
5180000	5182000	They really have a way to
5182000	5184000	Add chemical reactions
5184000	5186000	Then he really ran out of dots
5186000	5188000	So do a lot in chemical reactions
5188000	5190000	So you have seen paper
5190000	5192000	Is the real world
5192000	5194000	Chemical substances will produce
5194000	5196000	What is this called?
5196000	5198000	Turing pattern
5198000	5200000	Turing pattern
5200000	5202000	Is there such a thing in the real world?
5202000	5204000	Yes
5204000	5206000	Can work hard to give you
5206000	5208000	I haven't seen those for a long time
5208000	5210000	Because now it's chemical compounds
5210000	5212000	But you really are in a
5212000	5214000	Cultivator
5214000	5216000	Then you add a certain substance and another substance
5216000	5218000	Then they ran out of dots
5218000	5220000	I remember
5220000	5222000	Is there anyone
5222000	5224000	Is there anyone studying that cat?
5224000	5226000	Dog? What animal pattern?
5226000	5228000	Yes
5228000	5230000	That's more of a guess
5230000	5232000	Because if it is a chemical substance
5232000	5234000	What is your chemical substance
5234000	5236000	What is their reaction rate
5236000	5238000	All measured
5238000	5240000	So that model
5240000	5242000	How to write
5242000	5244000	But if it's in cats and dogs
5244000	5246000	We still
5246000	5248000	As far as I know
5248000	5250000	We don't know
5250000	5252000	Which one
5252000	5254000	Which one
5254000	5256000	Or
5256000	5258000	There is another
5258000	5260000	This is actually a more common
5260000	5262000	One is
5262000	5264000	But
5264000	5266000	It will inhibit
5266000	5268000	Even so
5268000	5270000	I can't find which one is the key
5270000	5272000	Which one is the key
5272000	5274000	Because there are too many molecules in the body
5274000	5276000	So I don't know
5276000	5278000	But they will point out
5278000	5280000	Look at the pattern of the cat
5280000	5282000	It's exactly the same
5282000	5284000	It must be like this
5284000	5286000	Mechanism
5286000	5288000	But no one really found that chemical substance
5288000	5290000	Even if you find that chemical substance
5290000	5292000	You have to write that thing
5292000	5294000	It is usually necessary to go through a lot of
5294000	5296000	Simplification
5296000	5298000	Because in the body
5308000	5310000	Any other questions
5310000	5312000	I have one
5312000	5314000	Common
5314000	5316000	I think
5316000	5318000	For example, like Zhang Yanping just asked
5318000	5320000	Say that in social science
5320000	5322000	Or
5322000	5324000	Social psychology
5324000	5326000	Is there a way to use such a model
5326000	5328000	Go
5328000	5330000	Do research
5330000	5332000	Then, for example, he used one here
5332000	5334000	A model like diffusion
5334000	5336000	Then someone just asked
5336000	5338000	That's it
5338000	5340000	At the beginning
5340000	5342000	When he proposed such a model
5342000	5344000	He is actually in chemistry
5344000	5346000	That is to say
5346000	5348000	But I myself
5348000	5350000	From the point of view of physics
5350000	5352000	I think
5352000	5354000	These are just
5354000	5356000	It's called effective model
5356000	5358000	It's not really
5358000	5360000	I think you can't
5360000	5362000	You have such a mathematical model
5362000	5364000	Then
5364000	5366000	To get data is the same
5366000	5368000	Then he interpreted this
5368000	5370000	Interaction
5370000	5372000	What is the nature of this system
5372000	5374000	Because
5374000	5376000	For example
5376000	5378000	Just
5378000	5380000	I think he just means
5380000	5382000	You have a quantity
5382000	5384000	Then it changes over time
5384000	5386000	It's a certain
5386000	5388000	He to another variable
5388000	5390000	How many times
5390000	5392000	You can actually write a super long
5392000	5394000	That is to say
5394000	5396000	You write super long
5396000	5398000	Then see which one comes out
5398000	5400000	Is the most like
5400000	5402000	But in fact, in chemistry
5402000	5404000	For example, in chemistry
5404000	5406000	The range of the equation
5406000	5408000	At least
5408000	5410000	That is to say
5410000	5412000	The size of the molecule
5412000	5414000	Otherwise you enter a completely different
5414000	5416000	Then you are different
5416000	5418000	So I think it's just
5418000	5420000	Effective model
5420000	5422000	Uh
5422000	5424000	Yeah, so we actually hate it
5424000	5426000	In fact, there are a lot of models
5426000	5428000	Will do this thing
5428000	5430000	Uh
5430000	5432000	In fact, like the original
5432000	5434000	It's the same
5434000	5436000	There is a
5436000	5438000	There is a mechanism
5438000	5440000	It will grow
5440000	5442000	Just
5442000	5444000	In physics
5444000	5446000	It's the same
5446000	5448000	But it doesn't mean
5448000	5450000	The mechanism of the original model
5450000	5452000	It's exactly the same
5452000	5454000	And indeed I told you today
5454000	5456000	This model is also a very
5456000	5458000	Very simplified
5458000	5460000	But there is actually a basis
5460000	5462000	That is to say
5462000	5464000	That's why I'm so happy to play with it
5464000	5466000	Because in fact
5466000	5468000	In terms of Helmholtz
5468000	5470000	Of course, this is also simplified
5470000	5472000	But in terms of Helmholtz
5472000	5474000	We know the molecule
5474000	5476000	In terms of
5476000	5478000	I can write a model
5478000	5480000	On the membrane
5480000	5482000	In the cytoplasm
5482000	5484000	And then
5484000	5486000	On the membrane
5486000	5488000	And then this scaffold
5488000	5490000	And this circle
5490000	5492000	And then they all have that protein
5492000	5494000	And if you kill one of the proteins
5494000	5496000	It really won't polarize
5496000	5498000	So these are all genetic data
5498000	5500000	In fact, it is very likely
5500000	5502000	There are a lot of data
5502000	5504000	This kind of circuit operation
5504000	5506000	But if I want to write this out
5506000	5508000	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
5508000	5510000	7
5510000	5512000	No, it's actually
5512000	5514000	8
5514000	5516000	Diffusion equation
5516000	5518000	System
5518000	5520000	Then it's hard to study
5520000	5522000	But someone
5522000	5524000	After this simplification
5524000	5526000	It can go through some state-by-state assumptions
5526000	5528000	Then get one
5528000	5530000	This kind of simplified
5530000	5532000	So there is a theory
5532000	5534000	It's not entirely
5534000	5536000	I ran out of a model today
5536000	5538000	Then this model just
5538000	5540000	It's just
5540000	5542000	The appearance of the creature
5542000	5544000	So we think that model is wrong
5544000	5546000	I think this kind of model is
5546000	5548000	This is
5548000	5550000	Overclaiming the model
5550000	5552000	Can do things
5552000	5554000	I totally agree with what you just said
5554000	5556000	But so we will pay attention
5556000	5558000	We actually
5558000	5560000	Is that molecular mechanism a Turing mechanism?
5560000	5562000	Then we think it is
5562000	5564000	Because there are other creatures
5564000	5566000	Supporting it
5568000	5570000	If today I am directly using the mechanism
5570000	5572000	Piled up
5572000	5574000	Then this model
5574000	5576000	There is a way to see me in the creature
5576000	5578000	The phenomenon is the same
5578000	5580000	I didn't give it a direct assumption
5580000	5582000	You should look like a Turing mechanism
5582000	5584000	When my model is 8
5584000	5586000	When molecules
5586000	5588000	It can't tell it's a Turing
5588000	5590000	But it looks like a Turing
5590000	5592000	I'm more confident at this time
5594000	5596000	I think
5596000	5598000	It should be said
5598000	5600000	I don't know what the person who just asked
5600000	5602000	But my understanding
5602000	5604000	It should be what he wants to ask
5604000	5606000	You this model
5606000	5608000	What you are doing now is that you assume
5608000	5610000	Use a very logical way to infer a model
5610000	5612000	Then find this model
5612000	5614000	Results with your research data
5614000	5616000	Can
5616000	5618000	Match your research data
5618000	5620000	But such a conclusion
5620000	5622000	There is no way to prove
5622000	5624000	Your model is really
5624000	5626000	The mechanism of this real world
5626000	5628000	You can only say your model
5628000	5630000	It's just a model
5630000	5632000	It's not any law
5634000	5636000	The question I asked just now
5636000	5638000	My understanding is like this
5638000	5640000	I don't know if it's right
5644000	5646000	My understanding is the same
5648000	5650000	But the problem is
5650000	5652000	I can understand
5652000	5654000	If you have a model today
5654000	5656000	Then you can use it to infer
5656000	5658000	Then you can infer a result
5658000	5660000	Then it's the same as the phenomenon
5660000	5662000	This does not explain
5662000	5664000	How things actually happen
5664000	5666000	For example, I use a more familiar example
5666000	5668000	Even if I can model today
5668000	5670000	On Facebook
5670000	5672000	This
5672000	5674000	How to diffuse
5674000	5676000	Then how it is
5676000	5678000	Between Racism and Anti-Racism
5678000	5680000	Make adjustments
5680000	5682000	For this process
5682000	5684000	I can go to model this phenomenon
5684000	5686000	Then there is also effect
5686000	5688000	But this does not explain
5688000	5690000	I can understand that this does not explain
5690000	5692000	Then I am on Facebook
5692000	5694000	How to influence another user
5694000	5696000	Pull it to me
5696000	5698000	This is not the case
5698000	5700000	But conversely
5700000	5702000	If I can't make a reasonable statement at the beginning
5702000	5704000	Say
5704000	5706000	On Facebook
5706000	5708000	Interaction with people
5708000	5710000	Satisfy diffusion
5710000	5712000	I won't set this model at the beginning
5712000	5714000	Because you are blind
5714000	5716000	I want to set it up
5716000	5718000	I don't believe anyone sets it up like this
5718000	5720000	Like when I first started
5720000	5722000	Really
5722000	5724000	Really
5724000	5726000	Many models do this
5726000	5728000	There are so many physics
5728000	5730000	No one talks about it
5730000	5732000	May be this mechanism
5732000	5734000	We have a lot of people here
5734000	5736000	Models mess up
5736000	5738000	Sometimes I hate it
5738000	5740000	Models mess up
5740000	5742000	Make us famous
5742000	5744000	But I want to talk about
5744000	5746000	At the beginning
5746000	5748000	When using this model
5748000	5750000	He also said first
5750000	5752000	We actually have a protein here
5752000	5754000	It looks like it can satisfy
5754000	5756000	This model
5756000	5758000	The assumption at the beginning
5758000	5760000	Or the description of that
5760000	5762000	Only use it
5762000	5764000	So I don't think
5764000	5766000	In the case of Jenkins
5766000	5768000	There is a big problem
5768000	5770000	Of course I don't think
5770000	5772000	You have this problem
5772000	5774000	I don't think he meant it
5774000	5776000	But
5776000	5778000	I think I understand what he said
5778000	5780000	I think
5780000	5782000	Because my model
5782000	5784000	There are some mechanistic bases
5784000	5786000	There are some
5786000	5788000	Data
5788000	5790000	Is to support
5790000	5792000	These chemical reactions
5792000	5794000	These chemical reactions
5794000	5796000	So I'm more confident about my model
5796000	5798000	But even so
5798000	5800000	Anyway, I can't say
5800000	5802000	That model itself
5802000	5804000	Is what actually happened
5804000	5806000	I totally agree with this sentence
5806000	5808000	But actually from a more scientific
5808000	5810000	If you think about it
5810000	5812000	Which model
5812000	5814000	All models are false
5814000	5816000	He must have gone through some simplifications
5816000	5818000	At least he went through some simplifications
5818000	5820000	In fact
5820000	5822000	Even when we
5822000	5824000	Understand any system
5824000	5826000	The truth we understand
5826000	5828000	It's not a truth
5828000	5830000	All the theories we understand
5830000	5832000	It's not the truth
5832000	5834000	And we don't know
5834000	5836000	There is no way to know
5836000	5838000	The theory we understand is the truth
5838000	5840000	There is no way to verify
5840000	5842000	Or
5842000	5844000	Yes
5844000	5846000	First of all
5846000	5848000	There is no way to verify
5848000	5850000	And it's very hard to deny
5850000	5852000	What we can do
5852000	5854000	Like what I was trying to do
5854000	5856000	I have a model today
5856000	5858000	Or I have a theory
5858000	5860000	If there is only one theory
5860000	5862000	It's hard for me to know
5862000	5864000	Is it right
5864000	5866000	For example, God created man
5866000	5868000	It's hard for me to know
5868000	5870000	But if I have another theory
5870000	5872000	For example, this theory
5872000	5874000	Explaining other phenomena is better than this
5874000	5876000	Or this theory
5876000	5878000	There is a way
5878000	5880000	This theory is easy to be denied
5880000	5882000	We need to compare two theories
5882000	5884000	The advantages between them
5884000	5886000	We have a way to
5886000	5888000	To be more realistic
5888000	5890000	It should look like this
5890000	5892000	In the process
5892000	5894000	Of course there is no theory
5894000	5896000	It's real
5896000	5898000	We can only try to be as realistic as possible
5898000	5900000	The process of being realistic
5900000	5902000	We try to compare different theories
5902000	5904000	Put the bad theory aside
5904000	5906000	Then compare with a different theory
5906000	5908000	Then put the bad theory aside
5908000	5910000	Then try to be realistic in this process
5910000	5912000	But our theory will never be true
5914000	5916000	I think it's totally fine
5916000	5918000	Because when you say
5918000	5920000	You are a model
5920000	5922000	It has already shown that it is such a thing
5922000	5924000	Because if you are from
5924000	5926000	Applied mathematics
5926000	5928000	Model, theorem, law
5928000	5930000	These all represent different things
5930000	5932000	So if you use the definition of people
5932000	5934000	In the field of applied mathematics
5934000	5936000	When you say it is a model
5936000	5938000	In fact, people in the field of applied mathematics
5938000	5940000	They won't care about
5940000	5942000	The mechanism behind the model
5942000	5944000	They will only ask
5944000	5946000	You have a model, you have done validation
5946000	5948000	You have done verification
5948000	5950000	Then this model is
5950000	5952000	A reasonable model
5952000	5954000	As for whether this model
5954000	5956000	Represents physics or the real world
5956000	5958000	In fact, from the point of view of applied mathematics
5958000	5960000	It's not that important
5960000	5962000	Because since you already call it a model
5962000	5964000	It means that as long as it works
5964000	5966000	That's it
5966000	5968000	But we still try our best
5968000	5970000	I hope our model can explain
5970000	5972000	Is to be as realistic as possible
5972000	5974000	Because we
5974000	5976000	After all, in the end, we want to solve the problem of life
5976000	5978000	OK
