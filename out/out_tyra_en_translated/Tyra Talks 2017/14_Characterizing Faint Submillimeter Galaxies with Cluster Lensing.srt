00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello everyone, I'm the host for today, Zhang Yanyong, and we're going to have our 21st Terra Talk.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today's speaker is Xu Liyan.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Xu Liyan and I have known each other for almost two years.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's really interesting because we're at Caltech, and Xu Liyan is studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In 2016, we had a year-long visit to Caltech and IPAC.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
At that time, we met Xu Liyan.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Xu Liyan happens to be a senior in the Department of Physics at Caltech, but he was studying astronomy at Manoa University in Hawaii.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Did I say that correctly?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm from the Department of Physics.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, you're from the Department of Physics.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But you're studying astronomy at Manoa University.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My advisor is from Manoa University.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I see.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's interesting because he's from Hawaii, and they were surfing.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was surfing, so we became good friends.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Of course, his main job is still doing astronomy observation research in Hawaii.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
After returning from Caltech, in 2017, he recently obtained a Ph.D. degree, so he is a new doctor.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Liyan's research is mainly galaxy observation.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In his doctoral career, he is going to talk to us about this big topic today.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He published 34 papers, but today he will focus on the latest one.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you are interested in learning more about the previous papers, you can contact him directly.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Without further ado, let's welcome Liyan to give us his speech.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll mute myself.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'd like to remind everyone to mute your microphone when you speak.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You can start.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, I'll start.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you have any questions, please mute your microphone.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm afraid people won't understand.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, sorry.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We forgot something.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We need to clap.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We need to mute our microphone when we clap.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, you can start.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, thank you.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As you can see, my title is Characterizing Faint Sub-millimeter Galaxies with Posture Lensing.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you don't read astronomy, you can only understand Characterizing, Faint, and Width.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll explain what they mean.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
In short, I'm studying a galaxy called Sub-millimeter Galaxy.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The wavelength detected by this galaxy is called Sub-millimeter.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sub-millimeter is shorter than millimeter.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Millimeter is in kilometers.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Traditionally, people use 850 micrometers to study Sub-millimeter Galaxy.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Now I'll explain why I'm studying this galaxy and what I'm studying.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why do we study this galaxy?

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's related to the evolution of the universe.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can google the history of the universe.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You'll see a similar picture.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Maybe you've heard of it.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It started from the Big Bang.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The history of the universe is shown here.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It started from the Big Bang.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then there was a period of time called Inflation.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
At that time, the temperature of the universe was still very high.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It was all gaseous gas.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Until the temperature dropped to the ground.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The gaseous electrons in the universe were recombined with the gaseous atoms.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They became neutral gas atoms.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
From then on, light can start to run freely in the universe.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Before that, any light would be scattered by those gaseous electrons.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
From then on, light can run freely in the universe.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
At that time, the universe was scattered by those gaseous electrons.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But the temperature of the universe was still very high.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
After the temperature dropped to the ground.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The temperature of the gaseous atoms dropped to the ground.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The temperature of the universe was still very high.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So there were a lot of neutral gas atoms in the universe.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Before that, there was a period called Dark Age.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Basically, in the Big Bang, Inflation, and Cosmic Microwave Background.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
During this period, I basically think that this part of history belongs to physicists.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Like the theory of explosion, it's a physicist.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is very physical.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And Big Bang.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
From the beginning of the formation of gravity.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
After the first gravity.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This part can be done by astronomers.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Astronomers can do this part.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I said that the temperature of the universe.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because the universe is constantly expanding.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The temperature slowly drops.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And these gaseous atoms.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It can be further combined into gaseous atoms.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Gaseous atoms.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If it's cold enough.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
After gravity collapses.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It will form a star.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then the star will.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You should have heard of the star.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Just like our sun.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It produces a fusion reaction.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So it will glow.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Then it will produce gas.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then the star will not be one by one.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They are produced in groups.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That is to form the so-called galaxy.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The galaxy is.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
A galaxy is basically.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
More than a billion of stars.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It is a system of galaxies.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
From this time on.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
After the galaxy.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It is.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Many galaxies.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
In this universe.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
More and more galaxies.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We study.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This part.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I study the so-called.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Galaxy formation and evolution.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The formation of galaxies.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And evolution.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Then.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
An important point is.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
My research.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This research.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is to study.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This universe.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The star formation.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The history of star formation.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is the so-called.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Cosmic star formation.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We want to use.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That is to say.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
From this.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
From the first star to now.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The evolution of this universe.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
One of them.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You have to understand the evolution of this universe.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
One of them.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You have to understand.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It must be very important.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
How to say.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
One of the very important factors.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Is star formation.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If you.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
From the perspective of astronomy.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No matter what you are studying.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No matter you are studying.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The evolution of galaxies.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Galaxy formation and evolution.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Or.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You want to study.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Stars.

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
For example.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Like our solar system.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Or study.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What.

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Mars.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Small stars.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In the universe.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No matter what kind of weather you study.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It must be.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Related to the stars.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Related to the stars.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You have the star.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You have the star formation.

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
After.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
After the star formation.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
These stars.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Merge together.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Becomes.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Galaxy.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So it's related to the galaxy.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then.

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You.

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Star.

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Star system.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Like our solar system.

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Is.

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
After the star formation.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then.

188
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Some dust around this star.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Slowly.

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is formed.

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Star.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Then the star.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Just go around the star.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like the comet.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Small star.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is also.

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is also.

198
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So.

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You can say.

200
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Astronomy.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No matter what you study.

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ah.

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I said astronomy.

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If it's.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The kind of physics in cosmology.

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It doesn't count.

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Astronomy.

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Basically.

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Whatever you do.

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No matter what you do.

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's related to.

212
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Star formation.

213
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So star formation.

214
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
History.

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Star formation.

216
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
History.

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So it's a very important.

218
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Ah.

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You want to understand.

220
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This universe.

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is a very important thing.

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
OK.

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then.

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So.

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I believe I have.

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Convinced everyone.

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Star formation.

228
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
History.

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a very important thing.

230
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But.

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Ah.

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Star formation.

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
History.

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Ah.

235
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We.

236
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
When we do research.

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Found.

238
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This picture on the left.

239
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's the so-called.

240
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I put star formation.

241
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
History.

242
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This thing.

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Brighten it.

244
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Then.

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This place.

246
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Left.

247
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This axis.

248
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Called.

249
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Star formation.

250
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Great.

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Density.

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Star formation.

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Great.

254
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is.

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Left.

256
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There is a green layer.

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Is.

258
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Every year.

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
His unit is.

260
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ah.

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Ah.

262
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The quality of the stars.

263
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Out of.

264
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Time.

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Then.

266
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
His unit basically.

267
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Every year.

268
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You see.

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Every year.

270
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Can produce.

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
How many solar qualities.

272
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This.

273
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This unit is the solar mass.

274
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is the solar mass.

275
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So in this part.

276
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Calls.

277
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Star formation.

278
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Great.

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So if you are in the volume.

280
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is.

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Star formation.

282
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Great.

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Then in the unit volume.

284
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then.

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't.

286
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You don't care how he came.

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then he is a huge unit.

288
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Then.

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Three times.

290
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So he is this part.

291
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Ah.

292
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Gravitational law.

293
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
In the unit volume.

294
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So called.

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Star formation.

296
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Great.

297
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Density.

298
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Very early.

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Here is the lookback time.

300
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So the more to the right.

301
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Is.

302
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Longer ago.

303
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
OK.

304
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Then this lookback time.

305
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Can correspond to the so-called.

306
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Redshift.

307
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Called.

308
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Redshift.

309
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Then this.

310
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Redshift.

311
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What is it?

312
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll explain it later.

313
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But you can.

314
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can tell you now.

315
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is.

316
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The more to the right.

317
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Is.

318
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The earlier.

319
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The.

320
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Universe.

321
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That.

322
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Zero.

323
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This place is now.

324
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
OK.

325
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So the time travel.

326
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Is from the right to the left.

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Or from the left to the right.

328
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
OK.

329
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Then this picture.

330
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Basically.

331
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is a star formation.

332
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
History.

333
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then you want to.

334
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Measure this picture.

335
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Ah.

336
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You.

337
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We.

338
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ah.

339
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Will find.

340
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There are two.

341
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ah.

342
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Basically.

343
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Can be.

344
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Two kinds of observations.

345
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Is very important.

346
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Is.

347
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Ah.

348
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When we used to.

349
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Probably in the 90s.

350
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
When.

351
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The end of the 90s.

352
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We have some.

353
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ah.

354
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ah.

355
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ah.

356
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ah.

357
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Satellite.

358
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Ah.

359
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's the space telescope.

360
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We go to measure.

361
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The whole universe.

362
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Background radiation.

363
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That.

364
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There are different.

365
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wavelength background radiation.

366
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That.

367
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I just mentioned.

368
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The background radiation of the universe microwave.

369
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Is called.

370
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Cosmic Microwave Background.

371
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is here.

372
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Ah.

373
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Then this.

374
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Is.

375
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Is the intensity of light.

376
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then.

377
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Horizontal.

378
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Is wavelength.

379
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So this is basically.

380
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Light wave.

381
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That.

382
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
CMB is probably a place.

383
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Then we will find.

384
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In this universe.

385
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There are two components.

386
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
CMB does not count.

387
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There are two.

388
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Very important components.

389
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
One is called.

390
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Cosmic.

391
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Optical Background.

392
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It is visible.

393
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Light.

394
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Background.

395
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then the other part.

396
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is called.

397
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Cosmic Infrared Background.

398
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Is infrared background.

399
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then we found.

400
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Then we found.

401
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
These two.

402
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Background.

403
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Their amount.

404
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is almost.

405
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Almost.

406
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So what does this tell us?

407
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because in this universe.

408
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Horizontal.

409
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
They will send out.

410
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ah.

411
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Point light.

412
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Visible light.

413
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Or.

414
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Infrared light.

415
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That.

416
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Horizontal.

417
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Direct light.

418
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Basically.

419
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Is this component.

420
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Optical Background.

421
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
OK.

422
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But.

423
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In this universe.

424
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Star formation.

425
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
OK.

426
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
About half.

427
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The other half.

428
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
About half.

429
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Is not.

430
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We can directly observe.

431
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It is called.

432
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Dusty Star Formation.

433
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What does it mean?

434
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That is.

435
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When you have.

436
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A lot of stars.

437
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
In a region.

438
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then.

439
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
A lot of.

440
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
New.

441
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Huge stars.

442
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They.

443
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Very soon.

444
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They will age.

445
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And become so-called.

446
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Supernova.

447
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Supernova.

448
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then.

449
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
These.

450
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
These huge stars.

451
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They are produced.

452
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They are produced.

453
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
A lot of.

454
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Heavy objects.

455
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then.

456
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They become supernova.

457
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They will explode.

458
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Then.

459
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Those heavy objects.

460
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That is.

461
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That is.

462
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Is talked about.

463
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In the space of the universe.

464
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And.

465
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Heavy objects.

466
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Heavy objects.

467
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
For example, carbon.

468
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Metal.

469
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
These things.

470
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They will form.

471
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The dust of the star system.

472
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That is.

473
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So-called.

474
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Dust.

475
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That particles.

476
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Is.

477
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Like dust.

478
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Floating.

479
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In space.

480
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That.

481
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Dust.

482
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Will block.

483
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
These stars.

484
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Directly.

485
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The light emitted by the star system.

486
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
As I said.

487
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It is.

488
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Extraterrestrial light.

489
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Radiation light.

490
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And.

491
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Near-infrared.

492
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That is.

493
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Near-infrared light.

494
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Those dust.

495
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Will absorb.

496
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This part of the light.

497
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then.

498
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
From the perspective of.

499
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The observer on our planet.

500
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That is.

501
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Blocking it.

502
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Blocking that part of the light.

503
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But.

504
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
After it is blocked.

505
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The energy is stored.

506
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
After it is absorbed.

507
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It will radiate.

508
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
These energy.

509
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The energy it absorbs.

510
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Radiate out.

511
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But when it radiates out.

512
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is.

513
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Absorbed.

514
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So we call.

515
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Dusty star formation.

516
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Or.

517
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Dust.

518
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hidden star formation.

519
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Or.

520
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Dust obscured star formation.

521
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Anyway.

522
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The meaning is.

523
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
These star formation.

524
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Will be.

525
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Dust.

526
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000

As an example, this study paper

1078
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:36,180
The green and blue

1079
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:40,940
are basically visible light or near-infrared light

1080
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:43,740
So what they represent is the horizontal part

1081
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:47,060
And the red part is the result of OMAR observation

1082
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:49,060
So the result of OMAR observation is basically dust

1083
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:54,580
Then they found that the horizontal part is a messy piece

1084
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:55,580
That is, they have a wider distribution

1085
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:58,860
And their dust is very compact in the middle

1086
01:59:58,860 --> 01:59:59,860
So what they found is that the horizontal part is a messy piece

1087
01:59:59,860 --> 01:59:59,860
