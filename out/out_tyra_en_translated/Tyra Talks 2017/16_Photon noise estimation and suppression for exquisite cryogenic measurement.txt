Okay, let's welcome everyone to participate in today's TARA speech.
Today's speaker is Mr. Zhang Yanyong.
He is now a Ph.D. student in astronomy and physics at Caltech.
Before coming to Caltech, he studied at NTU Physics and NTU Mechanics.
During his time at NTU, he specialized in accelerometers,
half astronomy and half accelerometers, high-performance physics experiments.
Now he is at Caltech, he specializes in dark matter experiments,
which are more astronomical.
So today's speech is mainly about...
My understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Zhang Yanyong.
It's mainly about how they detect their detectors in design experiments.
I want to share it with you.
Some of it has nothing to do with today's speech,
but it has a lot to do with the speaker.
Zhang Yanyong is a disciplined, self-trained athlete.
He is a good trainer.
If you are interested in running, cycling, or surfing,
he has a lot of experience.
He also likes to discuss these things with you.
Lastly, as you have heard,
today is Zhang Yanyong's birthday.
Actually, it's not yesterday, it's today.
I don't know why Zhang Yanyong...
Did Zhang Yanyong say that he was drunk yesterday because it was his birthday?
It's not easy to forget your birthday.
So I decided to sing a happy birthday song for Zhang Yanyong.
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.
You can open the microphone and sing together.
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.
Let's welcome Zhang Yanyong to share his research with us.
I'll turn off the microphone.
Can you hear me?
Because I found that the new version of BlueJeans
can't use a lot of screens on Linux.
So the topic I'm going to talk about is
Photon Noise Estimation and Suppression for Explicit Cryogenic Measurement.
Why did I choose this topic?
The reason is...
Of course, this is very specific.
It's an example of what we're doing right now.
But we all know that
any experiment needs to pursue a higher sensitivity.
The current trend in the world is that we're going to do it at a lower temperature.
Because basic statistical physics tells us that
no matter what system it is,
its noise is basically related to temperature.
So the lower the temperature, the lower the noise.
So today I want to talk about something more general.
For most people, whether they're listening now
or watching on the Internet,
those who are doing experiments
and want to take it,
whether you want to put your experiment device into a liquid nitrogen
or a liquid nitrogen solution,
or like we use cryogenic dilution fridge,
are all useful technologies.
In order to further promote its sensitivity in our experiments,
we developed an application of this technology.
Next slide.
I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about
what our traditional concept of noise is.
Why these concepts are very meaningful
if you think through the details.
But it's not something we can apply directly to our experiments.
First of all, what you're seeing now is called
thermal noise,
which we think is traditionally classical noise.
Of course, we have to say it's Johnson-Nyquist noise
because Johnson-Nyquist is the person who invented it.
Its feature is that it's very wide,
that is, it's maybe 10 hertz.
What you see on the screen
may be from 10 hertz to tens of millions of hertz.
It's the whole range
that you can see this kind of noise signal.
And it's flat, so it's called white noise.
It's like white light.
We know that Johnson found that
this noise only has to do with the temperature
of the instrument that produces this noise,
or the equivalent temperature.
It doesn't have to do with anything else.
For example, I have a resistor today,
and it keeps producing noise.
This resistor, whether it's made of cement,
wire, metal, or air,
it doesn't matter.
As long as the temperature of this thing is like that,
its noise is like that.
This is a very special thing.
So at the beginning of the 20th century,
it was a very special physics.
That is, you would have expected
that this thing would keep producing that noisy signal.
Should it be related to its material?
The answer is no.
But later on, the development of quantum mechanics
immediately made people think,
isn't this the same as black radiation?
What is black radiation?
Black radiation is its light or energy.
Its energy is kT,
and it only has to do with temperature.
Because no matter what material it is,
they exchange energy with light.
I've already said that.
So here's a question.
What is it that makes this classical system
reach thermal equilibrium?
The answer is light.
No matter what material it is, it's all light.
Okay.
So this light becomes...
Later on, Planck found that
as long as light reaches thermal equilibrium,
this thing will emit light.
It has nothing to do with material.
It has nothing to do with temperature.
Then it's called black radiation.
But we also know that black radiation
is the most important thing in human history.
It is the first direct evidence,
and it has been explained,
and it has started the so-called quantum era.
Without quantum mechanics,
without the phenomenon of quantum being brought into physics,
there is no way to explain black radiation.
So here's a very strange thing.
We say this is a classical system.
Classical thermal equilibrium has this phenomenon.
But without quantum mechanics,
there is no way to explain it.
So why does this happen?
If you put any material in a temperature,
put it in a temperature environment,
which is more scientific,
which is called photon bath.
Then through these quantum particles,
which is what we call photons,
exchange energy to reach thermal equilibrium,
there will be this classical effect.
Why is this thing?
Because in fact...
Okay.
Why is the classical description
applicable to the quantum phenomenon?
It has a very important reason.
This reason will also tell me today
why it is very relevant to future experiments.
Because in past experiments,
we usually think that
I operate in classical regime,
I think classical,
that is, T equals 4KT.
If I operate in quantum regime,
I think quantum.
But why is this important?
Because I have already said that
in this classical noise,
it actually comes from quantum effect.
But why can we use
classical treatment to think about this thing?
Because if you look at the textbook
or you look at the wiki,
roughly, usually at a normal temperature,
I write Montaigne here.
In fact, I just want to imply that
in fact, we are not doing
the experiment we are doing now in the future.
At a normal size,
for example, as big as your palm,
a normal temperature,
for example, a thing of room temperature,
it emits a ray of black radiation.
That ray of light
is every second,
every square meter,
it will emit 10 to 20 times of radiation.
So much that it's like
when you go to drink water,
you won't feel a drop of water
hitting your tongue.
It's like a continuous state.
So a classical description can be used.
So it can be calculated as 4KT.
But we can't forget that
if you look at its spectrum,
it can't be explained by classical physics.
It must be quantized.
That's why we started the quantum era.
So I can ask a question.
If your tongue is really sensitive,
when you drink water,
can you feel a drop of water?
Think about this question.
I will continue to talk later.
Then everyone will know
why I'm asking this question.
This question is actually quite interesting.
Next time you drink water,
you can think about
if I can feel a drop of water
on my tongue.
This is the first type.
Now let's look at the second type.
The second type is called shock noise
or Poisson noise.
Of course, Poisson comes from
Poisson distribution.
I think most people who study quantum mechanics
have studied it.
This is a mathematical description.
When you have a fixed probability,
you can calculate
the probability of something happening
in the fixed probability.
But sometimes I see it,
and the last chance I see it
is the biggest.
The last chance I see it is the smallest.
If you look at the picture on the right,
for example, let's look at the blue and purple.
On average,
there is a certain probability
that you will see something
four times.
For example, you see it four times
in one minute.
If you see it five times
in one minute,
it will be smaller.
If you see it six times,
it will be smaller.
But you actually have a chance
to see it 50 or 20 times
in one minute.
But the chance is very small.
You see it is very small here.
And zero times is also very small.
This thing is called Poisson distribution.
It is a system
that requires quantization
to be resolvable.
For example,
if the leaves fall down for a minute,
how many pieces can you see?
You can see this quantization.
Why?
What we are implying here is that
as a detector,
the resolution of your timing
is much higher than
the frequency at which the leaves fall down,
rather than the
frequency at which the leaves fall down.
So you can see this quantization.
So it becomes shot noise.
But you will suddenly find that
shot noise is a peak.
It's bulging here,
on the right side of the picture.
It's not like the picture above.
It's a whole screen.
But in theory,
they are just different.
Do you have that kind of resolution
that can see
the leaves fall down
or the frequency
of the water molecules hitting the tongue?
But its nature
is very different.
You see this shot noise.
It's a very narrow band.
It's a peak here.
And it's due to quantization.
It's due to the quantum nature
of carrier or event.
The example I just gave
is the leaves falling down.
But I can give another example.
For example,
if there is a導線 today,
you charge it.
The resistance of the導線 is very small.
So through the current,
the particles of the electron
are very, very, very many.
So it feels like
the thermal noise
I just mentioned.
That's also very typical.
That's how people measure
thermal noise.
But it's exactly the same thing.
If I put a導線 today
and use the pressure to do it,
is the resistance super, super big?
It's so big
that you can't measure it.
Uh,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
a dozen,
uh,
a visionure
dozen thousand.
So how was
that pressure-cousine
and小光

showed
a video
but if you give it
a very,
very,
very large voltage
it can destroy
that
then let it pull
out a
pull out a
good
like this
is shot
noise
but shot noise
in the
inside
is usually
happening
in you
have to
apply
a very,
very large
energy
to stimulate
this thing
may happen
in a small
opportunity
that
you can see
but see the
number is very
few,
so once,
twice,
three times
you can see
quantization
but we
want to do
experiments
in the future
good
I'm
I'm
good
so
in principle
any
signal
can be
uh
poisson
if we
have infinite
timing
resolution
you will
feel
and then
return to
the original
state to
feel the
next
molecule
in fact,
you can
feel the
shot noise
when you
drink
water
is that
you are
hit by the
tongue
is not a
fixed
water
pressure
ok
good
that
we
why
we
actually
like a
can feel
when drinking
water molecules
hit us
one by one
we want to
resolve
there is no
such a
resolution
experiment
for example
we generally
expect in
the simulation
ah
every five years
or ten years
of operation
why
five years
or ten
years
because
this is the
DOE
theory
we can see
usually expect
for example,
five or ten
events will
happen
and then
ah
for example,
like the
dark matter
or like
ah
no
DOE
beta
beta
change
or
DOE
hit the
atomic box
and then
the original
DOE
and then
bounce out
this rare
and then
of course
we can not
take them
that we observe
several times
to
ah
to translate into
there is no
new physics
to make these
things happen
is very
important
so we are
basically doing
this
good
but I just
said ah
you see oh
every five years
can see a few
events
means that
you can see
a year
probably
ah
normal
energy
excitation
for example,
the magnetic field of the earth
for example,
you give it a voltage
because you want to
charge
this thing
to reach a
physical
stable
time
it
every second
per square meter
area
to release
ten
twenty-one
square
light
has been crazy
to hit
your
detector
what
every year
you can see
ten twenty-five
square
ah
light
and then
this middle
may be involved
a
ok
one of
this you want to
see the
event
so basically
you can not
tell
you can not
tell
that
ah
this
this
in my
detector
inside
trigger
up
this
event
this
first
second
is basically
you only have
ten twenty-five
square
one-third
of the
opportunity
to store
data
the rest
is the
trash
that
this
basically
is
that
you can not
have a good
data
is
data
acquisition
system
and
electronics
to store
it
and
all the
trash
so we have to
find a way to
deal with
this thing
that is
the simplest
and most
intuitive
and basically
all have
to do
high sensitivity
experiment
no matter
what
I know
now the
grassland
there are people
doing
them to put
the sensor
because if
you go to
look at the
black radiation
of the
black radiation
of the
light
of the
flux
that
is what
the flow
is proportional
to the
temperature of
three times
so for
example,
300k is
probably
room temperature
and then
30
is now
common
we know
that
it can
but it
only has one
super small
point that
is not
because that
it is basically
studying the
temperature of the
change itself
it can not
contain a
experiment
in a container
we know
now can
be stable
and long
time
operation
is about
230
minikelvin
we say
if you put
a room temperature
of the
device
temperature
is 423
12 times
that above
the above
I just said
every second
every square
meter
there will be 21
so you
do this
you do this
to reduce it
to every second
square meter
there will be
9 times
of light
value
that if you
want to
operate
for example,
how many years
you now
may have
10
12 times
12
13 times
montre
and so on
but you have
one year
so we
now have
12 to
12 to
13 times
12 to
13 times
to reduce
how can we do it?
we can do another thing
is that we can find
some things
he absorbed
infrared light
is very strong
ok
I give an example
for example
for example
there are some
plastic materials
your eyes
see it is transparent
such as
the acrylic
box
but in fact
he is
infrared
is not completely
transparent
infrared hit him
will be completely
absorbed
OK
then I thought
that good
that's great
that I put
my experiment
all wrapped in
this kind of
acrylic inside
that would not
get it
the answer is not
because
why
an external
environment
will put out
infrared
because it is
a black body
that he put out
infrared purpose
or its function
is what
the temperature
is lower than
his thing
or will absorb
his infrared
things
to heat balance
OK
so you
you can say
good
I put a
box on my
experiment
equipment
at first
you will find
infrared
noise
is to hit
your detector
infrared
noise
suddenly
down
but slowly
slowly
slowly
slowly
super
this box
will also become
that source
temperature
and then he became
source temperature
and then
no matter what material
it is a black body
it is a black body
he put out
the photon
just related to
its temperature
so basically
you cover
a photon
a black body
and that you do
not want
the temperature
next to your
detector
so we
searched
a lot of
material
if we
exchange
privately
but usually
can not be used to
say that we have a
lot of material
is a material
library
for this thing
to compile
a super
material library
and then we found
one thing
is that we
picked a few
of its absorption
very strong
material
and its
material
its own
thermal conductivity
is very good
so you just
put this
material
on another
temperature
it can
continue to
take this
300k light
up and
pass it
away
it can continue
to maintain
the 50k
it touched
that thing
so it
is equal to
you put a
300k
noise
photon
source
into a
50k
photon
source
but
see the picture
on the right
this is just
I want to say
that if you
but this thing
took us a lot of
time
that we also
hope that
all kinds of
applications
can be
exchanged
and then we
can have
collaborators
need this
thing we
are all
welcome
so good
and then
next
I take a look
I did
this wrong
but
next
is that
we want to
say
traditionally
if you
look at
how much light
hit
us in
this
particle physics
inside
we usually
know that
we are in the
accelerator
inside
the collision
particle
particle
energy
are very,
very high
high to
its wavelength
I do not know
you know
the wavelength
is probably
the energy
of the
wavelength
is usually
very,
very,
very high
zlich
is small
is using
because
now
on the
keyboard
keyboard
from which
the radius
radius
right
how big
is probably
a little
less than
1.22
Ok
if
you see
now
that
you think
it is a dense
that I can tell you
that is probably
0.0
0.1
to 0.1
mm
is about 100
microns
OK
good
that if there is a
particle
it in
that
strong
magnet
magnet
is made
out of
its energy
is 14
so its
length
is smaller
than
nanometer
so
this
is a
space
right
it can pass
directly
it will not
touch anything
so
on the
traditional
particle
simulation
all of
these
tool
kits
assume
that
these
particles
are a
point
without
size
and
when it
travels
it
will
travel
in
a
straight
line
so
this is
what you
see
these
lines
are
particles
in
simulation
it
travels
in
a straight
line
so
we
put
the
material
on
the
surface
and
we
can
simulate
but
we have
to draw
a line
and
get an
event
so
we
just
said
every
second
every
year
we
have to
simulate
10
25
times
so
if
you
want
to
simulate
10
27
times
an event
you
have to
simulate
10
27
times
an event
so
you
can
simulate
it
so
that
it
is
useful
otherwise
it
will be
ignored
so
it
is
useless
so
you
can
simulate
it
so
that
it
is
useful
otherwise
it
is

so
