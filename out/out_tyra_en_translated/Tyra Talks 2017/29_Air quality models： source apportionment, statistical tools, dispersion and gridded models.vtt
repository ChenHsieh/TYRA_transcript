WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.160
Okay, I'll start now.

00:04.160 --> 00:05.360
I was scared.

00:05.360 --> 00:09.000
So what I'm going to talk about today is

00:10.760 --> 00:13.920
I'm going to describe fluid mechanics,

00:13.920 --> 00:16.800
but I'm going to use quantum mechanics

00:16.800 --> 00:19.760
to describe fluid mechanics.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.520
Before I start, I'm going to talk about

00:23.520 --> 00:25.840
why fluid mechanics,

00:25.840 --> 00:28.360
usually the Navier-Stokes equation or Euler equation,

00:28.360 --> 00:30.360
is very non-linear.

00:30.360 --> 00:35.360
How could it be related to this linear equation?

00:35.360 --> 00:37.360
In fact, this is not a discovery.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.360
As early as 1926,

00:39.360 --> 00:42.360
Magnum had already discovered

00:42.360 --> 00:45.360
that these two equations are closely related.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.360
I usually think like this.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.360
The Euler equation,

00:50.360 --> 00:52.360
the physics behind it is like this.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.360
It has a few postulates.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.360
The first one is that there is inertia.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.360
That is to say, if the particle has no force,

00:59.360 --> 01:02.360
the speed is just following the speed of the particle.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.360
So the speed of the fluid is

01:05.360 --> 01:07.360
the speed of the vector.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.360
But in fact, there is an inner force in the fluid,

01:11.360 --> 01:13.360
which is the pressure.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.360
And Euler's assumption is that

01:16.360 --> 01:18.360
this is a conservative field,

01:18.360 --> 01:20.360
so it is already a gradient of function.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.360
And finally, this gradient of function,

01:23.360 --> 01:25.360
which is the pressure force,

01:25.360 --> 01:28.360
is the only constraint.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.360
In fact, it is an incompressible flow.

01:31.360 --> 01:34.360
And these assumptions are combined

01:34.360 --> 01:38.360
to write the incompressible Euler equation.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.360
And the most difficult part in this equation

01:41.360 --> 01:44.360
is actually the inertia part.

01:44.360 --> 01:48.360
Because it has a non-linear effect in the equation.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.360
That is, U dot gradient U.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.360
When you say P-lemming,

01:54.360 --> 01:58.360
I also want to use these non-linear equations.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.360
Yes, just like dust.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.360
Do you know why?

02:02.360 --> 02:04.360
If I have the first equation on the right,

02:04.360 --> 02:06.360
will it be very simple?

02:12.360 --> 02:14.360
It can be said to be simple or not simple.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.360
It is not so direct.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.360
It is also a non-linear method.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.360
It is a Berger's equation.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.360
If you want to simulate,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.360
you can just throw a lot of particles

02:28.360 --> 02:30.360
and let it fly.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.360
But in the end, you have to predict

02:32.360 --> 02:34.360
what the final density is.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.360
In fact, it can be clearly written down.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.360
Especially when it is Euler,

02:38.360 --> 02:40.360
it can be clearly written down.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.360
In fact, there are some interesting phenomena.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.360
It is not very direct.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.360
And those are all non-linear phenomena.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.360
It looks like a very simple physics.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.360
But in fact, because it is non-linear,

02:50.360 --> 02:52.360
it just runs out of phenomena.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.360
Many non-linear phenomena,

02:54.360 --> 02:56.360
such as shock wave and reflection wave,

02:56.360 --> 02:58.360
will appear.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.360
Yes, it's a simple version,

03:00.360 --> 03:02.360
but it's not so direct.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.360
This non-linear phenomenon

03:08.360 --> 03:10.360
can be written in different ways.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.360
Like Lagrange and Helmholtz.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.360
A lot of people

03:14.360 --> 03:16.360
write Euler's equation in the same way.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.360
But the non-linear phenomenon

03:18.360 --> 03:20.360
is always there.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.360
It's all because of the law of inertia.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.360
But in fact, there is a linear equation.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.360
Schrodinger's equation

03:26.360 --> 03:28.360
is built into the law of inertia.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.360
Schrodinger's equation

03:34.360 --> 03:36.360
for complex value wave function

03:36.360 --> 03:38.360
is written like this.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.360
I will throw away the potential term.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.360
This looks like a heat equation.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.360
Yes, the mathematical convention

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
is that delta is the Laplacian.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.360
It's usually a gradient equation.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.360
It looks like a heat equation,

03:52.360 --> 03:54.360
but there is an i.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.360
h bar is a function

03:58.360 --> 04:00.360
in my entire talk.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.360
But this Schrodinger's equation

04:04.360 --> 04:06.360
shouldn't be regarded as a heat equation.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.360
It's actually a wave equation.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.360
And it's a dispersive wave equation.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.360
It has a dispersion phenomenon.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.360
That is, different waves

04:14.360 --> 04:16.360
travel at different speeds.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.360
If I look at the group velocity

04:20.360 --> 04:22.360
of this wave,

04:22.360 --> 04:24.360
you can see the dispersion relation.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.360
The group velocity is actually

04:26.360 --> 04:28.360
equal to the wave number.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.360
The wave number

04:30.360 --> 04:32.360
is usually measured by

04:32.360 --> 04:34.360
the IC time of the E2 wave.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.360
It will show

04:36.360 --> 04:38.360
the wave number

04:38.360 --> 04:40.360
and

04:40.360 --> 04:42.360
the point is that

04:42.360 --> 04:44.360
the wave number and the

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
wave number of the wave

04:46.360 --> 04:48.360
are actually all

04:48.360 --> 04:50.360
measured by the group velocity.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.360
The wave number itself is

04:52.360 --> 04:54.360
the group velocity.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.360
So you will get a

04:56.360 --> 04:58.360
velocity-advected-by-velocity phenomenon.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.360
That is, it only has

05:00.360 --> 05:02.360
an internal

05:02.360 --> 05:04.360
flying phenomenon.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.360
Because the speed is written as

05:06.360 --> 05:08.360
So based on this variable

05:08.360 --> 05:10.360
change, you can see that

05:10.360 --> 05:12.360
the original non-linear things

05:12.360 --> 05:14.360
may become linear, or the linear

05:14.360 --> 05:16.360
may become non-linear.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.360
After the Schrodinger equation

05:18.360 --> 05:20.360
is logged, what you get

05:20.360 --> 05:22.360
will be this

05:22.360 --> 05:24.360
functional phenomenon.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.360
This was actually done by

05:26.360 --> 05:28.360
Madelung in 1926.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.360
In 1925, Schrodinger

05:30.360 --> 05:32.360
just wrote the Schrodinger equation.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.360
The next year, Madelung said

05:34.360 --> 05:36.360
amplitude squared

05:36.360 --> 05:38.360
is the density of the fluid.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.360
That can be regarded as the probability

05:40.360 --> 05:42.360
density of the particle.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.360
Then you

05:44.360 --> 05:46.360
treat the whole system as a fluid.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.360
The speed of the fluid is

05:48.360 --> 05:50.360
gradient of theta, which is

05:50.360 --> 05:52.360
the group velocity.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.360
If you do this,

05:54.360 --> 05:56.360
you bring these things in

05:56.360 --> 05:58.360
and separate the actual area.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.360
Then it will be a

06:00.360 --> 06:02.360
If you have seen fluid,

06:02.360 --> 06:04.360
you will find that

06:04.360 --> 06:06.360
this is the compressible Euler equation.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.360
The first method is

06:08.360 --> 06:10.360
conservation of mass.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.360
The second is conservation of momentum.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.360
The only difference between

06:14.360 --> 06:16.360
compressible and classical fluid

06:16.360 --> 06:18.360
is the bone potential.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.360
In the end, this is also the key

06:20.360 --> 06:22.360
to evolving into bone mechanics.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.360
But this

06:26.360 --> 06:28.360
won't appear later.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.360
Because you can know

06:30.360 --> 06:32.360
I will add a

06:32.360 --> 06:34.360
compressible Euler equation

06:34.360 --> 06:36.360
to make it incompressible.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.360
In that case,

06:38.360 --> 06:40.360
the density will become constant

06:40.360 --> 06:42.360
and the bone potential will disappear.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.360
So we don't have to worry about it later.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.360
What I just said

06:48.360 --> 06:50.360
is that these two

06:50.360 --> 06:52.360
actually have a point of view.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.360
The first one is

06:54.360 --> 06:56.360
The first one is

06:58.360 --> 07:00.360
The first one is

07:00.360 --> 07:02.360
the continuity equation.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.360
q is the density.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.360
So this is

07:08.360 --> 07:10.360
the quality conservation.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.360
So when you say h bar equals 0,

07:12.360 --> 07:14.360
it's completely true.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.360
h bar equals 0.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.360
If your h bar equals 0,

07:20.360 --> 07:22.360
it looks very similar.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.360
But the

07:24.360 --> 07:26.360
fluid velocity

07:26.360 --> 07:28.360
h bar equals 0,

07:28.360 --> 07:30.360
the flow velocity disappears.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.360
Unless your theta

07:32.360 --> 07:34.360
is infinitely large.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.360
Look at the third line.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.360
The fluid velocity is u times h bar times the gradient.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.360
If your h bar equals 0,

07:46.360 --> 07:48.360
your theta will...

07:48.360 --> 07:50.360
You can make h bar very small.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.360
It will become

07:52.360 --> 07:54.360
semi-classic continuity.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.360
It will become very close to the fluid velocity.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.360
But you can't measure it directly.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.360
Just treat it as a variable.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.360
I only have u and theta left.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.360
Under this new variable,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.360
I already have

08:08.360 --> 08:10.360
q bar, q bar,

08:10.360 --> 08:12.360
h bar equals 0.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.360
But this implies that your theta

08:14.360 --> 08:16.360
must be an infinite positive function.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.360
So...

08:18.360 --> 08:20.360
Just treat it as...

08:20.360 --> 08:22.360
Let's say...

08:22.360 --> 08:24.360
Okay, that's it.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.360
So my

08:32.360 --> 08:34.360
overview is...

08:34.360 --> 08:36.360
At the beginning,

08:36.360 --> 08:38.360
I just simulated

08:38.360 --> 08:40.360
to show you the simulation result.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.360
And then...

08:42.360 --> 08:44.360
Next, I want to talk about

08:44.360 --> 08:46.360
a theory that is

08:46.360 --> 08:48.360
more advanced than the variable variation.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.360
It's called Geometric Clutch Variables.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.360
I don't know how much I can talk about it.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.360
For the dynamics part,

08:54.360 --> 08:56.360
I will talk about the result.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.360
But

08:58.360 --> 09:00.360
there may be some parts in the middle.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.360
I will try to talk about it.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.360
If you have any questions,

09:04.360 --> 09:06.360
please feel free to ask.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.360
I will use some

09:10.360 --> 09:12.360
more complicated math.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.360
And then...

09:14.360 --> 09:16.360
We published a paper

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
called Schrodinger's Smoke.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.360
It's about cat when smoke.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.360
It's about

09:22.360 --> 09:24.360
doing some

09:24.360 --> 09:26.360
utility simulation.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.360
So if you google

09:28.360 --> 09:30.360
Schrodinger's Smoke, you will see our paper.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.360
We use

09:32.360 --> 09:34.360
Madelung's idea.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.360
We want to

09:36.360 --> 09:38.360
treat fluid density...

09:38.360 --> 09:40.360
Instead of using

09:40.360 --> 09:42.360
density and velocity.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.360
We use the complex value

09:44.360 --> 09:46.360
wave function.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.360
And then use Madelung's variable variation.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.360
And this fluid velocity

09:50.360 --> 09:52.360
actually has this...

09:52.360 --> 09:54.360
You can write gradient theta

09:54.360 --> 09:56.360
as the square on the right.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.360
If you

09:58.360 --> 10:00.360
write it like this,

10:00.360 --> 10:02.360
you will find that

10:02.360 --> 10:04.360
minus i gradient is

10:04.360 --> 10:06.360
the momentum operator.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.360
So it just evaluates the momentum operator.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.360
But

10:10.360 --> 10:12.360
the point is

10:12.360 --> 10:14.360
even though it looks great,

10:14.360 --> 10:16.360
but velocity is just

10:16.360 --> 10:18.360
a function of function.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.360
It means that you don't have any vorticity.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.360
When you take

10:22.360 --> 10:24.360
velocity and curl,

10:24.360 --> 10:26.360
look at the angular momentum,

10:26.360 --> 10:28.360
you will find that it's zero.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.360
Your velocity

10:30.360 --> 10:32.360
can only be this kind of potential flow.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.360
Or this kind of

10:34.360 --> 10:36.360
no vortex fluid.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.360
It's not interesting.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.360
To solve this problem,

10:40.360 --> 10:42.360
we consider

10:42.360 --> 10:44.360
two components Schrodinger equation.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.360
You can think of this

10:46.360 --> 10:48.360
as spin half particle.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.360
Or you can think of it as

10:50.360 --> 10:52.360
two components.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.360
Its Schrodinger equation is still the same.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.360
It's component wise.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.360
It's still the same

10:58.360 --> 11:00.360
one component Schrodinger equation.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.360
The variable variation

11:02.360 --> 11:04.360
is the density of the fluid.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.360
It's still the same.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.360
Amplitude squared.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.360
But in this case,

11:10.360 --> 11:12.360
it's the sum of

11:12.360 --> 11:14.360
the density of two channels.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.360
And

11:16.360 --> 11:18.360
for velocity,

11:18.360 --> 11:20.360
it's the same as the momentum operator.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.360
If you write this down,

11:22.360 --> 11:24.360
it will become

11:24.360 --> 11:26.360
the velocity of two components.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.360
But

11:28.360 --> 11:30.360
it's a linear combination.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.360
It depends on their density.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.360
In this case,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.360
you don't have to worry about curl.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.360
It can

11:38.360 --> 11:40.360
describe

11:40.360 --> 11:42.360
more interesting

11:42.360 --> 11:44.360
fluid states.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.360
So we use one component

11:46.360 --> 11:48.360
and two components

11:48.360 --> 11:50.360
to describe the fluid.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.360
Now,

11:54.360 --> 11:56.360
to describe the fluid,

11:56.360 --> 11:58.360
we need to describe incompressible fluid.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.360
We already have the inertial motion.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.360
To describe

12:02.360 --> 12:04.360
incompressible fluid,

12:04.360 --> 12:06.360
we add a potential term

12:06.360 --> 12:08.360
to make it correspond to the velocity.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.360
It's the divergence tree.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.360
It's like the Euler equation.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.360
When you add the pressure,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.360
the fluid becomes incompressible fluid.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.360
Then we

12:20.360 --> 12:22.360
use the constraint Schrodinger equation

12:22.360 --> 12:24.360
to describe the incompressible Schrodinger equation.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.360
The solution is

12:26.360 --> 12:28.360
the incompressible Schrodinger flow.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.360
Then

12:32.360 --> 12:34.360
it's the same as

12:34.360 --> 12:36.360
other incompressible flow.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.360
As long as you have

12:38.360 --> 12:40.360
continuity equation,

12:40.360 --> 12:42.360
that is, the quality is constant,

12:42.360 --> 12:44.360
and

12:44.360 --> 12:46.360
it's incompressible fluid.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.360
The volume will not change over time.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.360
The density

12:50.360 --> 12:52.360
will not change

12:52.360 --> 12:54.360
over time.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.360
Initially, if density is constant,

12:56.360 --> 12:58.360
it will always be constant.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.360
My question is

13:00.360 --> 13:02.360
you

13:04.360 --> 13:06.360
turn it into

13:06.360 --> 13:08.360
a two-component

13:08.360 --> 13:10.360
vector.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.360
Are you a two-component?

13:12.360 --> 13:14.360
If

13:14.360 --> 13:16.360
the screen is zero,

13:16.360 --> 13:18.360
there will be no velocity.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.360
If you have two components,

13:20.360 --> 13:22.360
you need at least two components.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.360
What is the implication?

13:24.360 --> 13:26.360
How do you turn it into a one-component?

13:26.360 --> 13:28.360
Actually,

13:28.360 --> 13:30.360
at the beginning,

13:30.360 --> 13:32.360
nComponent

13:32.360 --> 13:34.360
and twoComponent.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.360
After that,

13:36.360 --> 13:38.360
twoComponent

13:38.360 --> 13:40.360
is enough.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.360
The meaning of enough

13:42.360 --> 13:44.360
is

13:44.360 --> 13:46.360
in

13:46.360 --> 13:48.360
the middle,

13:48.360 --> 13:50.360
at the end,

13:50.360 --> 13:52.360
there is a question.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.360
Can you find

13:54.360 --> 13:56.360
a two-component wave function

13:56.360 --> 13:58.360
that matches

13:58.360 --> 14:00.360
the velocity?

14:00.360 --> 14:02.360
Then I found that two-component

14:02.360 --> 14:04.360
did a good job.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.360
It means that it can be done

14:06.360 --> 14:08.360
suddenly.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.360
Is it a two-component?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.360
Three-component.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.360
Do you mean domain?

14:14.360 --> 14:16.360
Is it a fluid domain?

14:18.360 --> 14:20.360
Is it a fluid space?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.360
Yes.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.360
Two-component or three-component?

14:36.360 --> 14:38.360
Sorry.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.360
There are four variables

14:44.360 --> 14:46.360
on your right hand side.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.360
Each size is different.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.360
On the left hand side,

14:50.360 --> 14:52.360
there are two

14:52.360 --> 14:54.360
or three variables.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.360
If there are two variables,

14:58.360 --> 15:00.360
there is a redundancy on the right hand side.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.360
Do you know

15:02.360 --> 15:04.360
what is redundancy?

15:04.360 --> 15:06.360
You mean

15:06.360 --> 15:08.360
four components

15:08.360 --> 15:10.360
are like four-component,

15:10.360 --> 15:12.360
but there are only three-component

15:12.360 --> 15:14.360
to be described.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.360
Yes, there is redundancy.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.360
Then...

15:20.360 --> 15:22.360
Let me think about it.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.360
Is it a symmetry?

15:24.360 --> 15:26.360
What?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.360
Yes, it is.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.360
It is a bit complicated.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.360
There is a symmetry.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.360
It means

15:34.360 --> 15:36.360
when you write the velocity field

15:36.360 --> 15:38.360
like this,

15:38.360 --> 15:40.360
in the end,

15:40.360 --> 15:42.360
we will do an unshrinkable flow.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.360
The unshrinkable flow is just

15:44.360 --> 15:46.360
that the velocity field drops a little bit.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.360
All the velocity fields

15:48.360 --> 15:50.360
can be projected.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.360
All the radians of pressure

15:52.360 --> 15:54.360
can be shrinked.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.360
After this,

15:56.360 --> 15:58.360
this space

15:58.360 --> 16:00.360
will only be dominated by

16:00.360 --> 16:02.360
one particle.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.360
Given curl of u,

16:04.360 --> 16:06.360
we can only decide how much u is.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.360
The curl of u

16:08.360 --> 16:10.360
will be mapped to

16:10.360 --> 16:12.360
the two-component

16:12.360 --> 16:14.360
wave function

16:14.360 --> 16:16.360
corresponding to the spin vector

16:16.360 --> 16:18.360
or block vector.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.360
There is a gauge symmetry

16:20.360 --> 16:22.360
which is the variable

16:22.360 --> 16:24.360
of the unshrinkable area.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.360
It will be

16:26.360 --> 16:28.360
corresponding to the same velocity field.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.360
In the end,

16:30.360 --> 16:32.360
you will see a big

16:32.360 --> 16:34.360
redundant degree of freedom.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.360
So on the right,

16:36.360 --> 16:38.360
the overall phase

16:38.360 --> 16:40.360
of quantum mechanics

16:40.360 --> 16:42.360
is not important.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.360
Is it physical or...

16:44.360 --> 16:46.360
It's the same.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.360
It just matches

16:48.360 --> 16:50.360
the velocity field.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.360
In the velocity field,

16:52.360 --> 16:54.360
we need to do pressure projection.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.360
The redundancy.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.360
In the end, it will match.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.360
Yes.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.360
In the velocity field,

17:02.360 --> 17:04.360
we need to remove

17:04.360 --> 17:06.360
some redundancy

17:06.360 --> 17:08.360
to describe the

17:08.360 --> 17:10.360
unshrinkable flow.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.360
It's the phase shift

17:12.360 --> 17:14.360
in Schrodinger's equation.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.360
Why can you use

17:16.360 --> 17:18.360
both domain and three-dimensional?

17:18.360 --> 17:20.360
This is...

17:22.360 --> 17:24.360
Actually,

17:24.360 --> 17:26.360
domain can be done

17:26.360 --> 17:28.360
in higher dimensions.

17:28.360 --> 17:30.360
This is because...

17:30.360 --> 17:32.360
I don't know how to explain.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.360
It's...

17:34.360 --> 17:36.360
Simply put,

17:36.360 --> 17:38.360
vorticity is a two-form.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.360
Only that thing

17:40.360 --> 17:42.360
is used

17:42.360 --> 17:44.360
to describe the flow.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.360
It's...

17:46.360 --> 17:48.360
It's...

17:48.360 --> 17:50.360
If I say

17:50.360 --> 17:52.360
the speed of unshrinkable flow

17:52.360 --> 17:54.360
is equal to

17:54.360 --> 17:56.360
the vorticity.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.360
It's a two-form.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.360
In the end,

18:00.360 --> 18:02.360
you only need

18:02.360 --> 18:04.360
a map.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.360
At most, you only need

18:06.360 --> 18:08.360
a map.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.360
So, vorticity is a two-form.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.360
Yes.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.360
If it's in the other direction,

18:14.360 --> 18:16.360
it won't shrink.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.360
It's not important.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.360
It can shrink.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.360
Yes.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.360
You can see

18:26.360 --> 18:28.360
in the end.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.360
Now, let's say it's just a metronome.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.360
Will you talk about turbulence?

18:32.360 --> 18:34.360
I won't talk about turbulence.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.360
But I will talk about

18:36.360 --> 18:38.360
the dynamics of a normal vortex.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.360
This is incompressible Schrödinger's flow.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.360
Then we...

18:46.360 --> 18:48.360
The mathematical simulation

18:48.360 --> 18:50.360
is very simple.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.360
You just need to

18:52.360 --> 18:54.360
make a circle and

18:54.360 --> 18:56.360
solve the linear Schrödinger's equation.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.360
It corresponds to

18:58.360 --> 19:00.360
your field.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.360
It's like a simulation

19:02.360 --> 19:04.360
of inertia motion.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.360
Then you apply potential force

19:06.360 --> 19:08.360
to make the field

19:08.360 --> 19:10.360
become divergence-free.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.360
Then we started to do some simulations.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.360
In the end, we found

19:16.360 --> 19:18.360
that it was

19:18.360 --> 19:20.360
very successful

19:20.360 --> 19:22.360
in simulating

19:22.360 --> 19:24.360
vortex dynamics.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.360
What is vortex?

19:26.360 --> 19:28.360
I just said curl of velocity.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.360
That thing is called vorticity.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.360
In the real fluid,

19:32.360 --> 19:34.360
it only appears

19:34.360 --> 19:36.360
from the boundary.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
It appears from the boundary.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.360
When it forms,

19:40.360 --> 19:42.360
it's already low-dimensional.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.360
It's two-dimensional geometry.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.360
That's vortex sheet.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.360
Vortex sheet is not stable.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.360
It will quickly curl into

19:50.360 --> 19:52.360
vortex filaments.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.360
It will become a vortex structure.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
That structure will become very stable.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.360
We see a lot of vortex in our daily lives.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.360
That's what we call

20:00.360 --> 20:02.360
vortex filaments.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.360
Are those two real photos?

20:04.360 --> 20:06.360
Yes, they are.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.360
They are not photoshopped.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.360
They look like real photos.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.360
The color is very bright.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.360
You need to add a filter.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.360
Yes, I need to add a filter.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.360
This is a real video.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.360
But vortex filaments

20:26.360 --> 20:28.360
are hard to simulate

20:28.360 --> 20:30.360
with a normal

20:30.360 --> 20:32.360
fluid software.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.360
Because

20:34.360 --> 20:36.360
these vortex motions

20:36.360 --> 20:38.360
are very sensitive

20:38.360 --> 20:40.360
to the

20:40.360 --> 20:42.360
vortex thickness.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.360
If the vortex becomes thicker,

20:46.360 --> 20:48.360
it will become slower.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.360
If it becomes thinner, it will become faster.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.360
So if you really want to...

20:52.360 --> 20:54.360
And the whole fluid is

20:54.360 --> 20:56.360
the whole fluid motion

20:56.360 --> 20:58.360
is dominated by

20:58.360 --> 21:00.360
these

21:00.360 --> 21:02.360
one-dimensional filaments.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.360
So if you want to calculate the whole fluid

21:04.360 --> 21:06.360
qualitatively correct,

21:06.360 --> 21:08.360
you need to use a very high

21:08.360 --> 21:10.360
resolution fluid to solve

21:10.360 --> 21:12.360
those vortex.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.360
Otherwise, the thickness will be misinterpreted.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.360
The whole

21:16.360 --> 21:18.360
vortex dynamics

21:18.360 --> 21:20.360
will be qualitatively wrong.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.360
So you either need

21:22.360 --> 21:24.360
a very expensive grid,

21:24.360 --> 21:26.360
or you need to use some very complicated methods

21:26.360 --> 21:28.360
to describe those vortex dynamics

21:28.360 --> 21:30.360
using some real curves.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.360
Then you can do those simple reconnections.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.360
But if you use Schrodinger's

21:36.360 --> 21:38.360
equation...

21:38.360 --> 21:40.360
Let me talk about

21:40.360 --> 21:42.360
the difficulties first.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.360
You can see from some benchmark tests.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.360
There is a phenomenon called leapfrogging vortex rings.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.360
If you put two vortex rings

21:48.360 --> 21:50.360
in front and back,

21:50.360 --> 21:52.360
the vortex rings will be sucked

21:52.360 --> 21:54.360
to the front.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.360
This is a real video.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.360
They will be exchanged.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.360
Then you will see...

22:00.360 --> 22:02.360
Will the people on the line see

22:02.360 --> 22:04.360
the same thing?

22:06.360 --> 22:08.360
Anyway,

22:08.360 --> 22:10.360
two vortex rings will leapfrog.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.360
But if you use

22:12.360 --> 22:14.360
a general

22:14.360 --> 22:16.360
mathematical method

22:16.360 --> 22:18.360
to solve Euler's equation or Navier-Stokes equation,

22:18.360 --> 22:20.360
even if you use a very advanced method,

22:20.360 --> 22:22.360
but if you are in a very rough grid,

22:22.360 --> 22:24.360
the two vortex rings will merge together very quickly.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.360
Then you won't see that leapfrogging phenomenon.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.360
Now we are solving...

22:28.360 --> 22:30.360
We just

22:30.360 --> 22:32.360
introduced incompressible Schrodinger flow.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.360
It has the same resolution size.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.360
You can see that

22:36.360 --> 22:38.360
it can do this.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.360
It can reproduce

22:40.360 --> 22:42.360
this observed phenomenon.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.360
Then...

22:44.360 --> 22:46.360
Let me ask a question.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.360
You just said

22:48.360 --> 22:50.360
that it can reproduce this phenomenon.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.360
It means that

22:52.360 --> 22:54.360
you can see it like this.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.360
But if you change it to a parameter,

22:56.360 --> 22:58.360
it can really

22:58.360 --> 23:00.360
change to

23:00.360 --> 23:02.360
the gas you just saw.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.360
Yes.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.360
Because there are some parameters in it.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.360
So if you want to do

23:08.360 --> 23:10.360
further parameter

23:10.360 --> 23:12.360
tuning,

23:12.360 --> 23:14.360
of course you can match it.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.360
It's actually very simple.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.360
Just two rings.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.360
It has a certain vortex.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.360
When the ring is small enough,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.360
its final dynamics is dominated by

23:24.360 --> 23:26.360
the dynamics of the vortex filaments.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.360
That thing is

23:28.360 --> 23:30.360
mathematically...

23:30.360 --> 23:32.360
Even Schrodinger, you can push it out.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.360
Under that progressive behavior,

23:34.360 --> 23:36.360
it's the same.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.360
It's...

23:38.360 --> 23:40.360
It's...

23:40.360 --> 23:42.360
You can push it out.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.360
Then the two rings will jump like this.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.360
Yes.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.360
This system is very robust.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.360
If you put the two rings together,

23:52.360 --> 23:54.360
it will jump.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.360
It will jump according to

23:56.360 --> 23:58.360
the evolution distance.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.360
So we just put it anywhere and it will jump.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.360
Another phenomenon is also a very simple setup.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.360
It means that you put two vortex rings

24:06.360 --> 24:08.360
on each other.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.360
But there is an angle.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.360
Then they will recombine.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.360
Then it will separate from the other two directions.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.360
This is a real experiment.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.360
You can see the two rings.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.360
It's like this.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.360
Then it separates.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.360
If you use a normal

24:26.360 --> 24:28.360
LTI

24:32.360 --> 24:34.360
software,

24:34.360 --> 24:36.360
it's hard to simulate this thing.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.360
It really needs very high accuracy.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.360
This is the same as

24:40.360 --> 24:42.360
our method.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.360
You can find this phenomenon

24:44.360 --> 24:46.360
on a very thick network.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.360
Then

24:48.360 --> 24:50.360
I just said that

24:52.360 --> 24:54.360
when simulating LTI,

24:54.360 --> 24:56.360
its grid resolution

24:56.360 --> 24:58.360
dominates a large part.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.360
So you can see that

25:00.360 --> 25:02.360
using some traditional methods

25:04.360 --> 25:06.360
to look at

25:06.360 --> 25:08.360
the node.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.360
Then you will find that at different resolutions,

25:10.360 --> 25:12.360
the result is the same.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.360
So using our method

25:14.360 --> 25:16.360
on a very thick network, it's close to the end.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.360
It can simulate

25:18.360 --> 25:20.360
some other interesting phenomena.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.360
It can be used

25:24.360 --> 25:26.360
in computer graphics.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.360
For example, you can simulate a jet.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.360
You can simulate an obstacle.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.360
The vortex behind.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.360
The vortex behind.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.360
Then you can simulate

25:36.360 --> 25:38.360
a moving obstacle.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.360
This video looks good when it looks smooth.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.360
Then there's

25:44.360 --> 25:46.360
another

25:46.360 --> 25:48.360
moving obstacle.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.360
Because

25:50.360 --> 25:52.360
in this kind of vortex dynamics,

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
if it can be calculated accurately,

25:54.360 --> 25:56.360
you can see

25:56.360 --> 25:58.360
a more realistic vortex

25:58.360 --> 26:00.360
phenomenon.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.360
This is really important

26:02.360 --> 26:04.360
in computer graphics.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.360
These are two

26:08.360 --> 26:10.360
water-absorbing boxes.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.360
It's called secondary small ring shoot-off.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.360
What I'm doing here is

26:14.360 --> 26:16.360
putting two

26:16.360 --> 26:18.360
pieces of ink

26:18.360 --> 26:20.360
on top of each other.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.360
It will also

26:22.360 --> 26:24.360
have a problem.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.360
What is network complexity?

26:28.360 --> 26:30.360
Network complexity is

26:30.360 --> 26:32.360
that

26:32.360 --> 26:34.360
my computation grid

26:34.360 --> 26:36.360
how many

26:36.360 --> 26:38.360
pieces each side has to cut.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.360
So usually

26:40.360 --> 26:42.360
usually

26:42.360 --> 26:44.360
you have to

26:44.360 --> 26:46.360
cut 256

26:46.360 --> 26:48.360
times 256 times 256.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.360
Or 512 times 512.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.360
You often need

26:54.360 --> 26:56.360
a very large memory

26:56.360 --> 26:58.360
to eat.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.360
Or you need to use cluster to compute.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.360
This is 64 times

27:02.360 --> 27:04.360
64 times 64.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.360
Then you introduce it in these grids.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
Yes.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.360
What is relative?

27:14.360 --> 27:16.360
You can't say it's relative.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.360
How big is the thing in the middle?

27:18.360 --> 27:20.360
Oh.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.360
It's relative.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.360
Just look at this picture.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.360
It's

27:26.360 --> 27:28.360
64 times 64 times 64.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.360
If you put it on the computer

27:30.360 --> 27:32.360
you can see

27:32.360 --> 27:34.360
that

27:34.360 --> 27:36.360
the gray part at the bottom is the network.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.360
You can see the grid.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.360
That's the real

27:40.360 --> 27:42.360
network on the

27:42.360 --> 27:44.360
computation of Lisan.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.360
So the length of the command

27:46.360 --> 27:48.360
is actually normalized.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.360
Yes.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
It has a physical size

27:54.360 --> 27:56.360
which is 1m x 1m x 1m.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.360
And

27:58.360 --> 28:00.360
it has a resolution which is dimensionless.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.360
It's 1 out of 64.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.360
Then you put it on that position.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.360
It becomes the smallest length in the world.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.360
At this length

28:08.360 --> 28:10.360
we simulate the Lisan version

28:10.360 --> 28:12.360
of this grid.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.360
Theoretically

28:14.360 --> 28:16.360
at this length

28:16.360 --> 28:18.360
when it's dimensionless

28:18.360 --> 28:20.360
it will be

28:20.360 --> 28:22.360
limited to the real

28:22.360 --> 28:24.360
continuous world.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.360
And this picture

28:26.360 --> 28:28.360
is when I'm at 64 times 64 times 64

28:28.360 --> 28:30.360
it's very close.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.360
But in the traditional method

28:32.360 --> 28:34.360
you need a higher resolution.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.360
Why did you choose this picture?

28:42.360 --> 28:44.360
This is the community.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.360
It's a little perverted.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.360
You can actually add gravity.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.360
It's a little bit

28:54.360 --> 28:56.360
when the density is different.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.360
That's because

28:58.360 --> 29:00.360
there are two components.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.360
You can play a trick.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.360
For example, when the potential of two components

29:04.360 --> 29:06.360
is a little different

29:06.360 --> 29:08.360
you can make some effects.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.360
Because of the gravity

29:16.360 --> 29:18.360
the gravity of the air

29:18.360 --> 29:20.360
is pushed up.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.360
And this is bar.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.360
H bar

29:24.360 --> 29:26.360
has a unit

29:26.360 --> 29:28.360
which is meter square

29:28.360 --> 29:30.360
meter square divided by second.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.360
And

29:32.360 --> 29:34.360
so

29:34.360 --> 29:36.360
I usually

29:36.360 --> 29:38.360
make it dimensionless.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.360
So according to my real

29:40.360 --> 29:42.360
density

29:42.360 --> 29:44.360
it's 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 meter.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.360
There is a

29:46.360 --> 29:48.360
characteristic length

29:48.360 --> 29:50.360
which is 1 meter.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.360
And then you start to get rid of these variables.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.360
Based on experience.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.360
Planck constant

29:58.360 --> 30:00.360
has nothing to do with the real Planck constant.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.360
My final analysis will say

30:06.360 --> 30:08.360
you don't have to get close to 0.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.360
That is to say

30:10.360 --> 30:12.360
H bar can be very large.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.360
The phenomenon you just saw

30:14.360 --> 30:16.360
is the result when H bar is very large.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.360
Finally, we did a mathematical analysis

30:18.360 --> 30:20.360
and found that

30:20.360 --> 30:22.360
when H bar is very large

30:22.360 --> 30:24.360
the result of Perturb

30:24.360 --> 30:26.360
is the difference between it and the Euler equation

30:26.360 --> 30:28.360
the effect

30:28.360 --> 30:30.360
is only in the

30:30.360 --> 30:32.360
vortex

30:32.360 --> 30:34.360
and other places it will be very fast

30:34.360 --> 30:36.360
to the Euler equation.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.360
There is this kind of

30:38.360 --> 30:40.360
argument.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.360
In this case, you will find that

30:42.360 --> 30:44.360
when H bar is very large,

30:44.360 --> 30:46.360
it will get the vortex

30:46.360 --> 30:48.360
dominated Euler equation.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.360
Then you will find

30:50.360 --> 30:52.360
that

30:52.360 --> 30:54.360
I will talk about this later.

30:54.360 --> 30:56.360
I don't know what I'm talking about.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.360
But

30:58.360 --> 31:00.360
H bar

31:00.360 --> 31:02.360
when it is very small

31:02.360 --> 31:04.360
it will become exactly the Euler equation.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.360
You just saw

31:06.360 --> 31:08.360
when H bar is very large

31:08.360 --> 31:10.360
I can simulate some phenomena

31:10.360 --> 31:12.360
and it is matched.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.360
I can see the phenomenon in the vortex.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.360
It is the same as the vortex.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.360
If H bar is very small

31:18.360 --> 31:20.360
it will be the same.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.360
It will be the same.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.360
It can detect the Euler equation

31:24.360 --> 31:26.360
on a very large network.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.360
Yes, if H bar is too small

31:28.360 --> 31:30.360
I think H bar is a bit

31:30.360 --> 31:32.360
too large.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.360
Yes.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.360
In fact, it is H bar

31:38.360 --> 31:40.360
that you have to choose.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.360
H bar will correspond to

31:46.360 --> 31:48.360
your

31:48.360 --> 31:50.360
If you know the super fluid

31:50.360 --> 31:52.360
there is an H bar inside.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.360
That thing will cause the vortex

31:54.360 --> 31:56.360
quantization.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.360
That is, every vortex unit

31:58.360 --> 32:00.360
can be quantized into H bar units.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.360
In that case

32:02.360 --> 32:04.360
you will see that

32:04.360 --> 32:06.360
H bar is very small

32:06.360 --> 32:08.360
you have to have the same strength

32:08.360 --> 32:10.360
of vortex to detect

32:10.360 --> 32:12.360
a lot of small vortices.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.360
You can take the real fluid as

32:16.360 --> 32:18.360
vortex becomes

32:18.360 --> 32:20.360
a continuum.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.360
That is, vortex can be any

32:22.360 --> 32:24.360
number or size.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.360
It can be taken as H bar is infinitely small

32:26.360 --> 32:28.360
and there are a lot of vortices.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.360
But when H bar is large

32:30.360 --> 32:32.360
it still has some thicker vortices.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.360
Those vortex dynamics

32:34.360 --> 32:36.360
are similar to the vortex dynamics

32:36.360 --> 32:38.360
in the fluid.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.360
What is the advantage of simulation?

32:44.360 --> 32:46.360
Is it because

32:46.360 --> 32:48.360
we don't know what linear is?

32:48.360 --> 32:50.360
Or does it have some special properties?

32:50.360 --> 32:52.360
There are two

32:52.360 --> 32:54.360
advantages.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.360
One is

32:56.360 --> 32:58.360
that the method

32:58.360 --> 33:00.360
becomes simpler.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.360
You don't have to worry about

33:02.360 --> 33:04.360
how to idealize.

33:04.360 --> 33:06.360
Because that thing is quite difficult.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.360
You just need to idealize the linear system.

33:08.360 --> 33:10.360
In Numerical Method

33:10.360 --> 33:12.360
it becomes

33:12.360 --> 33:14.360
an extreme simplification.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.360
The other is

33:16.360 --> 33:18.360
that even if I simulate

33:18.360 --> 33:20.360
in a very advanced way

33:20.360 --> 33:22.360
those non-linear OEVs

33:22.360 --> 33:24.360
still can't simulate those phenomena.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.360
In our method

33:26.360 --> 33:28.360
I can simulate those phenomena

33:28.360 --> 33:30.360
in a very early stage.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.360
Especially on those

33:32.360 --> 33:34.360
thin vortex dynamics.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.360
These are the two advantages.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.360
Someone asked

33:40.360 --> 33:42.360
what is the physics of H bar?

33:44.360 --> 33:46.360
Isn't it a high-level question?

33:46.360 --> 33:48.360
The physics of H bar

33:48.360 --> 33:50.360
in this fluid world

33:50.360 --> 33:52.360
can be regarded as a parameter.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.360
It will be connected to

33:58.360 --> 34:00.360
for example

34:02.360 --> 34:04.360
in this animation

34:04.360 --> 34:06.360
you can see

34:06.360 --> 34:08.360
a small amount of

34:08.360 --> 34:10.360
in the end

34:10.360 --> 34:12.360
the vortex will

34:12.360 --> 34:14.360
cascade to a very low level

34:14.360 --> 34:16.360
and look like turbulence.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.360
But because of H bar

34:18.360 --> 34:20.360
it will

34:20.360 --> 34:22.360
go to a certain level and won't continue to fall.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.360
That is the vortex concentration.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.360
Now that you mentioned it

34:26.360 --> 34:28.360
you don't assume

34:28.360 --> 34:30.360
that it will cascade.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.360
Will it?

34:32.360 --> 34:34.360
No.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.360
It will still cascade.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.360
In the original fluid

34:44.360 --> 34:46.360
the vortex will cascade.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.360
H bar means

34:48.360 --> 34:50.360
that at a certain level

34:50.360 --> 34:52.360
H bar will dominate

34:52.360 --> 34:54.360
and the fluid will disappear

34:54.360 --> 34:56.360
at that level.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.360
The vortex will not continue to cascade.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.360
It will become diffusion and disappear.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.360
It will eat up the energy.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.360
So when we look at

35:06.360 --> 35:08.360
turbulence

35:08.360 --> 35:10.360
if H bar

35:10.360 --> 35:12.360
is getting smaller and smaller

35:12.360 --> 35:14.360
it will cause

35:14.360 --> 35:16.360
turbulence.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.360
It will look like turbulence.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.360
Without H bar

35:20.360 --> 35:22.360
in theory

35:22.360 --> 35:24.360
it will develop into

35:24.360 --> 35:26.360
this is still an open problem

35:26.360 --> 35:28.360
how is turbulence born.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.360
A typical situation is that

35:30.360 --> 35:32.360
it will continue to cascade from H bar

35:32.360 --> 35:34.360
and then dominate into a spectrum

35:34.360 --> 35:36.360
of different

35:36.360 --> 35:38.360
things.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.360
So you mean

35:40.360 --> 35:42.360
if H bar is too large

35:42.360 --> 35:44.360
if H bar is too large

35:44.360 --> 35:46.360
you won't be able to see turbulence.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.360
Because

35:48.360 --> 35:50.360
it hasn't produced a new vortex yet

35:50.360 --> 35:52.360
so it will dissipate.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.360
I remember

35:56.360 --> 35:58.360
in Sandwich

35:58.360 --> 36:00.360
the cascading and reverse cascading

36:00.360 --> 36:02.360
were very good.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.360
We haven't done

36:06.360 --> 36:08.360
that side yet.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.360
We want to

36:10.360 --> 36:12.360
use

36:12.360 --> 36:14.360
a very large network

36:14.360 --> 36:16.360
with high resolution

36:16.360 --> 36:18.360
and then put

36:18.360 --> 36:20.360
some random

36:20.360 --> 36:22.360
velocity

36:22.360 --> 36:24.360
and random wave function

36:24.360 --> 36:26.360
and then use our method

36:26.360 --> 36:28.360
to look at its energy spectrum

36:28.360 --> 36:30.360
and then compare

36:30.360 --> 36:32.360
the turbulence.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.360
But we haven't done that yet.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.360
But usually

36:36.360 --> 36:38.360
if you want to see

36:38.360 --> 36:40.360
if this thing can model

36:40.360 --> 36:42.360
turbulence

36:42.360 --> 36:44.360
you have to look at

36:44.360 --> 36:46.360
the energy spectrum first.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.360
I think

36:48.360 --> 36:50.360
cascading versus reverse cascading

36:50.360 --> 36:52.360
is the most important thing.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.360
Is there a way?

36:54.360 --> 36:56.360
Yes.

36:56.360 --> 36:58.360
One.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.360
But there are still other ways.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.360
So you mean

37:02.360 --> 37:04.360
we don't need

37:04.360 --> 37:06.360
theory.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.360
I think reverse cascading

37:10.360 --> 37:12.360
is better.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.360
Yes.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.360
We also

37:28.360 --> 37:30.360
have

37:32.360 --> 37:34.360
simulation on the left

37:34.360 --> 37:36.360
and real video on the right.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.360
This is what we often show to others

37:40.360 --> 37:42.360
that

37:42.360 --> 37:44.360
we can use our very simple algorithm

37:44.360 --> 37:46.360
to do some

37:46.360 --> 37:48.360
simulation of turbulence.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.360
This is the first part of the remark.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.360
It means

37:54.360 --> 37:56.360
it breaks through our traditional

37:56.360 --> 37:58.360
imaginary fluid calculus

37:58.360 --> 38:00.360
what the usual framework looks like.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.360
Usually we will

38:02.360 --> 38:04.360
figure out how to simulate turbulence.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.360
But this framework

38:06.360 --> 38:08.360
doesn't have this problem.

38:10.360 --> 38:12.360
Especially in Vortex Dynamics

38:12.360 --> 38:14.360
we can

38:14.360 --> 38:16.360
simulate those phenomena.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.360
Usually we think

38:18.360 --> 38:20.360
we need to solve Euler's equation

38:20.360 --> 38:22.360
or Navier-Stokes equation.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.360
We need to be very advanced

38:24.360 --> 38:26.360
and have a very fine network

38:26.360 --> 38:28.360
to simulate those phenomena.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.360
There is also

38:30.360 --> 38:32.360
an interesting

38:32.360 --> 38:34.360
insight on math.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.360
This is

38:38.360 --> 38:40.360
incompressible Schrodinger flow equation.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.360
It looks like this.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.360
Schrodinger equation

38:44.360 --> 38:46.360
restricted on

38:46.360 --> 38:48.360
a divergence-free constraint.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.360
This divergence-free constraint

38:52.360 --> 38:54.360
can be translated into

38:54.360 --> 38:56.360
wave function and

38:56.360 --> 38:58.360
Laplacian.

38:58.360 --> 39:00.360
The spatial derivative of the whole equation

39:00.360 --> 39:02.360
is Laplacian.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.360
This is a very special

39:04.360 --> 39:06.360
part of Schrodinger.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.360
You often need to talk about

39:08.360 --> 39:10.360
U dot grad U.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.360
You use a lot of mathematical structures.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.360
You often talk about 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.360
Or

39:16.360 --> 39:18.360
you have to be on a manifold.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.360
Laplacian can be set

39:20.360 --> 39:22.360
on a very low space.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.360
You can have a graph

39:24.360 --> 39:26.360
or a point cloud.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.360
You don't even need to use a dimensional concept.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.360
In that world,

39:30.360 --> 39:32.360
you can still discuss similar flow phenomena.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.360
This is a surface,

39:38.360 --> 39:40.360
so it's still a manifold.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.360
Then we have this rabbit

39:42.360 --> 39:44.360
and its graph.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.360
A triangular graph.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.360
You can get the graph.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.360
That information is the only thing you need to know.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.360
You can solve the

39:52.360 --> 39:54.360
Schrodinger equation.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.360
You can easily

39:56.360 --> 39:58.360
use the same complexity

39:58.360 --> 40:00.360
to model the graph

40:00.360 --> 40:02.360
in this general space.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.360
That was

40:06.360 --> 40:08.360
my first part.

40:08.360 --> 40:10.360
Next, I'm going to talk about

40:10.360 --> 40:12.360
the

40:14.360 --> 40:16.360
wave function

40:18.360 --> 40:20.360
and

40:22.360 --> 40:24.360
the

40:24.360 --> 40:26.360
encoded information.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.360
This is called

40:28.360 --> 40:30.360
Clutch Variables.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.360
We developed

40:36.360 --> 40:38.360
this theory

40:38.360 --> 40:40.360
to connect the Schrodinger equation

40:40.360 --> 40:42.360
to the classical field.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.360
We have a side project

40:44.360 --> 40:46.360
to use this to do

40:46.360 --> 40:48.360
some

40:48.360 --> 40:50.360
vortex visualization.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.360
Okay.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.360
Notation means

40:56.360 --> 40:58.360
that we often

40:58.360 --> 41:00.360
use vector field

41:00.360 --> 41:02.360
to represent the speed.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.360
On the right,

41:04.360 --> 41:06.360
there are many arrows in a fish tank.

41:06.360 --> 41:08.360
Alternatively,

41:08.360 --> 41:10.360
you can consider its

41:10.360 --> 41:12.360
covector,

41:12.360 --> 41:14.360
or throw the index down.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.360
Or it will

41:16.360 --> 41:18.360
become...

41:18.360 --> 41:20.360
You can imagine

41:20.360 --> 41:22.360
that the arrow

41:22.360 --> 41:24.360
is replaced by

41:24.360 --> 41:26.360
some hyperplane.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.360
This is called

41:30.360 --> 41:32.360
Differential Form.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.360
Differential Form

41:34.360 --> 41:36.360
means that

41:36.360 --> 41:38.360
it can be evaluated

41:38.360 --> 41:40.360
along some curves.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.360
If it is a one-form,

41:42.360 --> 41:44.360
it means that

41:44.360 --> 41:46.360
it can be evaluated

41:46.360 --> 41:48.360
along the curve.

41:48.360 --> 41:50.360
This is called

41:50.360 --> 41:52.360
Circulation.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.360
It is usually visualized

41:54.360 --> 41:56.360
as a hyperplane.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.360
When you see

41:58.360 --> 42:00.360
many hyperplanes,

42:00.360 --> 42:02.360
the curve is

42:02.360 --> 42:04.360
proportional to

42:04.360 --> 42:06.360
the density

42:06.360 --> 42:08.360
of these hyperplanes.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.360
The density

42:10.360 --> 42:12.360
of the banana

42:12.360 --> 42:14.360
is the value of the curve.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.360
So we often use

42:16.360 --> 42:18.360
this one-form.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.360
There is also

42:22.360 --> 42:24.360
a abstract concept called

42:24.360 --> 42:26.360
Pullback.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.360
If you have two spaces

42:28.360 --> 42:30.360
and you have a map

42:30.360 --> 42:32.360
from the space on the left to the space on the right,

42:32.360 --> 42:34.360
if there is a Differential Form

42:34.360 --> 42:36.360
on the right,

42:36.360 --> 42:38.360
you can pull it back

42:38.360 --> 42:40.360
into the Differential Form

42:40.360 --> 42:42.360
of the space on the left.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.360
The definition is that

42:44.360 --> 42:46.360
if there is a Differential Form

42:46.360 --> 42:48.360
on the right,

42:48.360 --> 42:50.360
you map it to the right

42:50.360 --> 42:52.360
and evaluate it to the right.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.360
The symbol is defined as

42:54.360 --> 42:56.360
f star alpha.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.360
If you don't use this symbol,

42:58.360 --> 43:00.360
you often write

43:00.360 --> 43:02.360
the rightmost space.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.360
We often write

43:04.360 --> 43:06.360
Pullback.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.360
Pullback

43:08.360 --> 43:10.360
has some beautiful

43:10.360 --> 43:12.360
definitions.

43:12.360 --> 43:14.360
But that's only

43:14.360 --> 43:16.360
a very detailed introduction.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.360
So I won't talk about it here.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.360
Pullback

43:28.360 --> 43:30.360
has something called

43:30.360 --> 43:32.360
Exterior Derivative Commute.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.360
If you write it in a normal language,

43:34.360 --> 43:36.360
it will be very difficult to see.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.360
So we like to use

43:38.360 --> 43:40.360
this

43:40.360 --> 43:42.360
coordinate-free

43:42.360 --> 43:44.360
notation.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.360
There is a special pullback

43:48.360 --> 43:50.360
in the stream.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.360
Consider that the map

43:52.360 --> 43:54.360
is a flow map.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.360
When the stream is flowing,

43:56.360 --> 43:58.360
the map is from

43:58.360 --> 44:00.360
the space of time 0

44:00.360 --> 44:02.360
to the space of time t.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.360
In this way,

44:04.360 --> 44:06.360
you can naturally

44:06.360 --> 44:08.360
generate the map

44:08.360 --> 44:10.360
and

44:10.360 --> 44:12.360
the physical quantity

44:12.360 --> 44:14.360
in the world of time t

44:14.360 --> 44:16.360
can be pulled back to the space of time 0.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.360
That thing is called

44:18.360 --> 44:20.360
Lagrangian Coordinate.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.360
The physical quantity

44:22.360 --> 44:24.360
in the Lagrangian Coordinate.

44:24.360 --> 44:26.360
We often like to discuss

44:26.360 --> 44:28.360
the division of time

44:28.360 --> 44:30.360
in the Lagrangian Coordinate.

44:30.360 --> 44:32.360
That division is called

44:32.360 --> 44:34.360
Lead Derivative.

44:34.360 --> 44:36.360
If the physical quantity

44:36.360 --> 44:38.360
changes with time,

44:38.360 --> 44:40.360
it will become

44:40.360 --> 44:42.360
the generalized

44:42.360 --> 44:44.360
material derivative.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.360
I often say that

44:54.360 --> 44:56.360
this physical quantity is just

44:56.360 --> 44:58.360
carried away by the stream.

44:58.360 --> 45:00.360
It means that

45:00.360 --> 45:02.360
after it is pulled back

45:02.360 --> 45:04.360
to the Lagrangian Coordinate,

45:04.360 --> 45:06.360
the world will not change.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.360
Do you understand?

45:10.360 --> 45:12.360
It doesn't matter.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.360
The Euler equation

45:14.360 --> 45:16.360
is written as

45:16.360 --> 45:18.360
in terms of velocity one form.

45:18.360 --> 45:20.360
That is to say,

45:20.360 --> 45:22.360
the one form of velocity

45:22.360 --> 45:24.360
is the hyperplane

45:24.360 --> 45:26.360
covector

45:26.360 --> 45:28.360
that I just visualized.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.360
It is purely a vector.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.360
There is a

45:32.360 --> 45:34.360
derivative of some function

45:34.360 --> 45:36.360
on the right.

45:36.360 --> 45:38.360
We often call that

45:38.360 --> 45:40.360
an exact form.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.360
The exact form

45:42.360 --> 45:44.360
means that

45:44.360 --> 45:46.360
the velocity form

45:46.360 --> 45:48.360
is divergence-free.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.360
The vorticity equation

45:54.360 --> 45:56.360
is purely a vector.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.360
The vorticity

45:58.360 --> 46:00.360
is a two-form.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.360
Vorticity is a two-form.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.360
Vorticity

46:04.360 --> 46:06.360
is a quantity.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.360
It is not a vector.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.360
It is a quantity

46:10.360 --> 46:12.360
that is to be measured

46:12.360 --> 46:14.360
on a two-dimensional curve.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.360
We often say vorticity flux.

46:16.360 --> 46:18.360
In fact,

46:18.360 --> 46:20.360
what we can measure

46:20.360 --> 46:22.360
is the concept of flux

46:22.360 --> 46:24.360
that is to be measured

46:24.360 --> 46:26.360
on a two-dimensional curve.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.360
Then,

46:28.360 --> 46:30.360
if you see a curve

46:30.360 --> 46:32.360
that flows

46:32.360 --> 46:34.360
at any given time,

46:34.360 --> 46:36.360
you can pull it back

46:36.360 --> 46:38.360
to its zero-time state

46:38.360 --> 46:40.360
and put the evaluated

46:40.360 --> 46:42.360
vorticity flux

46:42.360 --> 46:44.360
back to the original space.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.360
You will find that it changes at any time.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.360
That is, vorticity is purely a vector.

46:48.360 --> 46:50.360
You want to ask...

46:50.360 --> 46:52.360
The meaning of vector

46:52.360 --> 46:54.360
is not that

46:54.360 --> 46:56.360
it has a

46:56.360 --> 46:58.360
zero-time state.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.360
You can ask again.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.360
The meaning of vector

47:02.360 --> 47:04.360
is not that

47:04.360 --> 47:06.360
it has a zero-time state.

47:06.360 --> 47:08.360
There is still a

47:08.360 --> 47:10.360
velocity field in the fluid.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.360
It is u.

47:12.360 --> 47:14.360
The relationship between u and eta

47:14.360 --> 47:16.360
and the velocity one-form

47:16.360 --> 47:18.360
is that

47:18.360 --> 47:20.360
eta is the velocity

47:20.360 --> 47:22.360
flat.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.360
It is the co-vector.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.360
It is the dual vector.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.360
Then,

47:30.360 --> 47:32.360
the physical quantity

47:32.360 --> 47:34.360
is directly

47:34.360 --> 47:36.360
purely a vector

47:36.360 --> 47:38.360
in this velocity field.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.360
It changes at any time.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.360
You see that

47:42.360 --> 47:44.360
L sub u

47:44.360 --> 47:46.360
depends on

47:46.360 --> 47:48.360
the velocity.

47:48.360 --> 47:50.360
Then, eta

47:50.360 --> 47:52.360
u depends on eta.

47:52.360 --> 47:54.360
So, it is a nonlinear function.

47:56.360 --> 47:58.360
The vorticity

47:58.360 --> 48:00.360
equation is the same.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.360
In fact, vorticity

48:02.360 --> 48:04.360
must be equal to d of eta

48:04.360 --> 48:06.360
or d of u

48:06.360 --> 48:08.360
flat. So, omega

48:08.360 --> 48:10.360
is coupled with velocity.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.360
In this case,

48:12.360 --> 48:14.360
vorticity is

48:14.360 --> 48:16.360
purely a vector

48:16.360 --> 48:18.360
in this equation.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.360
When they are coupled together,

48:20.360 --> 48:22.360
it increases.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.360
What are the benefits?

48:24.360 --> 48:26.360
I am just talking about

48:26.360 --> 48:28.360
the benefits.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.360
There is no benefit or

48:30.360 --> 48:32.360
disadvantage.

48:32.360 --> 48:34.360
It is just a different formulation.

48:34.360 --> 48:36.360
Since the time of Euler,

48:36.360 --> 48:38.360
we have been talking about

48:38.360 --> 48:40.360
purely a vector.

48:40.360 --> 48:42.360
This term is not invented by me.

48:44.360 --> 48:46.360
So, there is no disadvantage.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.360
I am just saying

48:48.360 --> 48:50.360
that

48:50.360 --> 48:52.360
I am just saying that

48:52.360 --> 48:54.360
the definition of purely a vector is

48:54.360 --> 48:56.360
the force derivative.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.360
It is just a general material derivative.

48:58.360 --> 49:00.360
It is just a quantity of u dot grad.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.360
I can imagine

49:02.360 --> 49:04.360
writing a general

49:04.360 --> 49:06.360
derivative.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.360
What is the general derivative?

49:08.360 --> 49:10.360
u dot grad.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.360
The u dot grad

49:12.360 --> 49:14.360
you mentioned

49:14.360 --> 49:16.360
is used for zero-form.

49:16.360 --> 49:18.360
Few people talk about

49:18.360 --> 49:20.360
how to generalize

49:20.360 --> 49:22.360
one-form, two-form, or other tensors.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.360
In this case,

49:24.360 --> 49:26.360
people can only write

49:26.360 --> 49:28.360
a basis for those tensors.

49:28.360 --> 49:30.360
For those

49:30.360 --> 49:32.360
previous functions,

49:32.360 --> 49:34.360
they become a zero-form function.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.360
You can do

49:36.360 --> 49:38.360
a partial division of time

49:38.360 --> 49:40.360
plus u dot grad.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.360
But often the right-hand side won't do that.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.360
It should be taken care of.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.360
It should not be a function.

49:46.360 --> 49:48.360
It should be a tensor.

49:50.360 --> 49:52.360
It contains those things.

49:52.360 --> 49:54.360
So,

49:54.360 --> 49:56.360
sometimes people are surprised

49:56.360 --> 49:58.360
that the vorticity should not be written as

49:58.360 --> 50:00.360
zero on the right-hand side.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.360
So, I added an equation here.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.360
We often see vorticity as a vector.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.360
Or three components

50:06.360 --> 50:08.360
with some

50:08.360 --> 50:10.360
basis.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.360
Then we find that the right-hand side is not zero.

50:12.360 --> 50:14.360
Then it is regarded as a vortex stretching term.

50:14.360 --> 50:16.360
People often say that

50:16.360 --> 50:18.360
the difference between two-form and three-form is

50:18.360 --> 50:20.360
that sometimes there is

50:20.360 --> 50:22.360
a vortex stretching term.

50:22.360 --> 50:24.360
It's just because

50:24.360 --> 50:26.360
it's a co-dimension.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.360
When it's different,

50:28.360 --> 50:30.360
it should be a tensor,

50:30.360 --> 50:32.360
but it's a vector.

50:32.360 --> 50:34.360
When it's a purely vector,

50:34.360 --> 50:36.360
there is a difference.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.360
Then,

50:38.360 --> 50:40.360
I want to emphasize that

50:40.360 --> 50:42.360
I only use the above notation.

50:42.360 --> 50:44.360
I only use the simple notation

50:44.360 --> 50:46.360
to represent

50:46.360 --> 50:48.360
what I need to use.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.360
The first one is notation.

50:52.360 --> 50:54.360
Now I can talk about

50:54.360 --> 50:56.360
clebsch representation.

50:56.360 --> 50:58.360
Clebsch is

50:58.360 --> 51:00.360
from 1850s.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.360
You may have heard of

51:04.360 --> 51:06.360
Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.360
But most people may not know

51:08.360 --> 51:10.360
quantum mechanics.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.360
Who is the boss?

51:12.360 --> 51:14.360
Clebsch.

51:14.360 --> 51:16.360
They seem to be from the same era.

51:16.360 --> 51:18.360
But they

51:18.360 --> 51:20.360
are not used

51:20.360 --> 51:22.360
to describe quantum mechanics.

51:22.360 --> 51:24.360
They want to describe

51:24.360 --> 51:26.360
SU.

51:26.360 --> 51:28.360
That was in

51:28.360 --> 51:30.360
the mid-19th century.

51:30.360 --> 51:32.360
So people think

51:32.360 --> 51:34.360
Clebsch is a modernist.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.360
No, he is from

51:36.360 --> 51:38.360
the mid-19th century.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.360
But some of his work

51:40.360 --> 51:42.360
is in quantum mechanics.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.360
Before Clebsch,

51:46.360 --> 51:48.360
people only discussed

51:48.360 --> 51:50.360
potential flow.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.360
At first, people didn't know

51:52.360 --> 51:54.360
what to do with quantum mechanics.

51:54.360 --> 51:56.360
People didn't know curl operator.

51:56.360 --> 51:58.360
And there were no planes at that time.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.360
People were most concerned about

52:00.360 --> 52:02.360
the problem of quantum mechanics.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.360
So

52:04.360 --> 52:06.360
it was all about

52:06.360 --> 52:08.360
potential flow.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.360
In that case,

52:10.360 --> 52:12.360
velocity one form is

52:12.360 --> 52:14.360
d of some function.

52:14.360 --> 52:16.360
Velocity vector field is

52:16.360 --> 52:18.360
the gradient of some function.

52:18.360 --> 52:20.360
This is potential.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.360
But there was no vorticity.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.360
So Clebsch wrote a paper

52:24.360 --> 52:26.360
in Camp-Holt's

52:26.360 --> 52:28.360
first invention of

52:28.360 --> 52:30.360
vorticity.

52:30.360 --> 52:32.360
He immediately thought

52:32.360 --> 52:34.360
potential flow should be generalized.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.360
Otherwise,

52:36.360 --> 52:38.360
the vorticity will be destroyed.

52:38.360 --> 52:40.360
So he considered

52:40.360 --> 52:42.360
two other potentials.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.360
One is lambda and the other is mu.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.360
He wrote velocity one form

52:46.360 --> 52:48.360
as lambda d mu plus d phi.

52:48.360 --> 52:50.360
And

52:50.360 --> 52:52.360
lambda d mu

52:52.360 --> 52:54.360
is generalized.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.360
It will have vorticity.

52:56.360 --> 52:58.360
This was very popular

52:58.360 --> 53:00.360
at that time.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.360
You can see it in thermodynamics.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.360
It's not

53:04.360 --> 53:06.360
closed.

53:06.360 --> 53:08.360
It's

53:08.360 --> 53:10.360
TDS.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.360
At that time,

53:16.360 --> 53:18.360
it's easy to see

53:18.360 --> 53:20.360
lambda d mu as a consideration.

53:20.360 --> 53:22.360
It's natural.

53:22.360 --> 53:24.360
At that time,

53:24.360 --> 53:26.360
d phi can be used as

53:26.360 --> 53:28.360
potential flow.

53:28.360 --> 53:30.360
Lambda d mu is not necessarily

53:30.360 --> 53:32.360
divergence-free.

53:32.360 --> 53:34.360
As long as phi is good enough.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.360
If so,

53:36.360 --> 53:38.360
I will look at

53:38.360 --> 53:40.360
the vorticity two form.

53:40.360 --> 53:42.360
It's just lambda wedge d mu.

53:42.360 --> 53:44.360
Phi is not important.

53:50.360 --> 53:52.360
But

53:52.360 --> 53:54.360
it's like this.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.360
Any lambda mu

53:56.360 --> 53:58.360
can be solved

53:58.360 --> 54:00.360
by

54:00.360 --> 54:02.360
the fact that

54:02.360 --> 54:04.360
eta needs to be divergence-free.

54:04.360 --> 54:06.360
This is

54:06.360 --> 54:08.360
Helmholtz's

54:08.360 --> 54:10.360
decomposition theorem.

54:12.360 --> 54:14.360
Any

54:16.360 --> 54:18.360
three-dimensional field

54:18.360 --> 54:20.360
can be divided into

54:20.360 --> 54:22.360
divergence-free part and curl-free part.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.360
This is Helmholtz's decomposition theorem.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.360
Is this the only part?

54:30.360 --> 54:32.360
No.

54:34.360 --> 54:36.360
It's not well-defined.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.360
Potential flow is not well-defined.

54:38.360 --> 54:40.360
Phi can be any parameter.

54:42.360 --> 54:44.360
D phi is well-defined.

54:44.360 --> 54:46.360
The left part is well-defined.

54:46.360 --> 54:48.360
It's not well-defined or not well-defined.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.360
It can be represented by

54:50.360 --> 54:52.360
this equation.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.360
Phi is not defined as

54:54.360 --> 54:56.360
d inverse of eta.

54:56.360 --> 54:58.360
It's not well-defined.

55:00.360 --> 55:02.360
I only consider

55:02.360 --> 55:04.360
the velocity field.

55:04.360 --> 55:06.360
It's the form of d of some function.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.360
Then we discuss how to

55:08.360 --> 55:10.360
describe the function.

55:12.360 --> 55:14.360
I want to have more potential.

55:14.360 --> 55:16.360
Three potentials.

55:16.360 --> 55:18.360
I deliberately put this form

55:18.360 --> 55:20.360
as curl-free.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.360
It's not

55:24.360 --> 55:26.360
orthogonal splitting.

55:28.360 --> 55:30.360
I don't claim this is

55:30.360 --> 55:32.360
a splitting.

55:32.360 --> 55:34.360
It's not unique splitting.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.360
It's not like this.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.360
You can also discuss

55:40.360 --> 55:42.360
what the gauge symmetry is.

55:42.360 --> 55:44.360
It can be short form lambda mu phi.

55:44.360 --> 55:46.360
It corresponds to the left side.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.360
There are a lot.

55:48.360 --> 55:50.360
It should be easy to see.

55:56.360 --> 55:58.360
Omega looks like this.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.360
It means

56:00.360 --> 56:02.360
you will see later

56:02.360 --> 56:04.360
it's the area form of

56:04.360 --> 56:06.360
lambda mu plane.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.360
It's like gradient mu.

56:08.360 --> 56:10.360
Gradient lambda cross gradient mu.

56:10.360 --> 56:12.360
It's a small area.

56:16.360 --> 56:18.360
If you want to use

56:18.360 --> 56:20.360
vector potential,

56:20.360 --> 56:22.360
can you use it?

56:22.360 --> 56:24.360
Yes.

56:28.360 --> 56:30.360
If you want to use

56:30.360 --> 56:32.360
vector potential,

56:32.360 --> 56:34.360
omega corresponds to

56:34.360 --> 56:36.360
magnetic field or curvature.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.360
I will use it later.

56:38.360 --> 56:40.360
Then

56:42.360 --> 56:44.360
So

56:44.360 --> 56:46.360
capstructure

56:46.360 --> 56:48.360
is described as

56:48.360 --> 56:50.360
three potentials.

56:50.360 --> 56:52.360
You can ask

56:52.360 --> 56:54.360
what the three potentials

56:54.360 --> 56:56.360
satisfy.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.360
Then you will find

56:58.360 --> 57:00.360
those functions are purely reflected.

57:00.360 --> 57:02.360
Then phi

57:02.360 --> 57:04.360
lambda mu is purely reflected.

57:04.360 --> 57:06.360
Then phi

57:06.360 --> 57:08.360
is the time point.

57:08.360 --> 57:10.360
It is chosen to say

57:10.360 --> 57:12.360
eta is divergence free and

57:12.360 --> 57:14.360
for all time.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.360
This is capstructure.

57:16.360 --> 57:18.360
But it's

57:18.360 --> 57:20.360
not that famous.

57:20.360 --> 57:22.360
Then

57:22.360 --> 57:24.360
there are still

57:24.360 --> 57:26.360
some works on it.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.360
For example, Marston

57:28.360 --> 57:30.360
found that

57:30.360 --> 57:32.360
capstructure representation can make

57:32.360 --> 57:34.360
fluid

57:34.360 --> 57:36.360
described as Hamiltonian system.

57:36.360 --> 57:38.360
Hamiltonian system is

57:38.360 --> 57:40.360
a generalized coordinate

57:40.360 --> 57:42.360
and the momentum corresponding to it.

57:42.360 --> 57:44.360
There will be a position and momentum

57:44.360 --> 57:46.360
relationship.

57:46.360 --> 57:48.360
This is the infinite version.

57:48.360 --> 57:50.360
Because fluid has infinite freedom.

57:50.360 --> 57:52.360
Then

57:52.360 --> 57:54.360
lambda and mu

57:54.360 --> 57:56.360
correspond to

57:56.360 --> 57:58.360
position and momentum.

57:58.360 --> 58:00.360
Then

58:00.360 --> 58:02.360
there are some beautiful mathematical structures.

58:02.360 --> 58:04.360
However,

58:04.360 --> 58:06.360
people think it's too artificial.

58:06.360 --> 58:08.360
It's not practical.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.360
The main reason is

58:10.360 --> 58:12.360
there are a lot of fluid

58:12.360 --> 58:14.360
and a lot of momentum.

58:14.360 --> 58:16.360
It can't be written as lambda and mu plus phi.

58:16.360 --> 58:18.360
Then

58:18.360 --> 58:20.360
it doesn't mean

58:20.360 --> 58:22.360
it can't be...

58:22.360 --> 58:24.360
It doesn't mean

58:24.360 --> 58:26.360
some capstructure can be designed in a strange way.

58:26.360 --> 58:28.360
It is topologically

58:28.360 --> 58:30.360
separated.

58:30.360 --> 58:32.360
For example, if your eta is written as

58:32.360 --> 58:34.360
lambda and mu plus phi.

58:34.360 --> 58:36.360
Then there is a quantity called helicity.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.360
It is the

58:38.360 --> 58:40.360
velocity

58:40.360 --> 58:42.360
and velocity

58:42.360 --> 58:44.360
are integrated.

58:44.360 --> 58:46.360
Then

58:46.360 --> 58:48.360
its total points

58:48.360 --> 58:50.360
will be equal to

58:50.360 --> 58:52.360
the average

58:52.360 --> 58:54.360
of the vortex line in the fluid.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.360
It's like

58:56.360 --> 58:58.360
that

58:58.360 --> 59:00.360
if you have two vortex filaments

59:00.360 --> 59:02.360
and there is a linking,

59:02.360 --> 59:04.360
then the helicity is not linked.

59:04.360 --> 59:06.360
Then

59:06.360 --> 59:08.360
it can use points to describe.

59:08.360 --> 59:10.360
But if

59:10.360 --> 59:12.360
eta is written as lambda and mu plus phi,

59:12.360 --> 59:14.360
you can easily prove that

59:14.360 --> 59:16.360
its total helicity is linked.

59:16.360 --> 59:18.360
Then it will cause

59:18.360 --> 59:20.360
a lot of velocity

59:20.360 --> 59:22.360
that helicity won't be linked.

59:22.360 --> 59:24.360
It is topologically

59:24.360 --> 59:26.360
unable to be described

59:26.360 --> 59:28.360
as a capstructure.

59:30.360 --> 59:32.360
And if it is possible,

59:32.360 --> 59:34.360
it is difficult to find

59:34.360 --> 59:36.360
lambda and mu.

59:36.360 --> 59:38.360
And even if you find it, it is not unique.

59:38.360 --> 59:40.360
Just like what you just found.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.360
Does it have the same thing as trace-734?

59:42.360 --> 59:44.360
Yes.

59:44.360 --> 59:46.360
Trace-734.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.360
If it is a higher-dimensional fluid,

59:48.360 --> 59:50.360
for example, a 5D fluid,

59:50.360 --> 59:52.360
it has a slightly higher helicity.

59:52.360 --> 59:54.360
Yes.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.360
This question is a bit confusing.

59:56.360 --> 59:58.360
Will there be this effect?

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.360
Yes. For example, a 2D fluid,

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.360
no one will discuss its helicity.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.360
Then 3D, 5D, 7D,

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.360
no, 4D fluid,

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.360
you can still discuss

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.360
three-dimensional helicity.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.360
It follows the fluid,

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.360
it is purely a dimension.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.360
It can be grouped into 3D.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.360
It is a 3D form.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.360
It is purely a dimension.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.360
Then if it is

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.360
a three-dimensional fluid,

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.360
it is a closed space.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.360
It should be like this.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.360
Then a five-dimensional fluid,

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.360
it corresponds to trace-734.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.360
It means that

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.360
depending on how high your helicity is,

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.360
you can write a lot of

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.360
new concert content.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.360
With trace-734.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.360
Then because of these difficulties,

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.360
some people want to write

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.360
Clutch Representation.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.360
So they invented a thing called

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.360
Multi-Component Clutch Variable.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.360
Lambda and mu

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.360
make a lot of noise,

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.360
and then add them together.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.360
Then diffuse.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.360
Diffuse is the same as

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.360
pressure projection.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.360
But this is very

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.360
new insight.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.360
Because it is trivial.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.360
You can write it

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.360
in three-dimensional form.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.360
Velocity 1 force

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.360
is also very trivial.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.360
This is exactly Clutch Representation.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.360
Multi-Component Clutch Representation.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.360
So you don't have

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.360
as much new insight as Lagrangian.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.360
But there is

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.360
a very interesting paper

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.360
in the 1980s.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.360
At that time,

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360
it used another

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.360
new

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.360
generalized Clutch Variable method.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360
You put the lambda and mu,

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.360
which is

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.360
the key term.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.360
You put lambda and mu together

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.360
as a map.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.360
It is sent from the fluid domain to R2.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.360
Then omega equals

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.360
lambda times mu.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.360
It is the area

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.360
of the two-dimensional space

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.360
pulled back by the map.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.360
That is,

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.360
it does the variable conversion.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.360
You can think of it as

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.360
you put the S,

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.360
which is lambda and mu together.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.360
R2 vector value

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.360
function.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.360
From three-dimensional to two-dimensional.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.360
On the left,

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.360
you can draw any two-dimensional curve.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.360
You can discuss

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.360
the vorticity flux on it.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.360
Its value is equal to the area

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.360
on the right.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.360
How much time did I spend?

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.360
8 minutes.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.360
Oh.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.360
OK.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.360
This is a natural generalization.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.360
You can imagine that you put the lambda and mu

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.360
together. I don't take it as R2.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.360
I can take it as any two-dimensional manifold.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.360
So you can

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.360
consider it as a sphere.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.360
Then,

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.360
the

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.360
vorticity can still be taken as

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.360
the area on the sphere

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.360
from the pullback.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.360
You can't actually

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.360
put the lambda and mu together.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.360
You can only write it as a variable conversion.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.360
If so,

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.360
you will find that the helicity is not necessarily the same.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.360
So you can

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.360
find that at least most of the three-dimensional

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.360
flux can be approximated.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.360
Yes.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.360
Yes.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.360
The dimension is not the same.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.360
This is a continuous map.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.360
SC continuous map.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.360
Then you can discuss its pullback.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.360
There is a tool form on the right.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.360
You can turn the pullback

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.360
into a tool form.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.360
And that tool form,

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.360
if you just put the area on the right

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.360
from the pullback into

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.360
vorticity,

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.360
it is a

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.360
it is a

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.360
capture representation.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.360
Because the core of the capture representation

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.360
is that omega equals

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.360
lambda which equals

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.360
the area from the pullback

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.360
into vorticity.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.360
Yes.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.360
I will say syntactic manifold.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.360
There is a

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.360
non-degenerate tool form.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.360
Yes.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.360
Yes.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.360
This is the syntactic manifold value

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360
function.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.360
The non-degenerate version of

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.360
syntactic structure

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.360
is what Marston and others

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.360
saw.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.360
So we think

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.360
this method is

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.360
quite interesting.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.360
It turns the space on the right

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.360
into a general manifold.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360
So we look for this route.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360
But this

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360
is just a two-page paper.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.360
I didn't talk much about it.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.360
So we continue to develop this thing.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.360
But it only discusses vorticity.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.360
Velocity can also be generalized like this.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.360
To generalize velocity,

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.360
we remember that

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.360
velocity is written as this lambda

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360
dmu plus dv.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360
You can also think of it as a

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.360
map size. It is sent to a three-dimensional space.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.360
Then it projects it.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.360
Then it

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.360
pulls back a one-form.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.360
Just like the

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.360
vorticity is a two-form.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.360
Its form is xdy plus dz.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.360
You can imagine

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.360
what this means.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.360
This is what Clebsch did.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.360
Before Clebsch, people

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.360
only looked at the potential flow,

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.360
which is eta equals to dv.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.360
You can think of it as

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.360
pulling back the dz one-form.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.360
You can think of dz

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.360
as these hyperplane fields.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.360
They all point in the same direction.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360
A very trivial one-form.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.360
Then you pull it back like this.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.360
What Clebsch did

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.360
was to replace the template field

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.360
with a more

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.360
rich xdy plus dz form.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.360
Then you see

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.360
that hyperplane field

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.360
is nowhere integrable.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.360
It's not just

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.360
some tangent spaces

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.360
in the family of surfaces.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.360
It's all separated like this.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.360
This is called contact geometry.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.360
Clebsch representation

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.360
means that

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.360
I have a size of a map, which is sent to this space.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.360
Then I pull back these hyperplane fields

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.360
to become the velocity

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.360
of this hyperplane field, one-form.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.360
To describe the flow,

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.360
instead of saying

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.360
how some one-forms change at any time,

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.360
he just said how this psi changes at any time.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.360
Then this becomes a zero-form.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.360
So it becomes a little bit

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.360
simpler.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.360
Then in the case of Clebsch,

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.360
remember lambda, mu, and phi.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.360
Actually, only lambda and mu determine the vorticity.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.360
So

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.360
there is a natural projection,

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.360
which is just a projection.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.360
Then

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.360
you can say that

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360
the vorticity is just the two parts in front

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.360
of the pullback area.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.360
Then

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:34.360
we call the psi velocity-Clebsch map.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.360
Then S is called

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.360
vorticity-Clebsch map.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.360
So the identity after the pullback

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.360
is the velocity of the vorticity.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.360
Then you will find that

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.360
actually

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.360
the x, dy, and z on the right

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.360
and the sigma below

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.360
are x, dy, and h, dy.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.360
One is the area form,

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.360
and the other is the form of Clebsch.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.360
The relationship between the two

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.360
is actually quite important.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.360
It's very obvious.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.360
The result is that

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.360
the relationship of the

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.360
theta on top

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.360
is quite important.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.360
It's

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.360
d theta equals pi star sigma.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:18.360
That is, the curved

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.360
curves on top

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.360
are like a velocity field.

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.360
A fixed velocity field.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.360
Then the curl

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.360
corresponds to the vorticity

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.360
in the template velocity field.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.360
The two forms are

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.360
the area forms

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.360
in the two-dimensional space below.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.360
Then

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.360
this

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.360
means that

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.360
the frame on the right

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.360
and the square on the left

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360
are

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.360
in another field.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.360
This is called pre-quantum bundle.

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.360
I don't have much time,

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.360
so I'll

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.360
try to

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.360
explain

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.360
what each sentence

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.360
means.

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.360
I don't think it's bad.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.360
It's not bad?

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.360
It's not bad, right?

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.360
What I just said

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.360
is that it can be any syntax manifold.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.360
The two-dimensional space below me

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.360
can also be a sphere,

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.360
or a Riemann surface,

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.360
or in general, any syntax manifold,

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.360
any two-dimensional space.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.360
Then

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.360
there is actually

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.360
a fiber bundle above it.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.360
If I add one more,

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.360
each point below me will grow

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.360
a little bit of freedom.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.360
Then it becomes

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.360
a three-dimensional space

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.360
in the two-dimensional space below.

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.360
There is an operator

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.360
called projection.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.360
Then there is

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.360
a

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.360
one-form

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.360
in the three-dimensional space,

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.360
just like x, y, and z.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.360
But in general, I can use any one-form

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.360
as long as it meets the following conditions.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.360
As I just said,

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.360
def equals pi star sigma.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.360
Then

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.360
there is a normalization.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.360
Then it will be

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.360
a pre-quantum bundle.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.360
This word comes from geometric quantization.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.360
That is to say,

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.360
there is a form that

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.360
quantum mechanics

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.360
is generally

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.360
quantized from the classical system.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.360
We usually say

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.360
that the momentum

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.360
is a function of space.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.360
There are some standard programs.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.360
But in general,

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.360
there is not only

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.360
x and p in general space.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360
There is only position and momentum.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.360
It is a general simplex manifold.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.360
How do you discuss it?

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.360
Then how does the classical mechanics

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.360
on it become a quantum system?

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.360
It actually lifts this thing

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.360
into this

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.360
phase factor.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.360
Then the function on this is called wave function.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.360
Then there is a point

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.360
that needs to be defined.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.360
It is pi star sigma.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.360
It is a connection.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.360
Then you will need

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.360
to say that the

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.360
coverage of the connection

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.360
is the same as the symplectic form

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.360
of the manifold.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.360
That is

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.360
key for the Poisson equation.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.360
Poisson bracket

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.360
will become

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.360
b bracket.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.360
Then the Hamiltonian equation

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.360
will become

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.360
the Heisenberg equation.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.360
That has nothing to do

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360
with this.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.360
They will need

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.360
a definition called pre-confirm bundle.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.360
I just need the same definition here.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.360
So I call it pre-confirm bundle.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.360
What is theta?

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.360
Theta is a one form.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.360
You can say that it is the bundle

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.360
connection.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.360
Connection means

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.360
that it defines

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.360
if I go from one point to another

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.360
in the manifold,

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.360
we need to discuss

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.360
what is called parallel transport.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.360
Then you will see this hyperplane field.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.360
It means that

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.360
if it is cut off from this hyperplane,

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.360
it means parallel.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.360
If it is all misaligned,

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.360
it means that if I go around

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.360
and do parallel transport,

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.360
it may go to different heights.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.360
That is the definition of Parallel transport.

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.360
There is a gap.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.360
The size of the gap

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.360
is the

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.360
distance between

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.360
the two paths.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.360
What is the library?

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.360
It means

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.360
the phase.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.360
It is

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.360
usually

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.360
U1.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.360
Wave function is a definition

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.360
for every x and p

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.360
in the space below.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.360
I define

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.360
its

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.360
amplitude.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.360
How much probability it has in that place.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.360
It also adds a phase factor.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.360
I can have the density of the wave

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.360
but I can only have the Ith.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360
It can be evaluated on this factor.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.360
What is the difference between

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.360
U1 and U2?

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.360
Another variable

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.360
is the

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.360
density.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.360
Because it

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360
actually has

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.360
another value.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.360
But the bundle

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.360
is a trivial bundle.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.360
It is just cross r.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.360
But this phase is

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.360
more complicated.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.360
Because it is cross s1.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.360
But in general, it might be cross s1.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.360
So it must be written in bundle language.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.360
So it is often

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.360
that

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.360
in

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.360
that

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.360
density is just

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.360
a function

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.360
of the manifold below.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.360
But if we talk about phase,

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.360
it can't be well defined.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.360
You have to choose a gauge

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.360
because this fiber

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.360
is a compact.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.360
In quantum mechanics, it is usually compact.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.360
How does it decide

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.360
the fiber structure

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.360
or the

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.360
input module?

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.360
How do I

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.360
choose sigma

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.360
or q?

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.360
How do you

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.360
make a connection

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.360
with the fiber

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.360
of the module?

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.360
I read

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.360
Wikipedia.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.360
It only talks about

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.360
U1 principle bundle

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.360
over a syntactic manifold.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.360
I just generalize a little bit here.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360
I just say that it is a single fiber.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.360
So it can be

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.360
not necessarily

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.360
a U1 structure.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.360
I don't know why.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.360
What I mean is, even if you choose

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.360
a manifold bundle, I think your

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.360
manifold structure is free.

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.360
Yes.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.360
I don't know how physicists

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360
usually choose this.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.360
When doing geometric composition,

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.360
how to choose?

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.360
How to choose?

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.360
Sometimes

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.360
there is a problem with the existence.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.360
But if there are many different structures,

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360
I don't know.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.360
As long as you have this pre-quantum structure,

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.360
you can immediately discuss

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.360
what it corresponds to.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.360
Velocity-catch map and

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.360
vorticity-catch map.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.360
That is, the domain of the fluid

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.360
is the bundle above.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.360
It is called velocity-catch map.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.360
It can be used to pull back

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.360
the hyperplane field above.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.360
Then the area form

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.360
or syntactic form

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.360
is pulled back to the vorticity field.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.360
There is a very important

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360
combination.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.360
In fact,

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.360
if my right

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.360
syntactic manifold

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.360
is only 2-dimensional,

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.360
and my fluid domain is only 3-dimensional,

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.360
there is an interesting phenomenon.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.360
If I draw an area on the right,

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.360
its pre-image

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.360
must be a vortex tube.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.360
The definition of a vortex tube is

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.360
that it is a 3-dimensional area,

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.360
but the vorticity flux through

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.360
its boundary is 0.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.360
In other words,

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.360
the vortex line is like a parallel tube.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.360
If you reduce these regions to a point,

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.360
you will find that it is

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.360
pre-image of point through S.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.360
It will be a vortex line.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.360
There is a well-known

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.360
level set method in

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.360
application mathematics.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.360
You can use a level set function

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.360
to describe any

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.360
combination shape.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.360
You can use an implicit function

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.360
to describe.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.360
S is like this implicit function.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.360
It is not mapped to R2,

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.360
but it is mapped to the

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.360
general syntactic manifold.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.360
The geometry it describes

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.360
is the vortex line.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.360
The vortex line

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.360
looks complicated,

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.360
but if you have

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.360
this geometric variable,

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.360
it is a level set function.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.360
If you have

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.360
this level set function,

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.360
it is very easy to visualize

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.360
these vortex structures.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.360
This motivates

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.360
us to have a side project.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.360
Remember that

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.360
if you want to

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:54.360
set up a level set

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.360
interpretation, you need to

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.360
have a side project.

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.360
But if we choose R2,

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.360
we know that there is no helicity,

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.360
so it is too boring.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.360
We already know that S2

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.360
has a two-page paper

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.360
that says there is a general helicity.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.360
If the domain below is S2,

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.360
you have to ask

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.360
how to choose

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.360
the helicity.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.360
We already know that there is a pre-content bundle

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.360
called half-vibration.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.360
The Q above is S3.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.360
S3 is the three-dimensional sphere

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.360
in the four-dimensional space.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.360
The three-dimensional

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.360
surface is also

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.360
the three-dimensional surface.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.360
The easiest way to understand

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.360
the structure is to use

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.360
the four-element.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.360
The four-element is

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.360
a plus bi

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.360
a plus bi is

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.360
the negative number.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.360
You can add

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.360
cj plus dk

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.360
i, j, k are all negative numbers.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.360
There are three negative numbers in the space.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.360
Then

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.360
satisfy some multiplication

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.360
i squared minus 1

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.360
j squared minus 1

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.360
k squared minus 1

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.360
aj minus k

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.360
polymatrix

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.360
There are

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.360
four elements

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.360
and four helicity.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.360
The three-dimensional sphere is

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.360
normalize.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.360
This is

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360
often used

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.360
to describe three-dimensional rotation.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.360
When do I need to finish?

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.360
I want to finish

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.360
the second part.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.360
If you want to hear more,

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.360
I will continue.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.360
The three-dimensional

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.360
rotation is like this.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.360
Any

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.360
Q is a

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.360
unit four element.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.360
The three-dimensional rotation is

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.360
like su2.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360
Because it is

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.360
su2 space.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.360
The rotation of the implement

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.360
is that any three-dimensional

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.360
rotation

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.360
is written as

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360
span.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.360
It is any point on the earth.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.360
It is written as

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.360
a four-dimensional element.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.360
If you put the left side

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.360
as Q and the right side as Q

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.360
as a unit four element,

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.360
the result is still a three-dimensional

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.360
three-dimensional element.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.360
So there is a rotation of r3.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.360
That is

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.360
a three-dimensional rotation.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.360
If you

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.360
make Q a

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.360
shift,

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.360
it is a

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.360
ten-digit number.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.360
You just multiply

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.360
cosine something

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.360
with i sine something.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.360
You will find that your rotation

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.360
is just a rotation

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.360
along the North Pole.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.360
The North Pole

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.360
is the invariant

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.360
vector under this variation.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.360
I call

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.360
Q bar iQ

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.360
or Pi of Q.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.360
Pi is projection.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.360
The Q map of S3

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.360
becomes the new location

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.360
of the North Pole.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.360
This is the map of S3 to S2.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.360
This map is called half map.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.360
It goes from

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.360
r3 to r2.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.360
The fiber direction

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.360
is the projection.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.360
All are projected at the same point.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.360
It is a fiber.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.360
The fiber

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.360
is the iQ of E2.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.360
It is the iQ of E2.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.360
In fact,

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.360
the three-dimensional sphere

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.360
looks abstract,

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.360
but you can visualize it.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:50.360
You can use stereographic projections

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.360
to project it to r3.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.360
You can project the two-dimensional sphere

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.360
to r2.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.360
You can project it to r2.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.360
You can project it to r3.

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.360
You can project it to r3.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.360
You can visualize

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.360
the two-dimensional sphere to r3.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.360
It is a polyhedral transformation.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.360
You can see the angle.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.360
This map is

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.360
the

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.360
the

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.360
This map is

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.360
all

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.360
I put 1000 fibers.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360
The half fiber I mentioned earlier

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.360
looks like this.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.360
It is very crossed.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.360
This is a fiber bundle.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.360
Each circle

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.360
Each fiber is a

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.360
circle of S1.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.360
It is all mapped to a point on S2.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.360
The index set

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.360
of these fibers

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.360
is S2.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.360
It is the location of the base point.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.360
The remaining freedom

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.360
is that you can rotate

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.360
the base point.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360
S3 is this structure.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.360
Each fiber

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.360
is generated by e2's

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.360
it.

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.360
Vertical direction

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360
is

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.360
i times i.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.360
If e2's it

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.360
can go

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.360
in this direction,

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.360
infinitesimally times i

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.360
is in this direction.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.360
The vertical space

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.360
is a one form.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.360
I call it Theta.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.360
This is

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.360
You can think of it as

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.360
because it is a vertical space

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.360
so

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.360
the one form of Theta

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.360
is any infinitesimally motion

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.360
projected to fiber direction.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360
That is, the internal

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.360
i times q.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.360
This structure

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.360
is in every point.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.360
Remember that the fibers are intersecting each other.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.360
So you will see that

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.360
Theta is nowhere integral.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.360
You can go through it.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.360
This is

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.360
I have printed out the 3D printer.

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.360
If you go to see it,

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.360
you will see that it is nowhere integral.

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.360
This is the real

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.360
I am in S3

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.360
I drew this quaternion

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.360
stereographic projecting

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.360
to R3 and then 3D

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.360
3D printer

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.360
3D printer

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.360
Yes.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.360
So it becomes S3 printer.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.360
4D printer.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.360
Actually it satisfies

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.360
this choice.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.360
It just satisfies

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.360
the pre-quantum bundle.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.360
This is the pre-quantum structure.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.360
This thing

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.360
you can visualize it like this.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.360
S3

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.360
There is fiber direction in S3.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.360
Just like the Z direction in R3.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.360
Now it becomes

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.360
fiber direction in S3.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360
So you can take that direction as

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.360
the Z axis of the general world.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.360
It is the direction of gravity.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.360
The vertical space is the platform.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.360
When you walk on the platform, you are stable.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.360
Nowhere integral

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.360
means

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.360
if you want to

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.360
walk a circle

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.360
if you want to walk a circle back

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.360
you will find that you have to keep climbing the stairs

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.360
to get back to the platform.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.360
This is the

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.360
Zeta and Pi-star sequence.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.360
Zeta

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360
is projected

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.360
to the fiber direction.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.360
In other words,

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.360
if you draw a circle

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.360
or a curve in S3

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.360
and you take the Zeta

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.360
you will find that

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.360
you are walking in that direction

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.360
but you are in the fiber direction.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360
So the physical force you produce

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.360
is your total work.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.360
It is the work of climbing up

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.360
with gravity.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.360
Zeta means that

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.360
if you walk a circle back, it is not equal to zero.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.360
It means that

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.360
if you walk to the platform, you will find that

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.360
your progress is not equal to zero.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.360
This is also

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360
produced by our S3D.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.360
So you will see

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.360
this is the famous

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.360
impossible stairs.

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.360
Most people

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360
know that

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.360
this is a visual illusion.

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.360
But that is in R3.

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.360
You have to use a visual illusion to understand.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.360
But in S3, this is everywhere.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.360
Because

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.360
the platforms in S3 are all low-end.

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.360
So it must look like this.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.360
So you can

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.360
put it in S3D.

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.360
Just now

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.360
there are a lot of abstract things.

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.360
We found that

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.360
one of the good examples is

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.360
half-vibration.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.360
So if we change

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.360
the catch variable to S3

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360
to S2

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.360
the catch side

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.360
corresponds to S.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.360
It will become

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360
the wave function

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.360
in our Schrodinger equation.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.360
Then

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.360
when the velocity is pulled back

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.360
it is the Madelung transform.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.360
In Madelung transform, we use

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.360
C2 value wave function.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.360
You have a, b, c, d, i.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.360
You can expand it into 4 elements.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.360
Remember

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.360
we normalized it

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.360
because it is an incompressible case.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.360
So actually

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.360
psi is a

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.360
S3 value function.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.360
It is normalized, quaternion or C2 vectors.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360
Then

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360
when we do

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360
phase shift

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360
what is that?

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360
No, this is just a value.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.360
I want to expand

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.360
a, b, i, c, d, i

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.360
into a, b, i, c, j, d, k

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.360
There are many different ways.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.360
But I deliberately choose this way

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.360
it will cause my left side is a complex scalar

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.360
dependent on i, c.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.360
The right side will be a quaternion

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.360
dependent on i, c.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.360
Remember

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.360
in Madelung transform

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.360
the momentum operator

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360
is evaluated.

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360
Then you will find

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.360
quaternion is a deep sine

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360
projected to i-th direction.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.360
We can see

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.360
i-gradient

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.360
after gradients

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.360
is projected to i-th side.

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.360
That is exactly

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.360
the action of C2.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.360
It is projected to fiber direction or gravity direction.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.360
It is exactly

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.360
the pullback of 1-form.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.360
So the pullback of 1-form

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.360
is exactly the Clebsch representation.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.360
So in S3

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.360
under the

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.360
pre-quantum structure

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360
the Clebsch variable

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360
is exactly the Madelung transform.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.360
Then we know

01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.360
the given velocity

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.360
form has a

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.360
vorticity Clebsch variable.

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.360
The vorticity Clebsch variable

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360
is the sidebar i-th side.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.360
That is

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.360
the block vector

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.360
we learned in quantum mechanics.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.360
The block vector

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.360
is the vorticity Clebsch map.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.360
Remember

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.360
vorticity Clebsch map has an amazing function.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.360
It is the level size function of

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.360
vortex line.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.360
If you have wave function

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.360
you can find the block vector.

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.360
The block vector

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.360
is the area drawn on the sphere.

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.360
The pre-image is the vortex.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.360
Vortex2

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.360
Another interesting application is

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.360
given velocity field.

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.360
You can find the wave function.

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.360
Then you can visualize the vortex2

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.360
as an implicit function.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.360
Here I show some results.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.360
This turns into

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.360
a vortex detection

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.360
application.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.360
Vortex detection is

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.360
how to find

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.360
where the vortex is

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.360
in a velocity field.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.360
This is a

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.360
flow data.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:16.360
It is a delta wing.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.360
You can see

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.360
some vortex settings.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.360
Under the velocity field

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.360
you can

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.360
calculate the vorticity

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.360
and take the threshold.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.360
Then you can see the vorticity is bigger.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.360
Some more complicated methods

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.360
are lambda2 method

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.360
or cube criterion method.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.360
There are some heuristics.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.360
You can look at the local Jacobian

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.360
and calculate the eigenvalue.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.360
Then you can determine

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.360
where the vortex is.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.360
These methods are heuristic.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.360
You can see these tubes are not vortex tubes.

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.360
We developed

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360
a method to convert

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.360
given velocity field

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.360
into wave function.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.360
You can find the spin vector

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.360
and

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.360
the

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.360
level set function

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.360
for vortex tubes

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.360
and vortex stripes.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.360
You can easily

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.360
visualize

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.360
the vortex structure.

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.360
It can reveal

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.360
much more information.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.360
These are the real vortex tubes

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.360
and not heuristic.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.360
You can calculate the operator

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.360
and look at the eigenvalue

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.360
to see if it is rotating or not.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.360
We found that

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:42.360
most velocities can be approximated.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.360
For example,

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.360
the vortex has a linking number

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.360
which is 0.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.360
To solve this problem,

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.360
we solved

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.360
an image processing problem.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.360
We found that

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:58.360
it is a Ginzburg-Landau model.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.360
When we solve

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:02.360
an image processing problem,

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.360
we want to match

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.360
some parameters.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.360
For example,

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.360
I want to find a Psi

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.360
which

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.360
is close

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.360
to

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.360
the given velocity field.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.360
This is called fidelity term.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.360
There is a problem.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.360
As I mentioned,

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.360
there is a redundant

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.360
gauge symmetry.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.360
If my S

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.360
is below the block vector,

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:36.360
I will post-compose

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.360
an area-preserving differential coefficient.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.360
It is exactly the same

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.360
as the vortex.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.360
Vortex is a pull-back area.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.360
The right side is a mix.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.360
The pull-back area is the same.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.360
With such a big

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.360
redundant gauge symmetry,

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.360
we still want to find

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.360
a better one.

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.360
So we add

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.360
a symmetry-breaking term.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.360
I want to find

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.360
the most smooth

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.360
solution.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.360
With this solution,

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.360
we get a better

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.360
optimization problem.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.360
This is fidelity and regularization.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.360
Image processing

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.360
has two terms.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:28.360
Fidelity and regularization.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.360
These two terms

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.360
are the

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:34.360
two directions

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.360
of the

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.360
re-quantum structure.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.360
If you have a deep Psi,

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.360
the rest of the direction

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.360
is how fast

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.360
you move

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.360
in different fibers.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.360
The projection

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.360
is how fast

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.360
you move

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.360
in the two-dimensional

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.360
sphere.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.360
You will find that

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.360
ds is the horizontal direction

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.360
and the re-quantum direction

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.360
is the speed direction.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.360
This is the fidelity term.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.360
You just need to change the gauge.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.360
I change d to

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360
d-iEta.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.360
As I mentioned earlier,

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.360
the re-quantum connection

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.360
is at the same speed.

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.360
You can adjust it like this.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.360
After adjusting it,

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.360
this is my new covariant derivative.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.360
After adjusting it,

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.360
this nabla Psi

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360
is projected

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.360
on the fiber direction.

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.360
The horizontal direction

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.360
is still

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.360
the original ds.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.360
What?

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.360
It's non-zero.

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.360
It's because of the redundant gauge symmetry.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.360
That is to say,

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.360
if I choose 0,

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.360
the problem should be solved like this.

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.360
When I find a Psi,

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.360
it should be 0.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.360
Oh, right.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.360
How do I choose Psi?

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.360
The way of optimization is

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.360
that I choose Psi at the beginning.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.360
Because the larger the Psi,

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.360
the easier it is to solve.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.360
The ds on the right is good.

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.360
When I solve

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.360
to the approximate value,

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.360
I reduce Epsilon.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.360
At the end,

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.360
when Epsilon is almost 0,

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.360
I trace my

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.360
suboptimal solution.

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.360
When Epsilon is equal to 0,

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.360
it will stick to the

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.360
minimized

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:44.360
Psi star Theta.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.360
The fidelity term

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:48.360
will be minimized.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.360
Yes.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.360
You can say that.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.360
You can see that

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.360
there are different weights.

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.360
Yes.

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.360
It's called a Bergers sphere.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.360
The metric of fiber

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:10.360
and not fiber direction

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.360
is anisotropic.

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.360
The concept is

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.360
used to do

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.360
collapse S3 into S2

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.360
in Weibull.

01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.360
It's used in

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.360
different things.

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.360
According to

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.360
the theorem of Pythagoras,

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.360
the square box

01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.360
is just

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.360
its

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:38.360
size.

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.360
It's just anisotropic.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.360
As you mentioned.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.360
Visualize.

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.360
Anisotropic norm

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.360
looks like this.

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.360
Cool.

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.360
It's called King-Splendor

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.360
because

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.360
it's normalized

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:04.360
Psi.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.360
It's normalized

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.360
deep Psi

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.360
norm square.

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.360
The D is covaried.

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.360
It's magnetic field.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.360
At the bottom,

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.360
there will be some

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.360
particles.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:22.360
You can see

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.360
the vortices.

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.360
I'm visualizing the vortices.

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:28.360
And

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.360
some particles.

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.360
And

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.360
this is the choice of

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.360
the query.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.360
Can you see it?

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.360
We also

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.360
do some

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.360
biological

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.360
flow calculation.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.360
We ask for some data

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.360
and do some

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.360
visualization.

01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.360
Find

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.360
the velocity field

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.360
near the bird.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.360
Convert into wave function.

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.360
Block vector.

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:08.360
Preimage of area.

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.360
Visualization is

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.360
more information

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.360
than

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.360
simulation.

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.360
This is the second part.

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.360
I think

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.360
we can stop here.

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:24.360
I just want to prove

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.360
some mathematical

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.360
flow.

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.360
That's it.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.360
I just want to say

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.360
what?

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.360
I said it all

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.360
in defense class.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.360
There are some

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.360
interesting things.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.360
Coriolis force and quantum

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.360
hole effect.

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.360
Quantum hole effect is

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.360
quantum mechanics

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.360
with magnetic field.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.360
There will be

01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.360
some

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.360
Lorentz force

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.360
quantum version.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.360
Then

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.360
we put quantum mechanics

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.360
power system.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360
It's similar to fluid.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.360
Lorentz force

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.360
is Coriolis force.

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360
I can simulate

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.360
the fluid

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.360
with Coriolis force.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.360
But my method

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.360
is not to add

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.360
Coriolis force.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.360
I just add

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.360
quantum mechanics.

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.360
The result is like this.

01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:32.360
You can see

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.360
it's all anti-clockwise.

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.360
I didn't

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.360
solve any equation.

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.360
I just solve the equation

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.360
with magnetic field.

01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.360
There are many open problems.

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.360
This is just the beginning

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.360
of a new framework.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.360
For example,

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.360
I didn't say

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.360
if we can get

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.360
new insights

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.360
from the Euler equation.

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.360
We can't make

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:16.360
a big claim yet.

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.360
I don't want to

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.360
discuss Euler equation.

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.360
I want to discuss general flow

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.360
or conservation law.

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.360
For example, traffic flow.

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.360
Those are

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.360
general flow.

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.360
It's not only about

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.360
inertia system

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.360
and conservation law.

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.360
There are some

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.360
capture representation.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.360
Most of them are

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.360
capture representation in MHD.

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.360
We can discuss

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.360
the framework.

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:56.360
That's all.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.360
Thank you.

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.360
I think there will be.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.360
But I need to know

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360
more about it.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.360
Then

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.360
do some benchmark.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.360
Maybe climate simulation is better.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.360
Weather prediction.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.360
I think data-driven is better.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.360
I've seen

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.360
the chart of

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.360
state-of-the-art.

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.360
Wait.

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:22.360
I've seen

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.360
very good

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.360
I've heard

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.360
that

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:30.360
I've seen some

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.360
crappy simulation.

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.360
I've heard some talk

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.360
that you can do it

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.360
very accurately.

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.360
For example,

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.360
it's not real

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.360
but it's conservation law.

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.360
It's the simulation of tsunami.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.360
It can match

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.360
almost exactly.

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.360
It has been developed

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.360
since 90s.

01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.360
But it's not

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.360
tsunami every day.

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.360
You need to verify.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.360
It matches

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.360
with the Japanese tsunami.

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:06.360
Is the simulation

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.360
non-linear?

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.360
Non-linear.

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.360
The tsunami's

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.360
shadow water wave is non-linear system.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.360
It's from

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.360
physical model

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.360
to mathematical

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.360
shadow water equation.

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.360
There might be

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.360
error.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.360
And the geography

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.360
is input.

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.360
And the real

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.360
wave arrive time

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:40.360
and height are all non-linear.

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.360
If you really want to

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.360
do the prediction,

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.360
you can do it very well.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:54.360
I have a similar question.

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.360
I've been thinking about application.

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.360
I've been thinking about

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.360
TimeTree.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.360
You mean Gensperr?

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.360
I've been thinking about it

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.360
since the beginning.

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.360
I don't know

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.360
like Xiaoliu

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.360
or DMT.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.360
They want to use

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.360
first principle to create new

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.360
real.

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.360
I don't know.

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.360
I want to

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.360
compare

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.360
the terms in DFT.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.360
And I know

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.360
for example

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.360
the simplest

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:38.360
Gensperr Landau model

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.360
doesn't need complicated

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:42.360
DFT.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.360
Gensperr Landau model

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:46.360
usually

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.360
means

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.360
I said this is Gensperr Landau

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.360
means

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.360
usually Gensperr Landau

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.360
will say Psi is not sent to S3 map

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.360
but to D2 or R4 map.

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.360
And then

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.360
it's not normalized.

01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:16.360
So there's a non-linear image.

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.360
Non-linear image means

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.360
it's

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:22.360
penalized.

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.360
If Psi is not equal,

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:26.360
it will want to go in the opposite direction.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.360
It's a non-term.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.360
Of course, it's related to Psi norm.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.360
So it's a non-linear image.

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.360
And that image

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.360
will appear in

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.360
GP equation.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.360
It's a very popular GP equation.

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:42.360
It's a non-linear

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:44.360
equation.

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.360
It's a bit long in practical.

01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:48.360
It's a bit long in practical.

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.360
But you often

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:52.360
think that

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.360
if I model it,

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.360
it's a very natural

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.360
symmetry.

01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.360
You can see the mathematical meaning

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.360
of penalization term.

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.360
So you often see

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.360
many models

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:08.360
add up like this.

01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.360
But this is a bit different.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:12.360
It's a projection

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:14.360
or a constraint

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.360
system.

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.360
So for example, GP equation

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.360
is a bit superfluous.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.360
It's an incompressible

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.360
flow.

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.360
So

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.360
it's a bit different in math.

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:30.360
So if it's going in that direction,

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360
I don't know if there are

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.360
new ideas.

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.360
Okay.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.360
Okay.

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.360
If there are no other questions,

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.360
thank you again.
