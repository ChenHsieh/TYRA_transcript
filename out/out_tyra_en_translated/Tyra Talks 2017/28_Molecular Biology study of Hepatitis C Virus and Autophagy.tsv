0	9000	Hi, everyone. I'm the host for today. I'm Zhang Yanyong.
9000	18000	We're going to have our 23rd Tara Talk this year.
18000	23000	We're honored to have Dr. Wang Lingya as our speaker today.
23000	25000	She's my senior at NTU.
26000	28000	Wait a minute.
30000	34000	Lingya studied medicine at NTU.
34000	38000	After graduating from the PhD program at NTU,
38000	40000	she came to Nanyang University.
40000	42000	She's actually our neighbor.
42000	44000	We've met quite a few times.
44000	48000	After doing her PhD, Lingya majored in virology.
48000	54000	That's the topic she's going to talk about today.
54000	65000	Today's topic is Molecular Biology Study of Hepatitis C Virus and Autophagy.
65000	66000	Is that how you pronounce it?
66000	67000	Yes.
67000	70000	I don't know. If I pronounce it wrong, Lingya will correct me.
70000	72000	Without further ado, let's welcome Lingya.
72000	75000	Oh, right. Autophagy.
75000	77000	There are two things I want to remind you of.
77000	80000	First, if you don't want to speak,
80000	82000	turn off your microphone so that you won't have noise.
82000	86000	Second, when you clap, remember to turn on your microphone so that you can hear.
86000	88000	Let's welcome our speaker.
90000	92000	Hello, everyone. I'm Lingya.
92000	95000	As the host just said,
95000	97000	I'm doing my PhD in Nanyang University.
97000	100000	I'm majoring in virology.
100000	103000	When you watch a movie,
103000	107000	you'd think that you're walking around in a white gown in a lab.
107000	114000	But in fact, the most commonly used technology in our department is molecular biology.
114000	121000	So today, I'm going to talk about some methods of molecular biology
121000	125000	and how it's used to study viruses.
125000	130000	I'll talk about autophagy later.
131000	134000	Molecular biology.
134000	136000	As you can imagine,
136000	138000	biology is a big topic.
138000	141000	But molecular biology is about small molecules.
141000	144000	We learned in middle school that
144000	148000	DNA converts into RNA and converts into protein.
148000	152000	So the so-called genes are all on DNA.
152000	154000	After a series of synthesis,
154000	156000	it becomes protein.
157000	159000	When we study viruses,
159000	162000	we study almost everything.
162000	165000	It's either DNA, RNA, or protein.
165000	167000	These things are very small,
167000	169000	so you can't see them with the naked eye.
169000	173000	So our experiments are often done on
173000	176000	very small transparent objects.
176000	177000	For example,
177000	182000	a 100-microliter or even a 1-microliter object.
182000	185000	Basically, you can't see it with your eyes.
185000	187000	So if you go on a trip,
187000	190000	you might not know which one you're holding.
190000	191000	They all look the same,
191000	192000	so you don't know.
193000	195000	This is mainly about molecular biology.
195000	199000	It's about looking at the performance of DNA, RNA, or protein.
200000	202000	I just mentioned cells.
202000	204000	We also taught this in middle school.
204000	206000	Cells look like this.
206000	208000	There's a cell box, a cell paper, a cell film,
208000	210000	and there's a lot of air in it.
210000	214000	But the textbook will draw it cuter.
214000	216000	It's more like a starfish.
216000	220000	But in fact, the cells under the wire
220000	222000	are filled very slowly.
222000	224000	You can see this is the cell box,
224000	225000	and then the cell film,
225000	227000	and in the middle is the cell paper.
227000	230000	There's a lot of air in the cell paper.
230000	231000	All the so-called air
231000	234000	is actually made up of a lot of film,
234000	236000	all kinds of bubbles.
236000	238000	This is a little bit bigger.
238000	241000	You can see there's a lot of film,
241000	242000	a lot of bubbles.
242000	245000	These films and bubbles are actually all fat.
245000	247000	They're all made up of lipids.
247000	251000	Different bubbles have different functions.
251000	253000	Some are producing energy.
253000	255000	Some are making protein.
255000	258000	Some are making cyanide.
258000	261000	They're helping our cells maintain a good operation.
261000	263000	We need these cells.
265000	267000	Out of all these cells,
267000	269000	the autophagy we're going to talk about today
269000	271000	is actually a cyanide job.
271000	272000	To put it simply,
272000	274000	when our cells have
275000	277000	old bacteria,
277000	279000	or broken proteins,
279000	281000	or even when there's a virus infection,
281000	283000	or something from the outside,
283000	285000	it's all based on this cyanide
285000	289000	to get rid of these bad or old things.
289000	291000	Since it's a function of cyanide,
291000	294000	it will naturally follow the death of cells,
294000	295000	or cancer,
295000	296000	or like our immune response.
296000	297000	Because of the immune response,
297000	299000	the immune response needs to get rid of
299000	304000	some bad things from the virus or bacteria.
304000	307000	For example, neurodegenerative diseases
307000	310000	are all related to the function of this cyanide autophagy.
310000	312000	What we're going to focus on today
312000	316000	is infectious diseases.
316000	319000	Viruses are infectious diseases.
321000	324000	The function of autophagy
324000	326000	is mainly...
326000	327000	This is a cell membrane.
327000	329000	This brown one is a cell membrane.
329000	330000	We can see that
330000	333000	there are a lot of membranes in our cells.
333000	337000	It is a small membrane
337000	339000	made up of some fat
339000	341000	in a circle.
341000	343000	It will slowly get longer
343000	345000	and become a bubble.
345000	347000	Inside this bubble,
347000	349000	it will contain the bad things
349000	352000	that it will destroy later.
352000	356000	This bubble is called autophagosome.
356000	358000	I don't know how to say it in Chinese,
358000	360000	so please remember it.
360000	361000	It's called autophagosome.
361000	364000	It has a lot of enzymes
364000	366000	in this bubble.
366000	368000	These enzymes are used to
368000	371000	break down proteins.
371000	374000	When these two membranes are combined,
374000	376000	the substances in their cells
376000	377000	will be different.
377000	380000	This enzyme will
380000	384000	break down the proteins.
384000	388000	Let me talk a little bit about
388000	390000	the later process.
390000	393000	Every department has its own
393000	396000	application science or basic science.
396000	397000	The virus science I do
397000	399000	is very basic science.
399000	401000	It is purely studying
401000	404000	what protein, what gas
404000	406000	will react with the virus
406000	408000	in the cells.
408000	410000	When people ask me
410000	412000	if I'm doing medicine,
412000	414000	if I'm doing vaccines,
414000	416000	if I'm treating cancer,
416000	419000	it has nothing to do with clinical trials.
419000	421000	So when we talk about
421000	423000	basic virus science,
423000	426000	a lot of people think it's boring.
426000	428000	Today, I hope everyone
428000	430000	can understand this field.
430000	433000	How does autophagosome work?
433000	435000	From a simple membrane
435000	437000	to a circle,
437000	441000	it's easy to break down proteins.
441000	444000	As you can see in this picture,
444000	446000	this is a small membrane,
446000	447000	phagophore.
447000	449000	It will slowly become
449000	451000	a complete circle, autophagosome.
451000	453000	At the end, it's a fusion membrane.
453000	457000	The lysosome that breaks down proteins
457000	459000	is called autolysosome.
459000	463000	There are a lot of other proteins
463000	465000	that control the whole process.
465000	467000	Because the membrane doesn't
467000	469000	automatically merge together.
469000	471000	There must be a protein controlling it.
471000	473000	We can see that when phagophore
473000	475000	is still a fragment,
475000	477000	there is a protein called ATG5.
477000	479000	It will be specifically
479000	481000	combined on this membrane.
481000	483000	So when we monitor
483000	485000	the number of membranes in our cells,
485000	487000	when we specifically monitor
487000	489000	the membrane of this fragment,
489000	491000	we will look at the performance
491000	493000	of the protein ATG5.
493000	495000	If ATG5 performs well,
495000	497000	it means the membrane performs well.
497000	499000	So we call it a marker.
499000	502000	It's specifically for marking.
502000	504000	The marker on autophagosome
504000	506000	is LC3.
506000	508000	So in the experiment later,
508000	510000	if we talk about ATG5,
510000	513000	it's marking the membrane.
513000	515000	If we talk about LC3,
515000	518000	it's marking the autophagosome bubble.
518000	520000	How do we know
520000	522000	if the protein has been
522000	524000	broken down?
524000	526000	There is a protein called P62.
526000	528000	Every time it's in the autophagosome,
528000	530000	it will be wrapped inside.
530000	532000	So if it's broken down in the end,
532000	534000	we can see that
534000	536000	the performance of P62 will drop.
536000	538000	So these three things
538000	540000	are what we mainly do
540000	542000	when we do autophagosome,
542000	544000	to monitor how far it has come.
544000	546000	Why do we need to study
546000	548000	viruses and autophagosome?
548000	550000	We just mentioned that
550000	552000	autophagosome has the function
552000	554000	of cleaning the skin.
554000	556000	It can remove the protein
556000	558000	from the virus.
558000	560000	In theory,
560000	562000	autophagosome should be useful
562000	564000	to fight against viruses.
564000	566000	But many studies have found
566000	568000	that some viruses will
568000	570000	use autophagosome
570000	572000	to reproduce the virus
572000	574000	to fight against the virus.
574000	576000	This is a typical example
576000	578000	of how the virus
578000	580000	kidnaps the mechanism
580000	582000	inside the cell
582000	584000	to reproduce itself.
584000	586000	The virus is actually
586000	588000	something between
588000	590000	living and non-living.
590000	592000	Why is it non-living?
592000	594000	Because our cells
594000	596000	are made up of cell nucleus.
596000	598000	There are a lot of cells
598000	600000	that can produce energy
600000	602000	but not the virus.
602000	604000	The virus has some
604000	606000	scattered DNA and RNA
606000	608000	and a shell
608000	610000	made up of protein.
610000	612000	That's it.
612000	614000	The virus itself
614000	616000	has no biological ability.
616000	618000	But because it contains
618000	620000	DNA and RNA,
620000	622000	it is considered
622000	624000	a living organism.
624000	626000	So it is between
626000	628000	living and non-living.
628000	630000	The virus itself
630000	632000	has no biological ability.
632000	634000	It has to infect the cell.
634000	636000	So when we
636000	638000	are outside,
638000	640000	we don't see
640000	642000	the virus floating around.
642000	644000	It will die if it is outside.
644000	646000	It has to infect the cell.
648000	650000	The reproduction rate
650000	652000	of bacteria or cells
652000	654000	is 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8.
654000	656000	If we look at
656000	658000	the reproduction rate,
658000	660000	we will find that it is a log curve.
660000	662000	When it reaches a certain level
662000	664000	of oxygen or space,
664000	666000	it will start to die.
666000	668000	This is the growth curve
668000	670000	that a normal cell should have.
670000	672000	But the virus is very different.
672000	674000	It is made up of
674000	676000	a lot of DNA and RNA
676000	678000	in our cells.
678000	680000	There are also a lot of
680000	682000	shell proteins.
682000	684000	It is a bit like a factory
684000	686000	that produces parts.
686000	688000	When it is ready to ship,
688000	690000	it will assemble everything.
690000	692000	So if we look at
692000	694000	the virus in the patient's blood,
694000	696000	we will find that
696000	698000	the virus in the patient's blood
698000	700000	will decrease at first
700000	702000	because the virus is all in the cell.
702000	704000	So we can't detect it.
704000	706000	In the second stage,
706000	708000	when the virus is in the cell
708000	710000	and it is producing these parts,
710000	712000	we will feel like
712000	714000	the virus is all in the cell.
714000	716000	When it is ready to ship,
716000	718000	it will release it all at once.
718000	720000	So it is like an explosion.
720000	722000	This is why patients
722000	724000	who are infected with the virus
724000	726000	sometimes feel like
726000	728000	they are fine and
728000	730000	there are no symptoms.
730000	732000	But suddenly,
732000	734000	they are very weak
734000	736000	because the virus
736000	738000	is all out.
738000	740000	This is the difference
740000	742000	between A, B, C, D, E, and G.
742000	744000	There are many kinds of
744000	746000	hepatitis B virus.
746000	748000	In fact,
748000	750000	most people are studying A to E.
750000	752000	A and E
752000	754000	are eating something
754000	756000	that is not clean.
756000	758000	They are eating something
758000	760000	that is contaminated by the virus.
760000	762000	A and E are all sick.
762000	764000	They will be fine after a few weeks.
764000	766000	But B, C, D,
766000	768000	they will all
768000	770000	be infected.
770000	772000	As you can see,
772000	774000	when the virus is still
774000	776000	hiding in our cells,
776000	778000	this is called the incubation period.
778000	780000	At this stage,
780000	782000	our cells
782000	784000	do not detect
784000	786000	any foreign matter inside.
786000	788000	Then it can escape our immune system.
788000	790000	This is why some
790000	792000	virus infections
792000	794000	eventually lead to hepatitis B.
794000	796000	It is hiding in our cells.
796000	798000	Hepatitis C virus
798000	800000	has an incubation period,
800000	802000	but it can also become hepatitis B.
802000	804000	Hepatitis B can eventually
804000	806000	turn into liver cancer.
806000	808000	Not every virus
808000	810000	can turn into liver cancer.
810000	812000	So,
812000	814000	the current
814000	816000	hepatitis C virus
816000	818000	is still very common
818000	820000	in the world.
820000	822000	Many researchers
822000	824000	are still studying it.
824000	826000	Hepatitis C is an RNA virus.
826000	828000	Simply put,
828000	830000	when it infects cells,
830000	832000	it will decompose.
832000	834000	Then the RNA
834000	836000	will come out.
836000	838000	The first thing it does
838000	840000	is to rob
840000	842000	the protein
842000	844000	in our cells.
844000	846000	It is called the intracranial network.
846000	848000	After it robs the protein,
848000	850000	it is like saying,
850000	852000	don't make cell proteins anymore,
852000	854000	virus proteins
854000	856000	are made in large quantities.
856000	858000	Large amounts of virus proteins
858000	860000	will help it make more virus RNA.
860000	862000	More virus RNA
862000	864000	will make more virus proteins.
864000	866000	This is how
866000	868000	a lot of RNA and protein
868000	870000	are made in our cells.
870000	872000	Finally, it is assembled
872000	874000	and released in one breath.
874000	876000	Many studies have found that
876000	878000	HCV's RNA
878000	880000	copies are on the membrane.
880000	882000	There are many kinds of RNA in our cells.
890000	892000	Sorry, I have a question.
892000	894000	Can I interrupt you?
894000	896000	Or do you want to
896000	898000	ask one question at a time?
898000	900000	You can interrupt me,
900000	902000	but there will be lag.
902000	904000	My question is
904000	906000	this.
906000	908000	My question is
910000	912000	this.
912000	914000	I see.
914000	916000	My question is
916000	918000	you said that
918000	920000	this thing will go in
920000	922000	and remove this
922000	924000	and do this.
924000	926000	It sounds very smooth
926000	928000	and like an animation.
928000	930000	I am curious
930000	932000	about this.
932000	934000	Is it from some data
934000	936000	or can it be
936000	938000	visualized?
938000	940000	Actually, there are many steps.
940000	942000	Visualizing is one of them.
942000	944000	For example, someone
944000	946000	can see that
946000	948000	the virus particles
948000	950000	are on the surface of our cells.
950000	952000	They can also see that
952000	954000	the cell membrane goes in
954000	956000	and the virus is eaten.
956000	958000	This is visualized.
958000	960000	However, in the research of
960000	962000	molecular biology,
962000	964000	we can't just see it.
964000	966000	It may be an accident.
966000	968000	We can see that
968000	970000	the surface of our cells
970000	972000	also contains some proteins.
972000	974000	The virus uses
974000	976000	its own protein to interact
976000	978000	with the protein on the surface of our cells.
978000	980000	It is like a door
980000	982000	that opens a key.
982000	984000	It goes in.
984000	986000	This is an interesting point.
986000	988000	Why does the surface of our cells
988000	990000	have proteins to let the virus
990000	992000	combine?
992000	994000	It is similar to rice.
994000	996000	After many years of evolution,
996000	998000	it has found a way
998000	1000000	to enter our cells.
1000000	1002000	The protein on the surface of the cell
1002000	1004000	is not specifically for the virus.
1004000	1006000	It also has its own function.
1006000	1008000	The virus
1008000	1010000	uses the protein function
1010000	1012000	to let it enter the cell.
1012000	1014000	Of course,
1014000	1016000	the whole process
1016000	1018000	also has a lot of proteins
1018000	1020000	in it.
1020000	1022000	If all of them are drawn,
1022000	1024000	there will be a lot of proteins in it.
1024000	1026000	This is the result of evolution.
1026000	1028000	The control proteins
1028000	1030000	are not drawn in the soil.
1030000	1032000	Does this answer your question?
1034000	1036000	I have a question.
1038000	1040000	Please ask.
1042000	1044000	Yes, thank you.
1044000	1046000	You said that
1046000	1048000	RNA
1048000	1050000	allows cells
1050000	1052000	to produce protein.
1052000	1054000	Does it also produce
1054000	1056000	more RNA?
1056000	1058000	I forgot
1058000	1060000	the name.
1060000	1062000	Can it produce
1062000	1064000	protein and RNA at the same time?
1064000	1066000	It is like this.
1066000	1068000	This is called
1068000	1070000	an intracranial network.
1070000	1072000	This function is specifically for protein.
1072000	1074000	After the protein of the virus
1074000	1076000	is produced,
1076000	1078000	the RNA of the virus
1078000	1080000	is produced on the other membrane.
1080000	1082000	What is the other membrane?
1082000	1084000	This is what everyone is studying.
1084000	1086000	Our lab found that
1086000	1088000	it is made on the
1088000	1090000	autophagy membrane.
1090000	1092000	Some membranes are responsible for protein.
1092000	1094000	Some membranes are responsible for RNA.
1094000	1096000	After making a lot of them,
1096000	1098000	we put them together
1098000	1100000	and throw them out of the cell.
1100000	1102000	The process of throwing them out of the cell
1102000	1104000	is like HCV.
1104000	1106000	It is actually
1106000	1108000	a virus that
1108000	1110000	has not broken the cell.
1110000	1112000	Some viruses
1112000	1114000	will break the cell.
1114000	1116000	It means that
1116000	1118000	when it goes out,
1118000	1120000	it will kill the cell.
1120000	1122000	This will kill the cell
1122000	1124000	and make our body weaker.
1124000	1126000	It is like your body's cells
1126000	1128000	keep dying.
1128000	1130000	Killing cells is not very powerful.
1130000	1132000	It means that once it kills
1132000	1134000	your host,
1134000	1136000	it will die.
1136000	1138000	It is like Ebola.
1138000	1140000	It will kill people.
1140000	1142000	As long as you isolate
1142000	1144000	those people,
1144000	1146000	they will be fine.
1146000	1148000	HCV or HIV
1148000	1150000	will cause AIDS.
1150000	1152000	It will lurk
1152000	1154000	and not kill you.
1154000	1156000	It can exist in the natural world
1156000	1158000	for a long time.
1158000	1160000	Does this answer your question?
1160000	1162000	Thank you.
1162000	1164000	I have a question
1164000	1166000	about that page.
1166000	1168000	This one?
1168000	1170000	Yes.
1170000	1172000	This page is...
1172000	1174000	I thought
1174000	1176000	the growth of cells
1176000	1178000	is exponential.
1178000	1180000	So it starts with
1180000	1182000	log and then becomes exponential.
1184000	1186000	It starts with lag phase
1186000	1188000	and then log phase.
1188000	1190000	Of course,
1190000	1192000	our cells cannot
1192000	1194000	keep growing
1194000	1196000	because of space and nutrients.
1196000	1198000	So when it reaches a critical point,
1198000	1200000	it will enter
1200000	1202000	the death phase.
1202000	1204000	This is how
1204000	1206000	the life cycle of cells
1206000	1208000	looks like.
1208000	1210000	If it doesn't die,
1210000	1212000	it will become cancer.
1212000	1214000	I see.
1214000	1216000	So the virus has
1216000	1218000	a mathematical
1218000	1220000	growth
1220000	1222000	or something else?
1222000	1224000	Actually, every virus
1224000	1226000	is different.
1226000	1228000	For example,
1228000	1230000	let's take a look at
1230000	1232000	the flu virus.
1232000	1234000	We have heard about
1234000	1236000	H5N1 before.
1236000	1238000	That's because
1238000	1240000	it has
1240000	1242000	9 RNAs.
1242000	1244000	Each RNA
1244000	1246000	will produce
1246000	1248000	different RNAs.
1248000	1250000	So it will produce
1250000	1252000	9 different RNAs.
1252000	1254000	For example,
1254000	1256000	the 9 RNAs must be
1256000	1258000	mass-produced.
1258000	1260000	When it is packed,
1260000	1262000	the 9 RNAs must be packed.
1262000	1264000	So it may catch the wrong 9 RNAs.
1264000	1266000	For example,
1266000	1268000	the number of RNAs
1268000	1270000	is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
1270000	1272000	Then the virus will die.
1272000	1274000	The number of RNAs produced
1274000	1276000	and the number of RNAs packed
1276000	1278000	are different.
1278000	1280000	So
1280000	1282000	we can't
1282000	1284000	calculate
1284000	1286000	the number of RNAs
1286000	1288000	in a mathematical way.
1288000	1290000	There are many accidents
1290000	1292000	such as mutation
1292000	1294000	or wrong packing.
1294000	1296000	But we can't
1296000	1298000	figure out the exact number.
1298000	1300000	We can only use the approximate number.
1300000	1302000	It's hard to explain.
1312000	1314000	The reason why we do
1314000	1316000	HCV and autophagy
1316000	1318000	is that
1318000	1320000	we have a cell
1320000	1322000	that is infected.
1322000	1324000	This is a cell
1324000	1326000	infected with HCV.
1326000	1328000	We found that the green bubbles
1328000	1330000	are the autophagy bubbles.
1330000	1332000	Why do we know
1332000	1334000	these green bubbles?
1334000	1336000	Because we mentioned that
1336000	1338000	the marker of autophagosome
1338000	1340000	is LC3.
1340000	1342000	So we can detect
1342000	1344000	the LC3 of the cell.
1344000	1346000	When you see LC3,
1346000	1348000	it means it is autophagosome.
1348000	1350000	So if we can see
1350000	1352000	the LC3 in the cell with HCV,
1352000	1354000	it means the cell is doing autophagy.
1354000	1356000	This is the process
1356000	1358000	of infection.
1358000	1360000	I mainly want to show the below one.
1360000	1362000	The darker the color is,
1362000	1364000	it means more and more.
1364000	1366000	It means under the infection of HCV,
1366000	1368000	the LC3
1368000	1370000	will be more and more.
1370000	1372000	It means
1372000	1374000	the autophagosome
1374000	1376000	bubbles are more and more.
1376000	1378000	PCC2, as we mentioned before,
1378000	1380000	will be separated at this stage.
1380000	1382000	So we can see
1382000	1384000	it will be separated at the end.
1384000	1386000	It means the autophagosome
1386000	1388000	will be completed
1388000	1390000	in the cell of HCV infection.
1390000	1392000	Let me
1392000	1394000	introduce the meaning of these two methods.
1394000	1396000	In the cell dye,
1396000	1398000	we can design
1398000	1400000	what we often hear,
1400000	1402000	gene engineering.
1402000	1404000	It is the DNA outside the body
1404000	1406000	that we can design at will.
1406000	1408000	For example,
1408000	1410000	we want the gene series
1410000	1412000	to be put in.
1412000	1414000	The DNA series will be put in.
1414000	1416000	Then we put the protein gene
1416000	1418000	that we want to show.
1418000	1420000	After the DNA RNA makes the protein,
1420000	1422000	the protein will be green.
1422000	1424000	How to make it green?
1424000	1426000	We send the DNA
1426000	1428000	from outside the cell
1428000	1430000	to the cell.
1430000	1432000	The DNA makes RNA and becomes protein.
1432000	1434000	Then we can see
1434000	1436000	the green protein in the cell.
1436000	1438000	So
1438000	1440000	like this picture,
1440000	1442000	because of this protein,
1442000	1444000	we let it receive
1444000	1446000	a green protein
1446000	1448000	behind it or in front of it.
1448000	1450000	So it will be bright.
1450000	1452000	Otherwise, the cell itself will not be bright.
1452000	1454000	What if
1454000	1456000	the protein is not bright?
1456000	1458000	Because
1458000	1460000	not every protein we want to send
1460000	1462000	from outside the cell.
1462000	1464000	After all, sending from outside the cell
1464000	1466000	is an artificial method.
1466000	1468000	We can assume that
1468000	1470000	this is a wave.
1470000	1472000	The cells on the wave
1472000	1474000	have the protein we want.
1474000	1476000	Then we can use the antibody to recognize it.
1476000	1478000	This is the first antibody.
1478000	1480000	Every antibody
1480000	1482000	will only recognize one target.
1482000	1484000	This is a very transferable thing.
1484000	1486000	So if you have an A protein now,
1486000	1488000	you have to use the A antibody to recognize it.
1488000	1490000	This Y-shaped thing
1490000	1492000	is the antibody.
1492000	1494000	Its head is the target
1494000	1496000	we want to recognize.
1496000	1498000	It's very transferable.
1498000	1500000	But its tail
1500000	1502000	is almost the same
1502000	1504000	as everyone else's.
1504000	1506000	So we can use the second antibody
1506000	1508000	to recognize this butt.
1508000	1510000	Then the second antibody's butt
1510000	1512000	will receive a bright thing.
1512000	1514000	We use this method to detect
1514000	1516000	some non-bright proteins.
1516000	1518000	Then you might ask,
1518000	1520000	why don't you just take the first antibody's butt
1520000	1522000	and receive a bright thing?
1522000	1524000	We have tens of millions
1524000	1526000	of proteins.
1526000	1528000	If you have to design
1528000	1530000	an antibody for every protein,
1530000	1532000	and its tail has to emit green light,
1532000	1534000	red light, or blue light,
1534000	1536000	then you have to make a protein
1536000	1538000	every time.
1538000	1540000	It's a waste of money.
1540000	1542000	So you can imagine
1542000	1544000	that the second antibody
1544000	1546000	is a transferable tool.
1546000	1548000	It can recognize
1548000	1550000	all the
1550000	1552000	second antibody's butt.
1552000	1554000	So if you want to study other proteins,
1554000	1556000	you only need to change the first antibody.
1556000	1558000	You can use the same second antibody
1558000	1560000	to make it glow.
1560000	1562000	The so-called glow
1562000	1564000	is like the cell dye we just saw.
1564000	1566000	If we want to see
1566000	1568000	how bright the protein is,
1568000	1570000	if we look at the cell dye,
1570000	1572000	we can adjust the light
1572000	1574000	to make the color
1574000	1576000	look bright or dark.
1576000	1578000	This is not
1578000	1580000	credible.
1580000	1582000	It's just to see
1582000	1584000	where the cell is,
1584000	1586000	but it's more or less.
1586000	1588000	We still have to do it in other ways.
1588000	1590000	This method
1590000	1592000	is to briefly introduce
1592000	1594000	that the middle piece is a cabbage corner.
1594000	1596000	If you haven't eaten cabbage when you were a kid,
1596000	1598000	it's probably like that.
1598000	1600000	That thing
1600000	1602000	looks like a solid to us,
1602000	1604000	but for a small molecule,
1604000	1606000	the holes in it
1606000	1608000	are very large.
1608000	1610000	Each protein has electricity.
1610000	1612000	So after charging,
1612000	1614000	the protein we take out of the cell
1614000	1616000	is the protein of all cells.
1616000	1618000	We want to separate it.
1618000	1620000	After running the electric current,
1620000	1622000	the smaller protein
1622000	1624000	will run farther.
1624000	1626000	For example, if we add protein from here,
1626000	1628000	it will run to the back
1628000	1630000	after passing the electric current.
1630000	1632000	The larger protein will be stuck on top.
1632000	1634000	So using this method
1634000	1636000	can separate a lot of proteins
1636000	1638000	from large to small.
1638000	1640000	Because the cabbage corner
1640000	1642000	can't do more experiments,
1642000	1644000	so we have to run it again
1644000	1646000	and lay it down.
1646000	1648000	The cabbage corner was made of paper.
1648000	1650000	Then lay it down
1650000	1652000	and run the electric current
1652000	1654000	to print it on the membrane below.
1654000	1656000	It can be imagined that it is a piece of paper.
1656000	1658000	Although its material is not paper.
1658000	1660000	On this piece of paper,
1660000	1662000	there will be
1662000	1664000	proteins arranged from large to small.
1666000	1668000	If you want to measure
1668000	1670000	the protein position here,
1670000	1672000	add it to the antigen
1672000	1674000	and add another antigen
1674000	1676000	to make it glow.
1676000	1678000	Then we can detect the signal.
1678000	1680000	The so-called detection signal
1680000	1682000	is a traditional method of using a film.
1682000	1684000	It is the kind of film that everyone knows.
1684000	1686000	We know that when there is light,
1686000	1688000	the film will turn black.
1688000	1690000	This means that the more protein,
1690000	1692000	the more light it receives.
1692000	1694000	The more antibodies it receives,
1694000	1696000	the brighter it glows,
1696000	1698000	the darker it gets.
1698000	1700000	So if we go back to this,
1700000	1702000	this means
1702000	1704000	that there is very little protein.
1704000	1706000	Then the one on the right
1706000	1708000	means that it has a lot of protein.
1708000	1710000	So we can use this method
1710000	1712000	to separate the various proteins
1712000	1714000	in the cell
1714000	1716000	from large to small
1716000	1718000	and then use antibodies to detect
1718000	1720000	how much it performs.
1724000	1726000	Back to HCV and autophagy.
1726000	1728000	There has been research
1728000	1730000	that HCV's RNA
1730000	1732000	copies will be on the membrane.
1732000	1734000	There are so many membranes
1734000	1736000	in our cells.
1736000	1738000	What membrane does it use?
1738000	1740000	Our lab found that
1740000	1742000	it uses the autophagy membrane.
1742000	1744000	Where does the autophagy
1744000	1746000	make so many steps and so many membranes?
1746000	1748000	First of all,
1748000	1750000	this is also an electromagnetic map.
1750000	1752000	You can see the curved
1752000	1754000	phagophore in the cell.
1754000	1756000	It looks like this.
1756000	1758000	Then it will be assembled
1758000	1760000	into a circle,
1760000	1762000	which is autophagosome.
1762000	1764000	I just said
1764000	1766000	that it may not be true when the eyes see it.
1766000	1768000	It may just happen to be
1768000	1770000	put together.
1770000	1772000	So we really have to prove that it will be
1772000	1774000	integrated together.
1774000	1776000	As mentioned earlier,
1776000	1778000	we put the ATG5,
1778000	1780000	which is specialized
1780000	1782000	to label the
1782000	1784000	phagophore
1784000	1786000	marker.
1786000	1788000	ATG5
1788000	1790000	means phagophore.
1790000	1792000	We send the DNA
1792000	1794000	with green light
1794000	1796000	to the cell.
1796000	1798000	It will show the ATG5
1798000	1800000	with green light.
1800000	1802000	The ATG5 will run to the membrane.
1802000	1804000	Simply put,
1804000	1806000	the phagophore in this cell
1806000	1808000	will be green.
1808000	1810000	We use red light for the other cell.
1810000	1812000	The phagophore in this cell
1812000	1814000	will be red.
1814000	1816000	If these two membranes
1816000	1818000	are combined,
1818000	1820000	it will turn yellow light.
1820000	1822000	If not, you will see
1822000	1824000	red or green.
1824000	1826000	So we use this method
1826000	1828000	to see if these two membranes
1828000	1830000	will assemble
1830000	1832000	and turn yellow light.
1832000	1834000	This picture
1834000	1836000	may be a little small.
1836000	1838000	I don't know if you can see it.
1838000	1840000	When our cell
1840000	1842000	is under pressure,
1842000	1844000	for example, starvation,
1844000	1846000	it will make the cell
1846000	1848000	starved or
1848000	1850000	infected by the virus.
1850000	1852000	The autophagy will start to occur.
1852000	1854000	Then we can see
1854000	1856000	the ATG5
1856000	1858000	phagophore formation.
1858000	1860000	We can see
1860000	1862000	the yellow dots
1862000	1864000	on the membrane.
1864000	1866000	These are yellow dots.
1866000	1868000	These are all yellow dots.
1868000	1870000	This means that
1870000	1872000	in the HCV-infected cell,
1872000	1874000	the membrane will
1874000	1876000	be
1876000	1878000	fused together
1878000	1880000	into a
1880000	1882000	circle bubble.
1884000	1886000	It won't be fused
1886000	1888000	with the membrane.
1888000	1890000	It will be controlled by the protein.
1890000	1892000	This is just an example of
1892000	1894000	how the protein controls the
1894000	1896000	fusion of the membrane.
1896000	1898000	Some proteins will
1898000	1900000	run to the A membrane.
1900000	1902000	The B membrane
1902000	1904000	may also have another protein.
1904000	1906000	These proteins
1906000	1908000	interact
1908000	1910000	to pull the two membranes
1910000	1912000	together
1912000	1914000	and cause them to fuse.
1914000	1916000	It depends on the protein
1916000	1918000	to fuse them together.
1918000	1920000	We found that
1920000	1922000	there is a protein called
1922000	1924000	syntax-insider.
1924000	1926000	It will
1926000	1928000	fuse the membrane
1928000	1930000	together.
1930000	1932000	In order to prove
1932000	1934000	the function of a protein,
1934000	1936000	the simplest way is to
1936000	1938000	show it or not.
1938000	1940000	For example,
1940000	1942000	you suspect a protein
1942000	1944000	to do something.
1944000	1946000	In order to prove
1946000	1948000	the function of the protein,
1948000	1950000	the simplest way is to
1950000	1952000	remove the protein.
1952000	1954000	If the protein is removed,
1954000	1956000	the function of the protein
1956000	1958000	will not occur.
1958000	1960000	How can we
1960000	1962000	prevent the protein from
1962000	1964000	functioning?
1964000	1966000	We designed some RNAs
1966000	1968000	and sent them
1968000	1970000	to the cell.
1970000	1972000	The point is
1972000	1974000	that the RNA
1974000	1976000	we designed
1976000	1978000	will target the
1978000	1980000	RNA we don't want it to show.
1980000	1982000	Then it will
1982000	1984000	cut off the RNA.
1984000	1986000	We just said that
1986000	1988000	DNA makes RNA,
1988000	1990000	RNA makes protein.
1990000	1992000	If we let a gene's RNA
1992000	1994000	be cut off,
1994000	1996000	it can't make protein.
1996000	1998000	This is just a technique.
1998000	2000000	This technique is to
2000000	2002000	prevent the protein we want
2002000	2004000	from being made.
2004000	2006000	We can see that
2006000	2008000	ATG5
2008000	2010000	is the marker
2010000	2012000	on the membrane.
2012000	2014000	We can also see that
2014000	2016000	Syntaxin7
2016000	2018000	is the protein that
2018000	2020000	will merge the membrane.
2020000	2022000	The green one is the membrane,
2022000	2024000	and the red one is the protein
2024000	2026000	that will merge the membrane.
2026000	2028000	We can see that
2028000	2030000	Syntaxin7
2030000	2032000	is really
2032000	2034000	on the membrane.
2034000	2036000	Next,
2036000	2038000	we use
2038000	2040000	the method of
2040000	2042000	red and green membrane.
2042000	2044000	In the cell of
2044000	2046000	HCV,
2046000	2048000	the red and green membrane
2048000	2050000	will be merged.
2050000	2052000	We can see the yellow dots.
2052000	2054000	But when we show
2054000	2056000	the protein,
2056000	2058000	there are no yellow dots.
2058000	2060000	This means that
2060000	2062000	the existence of this protein
2062000	2064000	is important for
2064000	2066000	the green and red membrane
2066000	2068000	to be merged.
2068000	2070000	Without it, the membrane won't be merged.
2072000	2074000	Next,
2074000	2076000	if the membrane is not merged,
2076000	2078000	it is useless.
2078000	2080000	This method is called
2080000	2082000	membrane flotation.
2082000	2084000	This means that
2084000	2086000	we take out all the protein
2086000	2088000	in the cell,
2088000	2090000	and use a different concentration of sugar.
2090000	2092000	At the bottom is 80% of sugar water.
2092000	2094000	It is almost a piece of water.
2094000	2096000	The higher it is,
2096000	2098000	the thinner the sugar.
2098000	2100000	After going through a super high speed reaction,
2100000	2102000	the lighter protein will float to the top.
2102000	2104000	We just said that the membrane is
2104000	2106000	some fat.
2106000	2108000	It is very light.
2108000	2110000	It will float to the top.
2110000	2112000	We want to
2112000	2114000	separate the structure
2114000	2116000	of the membrane.
2116000	2118000	We don't want to mix with others.
2118000	2120000	We just want to take this membrane.
2120000	2122000	We found that
2122000	2124000	this is too complicated.
2124000	2126000	In short,
2126000	2128000	after we separate
2128000	2130000	the structure of the membrane,
2130000	2132000	we found that
2132000	2134000	the independent membrane
2134000	2136000	is broken.
2136000	2138000	Even if it is not
2138000	2140000	synthesized into a circle,
2140000	2142000	it has a way to
2142000	2144000	reproduce the HCV RNA.
2146000	2148000	This may be easier to understand
2148000	2150000	later.
2150000	2152000	In other words,
2152000	2154000	the structure of
2154000	2156000	ATG5
2156000	2158000	is enough to support
2158000	2160000	the reproduction of HCV RNA.
2160000	2162000	We can also see
2162000	2164000	from another result
2164000	2166000	that LC3,
2166000	2168000	B and C
2168000	2170000	are virus proteins.
2170000	2172000	We can see that
2172000	2174000	the virus protein
2174000	2176000	is on LC3.
2176000	2178000	This means that
2178000	2180000	we let LC3 glow,
2180000	2182000	we let the virus protein glow,
2182000	2184000	and then we put the image
2184000	2186000	together.
2186000	2188000	We found that
2188000	2190000	the signal is at the same point.
2190000	2192000	It means that it is there.
2192000	2194000	This is the structure of
2194000	2196000	the virus RNA.
2196000	2198000	It is also on LC3.
2198000	2200000	There are virus proteins
2200000	2202000	and virus RNA on LC3.
2204000	2206000	We also found that
2206000	2208000	HCV not only uses
2208000	2210000	the membrane
2210000	2212000	to reproduce,
2212000	2214000	it also uses the entire membrane
2214000	2216000	to reproduce.
2216000	2218000	To make a simple diagram,
2218000	2220000	when the phagophore
2220000	2222000	is made,
2222000	2224000	it needs to rely on
2224000	2226000	SYN7 to
2226000	2228000	combine them together
2228000	2230000	to form a circle.
2230000	2232000	We found that
2232000	2234000	HCV can reproduce
2234000	2236000	on these three membranes.
2236000	2238000	But
2238000	2240000	ATG5 will
2240000	2242000	decompose the protein
2242000	2244000	at the end.
2244000	2246000	What happens at the end?
2246000	2248000	If it starts to decompose the protein,
2248000	2250000	it is not good for the virus
2250000	2252000	and the virus will
2252000	2254000	try to stop
2254000	2256000	the process.
2256000	2258000	How does it stop?
2258000	2260000	We use another
2262000	2264000	LC3
2264000	2266000	that emits red light and green light.
2266000	2268000	When it is at the phagophore stage,
2268000	2270000	because it emits red light and green light,
2270000	2272000	we see that it is yellow.
2272000	2274000	When it is
2274000	2276000	merged with the last step
2276000	2278000	to become autolysosome,
2278000	2280000	the green light will be decomposed
2280000	2282000	but the red light will remain.
2282000	2284000	This is actually a cell observation method.
2284000	2286000	When you see yellow,
2286000	2288000	it means that it is still in autolysosome.
2288000	2290000	When you see red,
2290000	2292000	it means that it has entered the last stage.
2292000	2294000	Look at this diagram.
2294000	2296000	When it is still at this stage,
2296000	2298000	it will be yellow.
2298000	2300000	If it enters the last step
2300000	2302000	to decompose the protein,
2302000	2304000	it will turn red.
2304000	2306000	In the case of virus infection,
2306000	2308000	from 6 hours to 12 hours,
2308000	2310000	one day to two days,
2310000	2312000	we can see that
2312000	2314000	it is always yellow.
2314000	2316000	Until the 24th hour, it is still yellow.
2316000	2318000	It means that it is still at this stage
2318000	2320000	until the 24th hour.
2320000	2322000	It is always very late.
2322000	2324000	It becomes red after two days
2324000	2326000	and enters the last stage.
2326000	2328000	What mechanism keeps it
2328000	2330000	at this stage,
2330000	2332000	the autolysosome stage,
2332000	2334000	instead of entering the last stage?
2334000	2336000	There are two proteins.
2336000	2338000	One is Rubicon.
2338000	2340000	Rubicon's performance rises first.
2340000	2342000	UV-REG's performance
2342000	2344000	rises later.
2344000	2346000	What are these two proteins doing?
2346000	2348000	It is easier to explain with a diagram.
2348000	2350000	In general,
2350000	2352000	the function of UV-REG
2352000	2354000	is to let these two moles
2354000	2356000	merge,
2356000	2358000	that is, the autolysosome and the lysosome
2358000	2360000	merge to enter the last stage.
2360000	2362000	But at the beginning of the virus infection,
2362000	2364000	it will let Rubicon
2364000	2366000	perform a lot.
2366000	2368000	It will squeeze out UV-REG.
2368000	2370000	This protein is
2370000	2372000	specifically for this fusion
2372000	2374000	not to happen.
2374000	2376000	If it doesn't happen,
2376000	2378000	a lot of autolysosome moles
2378000	2380000	will accumulate.
2380000	2382000	The more moles,
2382000	2384000	the happier the virus will be.
2384000	2386000	Because it can reproduce with these moles.
2386000	2388000	It wants these moles.
2388000	2390000	It doesn't want them to merge
2390000	2392000	But at the late stage
2392000	2394000	of the infection,
2394000	2396000	it may not be able to stop it.
2396000	2398000	UV-REG will come back.
2398000	2400000	It will squeeze out Rubicon again.
2400000	2402000	It will let this fusion
2402000	2404000	continue.
2404000	2406000	At the end,
2406000	2408000	because it can no longer stop
2408000	2410000	the fusion of these moles,
2410000	2412000	it will use other moles.
2412000	2414000	This is the experiment of others.
2414000	2416000	It has nothing to do with our lab.
2416000	2418000	Our lab has reached this stage.
2418000	2420000	When HCV is infected,
2420000	2422000	it will trigger
2422000	2424000	the occurrence of autolysosome.
2424000	2426000	It will produce
2426000	2428000	this membrane.
2428000	2430000	Cytosine 7 will let
2430000	2432000	these moles merge
2432000	2434000	into a complete circle.
2434000	2436000	It can reproduce on this membrane.
2436000	2438000	It doesn't want this membrane
2438000	2440000	to merge
2440000	2442000	at the last stage.
2442000	2444000	So that it can have
2444000	2446000	endless moles to attack
2446000	2448000	and reproduce.
2448000	2450000	That's about it.
2450000	2452000	This is the research
2452000	2454000	I did in our lab.
2454000	2456000	This is a very basic
2456000	2458000	research on molecular biology.
2458000	2460000	Basically,
2460000	2462000	we haven't done
2462000	2464000	any clinical trials
2464000	2466000	on how to treat this virus.
2466000	2468000	Our job is
2468000	2470000	to see
2470000	2472000	what happens
2472000	2474000	after the virus infects the cell.
2474000	2476000	Then we control the protein
2476000	2478000	so that it can reproduce.
2478000	2480000	Okay.
2480000	2482000	I'm done.
2488000	2490000	I have a question.
2492000	2494000	Before we start
2494000	2496000	the Q&A,
2496000	2498000	let's thank Linya for her speech.
2500000	2502000	Thank you.
2504000	2506000	My question is
2506000	2508000	the protein...
2508000	2510000	Sorry.
2510000	2512000	I'm lagging.
2512000	2514000	You can continue.
2516000	2518000	The host is lagging.
2520000	2522000	The protein
2522000	2524000	will make the membrane
2524000	2526000	into a circle.
2526000	2528000	How does it...
2528000	2530000	The protein
2530000	2532000	is like a signal
2532000	2534000	to make the membrane
2534000	2536000	into a circle.
2536000	2538000	Or is it induced?
2538000	2540000	It can change the curvature
2540000	2542000	of the membrane.
2542000	2544000	Let me find a picture.
2550000	2552000	I don't know if you can see it.
2552000	2554000	On this membrane,
2554000	2556000	there are some proteins.
2558000	2560000	On the other membrane,
2560000	2562000	there are some proteins.
2562000	2564000	These two proteins
2564000	2566000	cooperate
2566000	2568000	and mix together
2568000	2570000	to make the two membranes
2570000	2572000	merge.
2572000	2574000	As I mentioned,
2574000	2576000	the protein
2576000	2578000	of Synthase C7
2578000	2580000	has a function
2580000	2582000	that
2582000	2584000	on the membrane,
2584000	2586000	this and that
2586000	2588000	mix together
2588000	2590000	to make the membrane
2590000	2592000	merge with each other.
2592000	2594000	This is what the protein
2594000	2596000	is doing.
2596000	2598000	The membrane that it will merge
2598000	2600000	is not only the membrane we just mentioned.
2600000	2602000	It will also merge many other membranes.
2602000	2604000	This series of
2604000	2606000	Synthase C7
2606000	2608000	has 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8...
2610000	2612000	The whole series of proteins
2612000	2614000	are all doing the
2614000	2616000	membrane merging.
2616000	2618000	There are many different types of membrane in the cell.
2618000	2620000	So different members
2620000	2622000	are responsible for different membranes
2622000	2624000	to merge together.
2624000	2626000	Does this answer your question?
2626000	2628000	Yes, thank you.
2628000	2630000	So the protein is very large, right?
2630000	2632000	If it wants to
2632000	2634000	stir this...
2634000	2636000	Actually, they are all very small.
2636000	2638000	The protein itself is actually quite small.
2638000	2640000	Mainly because
2640000	2642000	the protein has a
2642000	2644000	3D structure.
2644000	2646000	You can imagine your hand
2646000	2648000	can be flat,
2648000	2650000	but you can also bend it.
2650000	2652000	And you still have fingers.
2652000	2654000	You can interlock your fingers with others.
2654000	2656000	If you hold it together, it will become a very small group.
2656000	2658000	The same goes for the protein.
2660000	2662000	When it is doing what it should do,
2662000	2664000	it may become a very small group
2664000	2666000	when it is interlocked with others.
2666000	2668000	Because it merges closely together.
2670000	2672000	I understand. Thank you.
2674000	2676000	There should be no more questions.
2676000	2678000	Am I talking too fast?
2682000	2684000	I have a question.
2690000	2692000	Did you hear that?
2692000	2694000	Yes, I did.
2694000	2696000	My question is
2696000	2698000	to confirm
2698000	2700000	if I understand.
2700000	2702000	You said
2702000	2704000	when you are infected
2704000	2706000	by HCV,
2706000	2708000	I forgot the name.
2708000	2710000	A purple and a blue protein.
2710000	2712000	The light blue one
2712000	2714000	will be inhibited.
2714000	2716000	The purple one will come in.
2716000	2718000	So it can't be interlocked.
2718000	2720000	From a pharmaceutical point of view,
2720000	2722000	is it possible that
2722000	2724000	in the middle stage,
2724000	2726000	I can make a lot of
2726000	2728000	UV rays in the cell,
2728000	2730000	and it won't happen?
2730000	2732000	This is the protein in the cell.
2732000	2734000	This is not the protein of the virus.
2734000	2736000	The protein in the cell
2736000	2738000	has what it should do.
2740000	2742000	So if we
2742000	2744000	target any protein
2744000	2746000	in the cell
2746000	2748000	to affect its performance,
2748000	2750000	it may harm your cell.
2752000	2754000	So the virus is
2754000	2756000	a bit like
2756000	2758000	hijacking.
2758000	2760000	It hijacks
2760000	2762000	the cell
2762000	2764000	to do what it wants to do.
2764000	2766000	But if you say
2766000	2768000	it will hijack the protein
2768000	2770000	to do what it wants to do,
2770000	2772000	we will eliminate the protein.
2772000	2774000	Then the virus can't be reproduced.
2774000	2776000	This is because the virus
2776000	2778000	has its own function in the cell.
2778000	2780000	If you eliminate it,
2780000	2782000	our cells may die first.
2788000	2790000	Hello? Can you hear me?
2792000	2794000	Oh, I see.
2794000	2796000	This is much more complicated than I thought.
2796000	2798000	Yes, so in fact,
2798000	2800000	from a pharmaceutical point of view,
2800000	2802000	we have done a lot of
2802000	2804000	protein things.
2804000	2806000	Do you have any questions?
2810000	2812000	I have a lag with you.
2818000	2820000	I have a lag with you.
2824000	2826000	I just heard it,
2826000	2828000	so you can finish it.
2828000	2830000	No, that's it.
2830000	2832000	Anyway, it is quite difficult
2832000	2834000	to make medicine
2834000	2836000	for protein.
2836000	2838000	You have to find a protein
2838000	2840000	that only affects
2840000	2842000	the virus
2842000	2844000	but not the person.
2844000	2846000	But this is rare.
2846000	2848000	Protein is useless
2848000	2850000	in our human body,
2850000	2852000	but in terms of natural evolution,
2852000	2854000	very few proteins are useless
2854000	2856000	in our body.
2870000	2872000	Okay, any more questions?
2872000	2874000	I know I'm lagging,
2874000	2876000	so when I heard that
2876000	2878000	everyone had no questions,
2878000	2880000	it should have been a while.
2880000	2882000	No, I don't think so.
2882000	2884000	Thank you.
2884000	2886000	Thank you.
2890000	2892000	Okay, we are done.
2894000	2896000	Thank you again, Linya.
2896000	2898000	Thank you.
2898000	2900000	That's all for
2900000	2902000	our talk today.
2902000	2904000	Bye-bye.
