Welcome to this week's Tera Talk. I'm your host, Yu-Wei Lin.
I'm pleased to welcome our speaker today, Louis.
He is currently a Ph.D. student at St. Louis University of Washington.
His main research projects include intellectual property rights, law, anti-Thorax law, and economic analysis.
Before he was a Ph.D. student, he was an intern at Winston & Stone, a law firm in Taiwan and abroad.
He also analyzed the legal process of Taiwan clients and non-authorized individuals in the U.S. and East Texas courts.
Louis is also passionate about entrepreneurship.
He is a member of the China Entrepreneurship and International Exchange Association.
He regularly holds conferences and talks in Taiwan to promote entrepreneurship.
Today's topic is based on his background in law and entrepreneurship.
Louis, please turn on your microphone.
Thank you, Yu-Wei, and thank you, Tera, for inviting me.
Last year, I also talked about copyright issues in my talk.
Today's topic is completely different.
This topic has a little to do with my graduate thesis, but it is not all of my graduate thesis.
Instead, I use different angles to analyze the case study of my graduate thesis.
As you can see on the screen, my graduate thesis is co-authored by a friend from Shanghai Fudan University's School of Management.
My thesis focuses on the use of bundling in the market.
The main details of my thesis will take about 30-40 minutes.
This topic has a background, so I will talk about it in detail.
I'm just curious about what kind of people are listening to my talk today.
I will talk about it in detail.
In fact, it is not so difficult to compare things in the Department of Sociology and Law.
Today, I will use some mathematical things, but I will not show you the whole process.
I don't think I need to show off.
I just want to show you what our results are.
I don't have much to say.
Some of the things I study need to be understood by everyone.
If some of you are interested in this industry or already know it very well, please add it if I am wrong.
What I want to talk about today is actually related to modern chip.
Modern chip is the so-called communication chip industry.
In fact, I found this Samsung Galaxy S4 on the Internet.
The structure of the picture is like this.
One of them is modern chip.
What are the benefits of modern chip?
The advantage is that after I installed this modern chip in my mobile phone today,
For example, as we all know, the communication standards of 2G, 3G, and 4G will not have the so-called problems that cannot be used in different countries.
Just imagine that if you buy an iPhone today, whether it is iPhone 4, iPhone 5, or iPhone 6,
The result may be that your communication standards are different today, or your communication bandwidth is different.
In fact, this is very blind.
How to solve this difference in bandwidth or communication standards?
Modern chip plays a very important role.
Another example is that everyone is in the United States.
I assume that everyone is in the United States.
For example, if you run to some remote places with your mobile phone, it is not 4G that covers the range, but 3G or even 2G.
But you can still make calls and you can still go online.
It's just that it's very slow.
How is this function done?
In fact, this is the function of modern chip.
It can still operate under different standards and under different levels.
However, its operating function is limited.
This is the function of modern chip.
It can be seen that a mobile phone has a lot of functionality.
But the value of a smart phone is to be online.
Modern chip plays a very important role.
What I want to discuss today is a small communication chip problem.
Let's take a look at the situation of this industry.
This is a total of 1.2 years.
From 2007 to 2012, there were several leading companies in the modern chip industry.
We can probably see that Qualcomm has been playing a leading role in this field.
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2007 to the 4G in 2012.
Later, I will show the state of the 5G patent layout.
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role.
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2012 to the 5G in 2012.
This is the current state of the industry.
From 2012 to now, we can see that the green part of the patent is high-speed communication.
In fact, it occupies a very high position in the patent layout of modern chip, including radio front, modulation, and core networking.
From these pictures, we can see the current state of the industry.
For example, InterDigital and BlackBerry have all disappeared.
These are all in the past.
The former dragon head is no longer in use.
You can see that there is a lot of communication in the green part.
The gray part is Intel, which we will discuss today.
In fact, it is not as good as Qualcomm in terms of patent layout, especially 5G.
So we can simply summarize that Qualcomm is almost in monopoly in the modern chip industry.
Because most of the chips are in the patent layout of most of the modern chip sales, and the quality of its products is maintained.
So the state of its maintenance is very good.
Most of the big manufacturers, including Apple users, mostly use Qualcomm's modern chip for their important suppliers from iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, and iPhone 7.
But the problem is that these so-called communication standards, which I just mentioned, such as 2G, 3G, and 4G standards.
In fact, these standards have a lot of patent layout behind them, and the negotiation process of each party.
You always have to decide which standard to use. It must be of good quality and easy to promote. I think everyone can understand this.
In fact, there are these international standard organizations behind the standard promotion.
So back to the picture just now, let's come here first.
I think this picture is very important in the background of my law school.
Why is it important? Because it explains the relationship between people of different levels.
Because on my left is IEEE, ITU, and ETSI. These three are very important technical standards organizations that designate 4G and even 5G.
These technical standards organizations play a role in promoting technical standards.
The core concept is that I want my 4G standard or 5G standard in the future to be able to be used by many people.
It's not that I only let a group of people use it. A small group of people using it is not a standard.
So it must be that everyone can recognize this thing. Yes, it's good, it's easy to use, and it's efficient.
The standard of 5G and 4G can be slowly promoted because the industry recognizes it.
But behind it, as I said before, it involves a lot of different patent layouts.
Because it is impossible for a company to have all the patents of technical standards.
It must be segmented. It must be cut into many segments. Some companies specialize in that.
For example, now everyone sees Radio Front End. Although the patents of Ericsson and Qualcomm are similar, it also means that there are many things that Qualcomm can't do.
So today I want to talk to you about this kind of industry.
Such patents are called SEP.
SEP stands for Standard Essential Patents.
Those who have SEPs, such as the manufacturers I mentioned earlier, including Ericsson, Qualcomm, and Intel, are considered SEPs.
Everyone will think that if everyone in the world uses this standard, then he can raise the price.
Because people all over the world use it, then I'm not turning over.
In order to prevent this from happening, it should be said that preventing it from turning over is one point.
Another point is that it can take advantage of the position of patents in the market.
Because patents are a kind of legal monopoly, everyone can understand it this way.
Most people may not study law.
If you ask me how to understand patents, the way to understand it is very simple.
A patent is a legal right for you to have this kind of monopoly.
It allows you to have the right to monopolize within a period of time for your technology and patent.
So it is a limited monopoly.
After these people have patents, if these patents or technologies are used as standards, then they can raise their prices indefinitely.
Isn't that against the purpose of these technical standards organizations that I just mentioned?
Because the price is too high, no one can use it.
If I want to pay so much, who will think about my rights?
So, in this atmosphere, in this concept, all technical standards organizations in the process of setting standards,
remember that this structural organization requires all SEPs to provide an LOA.
LOA is the condition that you have to accept the conditions provided by the technical standards organization.
For example, you want to become a 3G standard, or a 4G standard, or a 5G standard in the future.
But your patent price must be within a certain range.
But we call this range of conditions FRIEND.
Let me stop for a moment.
Because I really can't see everyone's conversation.
Does anyone have any questions now?
Let's take a look.
It seems that no one has asked me a question.
If you have any questions, you can ask me at any time, it doesn't matter.
If there are no questions, I will continue to talk.
Because I found that there is no social science background, I have to speak particularly slowly.
The full name of FRIEND is Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory Licensing.
FRAND is included in the conditions provided by all technical standards organizations.
This condition actually includes a lot.
If you are interested, you can check it.
One of the most important conditions is that your patent must be used as a standard.
Your technology must become my 5G standard.
You submit your patent application.
But you must accept the restrictions of FRAND.
Because, as I said, you can't raise the price too high.
If the price is too high, no one will use it.
Another point is the following box.
The following box is the implementer.
What I mean by implementer is, for example, our great HTC.
HTC may have some patents, but it is not a player.
HTC is not the patent holders we saw in the picture just now.
It's just that I'm an authorized person, and I use the technical standards they have, and I use the technology.
We call it implementer.
It is not a person who develops modern chips.
Simply put, HTC is also.
Apple is also.
Of course, if you are concerned about this industry, Apple has already released a message that it wants to step in.
It also wants to make its own chips.
If you are interested in this in the future, you can talk to me.
It's a matter of whether you can do it or not.
There are still some entry barriers.
Back here, you have to accept that you have to become a technical standard.
You have to accept FRAND.
Second, the condition of FRAND will not be limited to the relationship between you and the technical standard organization.
It will have a third-party interest.
We call it a third-party interest contract.
This third-party interest contract means that after I make these terms with the technical standard organization today, the efficiency of these terms will affect the third person.
The meaning of the third person is that it includes HTC, because it is not an owner of SEP.
It is not an owner of SEP, but its efficiency will affect the third person.
So everyone can enjoy the benefits of FRAND.
In other words, the third party, for example, HTC, I also have to use these technical standard organizations.
These 3G, 4G, or 5G patents.
You can't because I'm not in this technical standard organization, or I'm not part of this technical standard organization.
So these SEP owners raise my price very high.
Basically, these SEP owners join the technical standard organization and submit their patents to the technical standard organization as a prerequisite for 5G standards.
The problem is that you have to accept these two conditions.
The first is that the price of your patent must be within a reasonable range.
The second is that it will affect the third party.
As long as everyone wants to use this technical standard, everyone can enjoy the benefits of FRAND.
Instead of saying that because you are in a technical standard organization, I will give you a discount, and no one else will.
But here I make a signal.
That is, my research is in this area.
The source of all the problems is here.
Because there will be so-called market monopoly problems.
Why?
Think about it, who are the members of all the technical standard organizations?
Isn't it the so-called industry leaders?
Because who sets the technical standards?
It must be the industry leaders, right?
Among these industry leaders, if everyone gathers together to have a meeting.
But Taiwanese people may not know much about this law.
It seems that many manufacturers sit in line together to eat and discuss things.
It seems very simple, there is no legal problem.
I tell you, the problem is here.
The problem is that the U.S. Anti-Trust Law and the so-called EU Competition Law strictly prohibit this matter.
Because this prohibition is actually the so-called joint pricing behavior.
Because the U.S. has a lot of different review standards in the so-called Anti-Trust Law.
In fact, the most taboo thing is like the joint pricing I just said.
A bunch of competitors in the same industry.
For example, we just said that Ericsson also has a patent.
It is also in the ETSI, ITU, and IEE.
Qualcomm is also a member.
Because everyone submits their patents and then joins their members.
So this group of people are all competitors in the same industry.
All set standards here.
Of course, as a government role, the government will be very worried about this matter.
Are you guys doing it?
Why? Think from another perspective.
Friend is what we just talked about.
The problem with Friend is that I promised you today.
I promised you to set the price of Friend.
But this is a requirement for all SEP holders.
And this technical standard organization is afraid.
For example, if I ask for 5%, I ask for the price of Friend.
It is called 5% of each product sale.
5% may be too high.
1% is called Friend.
Think about it.
If this is the case.
What is the price of Friend?
What is the price of reasonable and non-discriminatory?
All people can only charge 1%.
In fact, from the perspective of the government, you will find it strange.
Why did you all create this RATE together?
Is there a joint pricing behavior?
This problem is stuck in the technical standard organization.
I abbreviate SSO to make it easier for me to say.
SSO will be worried.
If everyone is investigating me.
Everyone is doubting me.
Am I doing joint pricing?
Because I said a sentence.
The price of Friend is called 1%.
Am I being investigated all day?
So the problem is here.
Although it is a very important organization.
It created Friend.
It requires everyone to accept Friend.
But it is not responsible for the so-called pricing behavior.
Because of this, what is Friend?
I can report to you.
What is Friend?
In the legal circle.
There are many discussions in the paper of the Chamber of Commerce.
Because no one dares to go to court.
The court itself or the government unit.
It has never dared to respond positively to this matter.
Includes its definition.
It has its own method of calculation.
But every court in the United States.
Are using different methods of calculation.
So this thing is actually complicated.
In fact, today I will introduce this kind of background to you first.
Because I think this thing needs to be explained to you first.
Then his background state.
Then I can get into what we are studying.
Because of this, everyone will have the so-called level playing field.
Everyone has a rough idea of ​​this matter.
I know what I am studying.
I'm getting into my stuff.
This is easier for everyone to understand.
Before we officially start talking.
Before this very interesting case.
Let me ask you first.
The simple industry I just introduced.
Or some knowledge background.
Is there any problem with the introduction?
5 seconds.
No problem so far.
No problem, very good.
But if you have any questions, you are welcome.
I also want to train.
Talk to people in the legal field.
See what you think.
After having such background knowledge.
We know that the technical standards have many patents.
It is authorized to be restricted by the FRIEND regulation.
Then it has a third-party regulation.
So everyone can enjoy FRIEND.
Then there is that we all know.
When selling, there are usually a lot of patents behind.
The problem has appeared.
We all know that I just mentioned.
Qualcomm is an industrial leader.
Its modern chip quality is very good.
It is also an Apple long-term supplier.
But at the beginning of 2017.
FTC, the Federal Trade Commission of the United States.
And Apple itself.
Apple is its downstream manufacturer.
It has sued Qualcomm for violating the Antitrust Law.
Specifically, it has many claims.
It has advocated many things.
What I want to focus on today is.
Qualcomm is on the so-called contract.
With everyone playing a so-called.
It uses its market position.
To achieve its goal of making profits.
How does it do this?
First of all, everyone sees this picture.
This picture is actually public.
I didn't do it, it's not so beautiful.
This picture is when Apple is suing Qualcomm.
It added its content of this lawsuit.
And its analysis chart.
How does Qualcomm violate the law?
Basically, Qualcomm.
Its practice is actually divided into two stages.
Today, because of a little more time.
I don't know how much time I have.
But I'll talk slowly.
It is actually divided into two stages.
Qualcomm's two-stage behavior is the first.
Qualcomm in 2007.
Before officially becoming an Apple supplier.
In fact, it is with Apple.
Uh, other assembly lines.
Uh, including the so-called.
We refer to this Fuskang.
I take Fuskang as an example.
Fuskang is Apple's.
This assembly line.
It is actually Qualcomm itself.
Uh, the assembly line of Apple.
There is already a contract.
Why? Because you want to assemble.
You will also use Qualcomm's patent.
Because Qualcomm's patent layout is very wide.
We just.
In fact, I just gave a simple example.
In fact, if you look at it.
Qualcomm's patent layout.
It has exceeded the scope of the modern chip itself.
It contains the entire technical standard.
OK, this is what he said.
Uh, I also believe that.
Because if you go to check Qualcomm.
This company was established in 1985.
Then continue to be in.
Uh, the communication chip industry continues.
To do research and development.
Then continue to.
Uh, expand his career.
So he actually.
The impact is not just in the modern chip itself.
It also includes the whole.
It also includes itself.
Uh, it also includes technical standards.
OK.
So he was originally Qualcomm.
He is cooperating with Apple suppliers.
Ah, because Apple suppliers.
For example, I just said Fuskang.
Fuskang, he actually does more than Apple products.
He also does other.
Do HP, right?
You do other products.
HP's, for example.
Will also use Qualcomm's chip.
Uh, it will also use Qualcomm's patent.
Or technology also needs to be done.
Uh, patent authorization.
So it becomes.
In fact, Qualcomm already has.
With other Apple suppliers.
To do cooperation.
So why did I mention Apple suppliers?
His complexity is here.
Because Qualcomm, he did one.
The fun thing is that he is.
Before becoming an Apple supplier.
He told this Apple supplier.
I just said.
I signed a contract with you.
I put this.
You want to assemble this Apple product.
Okay, I'll take this patent with you.
But what about the content of this patent?
The scope is not the content.
Specific details.
How is it?
Uh, it's NDA.
Non-disclosure agreement is not open.
OK, what about other things?
If I think I'm because of this.
The relationship is actually a bit complicated.
To put it simply.
Qualcomm, I'm with Apple today.
Uh, the assembly plant of Apple.
Ah, and then the patent authorization.
Ah, these assemblies.
He can actually come back and ask Apple for this.
Want this reimbursement.
That is to say, because the assembly plant.
He doesn't think he has to.
Take more of this responsibility.
Because this contract is actually negotiable.
But in the real world.
I can tell you.
Report to everyone.
In fact, most of the money.
Uh, there are a lot of parts.
A lot of money has become.
Apple to squeeze.
But of course Apple will say.
I didn't squeeze them.
Of course, in this case.
Qualcomm is Qualcomm.
Uh, Qualcomm claims.
Oh, I have been with these assemblies today.
Cooperation.
I asked them to pay these.
Give me the rights to patent authorization.
If you don't want to.
You can go back to Apple.
You don't have to pay for this.
Does Apple pay for you?
But the fun thing is here.
Qualcomm, I just said that Qualcomm.
He is SEP.
In fact, his SEP is a.
There must be a range.
His range is the so-called.
This friend.
He is more than that.
Fair and reasonable.
He must be reasonable.
And not discrimination.
I went to these assemblies.
Signed the NDA.
If you are Apple.
Then there is a result.
I want to use.
For example, I want to use Qualcomm chips.
Then the result.
I use Qualcomm chips.
All those assemblies below me.
Have been asking me for money.
Qualcomm has already collected more money from me.
Then you have to compensate me.
Then how much compensation.
Then how much according to the contract.
Why is this price?
Those assemblies.
Apple asked those assemblies.
Why is this price?
I can't tell you.
Because Qualcomm said this is NDA.
I can't tell you.
So this is wonderful.
The first stage is to say.
Qualcomm went to Apple's assembly plant.
Wanted a sum of money.
Then the source of this money is.
NDA is not public.
That becomes.
Because the account is there.
Qualcomm asked me for so much money.
Then Apple.
Transferred to Apple.
Then Apple.
I can only admit it.
Apple thinks it's strange.
Is this price reasonable?
Ask my assembly plant.
He can't say.
That's weird.
Apple actually wants to get rid of this.
How much did I pay Qualcomm?
I don't know.
I don't know my source.
I don't know my calculation method.
I just kept paying for it.
He thinks it's unreasonable.
Feel the price.
His internal manager.
Or lawyers or lawyers.
Think this price may be unreasonable.
Qualcomm wants too much money.
He decided to talk to Qualcomm directly.
So this picture is later.
Apple talked to Qualcomm.
After he talked.
Apple said I can sign a contract with you.
The gray part below.
BCPA, TA, FTA, SDA, ASDA.
These are all abbreviations of this contract.
BCPA, for example.
His full name is.
Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement.
TA is Transition Agreement.
Anyway, he is an abbreviation.
Anyway, he is an abbreviation.
In these contracts.
Qualcomm and Apple.
They went to talk.
Apple feels bad.
You go through the middle.
I want to talk to you directly.
I want to talk to you directly.
Qualcomm agreed.
After he agreed, he signed these contracts.
But he added some conditions in these contracts.
But he added some conditions in these contracts.
These conditions are fun.
What you see now.
Rebate Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement.
These two.
It sounds very simple.
In fact, the specific content looks like this.
This is the lawsuit.
This is mentioned in Apple's lawsuit.
Of course, it contains a lot of confidential documents.
I don't know what confidentiality is.
I don't know what confidentiality is.
Mainly these two.
One is that you have to promise me.
You want me to provide.
You want me to provide you with chips.
You want me to provide you with chips.
He is the US Federal Trade Commission.
He is the US Federal Trade Commission.
No license.
No chip.
No license.
No license.
He said.
You want me to supply my high-quality modern chip.
But you have to accept the price.
But you have to accept the price.
But you have to accept the price.
You have to accept the price of my SEP.
You have to accept the price of my SEP.
Then he found out inside Apple.
It seems to be a bit higher than the market.
But Qualcomm said.
But Qualcomm said.
What can you do?
If you don't accept this price.
Then I can't provide you with this modern chip.
These two are bundled together.
The so-called bundled together.
I'm going to sell you a modern chip today.
But you have to accept.
Apple's own claim.
In fact, this case is still running.
In fact, this case is still running.
The so-called price is not FRIEND.
The so-called price is not FRIEND.
The so-called price is not FRIEND.
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.
But sorry, I want 5% of the sales price.
But because Qualcomm has good quality.
And then he is a market leader.
And then there's a lot of patent planning.
So Apple has to accept this.
So Apple has to accept this.
This is the first point.
The so-called no license, no chip policy.
The so-called no license, no chip policy.
Apple must accept his contract terms.
Apple must accept his contract terms.
In exchange, you say, okay, you want me to use his.
I use Qualcomm's modern chip.
I use Qualcomm's modern chip.
But I have to accept a higher FRIEND price.
But I have to accept a higher FRIEND price.
You want me to supply this, right?
But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel.
But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel.
I didn't treat you badly.
He provides a rebate.
He provides a rebate.
This rebate is a fixed amount of price.
This rebate is a fixed amount of price.
Because you've been my client for a long time.
Because you've been my client for a long time.
Use my communication chip.
Then I'll give you a discount.
Then I'll give you a discount.
Then I'll give you a discount.
Because everyone is not learning law or business.
Because everyone is not learning law or business.
All the discounts in the mall.
All the discounts in the mall.
I'll give you a sum of money.
In fact, there are conditions.
Qualcomm said yes.
Apple said yes.
You give me a discount.
But Qualcomm said yes.
I'll give you a discount.
But you have to accept the following conditions.
The following conditions are two.
The following conditions are two.
The following conditions are two.
What are the conditions?
You have to use my communication chip.
You have to use my communication chip.
You can't jump the grass.
You can't use Intel.
You can't use Samsung.
You can't use Samsung.
You can't use my competitor's chip.
You can't use my competitor's chip.
It sounds reasonable.
It sounds reasonable.
The second point is that it's fun.
You can't go to any government unit.
You can't go to any government unit for investigation.
You can't make a lawsuit.
Let's start the debate.
First, I provide a discount
First, I provide a discount
But you have to use my chip.
But you have to use my chip.
Second, he says,
Second, I provide a discount
Second, I provide a discount
But you can't sue me.
But you can't sue me.
These are two points.
One is that you can't investigate me.
Completely lock you up.
The other point is that
You can't jump to another place.
You can't jump to another place.
You can't make a patent lawsuit.
You can't make a patent lawsuit.
This makes Apple very upset.
I can't use other people's chip.
I can't use other people's chip.
I can't use other people's chip.
Qualcomm uses the so-called
Qualcomm uses the so-called
No license, no chip.
The price is so high.
I don't know what you're doing.
I don't know what you're doing.
You are a market monopoly.
You are a market monopoly.
The whole thing is mixed up.
The whole case is mixed up.
Let Apple jump.
And caused a lot of
And caused a lot of
European Union.
And China-Taiwan.
Taiwan, you probably heard of it.
He was also investigating this case.
US and the U.S.
The United States Trade Commission is investigating the whole thing.
What is his legitimacy?
What is his legitimacy?
We want to investigate.
Qualcomm is doing this.
What is the reason behind this?
Why does Qualcomm
Why does Qualcomm
Bundle Rebate?
Bundle Rebate?
You can think about it.
If Qualcomm's quality is so good.
If Qualcomm's quality is so good.
Good quality, good market monopoly status.
Why does he provide a return to Apple?
Why does he provide a return to Apple?
Because I'm lying down.
Apple is coming.
You can think about it.
If you are a market monopoly status.
If you are a market monopoly status.
Basically, everyone's products
Almost use my modern chip.
Almost use my modern chip.
People can't catch up with me.
People can't catch up with me.
For example, he mentioned Intel.
For him, Intel is nothing.
He can't catch up with me at all.
He can't catch up with me at all.
I don't know if you have learned this.
I don't know if you have learned this.
The cost of investment is very high.
So this question has always been a question of ours.
So this question has always been a question of ours.
So this question has always been a question of ours.
The core question is if Qualcomm
If Qualcomm is in a market monopoly status.
If Qualcomm is in a market monopoly status.
In market leadership.
He is so wide in his specialist.
OK, and the quality of products is also very good.
Why does he provide this return to Apple?
What's going on in society?
What's going on in society?
And provided with this return.
And provided with this return.
This period is not just a year or two,
Perhaps a period of 3 to 5 years.
Perhaps a period of 3 to 5 years.
So he's actually still providing this rebate.
So he's actually still providing this rebate.
Then provide such a return to Apple.
Then the two requirements are that
Then the two requirements are that
And then you can't investigate me.
And then you have to accept mine.
Then issue
Is the value of Friends justified?
I'm not in today's report.
I'm not in today's report.
Because you say everything.
Apple says you are not a friend.
Qualcomm says I am a friend.
Because I have the whole patent I authorize to you.
Because I have the whole patent I authorize to you.
This know-how
And this so-called technical standard.
Of course, the price is so high.
Of course, the price is so high.
This is the problem of the industry.
This is the problem of the industry.
Today's problem is on this rebate.
So today I will tell you briefly.
That is to say, today I focus on the point.
Also this paper.
The point I studied with that classmate is.
Why Qualcomm
He will be so persistent.
To provide rebate this matter.
OK
I'm pausing again.
I'm pausing again.
See if you have any understanding of this case.
See if you have any understanding of this case.
Do you understand this story I just said?
Do you understand this story I just said?
Do you understand this story I just said?
Does anyone not understand?
What is the link that you don't understand?
If you don't understand.
Can you tell me which link you don't understand?
OK, no one responded.
Just pretend to understand.
On the basis of this knowledge,
we know that the hatred between Apple and Qualcomm has spread like this.
I was sued like this last year.
For me, this paper is a cross-sectional, cross-field cooperation paper.
I am responsible for the part of legal analysis.
My partner is responsible for the study of the Gantt theory model,
and the analysis of this whole thing from a commercial and economic perspective.
First of all, everyone is very curious.
From my point of view,
is there a similar case in the past?
Or how did they judge this rebate case?
Or what is the result of their judgment?
Let me report to you.
Simply put, this thing, this problem,
even the court itself is difficult to handle.
The red part you see on the screen
represents that the court is the red part.
The red case is the court's judgment.
The defendant, a company like Qualcomm, is illegal.
The black part is that I didn't mark it.
The black part of these cases
is considered legal by the court.
It's like a bond rebate.
You have to accept this.
If you want to use it,
just like the state of communication I just talked about.
If you want to use my stuff,
you want to become my supplier,
or I want to supply you with good stuff,
but you have to accept my conditions.
You can buy it,
but you have to buy a certain amount.
After you buy a certain amount,
I'll give you a rebate.
It's a similar concept.
It's a similar trading model.
I've sorted out these six cases.
Since none of them are legal,
I won't go over them one by one.
In fact, based on the results,
the results are divided.
The reasons are also divided.
The three red dots
are the different courts
for these cases.
So you can see
a very special phenomenon.
On the issue of rebate,
or bond rebate,
different courts have different reasons
and different results.
I'll talk about it later.
Qualcomm actually used this point.
It's not a use.
It should have seen this point.
We infer that he saw this point
and it may have become his reason
to continue to use his bond rebate to Apple.
This is our inference.
I'll talk about it later.
This is my preliminary investigation.
I found that
if the defendant
is illegal in the red case,
and legal in the black case,
I'll see
what common features
the red case has.
First, those illegal cases
in the red part.
I just showed you the red part.
These defendants
actually have some market monopoly.
So if you are a market monopolist,
it is likely to violate the antitrust law.
This is in our legal school.
If you learn this antitrust law,
basically this probability is very high.
If you have this market monopoly,
it is basically easy to violate the antitrust law.
This is very normal.
OK.
In the context of this bond rebate,
it is not an exception.
But we have seen
the second point is very interesting.
We see legal.
We compare these legal cases.
In the black cases,
we found that
the defendant may still be legal.
Why?
Just imagine.
In the black cases,
why do some judges
think they are legal
in the same situation?
Because they do not have
the effect of exclusion.
OK.
In general,
let's put it simply.
Antitrust law is actually
a law of corporate behavior.
OK.
It is the law of market economy
and corporate behavior.
So the market economy
should maintain a competitive attitude
instead of letting a person monopolize
or show a state of monopoly.
But imagine
if he was originally today.
Although he is a
through his sales behavior
and then his innovative business model
to achieve his market leadership position
but not monopoly leadership position
and then he wants to continue
to increase his market share
he may let other competitors
have some problems
or what is the situation.
The effect of his exclusion
may make some
for example,
competition or something
he may let other competitors
he can not come in
or potential competitors
for example,
as I just mentioned
Intel
Intel in the so-called
this computer CPU
everyone should know
are doing very well
this Pentium
Pentium series are doing very well
and then with this
Microsoft
in the late 90s
is almost
this is almost
very few computers
but he is in
the communication chip inside
he just can not stand
he is not
the so-called position
that he is coming in today
but in fact
he wants to come in
as long as he invests enough money
in fact, Intel
if you go to check
in fact, he is also doing
just keep doing bad
OK
but not to say
he can not do
this is the difference
that is
I'll talk about
this is the difference
that is the so-called can not do
that is to say
I used some business behavior
for example, I
I join all the people
I do not provide you material
you can not do
this is not
this must be against
this anti-trust law
because this is against
this
this market competition
that is
the current situation
is to say
we observed
the first few
black cases
we found that
those cases
Why is it legal
because those potential competitors
he was not excluded
into this market
he can still
enter this market
competition
means that
his entry barrier
is low
that entry barrier
low, then
the court saw
low entry barrier
that is to say
that you
may come in today
but you choose not to come in
or you
may have other
commercial considerations
but not come in
so
before
I go back
before
these black cases
Why would be
legal
these Bundle
Rebate
because
other competitors
he
was not excluded
he still came in
he still joined
this industry
continue to compete
with these defendants
for example,
if the defendant
is Gaotong
he still
come in
this industry
to compete
that is
like we
discussed today
Gaotong
is not the only
one
to provide
Samsung
also has
Huawei
also has
OK
so
you
know
that
although Gaotong
in this market
is based on
monopoly status
based on this
leadership position
and then
may have
some monopoly
power on
sales
because
the quality of
his product
is good
but
other people
are still
inside
right
other players
are also
inside
other
manufacturers
are also
inside
but
you get
this market
leadership position
is my
development ability
is strong enough
my innovation is enough
my patent
quality is good enough
so everyone
likes to use my
product
and produce
this normal
market leadership
position
you can't
punish this
behavior
otherwise
if antitrust
if this
antitrust law
is operated
like this
who wants to
innovate
this
antitrust law
in the United States
is actually a
very sensitive
law and sensitive
topic
because
a
accident
may
have a
competitive
market
attitude
and
the aftermath
is actually
very big
because
you may
accidentally
punish
the right
person
if you
punish
the right
person
so
I
personally
think
Taiwan
can't
judge
antitrust
so soon
the reason
is here
I
want to
share
with
you
I
don't
know
if
this
is
good or
not
but
I
think
it's
worth
talking
about
since
there are
so many
people
in this
industry
and
why
they are
punished
you have
to give
a
legitimate
reason
the
United
States
is a
public
country
so
this
thing
has not
been
judged
even
as I
said
the red
case is
still
illegal
so
it has
legal
risk
under
this
legal
risk
why
will
it
continue
to
implement
this
bundle
rebate
this is
our
cooperation
paper
to
use
so-called
competition
theory
model to
do
that
this is
from him
I
will briefly
introduce
you
can leave
me a
message
to me
and
I will
explain
not
explain
is that
I will
ask my
friends
and see if
I can
answer
this
question
and
then
we will
see what
we see
in the
model and
then we
will
say
maybe
behind these
models
what kind
of behavior
is possible
so
this
model is
such a
situation
and
from the
business
point of
view
and
MD
cry
ah
yes
MD
cry
ok
MD
does not seem to
be within
this
range of
modern
chip
ok
so
he
I do not know
MD
is not really
doing
modern
chip
may not
have
ok
not at all
in the
patent
so
I just
simply talk about
this math
we use
some of the
math because
we just
finished listening to
our story
so
listen to
our story
after
these
mathematical
model
assumptions
I think
it should
not be
very complicated
ok
first of all
we design
this game
for the
theory of
game
so
this game
is divided into
the so-called
exotic and
non-exotic
ok
ah
exotic
I will explain
to you
that is
as I just
said
this
friend
problem
is the
so-called
price
problem
that
why
will have
friend
you think
reasonable
I think
unreasonable
ok
you provide me
inside
the
price
sales
price
should be
included
patent price
ah
ok
this is a bit
tricky
I say
again
is
Apple
will think
you
provide
me
modern
chip
ok
you
this is a
price
say
when
you
give me
a patent
patent
law
there is a
basic concept
that I simply
emphasize
this
you do not have
a patent
law
concept
is that
once
my
product
contains
my patent
together
sold out
if
this
thing
again
bought by
the
patent
sold to me
he put
this
patent
price
sold to me
why
Foxconn
to be
pulled
once more
wool ah
right
course
do not
use
the core
concept
is
the
concept
is
that
he will
have
this
controversy
is because
that
high school of course
think that
I do not
authorize you
or say I
sell you
a patent
that I
contain
only a small
part of my
patent
patent
combination
there are many
patents
you did not
use
so you have
to pay
extra
money
that everyone
should understand
it
is
why we
design
some of
this
game
because
I originally
give you
this
modern
chip
should be
all the
prices
include
patent
prices
this is
Apple's
idea
that
Qualcomm
do not
think so
Qualcomm
think that
I only
give you a
part of
you have
a lot of
money
why he dare
talk about this
condition
because he dare
say you
even if I
supply you
modern chip
I have other patents
you have not
used so you
have to pay more
money
that is not
gone
this is the
so-called
one-stage
non-exhaustive
non-exhaustive
this will
mean that
a game
exhaustive
contract
game
it is based on
Apple's
two-stage game
this is interesting
we will go to
two stages
of two stages
to run
this model
this game
3 model
that
inside the game
exhaustive
we just mentioned
that
because
this Apple
thinks
you give me
modern chip
is all
all
include all
patents
price
OK
because it
includes all
patents
price
100%
non-exhaustive
that
may be
because
this high-speed
he thought
that
the patent
inside the
modern chip
is only
part of me
OK
so
I
I have
many other
patents
have not
given you
so
I
also add
this money
there is
the whole
technology
this is
I think
Apple to pay
what is
Apple
to pay
the whole
market value
value
is not just
cheap
OK
so
this model
in
price
is the
P
above
the basic
method of
calculation
of
this
base
is not
the same
OK
that
in
how much
percentage
to calculate
but it
is not
supposed to
use the
whole
market
price
to calculate
OK
this is
our two
different
game
his
calculation
price
P
this
price
above
is not
the same
that
came
two
stages
in
the
first
stage
I
know
that
this
is a
very interesting
point
in
Qualcomm's
complaint
is that
I do not
know if
one
year
or
one
year
one
year
one
year
I
forgot
which
device
I
started
complaining
about
is because
Apple
but it
breaks the
rule
went to
Apple
will not accept
the
Bundle Rebate
and
Core Comp
most important
role
it
is there a reason
to provide
this rebate
is our basic
GAP
and
that
math model
we have a few
assumptions
are actually
based on our
story
so actually
quite intuitive
first
we assume
it is a
very
market
quality
and
higher than
Intel
in the first
stage
should be able to
understand
the
recent years
so
that
and
these
Apple
Apple
and
Qualcomm
these
are actually
a
standard
for their
companies
is that
I want to
get the
third
it
is that
we play
the game
a bit like
Apple is a
follower
because Apple
it did not produce
the so-called
modern chip
it did not
create a
modern chip
so
it is a
bit like
this game
is the
first
Qualcomm
it provides
a contract
which
includes
Bundle
Rebate
so
we play the game
is that
Apple accept
or not
accept
it
for Qualcomm
what is its
profit
and
what is the
profit of
Apple
does not
accept
Qualcomm's
profit
how to
change
Apple's
profit
how to
change
so
we use
this
Pi
to
game
is a
game
is
the
game
that
is
the
game
this
game
is
the
game
that
is
a
game
that
is
a
game
so
we
use
this
game
with
that
game
so
let's
say
if
we
say
if
galaxy
part
is
a
game
that
is
a
screen
over
the
screen
so
a
game
is
a
screen
that
a
is
a
screen
that
a
screen
over
the
screen
so
when
the
game
is
a
part
of
it
we
say
when
the

is so
long
so

it's
a
