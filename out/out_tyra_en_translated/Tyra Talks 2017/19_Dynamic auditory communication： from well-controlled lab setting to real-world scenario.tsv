0	20500	So after I graduated from university, I think I did an RA, if I remember correctly, at Professor Chen's place, right?
20500	26500	I did it for a year or two
27500	34500	After that, I went to Canada's McMaster to study for my PhD
34500	40500	When I was studying for my PhD, one of the tutors was Dr. Trenner
40500	47500	He was doing a course on music perception and intuition
47500	55500	If you're interested, you can ask him why he chose to do music
55500	58500	or intuition and cognition
58500	64500	I don't know much about intuition, but my impression is that
64500	68500	doing visual psychology takes up a large portion of the work
68500	72500	So why did I decide to do intuition? I think it's interesting
76500	80500	I don't know, it's just my guess
80500	84500	Yongyi has a website, you can go check it out, it's really scary
84500	88500	The publications are as long as ghosts
88500	93500	Other than the publications, there's also awards and media coverage
93500	95500	I think that's really cool
95500	98500	I hope one day I can tell my parents that I'm a journalist
98500	104500	Without further ado, let's welcome Yongyi to share his research with us
105500	110500	I'll turn off my mic so you can hear me
110500	113500	Can you hear me now?
113500	115500	I think it's okay
115500	118500	I'm a little shy
118500	120500	I don't even know if I have to give a score
120500	123500	Today is July 8th, I'm guessing my highest score is 87
123500	125500	I can't go any higher
125500	127500	That's about it
127500	129500	I can predict the results
130500	134500	You have to turn on the audio so you can hear the laughter
134500	137500	I don't think there's any feedback
137500	139500	I think we need feedback
139500	141500	Forget it
141500	143500	It's pretty funny
143500	146500	I'm being encouraged, I'm indeed a person who studies truth psychology
146500	148500	It's different
148500	151500	I'm probably just making things up
152500	156500	I'm not really interested in hearing
156500	159500	There's no deep reason
159500	162500	First of all, I'm very interested in music
162500	165500	I only found out later that most people do visual research
165500	167500	Most people talk about intuition
167500	170500	It's directly implied that it's visual research
170500	172500	I only found out later
172500	174500	If you're doing hearing research
174500	176500	You have to say it's particularly famous for auditory
176500	178500	Otherwise people will get it wrong
178500	180500	It's pretty interesting
180500	183500	I think there are some phenomena in hearing
183500	187500	It's different when it comes to other senses
187500	191500	There are some special problems to deal with
191500	193500	I think that's what makes hearing interesting
193500	195500	It's a special place
195500	199500	Okay, let's get into my presentation
199500	202500	I'm going to start studying how to share my screen
205500	207500	Okay, while you're studying
207500	209500	Let me tell you
209500	212500	Just in case there's feedback
212500	214500	Let me turn off the microphone
214500	217500	If you have anything you want to say
217500	220500	You can type it in
220500	223500	You can also speak
223500	224500	Okay
224500	225500	Okay
225500	227500	Let's go
227500	229500	Okay
229500	234500	My PhD research topic is
234500	238500	It's very vague
238500	240500	Dynamic Auditory Communication
240500	242500	It's vague
242500	244500	It's about how to change your hearing
244500	247500	In a dynamic situation
247500	250500	How to change your hearing
250500	253500	In a dynamic situation
253500	255500	This includes
255500	257500	For example, you're listening to me now
257500	259500	All my voices change at any time
259500	261500	For example, every time I make a sound
261500	262500	There's a millisecond
262500	264500	And then it disappears
264500	265500	Or listening to music
265500	267500	It's kind of like that
267500	268500	And then
268500	271500	And what I want to share today is
271500	272500	My experiment
272500	274500	From a traditional laboratory
274500	275500	Psychological laboratory
275500	277500	And then do it
277500	279500	More complicated
279500	281500	We think it's closer to the real
281500	282500	Interaction
282500	284500	Under the environment of human interaction
284500	285500	That is
285500	288500	From a small laboratory to a large laboratory
288500	289500	Between each other
289500	291500	There are some research methods
291500	293500	Needs to be adjusted
293500	296500	And then I just want to explain today
296500	298500	Take our research as an example
298500	301500	How do we do this
301500	302500	So my sub-topic is
302500	304500	How do psychologists do research
304500	306500	And there is a step-by-step explanation
306500	307500	Explain
307500	309500	What are the problems we encounter
309500	310500	And then
310500	311500	We think
311500	312500	In our situation
312500	313500	How do we solve it
313500	314500	And then
314500	315500	By the way
315500	316500	Just
316500	317500	Just
317500	318500	Please help everyone
318500	320500	The place is
320500	321500	September
321500	323500	Taiwan's Science and Music Magazine
323500	324500	There will be a
324500	327500	A special special issue of music psychology
327500	328500	And then
330500	331500	I want to put this
331500	332500	Related research
332500	333500	It's a draft
333500	334500	Go over there
334500	335500	As a
335500	336500	A small topic
336500	337500	Just share it
337500	339500	Just as a science book
339500	341500	Share it to readers in Taiwan
341500	343500	Then I didn't write it myself
343500	345500	The experience of doing a science book article
345500	346500	Then if I hope
346500	347500	That is to say
348500	350500	I hope to make today's speech
350500	351500	Into different fields
351500	352500	People interested in science
352500	353500	Can probably
353500	354500	Psychologists
354500	355500	How do we do research
355500	356500	Especially in
356500	357500	How do we do research
357500	358500	In such a special situation
358500	359500	If you think
359500	360500	On the content
360500	361500	Or how to explain
361500	363500	How can it be adjusted better
363500	364500	That is
364500	366500	I hope you can tell me
366500	367500	Then
367500	368500	I will
368500	370500	I'm going to take the exam in two weeks
370500	371500	So thank you very much
371500	373500	If there is any help
373500	374500	OK
374500	375500	it is good
375500	377500	The nonsense should be over
377500	379500	First of all, I want to say
379500	381500	Hearing has many domains
381500	382500	Like for example
382500	384500	You can know if the pitch is high or low
384500	386500	What I want to focus on today is
386500	387500	Focus on time
387500	388500	For hearing
388500	390500	Is a very important thing
390500	392500	In fact, time is for many senses
392500	394500	And the reaction is very important
394500	395500	For hearing
395500	397500	I think it is especially critical
397500	398500	Why
398500	400500	If you record my voice
400500	401500	Then take it to
401500	402500	In the software of the computer
402500	403500	Open it
403500	404500	Look at its radio
404500	405500	Its radio
405500	406500	It looks like
406500	407500	Almost like this
407500	408500	Then you can of course
408500	409500	Decode
409500	410500	That is to say
410500	412500	What is my voice
412500	413500	Then
413500	414500	Our hearing is
414500	415500	We have to put it together
415500	417500	To become a meaningful sentence
417500	418500	Ah
418500	419500	But it's hard for hearing
419500	420500	That is to say
420500	421500	Every message
421500	424500	The time it appears is so short
424500	425500	And
425500	427500	It won't appear again
427500	428500	Ah
428500	429500	Human beings have lived for so long
429500	430500	History
430500	431500	The history of human communication
431500	432500	Before the recorder was invented
432500	433500	We have no chance
433500	435500	Listen again
435500	436500	What happened before
436500	437500	How is it
437500	438500	So human hearing
438500	439500	A big problem
439500	440500	That is to say
440500	442500	We have to be able to catch it quickly
442500	443500	Ah
443500	444500	This message is displayed at any time
444500	446500	And then accurately
446500	447500	Awareness
447500	448500	Feel it accurately
448500	449500	The content of this
449500	450500	Then
450500	451500	And another
451500	452500	More demanding is
452500	453500	That is
453500	455500	We are not just aware of this
455500	456500	And we have to
456500	457500	Make a quick response
457500	458500	For example
458500	460500	When you have a conversation with others
460500	461500	What are you hearing
461500	462500	You will be able to understand immediately
462500	463500	Then immediately
463500	464500	Be able to react
464500	465500	Then this skill
465500	466500	When quarreling
466500	467500	It's particularly important
467500	468500	Because if you slow down
468500	469500	If you slow down
469500	470500	You lost the quarrel
470500	471500	It's very
471500	472500	It's important to speak
472500	473500	Right
473500	474500	So you see
474500	475500	Human beings are like this
475500	476500	No, I'm kidding
476500	477500	That
477500	478500	Not only in conversation
478500	479500	In another situation
479500	480500	For example, you are listening to music
480500	481500	Ah
481500	483500	And for example, you are with
483500	484500	You sing with others
484500	485500	Ah
485500	486500	Sing together
486500	487500	That
487500	489500	I can't just listen to other people's music
489500	490500	Listen to this
490500	491500	I'm going to
491500	493500	Sing my part
493500	494500	Because you are like this
494500	495500	No matter how fast your processing speed is
495500	497500	There must be a time difference inside
497500	498500	That
498500	499500	Ah
499500	500500	So
500500	502500	In fact, in many cases of hearing
502500	503500	We think it is
503500	504500	He keeps
504500	505500	Keep predicting
505500	507500	What's going to happen next
507500	509500	Then let people
509500	510500	Always
510500	511500	Let your intuition
511500	512500	Let your nervous response
512500	513500	Always in a
513500	514500	In a well-prepared situation
514500	515500	Then you can
515500	517500	Precise intuition to this matter
517500	518500	And then
518500	520500	Quickly prepared
520500	522500	To make the next reaction
522500	524500	So I think hearing is on time
524500	525500	Ah
525500	527500	In fact, compared to other sensory domains
527500	528500	Is
528500	529500	More demanding
529500	530500	This is
530500	531500	My task
531500	533500	So I think time is very important to hearing
533500	534500	Ok
534500	535500	If you have any questions
535500	536500	You can interrupt me in the middle
536500	537500	Then if there is no problem
537500	538500	I will continue
538500	539500	Then
539500	540500	By the way because I
540500	541500	Now
541500	543500	I share the screen
543500	544500	So if everyone
544500	545500	If you leave a message in the chat
545500	547500	I should not be able to see it now
547500	548500	So everyone can
548500	549500	Just turn on the microphone
549500	551500	It has nothing to do with me
551500	552500	Ok
552500	553500	Ah
553500	554500	I have a question
554500	555500	Ok
556500	557500	Please say
557500	558500	The
558500	561500	The M-I-N-G-E-R above the waveform
561500	562500	What is that?
563500	565500	Oh, that's just an example I found on the Internet
566500	568500	I don't know what that is
568500	569500	Sorry
569500	570500	Ok
570500	571500	Ok, thank you
572500	574500	It should be a project title
575500	576500	Yes
576500	577500	It looks like this
577500	578500	But I don't know
578500	580500	I haven't searched either
582500	583500	Alright
583500	584500	Maybe it's doing something
584500	585500	Voice
585500	586500	Voice of the computer
586500	589500	Some of the projects handled by the visual
589500	590500	I don't know
590500	591500	Sorry
591500	593500	Then I will talk about it first
593500	595500	In traditional psychology and neuroscience
595500	598500	How do we do this kind of research in the lab
598500	599500	If we want to know
599500	600500	What is the importance of time for hearing
600500	602500	How do we do research
602500	603500	For example
603500	604500	I
604500	605500	I will
605500	608500	Design a series of hearing with a computer
608500	610500	A series of hearing that opens at any time
610500	611500	Then for example
611500	612500	Then for example
612500	613500	I can
613500	614500	A kind of audio file
614500	615500	I put it
615500	616500	Every note
616500	617500	Bop, bop, bop
617500	618500	All time
618500	620500	Every bop, bop, bop
620500	621500	Between each tone
621500	623500	Its time is fixed
623500	624500	The same length
624500	626500	For example, it's 500 milliseconds
626500	627500	So this way you
627500	629500	It sounds like a decoder
629500	631500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
631500	633500	Then you can keep going
633500	634500	So this
634500	636500	This is a very regular time
636500	637500	Then you can have a
637500	639500	An irregular time
639500	640500	For example, it's
640500	641500	Between your pain and pain
641500	642500	Can be
642500	643500	For example
643500	644500	Random 250 milliseconds
644500	645500	Between 750 milliseconds
645500	646500	So it might sound like this
646500	649500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
649500	650500	Just
650500	651500	You don't know at all
651500	652500	You
652500	654500	When will the next pain appear
654500	655500	And then
655500	657500	In this different
657500	658500	Under the circumstances
658500	659500	We can
659500	661500	Require the audience to do some
661500	663500	Intuitive answer
663500	665500	For example, we can make
665500	667500	Some of them have sounds
667500	668500	Most of these sounds
668500	670500	Most of them are exactly the same
670500	671500	There are some sounds
671500	672500	Maybe we'll just make it
672500	674500	It's a little bit higher or a little bit lower
674500	676500	We're on the frequency domain
676500	677500	To make some adjustments
677500	678500	And then the audience
678500	679500	Just
679500	680500	To participate in the experiment
680500	682500	The college student has to listen to that sound
682500	683500	If he hears a higher pitch
683500	684500	He'll press a button
684500	685500	If you hear a lower pitch
685500	686500	Just press a button
686500	687500	It sounds like
687500	689500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
689500	691500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
691500	692500	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
692500	693500	You have to listen to the higher pitch
693500	694500	You have to react
694500	695500	And then the other
695500	696500	Under the circumstances of irregular time
696500	698500	You can also do this kind of manipulation
698500	699500	And then we can go and see
699500	700500	For example
700500	702500	Under the circumstances of regular time
702500	703500	The correct rate of his answer
703500	704500	It's going to be higher
704500	706500	Under the circumstances of irregular time
706500	707500	Then we can
707500	708500	Psychologists usually say
708500	710500	Oh, that's the regular time
710500	712500	It can help you
712500	713500	Have a better sense
713500	715500	Because you're better
716500	718500	Because your accuracy is higher
718500	720500	You can have a more accurate answer
720500	722500	In this case
722500	723500	We can also do some
723500	725500	Neuroscientific measurements
725500	728500	For example, I can measure people's brainwaves
728500	730500	This is a memory map
730500	732500	It's because of the nervous response of the brain
732500	733500	The nervous response of the brain
733500	734500	It's all about the nerve
734500	736500	It's all about the neurotransmitter
736500	737500	To do the reaction
737500	738500	Then we can put those
738500	740500	For example, the ECG map
740500	742500	Or the sensors for measuring muscle position
742500	743500	We'll put it on the scalp
744500	745500	That's because of the nerve response
745500	747500	It's going to be that wave signal
747500	748500	It's going to come out
748500	750500	So we can put it on the surface of the scalp
750500	751500	Record this signal
751500	752500	That's what we call it
752500	755500	The signal of the brainwaves
755500	757500	Then we can do some corresponding analysis
757500	759500	We can see that the brainwaves are
759500	762500	How to capture the regularity of this time
762500	763500	And then for example
763500	765500	Let's do some complicated processing
765500	766500	And then we'll get
766500	767500	Something like this
767500	768500	The answer is
768500	770500	We'll find out, for example
770500	771500	The brainwave
771500	774500	It's going to adjust the speed of its vibration
774500	776500	It's the same as the external stimulus
776500	778500	And then we just have to catch this
778500	779500	In the brain
779500	780500	Imagine the nerve in the brain
780500	781500	It's like a decoder
781500	783500	It's going to be able to accurately capture
783500	785500	How to produce the next second
785500	787500	That's the traditional neuroscience
787500	788500	Or psychologically
788500	790500	We're going to do this
790500	792500	A study of orientation
792500	794500	But this study is actually quite
794500	796500	OK, please go ahead
796500	798500	That's your time
798500	799500	That's the frequency
799500	801500	That cycle
801500	803500	How short can it be
804500	806500	You mean the cycle of my voice
806500	808500	Or the cycle of the brainwaves
808500	810500	The cycle of the voice
810500	812500	And then there's the brainwaves
812500	813500	You're going to adjust it
813500	815500	If it's the same as your external
815500	817500	Does it have a limit
818500	820500	This is a good question
820500	822500	Usually humans can catch the beat
822500	826500	The shortest is the shortest between pain and pain
826500	827500	It's 200 milliseconds
828500	830500	I can't sing so fast
830500	832500	It's about the same speed
832500	834500	More than 200 milliseconds
834500	835500	You probably think
835500	837500	It's almost a continuous sound
837500	838500	That's the slowest
838500	840500	It's the longest between pain and pain
840500	844500	It can be as long as 1,200 milliseconds
844500	845500	1.2 seconds
845500	847500	After that
847500	849500	You'll feel like every sound is independent
849500	852500	You don't think it's a continuous rhythm
852500	853500	You just can't
853500	855500	Know the pattern
855500	857500	What's interesting is that the brainwaves
857500	859500	Can only catch up
859500	861500	Such a speed range
861500	863500	It's slower than this
863500	864500	Or faster than this
864500	866500	There's no way
866500	868500	As for what causes what
868500	869500	I don't know
869500	871500	It's because the brain can't move so fast
871500	872500	Move so slow
872500	873500	To make us instinctively
873500	874500	Can't catch up so fast
874500	875500	Such a slow speed
875500	876500	I don't know
876500	877500	I can only say
877500	880500	This is what we have now
881500	882500	Thank you
882500	884500	Hello
884500	886500	So I'd like to ask
886500	888500	When you do this experiment
888500	889500	Do you have to eliminate
889500	892500	Other noise interference?
892500	893500	That's right
893500	895500	We do this kind of experiment
895500	896500	Because we want to be clean
896500	898500	So we do it in the soundproof room
898500	900500	And then we'll use headphones
900500	902500	That is, we'll use those
902500	903500	More special headphones
903500	905500	Just send the sound
905500	906500	Into the ear
906500	908500	And it's very close
908500	909500	The more inside, the better
909500	911500	And then the sound is transmitted
911500	912500	It's all very clean
912500	913500	I just want to reduce
913500	915500	External interference
915500	916500	That's right
916500	917500	So when you say
917500	918500	The so-called hearing
918500	920500	It means
920500	921500	Human beings
921500	922500	We can really
922500	923500	The sound we hear
923500	925500	Or include that
925500	926500	Include that
926500	927500	The frequency we can't hear
927500	929500	It's also in the hearing
929500	931500	For example, ultrasonic waves or
931500	933500	Very low frequency
933500	934500	That kind
934500	936500	That kind of hearing
936500	937500	That kind
937500	938500	That's what you're asking
938500	939500	That is to say
939500	940500	Physical stimulation
940500	942500	Does it stimulate psychological feelings?
942500	944500	That's what we say
944500	946500	Will ask questions like this
946500	947500	Of course
947500	948500	Of course there are people
948500	949500	Study such a question
949500	950500	That is to say
950500	951500	Where is the limit of human hearing?
951500	952500	Then you can see
952500	954500	Where is the limit of frequency?
954500	955500	But this is not me
955500	956500	Today
956500	959500	Is the main part of the discussion
959500	961500	Maybe we'll wait
961500	964500	Discuss again later
964500	965500	Like this
965500	966500	I don't know if it's like this
966500	967500	Or just
967500	968500	You can discuss it casually
968500	969500	No no no
969500	970500	Because of me
970500	971500	I'm more curious
971500	972500	When you say you want to eradicate
972500	973500	That interference
973500	975500	When noise interference
975500	977500	That's how you eradicate that kind
977500	978500	We don't know at all
978500	980500	The kind of interference we hear
980500	982500	For example, like ultrasonic waves
982500	984500	You are in that
984500	985500	What is that called
985500	986500	There is no noise at all
986500	987500	That kind of interference
987500	988500	In that kind of experimental environment
988500	990500	You can't guarantee
990500	993500	He won't be affected by the outside world
993500	994500	OK OK OK
994500	995500	Then I know
996500	998500	Of course we
998500	1000500	What we do is
1000500	1001500	We already know
1001500	1003500	Human hearing frequency range
1003500	1005500	It's about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz
1005500	1007500	In the frequency range of this Hz
1007500	1009500	We
1009500	1011500	In fact, in the experimental environment
1011500	1012500	Can still measure
1012500	1013500	In the case of measurement
1013500	1015500	We will make a comparison
1015500	1017500	As for ultrasonic waves
1017500	1019500	We generally think it's human
1019500	1021500	Physically, you can't hear it
1021500	1023500	So
1023500	1025500	So we don't care about his control
1025500	1027500	So for example
1027500	1028500	There is an ultrasonic wave in the lab
1028500	1031500	The sound of the ultrasonic wave
1031500	1033500	Or that kind of very, very, very high frequency
1033500	1035500	We don't care
1035500	1037500	So it's based on an assumption
1037500	1039500	Those things won't cause
1039500	1041500	It won't cause too much interference to humans
1041500	1043500	Yes, it really won't
1043500	1044500	And the other thing is
1044500	1046500	In the case of our experiments
1046500	1047500	We don't say
1047500	1049500	One condition is to make a trial
1049500	1051500	Of course we will do hundreds of trials
1051500	1052500	Thousands of trials
1052500	1053500	Even if there is an effect
1053500	1055500	As long as it is with your experiment
1055500	1057500	The program set by the computer
1057500	1059500	If it's not related to each other
1059500	1061500	Then the effect we observe
1061500	1064500	These external effects
1064500	1066500	It should be reduced a lot
1066500	1068500	OK, thank you
1068500	1070500	Then
1070500	1071500	Hey, copy it
1071500	1072500	That is to say
1072500	1074500	What about this POP process
1074500	1076500	Of course you can decide for yourself
1076500	1078500	See if you want to say
1078500	1080500	To accept the middle question
1080500	1081500	Or ask at the end
1081500	1082500	Or open the discussion directly
1082500	1083500	You can decide
1083500	1084500	Then but
1084500	1085500	That is
1085500	1086500	We
1086500	1088500	The prediction is that you can
1088500	1090500	You can talk for about an hour
1090500	1091500	And then
1091500	1094500	There will probably be a 20-minute discussion
1094500	1095500	Ah
1095500	1096500	That's it
1096500	1097500	As for you
1097500	1098500	Cut it in half
1098500	1099500	Or mixed together
1099500	1100500	How do you decide
1100500	1101500	Just decide for yourself
1101500	1102500	OK OK OK
1102500	1103500	OK
1103500	1104500	Let me tell you first
1104500	1106500	I actually didn't prepare a lot of POP
1106500	1108500	I only prepared about 18 pages
1108500	1109500	So
1109500	1111500	So the topic part will be finished in a moment
1111500	1112500	if
1112500	1113500	Um
1113500	1114500	Some related topics
1114500	1116500	Of course I'm sorry
1116500	1117500	I just didn't know
1117500	1118500	What's your problem
1118500	1121500	If it's related to listening or other music
1121500	1123500	We can wait until then to discuss
1123500	1125500	If this is related to the topic I'm talking about
1125500	1126500	Of course we'll put it up
1126500	1127500	Discussed at the scene
1127500	1128500	Sorry I just didn't know
1128500	1129500	Your question
1129500	1131500	With this
1131500	1132500	What I'm talking about now
1132500	1133500	What are the links
1133500	1136500	OK
1136500	1137500	OK
1137500	1138500	That
1138500	1139500	But
1139500	1141500	OK, I'll keep going
1141500	1144500	I think the biggest problem in doing laboratory research
1144500	1145500	That is to say
1145500	1146500	If we want to understand
1146500	1147500	Between people
1147500	1148500	How to use it normally
1148500	1150500	For example, interact with listening messages
1150500	1152500	But in fact, the time law and the time law
1152500	1153500	These two messages
1153500	1154500	I experiment
1154500	1156500	I make this kind of message in the computer
1156500	1158500	It doesn't exist in the natural world
1158500	1159500	You naturally
1159500	1160500	You won't hear one
1160500	1162500	It's as accurate as a decoder
1162500	1163500	You won't hear one
1163500	1165500	It's a completely random message
1165500	1166500	You usually hear
1166500	1167500	A little regular
1167500	1169500	But there is no such regular message
1169500	1171500	If I do research like this
1171500	1172500	In the end for understanding
1172500	1173500	My human
1173500	1175500	What is the real ability to help
1175500	1178500	In fact, sometimes it is a bit biased
1178500	1180500	So
1180500	1182500	In fact, there is a very interesting paper
1182500	1183500	Just released recently
1183500	1185500	It's called Neuroscience Needs Behavior
1185500	1187500	If you are related
1187500	1188500	Philosophy
1188500	1190500	If you are interested in scientific philosophy
1190500	1192500	I highly recommend this paper
1192500	1193500	Then I will use it first
1193500	1194500	A few pictures inside
1194500	1195500	To talk about
1195500	1196500	This research
1196500	1197500	The limitations of laboratory research
1197500	1198500	Generally, we want to know
1198500	1200500	Research can be said
1200500	1203500	For example, the neural pattern of the human brain
1203500	1206500	What is the relationship between natural behavior
1206500	1208500	Then you can take the neural pattern
1208500	1209500	As
1209500	1210500	For example, the psychological journey
1210500	1211500	Psychological journey
1211500	1213500	Psychological inner journey
1213500	1215500	This is what we want to know
1215500	1216500	That one
1216500	1218500	A better designed ideal experiment is
1218500	1220500	We can control
1220500	1222500	We know which part of the psychological journey
1222500	1223500	Or neural reaction
1223500	1226500	Corresponding to some of our natural behaviors
1226500	1227500	We can have one-to-one
1227500	1229500	Is a one-to-one correspondence
1229500	1231500	Or a simpler correspondence
1231500	1233500	But like the experiment we just did
1233500	1234500	In fact, the experiment just now
1234500	1236500	Is the experiment I did
1236500	1237500	I did it myself
1237500	1238500	Um
1238500	1239500	We
1239500	1241500	I actually designed an experiment
1241500	1242500	Human
1242500	1243500	In general
1243500	1245500	A situation that would not happen at all
1245500	1248500	Then we are studying his neural reaction
1248500	1249500	Although we can know
1249500	1251500	The relationship between these
1251500	1253500	But we can't answer directly
1253500	1255500	What is human nature
1255500	1256500	How
1256500	1257500	We can't answer
1257500	1259500	Human natural reaction
1259500	1261500	So what we know is that some humans
1261500	1263500	Supernormal ability
1263500	1264500	It's beyond his usual ability
1264500	1265500	but
1265500	1267500	Our main research topic
1267500	1269500	In fact, there is no direct understanding
1269500	1270500	This is what I think the lab is studying
1270500	1272500	Some big limitations
1272500	1274500	Especially in other areas
1274500	1275500	There is such a situation
1275500	1276500	For example
1276500	1278500	If you want to manipulate social interaction
1278500	1279500	You are in a very small lab
1279500	1280500	Basically can't do this
1280500	1281500	Because our lab
1281500	1283500	It basically looks like this
1283500	1284500	Just one person
1284500	1286500	Sitting in a small partition
1286500	1287500	Because we have to
1287500	1288500	Like I just said
1288500	1290500	Must control all external stimuli
1290500	1291500	So
1291500	1292500	Usually just sit in there alone
1292500	1293500	In a very quiet situation
1293500	1295500	Interact with the computer
1295500	1297500	And at the same time because
1297500	1298500	Uh
1298500	1300500	The relationship between our measuring tools
1300500	1301500	For example, that
1301500	1302500	Uh that
1302500	1304500	That side brain wave
1304500	1305500	That line
1305500	1306500	Long-term relationship
1306500	1307500	He can only sit there
1307500	1308500	He can't do anything
1308500	1309500	He can only use two fingers
1309500	1310500	Do the reaction
1310500	1311500	So this is actually
1311500	1312500	It's a very unnatural situation
1312500	1313500	That's some
1313500	1315500	Traditional lab environment
1315500	1317500	Some restrictions given
1317500	1318500	OK
1318500	1319500	And here
1319500	1320500	Everyone agrees
1320500	1322500	In fact, there are quite a lot of restrictions
1324500	1325500	Then I
1325500	1326500	What I want to say is
1326500	1327500	Then we
1327500	1329500	In our lab
1329500	1331500	How do we try to go
1331500	1332500	Uh
1332500	1334500	Extend to solve such a barrier
1335500	1336500	Uh
1336500	1337500	What I want to say first is
1337500	1338500	Music
1338500	1340500	It can be a good research tool
1340500	1342500	It can be a research tool
1342500	1343500	As a
1343500	1344500	Uh
1344500	1346500	To help study human mind activity
1346500	1347500	And neural reaction
1347500	1348500	He
1348500	1349500	Uh
1349500	1351500	There are some good ways
1351500	1352500	For example
1352500	1353500	I can keep
1353500	1355500	There is a good experiment
1355500	1356500	For example
1356500	1357500	I today
1357500	1359500	For example, look at this A picture on the left
1359500	1361500	I can ask the subject
1361500	1362500	Ask someone to come in
1362500	1364500	Then I'll give him a recorder
1364500	1365500	I asked him
1365500	1367500	Press the key of the piano
1367500	1369500	Then the speed of pressing is exactly the same as the recorder
1369500	1371500	That's a good one
1371500	1372500	A control experiment
1372500	1373500	And then
1373500	1374500	I can put this
1374500	1376500	The conditions I control are getting more and more relaxed
1376500	1377500	For example
1377500	1379500	I can ask the computer to produce a recorder
1379500	1380500	But this recorder is
1380500	1382500	As you press the key
1382500	1383500	Then he will go
1383500	1384500	Follow your speed
1384500	1386500	To change his own rhythm
1386500	1387500	Uh
1387500	1388500	Or you can say
1388500	1389500	Let two people play together
1389500	1390500	Multiple people play
1390500	1392500	Even when there are multiple people playing
1392500	1393500	You and the audience
1393500	1394500	Listening at the same time
1394500	1395500	That
1395500	1397500	Moving more and more to the right side of the spectrum
1397500	1398500	That's what we're talking about
1398500	1400500	Ecological interaction
1400500	1402500	Ecological validity
1402500	1404500	That is to say, what you are studying
1404500	1406500	Is able to correspond to human beings
1406500	1408500	In the case of real life
1408500	1409500	The right side is
1409500	1410500	We feel
1410500	1412500	More like real life
1412500	1413500	Because when you play music
1413500	1414500	You will also have an audience listening
1414500	1415500	This can be understood
1415500	1417500	But on the right side of the spectrum
1417500	1418500	In fact, your time control
1418500	1419500	It's getting worse and worse
1419500	1421500	For example, when a group of people play music
1421500	1423500	If they decide together
1423500	1424500	Speed up or slow down
1424500	1425500	What do you want
1425500	1426500	This is not for you
1426500	1428500	The experimenter can decide in advance
1428500	1430500	The information you get in the end
1430500	1432500	It will be difficult for you to explain
1432500	1434500	That music
1434500	1435500	Can be a good tool
1435500	1436500	Just because he can
1436500	1439500	Get some kind of balance in the middle
1439500	1441500	For example, when the two of them interact
1441500	1443500	They may not be random
1443500	1445500	Play the music they want
1445500	1446500	I can give him
1446500	1447500	Uh, music score
1447500	1449500	Uh, ask them to play the music score
1449500	1450500	And if they have
1450500	1451500	If you play the music score
1451500	1452500	If they play something wrong
1452500	1453500	In fact, we can
1453500	1454500	Record afterwards
1454500	1456500	To find out about this
1456500	1457500	So we can know
1457500	1458500	What did he do wrong
1458500	1459500	I also know
1459500	1460500	What is the correct answer
1460500	1461500	And we can set
1461500	1462500	That is to say
1462500	1463500	What is the rhythm he wants to play
1463500	1465500	So we still have some control
1465500	1467500	But even under these conditions
1467500	1469500	Their activities
1469500	1470500	Still very close
1470500	1472500	An activity of human real behavior
1472500	1473500	So we think music can be
1473500	1475500	A good tool to study
1475500	1477500	Uh, uh, human interaction
1477500	1479500	That is, hearing communication
1479500	1481500	And it can be balanced
1481500	1483500	That is, experimental control
1483500	1484500	And ecological efficiency
1484500	1486500	These two big questions
1486500	1488500	And another advantage of music is
1488500	1489500	Say
1489500	1490500	Uh
1490500	1492500	You said music is a good research tool
1492500	1493500	The reason is
1493500	1495500	It sounds like it's because he can be
1495500	1497500	That is, he can have this
1497500	1499500	From experimental control
1499500	1501500	To ecological interaction
1501500	1502500	The whole spectrum
1502500	1503500	But then you think
1503500	1504500	What kind of research tool
1504500	1506500	There is no such feature
1506500	1508500	Uh
1508500	1510500	What kind of research tool
1510500	1511500	Language
1511500	1512500	Isn't that right
1512500	1513500	Language
1513500	1514500	Language also has
1514500	1515500	Yeah
1515500	1516500	So I think I don't really understand
1516500	1517500	That's why he's a special
1517500	1518500	Good research tool
1518500	1519500	I didn't say he was particularly good
1519500	1521500	I said he could be a good research tool
1521500	1522500	OK
1522500	1523500	Good
1523500	1525500	So did I get it right this time
1525500	1526500	What you mean is
1526500	1528500	He can span the whole spectrum
1528500	1529500	He can be a
1529500	1530500	He can span the whole spectrum
1530500	1531500	That language is of course
1531500	1533500	You can communicate with the computer
1533500	1534500	Language
1534500	1535500	Or the language between people
1535500	1536500	Communicate with others
1536500	1538500	Yes, language is also a good research tool
1538500	1539500	My language
1539500	1540500	There is a difficulty in neuroscience
1540500	1542500	Because when you want to speak
1542500	1543500	Mouth to move
1543500	1544500	And then actually
1544500	1547500	It's a bit difficult to measure the signal
1547500	1549500	Of course, this is an externalization
1549500	1550500	But I think language is also a
1550500	1552500	Uh, it's a pretty good tool
1552500	1554500	Okay, got it
1554500	1555500	I didn't say music is the best
1555500	1556500	I just said he was one of them
1556500	1557500	And then
1557500	1559500	And the other good thing about music is
1559500	1560500	He
1560500	1562500	Even if it's a special event
1562500	1564500	But actually in each
1564500	1566500	There are music activities in all cultures
1566500	1567500	And humans actually
1567500	1569500	Spend a lot of resources
1569500	1570500	In music activities
1570500	1571500	A lot of time and resources
1571500	1572500	In music activities
1572500	1574500	So, uh, we think
1574500	1575500	Research on music activities
1575500	1576500	In fact, it can also be
1576500	1578500	Uh, it's a reflection of a human being
1578500	1580500	A very basic behavior
1580500	1584500	With a capability
1584500	1585500	OK
1585500	1586500	So
1586500	1589500	So you say music is a good research tool
1589500	1590500	It means
1590500	1592500	For example, you want to measure his brain
1592500	1593500	How does the brain work
1593500	1595500	You just play music for them
1595500	1597500	Is it similar to this
1597500	1599500	Is this a research method
1599500	1600500	Uh, play music for them
1600500	1601500	Or let them
1601500	1603500	Let them play music
1603500	1604500	So that means
1604500	1605500	You can have a
1605500	1606500	A spectrum
1606500	1608500	You can go from the far left
1608500	1609500	Play music for them
1609500	1611500	I've already designed this music in advance
1611500	1613500	It extends all the way to the far right
1613500	1614500	For example, you can
1614500	1615500	Interact with the music
1615500	1616500	For example, if you want to listen to karaoke
1616500	1617500	OK
1617500	1618500	Or if there's no music
1618500	1621500	It's just two people playing music together
1621500	1623500	Oh, good
1623500	1624500	I have a question
1624500	1625500	OK
1625500	1626500	I have a simple question
1626500	1627500	It's like this
1627500	1628500	Uh, because it says here
1628500	1630500	We may start from here
1630500	1631500	More and more
1631500	1632500	More and more about music
1632500	1633500	As a research tool
1633500	1634500	This thing
1634500	1635500	So I want to clarify
1635500	1636500	A simple question
1636500	1637500	That is
1637500	1638500	What we are discussing now is
1638500	1640500	Sound is a good research tool
1640500	1642500	Or music is a certain kind
1642500	1644500	There is a specific
1644500	1645500	Subset
1645500	1647500	In the sound thing
1647500	1648500	Or do we have to discuss
1648500	1650500	Sound is a research tool
1651500	1653500	Uh
1653500	1655500	I would say it's music
1655500	1657500	Because
1657500	1658500	Um
1658500	1660500	If I talk about sound
1660500	1661500	It's just a definition
1661500	1662500	Because
1662500	1664500	Because of the sound
1666500	1667500	Um
1670500	1672500	Can you talk about your question again
1673500	1675500	Yeah, so my question is actually
1675500	1677500	You're talking about music
1677500	1679500	A good research tool
1679500	1680500	What kind of sound
1680500	1681500	Don't you think it's
1681500	1682500	You want to use it as
1682500	1683500	The definition of music
1683500	1684500	Research tool
1684500	1685500	Oh, I understand
1685500	1687500	Oh, um
1687500	1688500	Yeah
1688500	1689500	Uh
1689500	1691500	I forgot to say that
1691500	1692500	In fact, in traditional
1692500	1693500	Research on hearing
1693500	1694500	We will use
1694500	1696500	Computer synthesis
1696500	1698500	That's a very
1698500	1699500	It's like you pick up the phone
1699500	1700500	To hear that kind of sound
1700500	1701500	Or more than that
1701500	1703500	A lot of noise
1703500	1704500	And these things
1704500	1705500	I'm all of us
1705500	1707500	Basic hearing
1707500	1708500	Uh
1708500	1709500	The material used
1709500	1711500	But in general
1711500	1713500	We don't use that kind of material
1713500	1714500	And then we
1714500	1715500	And
1715500	1716500	In addition, that is to say
1716500	1718500	When we study hearing
1718500	1719500	We often present a
1719500	1721500	A completely unchanged sound
1721500	1722500	A completely correct
1722500	1724500	For example, show it for a second
1724500	1725500	But in the case of nature
1725500	1726500	All the sounds
1726500	1727500	It's probably the first time
1727500	1728500	It's gone
1728500	1730500	It won't have the same stimulus
1730500	1731500	Repeat repeat
1731500	1732500	It's been extended to a second
1732500	1733500	So long
1735500	1736500	And music
1736500	1737500	It has another component
1737500	1738500	That is to say it has
1738500	1739500	Uh
1739500	1740500	More social interaction
1740500	1741500	Component
1741500	1742500	It's not just about making a sound
1742500	1744500	It's not just about making it
1744500	1745500	Uh
1745500	1746500	I'll just knock on the table today
1746500	1747500	Make a sound
1747500	1748500	But it's that people will
1748500	1749500	According to your voice
1749500	1751500	And then he has a response
1751500	1753500	And then he makes a new action
1758500	1759500	Did that answer the question
1760500	1761500	There are
1761500	1762500	Thank you
1762500	1763500	OK OK OK
1763500	1764500	OK
1764500	1767500	Everyone's questions are very good
1767500	1768500	That
1768500	1769500	Um
1769500	1770500	In our research example
1770500	1771500	That is to say
1771500	1772500	We want to understand
1772500	1773500	Using music
1773500	1775500	Play as a
1775500	1776500	Model example
1776500	1778500	Is a social interaction model
1778500	1780500	How do we measure cooperation
1780500	1781500	And then we have to understand
1781500	1783500	Is the relationship between the leader and the follower
1783500	1784500	And then we have to
1784500	1786500	What direction to go
1786500	1788500	To do this research
1788500	1789500	Ah, this photo is
1789500	1790500	A photo of our lab
1790500	1791500	And then I just found
1791500	1793500	We had a short film before the lab
1793500	1794500	OK
1794500	1795500	Show it to everyone
1795500	1797500	I hope everyone can hear the sound
1797500	1800500	Uh, there's a two and a half minute introduction
1823500	1825500	Adrian Fung and his colleagues
1825500	1827500	Are fitted with specially designed
1827500	1829500	Caps and sensors
1829500	1830500	Put them in the front of your shirt
1830500	1832500	And wired to monitors
1832500	1834500	That measure their brain activity
1834500	1835500	And heart rate
1835500	1836500	Motion capture cameras
1836500	1838500	Record their movements too
1838500	1840500	Researchers are studying
1840500	1842500	How the musicians communicate
1842500	1844500	With each other during a performance
1844500	1846500	Without using a single word
1846500	1848500	How do they use movements
1848500	1850500	What gestures do the musicians make
1850500	1852500	That make it possible for them to
1852500	1854500	Communicate with each other
1855500	1858500	And to communicate with members of the audience
1858500	1860500	They're all wired up too
1860500	1862500	To study how they respond
1862500	1864500	Physically and emotionally
1864500	1866500	To the performers on stage
1866500	1867500	What's great about this
1867500	1868500	Is it affords us
1868500	1869500	The ability to see
1869500	1871500	How effective we are as communicators
1871500	1874500	The theater is state-of-the-art technology
1874500	1876500	Including a sound system
1876500	1878500	With incredible acoustics
1878500	1880500	Here with just a tap on a tablet
1881500	1883500	I'll make it extremely reverberant in here
1883500	1885500	Sort of like a cathedral
1889500	1891500	The room is transformed
1891500	1893500	A cool feature that serves
1893500	1895500	A wider, more scientific purpose
1895500	1897500	One that could help researchers
1897500	1899500	Design a better hearing aid
1899500	1901500	For the hearing impaired
1901500	1903500	So, ratting
1903500	1905500	Background noise is coming out of all the speakers
1905500	1907500	It's a multi-channel surround mix
1907500	1909500	And then we could test
1909500	1912500	How well does a person with a hearing aid
1912500	1914500	Comprehend speech
1914500	1915500	That's presented to them
1915500	1917500	In an environment like this
1917500	1919500	Instead of in the quiet room
1921500	1922500	But for now
1922500	1924500	Most of the research is focused on music
1924500	1926500	And its therapeutic powers
1926500	1928500	Researchers hope their findings
1928500	1930500	Will uncover how some rhythms
1930500	1932500	Might help an autistic child
1932500	1934500	Or why a musical beat
1934500	1936500	Can improve the gait of a patient
1936500	1938500	With Parkinson's disease
1938500	1940500	To understand
1940500	1942500	What's going on in the brain
1942500	1944500	We need to know how it's done
1944500	1945500	In typical populations
1945500	1947500	Once we understand that
1947500	1949500	And we know that music
1949500	1951500	Can help people with Parkinson's
1951500	1953500	Or we know that music has an effect
1953500	1955500	On children with autism
1955500	1957500	We can start to understand
1957500	1959500	The deep reasons for that
1959500	1961500	And we can perfect
1961500	1963500	The therapies that we give these people
1963500	1965500	And add to mounting evidence
1965500	1967500	That music is good medicine
1967500	1969500	For the brain

2714600	2734600	Cass Rose, Cobain
2735600	2739600	But this is only an obvious effect in non-seeing.
2739600	2741600	So it represents visual experience,
2741600	2744600	which may create some noise,
2744600	2748600	which makes it more difficult not to be followed,
2748600	2750600	not to be affected by followers.
2750600	2752600	Of course, this needs to be replicated.
2752600	2754600	This is a small difference.
2754600	2756600	Or did you analyze the interaction?
2756600	2758600	Did you find it?
2758600	2760600	Sorry, I don't want to talk about it.
2760600	2764600	So there's no difference between the two white bars
2764600	2766600	and the two dark gray bars.
2766600	2768600	Is there a difference?
2768600	2770600	Did you analyze it?
2770600	2772600	No, I looked at all the interactions.
2772600	2774600	Okay, thanks.
2774600	2776600	You're welcome.
2776600	2780600	We actually replicated this,
2780600	2784600	but the difference between the two dark gray bars
2784600	2788600	and the FF didn't show up in the replication.
2788600	2790600	That's a shame.
2790600	2794600	So we didn't explain much in the paper.
2794600	2798600	I don't know why.
2798600	2800600	But we found that
2800600	2804600	the body movement can reflect the direction of information transmission.
2804600	2807600	But it's not very interesting.
2807600	2809600	What does this have to do with playing music?
2809600	2811600	It's just a bunch of people moving around in the studio.
2811600	2813600	It's just who moves first and who moves last.
2813600	2817600	After they played each song,
2817600	2820600	we asked the musicians to use a quantity table
2820600	2823600	to evaluate how well they played.
2823600	2826600	We asked them to evaluate three items.
2826600	2828600	What is the overall quality of the performance?
2828600	2830600	1 to 5 points.
2830600	2833600	Is the synchronization of time synchronized?
2833600	2836600	Is there a difference in the difficulty of cooperation?
2836600	2843600	Then we compared it with the quantity of Granger Casualty.
2844600	2849600	We found that the X axis is very good,
2849600	2850600	the right side is very good,
2850600	2852600	and the left side is very bad.
2852600	2853600	The Y axis is...
2853600	2854600	I wrote Casual Density.
2854600	2857600	Basically, it's the total amount of information exchanged
2857600	2859600	by the whole system.
2859600	2862600	We found that the quality of the performance
2862600	2866600	and the quantity of Casual Density and the amount of information exchange
2866600	2870600	and the coupling of body movements are related.
2870600	2873600	The synchronization of time is also related.
2873600	2876600	However, in the second time replication,
2876600	2878600	only the overall quality of the performance is related.
2878600	2882600	In other words, the amount of information transfer...
2882600	2886600	The body movement does not only reflect the direction of information transfer.
2886600	2888600	The amount of information transfer
2888600	2892600	seems to reflect the quality of cooperation.
2892600	2896600	To sum up, what did we learn?
2896600	2899600	We learned that in multi-person cooperation,
2899600	2903600	we can observe the direction of information transfer from body movements.
2903600	2907600	Even if this is a homework based on hearing and action,
2907600	2910600	it seems that it is also an important communication channel
2910600	2913600	whether you can see each other visually or not.
2913600	2915600	The overall amount of information flow
2915600	2919600	and the amount of information activity obtained by measuring body movements
2919600	2921600	can reflect the quality of cooperation.
2921600	2925600	In fact, these three points...
2925600	2927600	For everyone, if you don't do research,
2927600	2928600	you can probably guess the result.
2928600	2931600	We think the biggest value is that
2931600	2934600	we provide a low-threshold research method.
2934600	2937600	You don't have to observe in our lab.
2937600	2940600	You can observe in any natural situation.
2940600	2942600	You can observe each other's body movements
2942600	2945600	through imaging analysis.
2945600	2947600	You may be able to observe the group behavior
2947600	2949600	between people in natural situations.
2949600	2952600	We just prove that this effect exists
2952600	2955600	in a well-controlled lab.
2955600	2957600	It should be an effective index.
2957600	2959600	I think that
2959600	2962600	if the following researchers want to study
2962600	2964600	complex social behaviors,
2964600	2969600	at least they have a tool to use.
2969600	2971600	I have a question.
2971600	2972600	I'm sorry.
2972600	2977600	I don't quite understand the second and third points.
2978600	2980600	I thought the result is that
2980600	2982600	if they are facing each other,
2982600	2984600	they can't see each other.
2984600	2986600	The result is still the same.
2986600	2987600	Yes, it is.
2987600	2990600	But the effect is weaker.
2990600	2993600	There is a main effect.
2993600	2995600	Simple main effect is that
2995600	3000600	in the direction of leader to follower,
3000600	3004600	you can see each other much better than you can't see each other.
3005600	3006600	I see.
3006600	3009600	But the effect is still the same on both sides.
3009600	3013600	This is my question for the third point.
3013600	3017600	What is the direction of causal relationship?
3017600	3019600	For example,
3019600	3021600	is the communication channel
3021600	3023600	caused by musical communication
3023600	3026600	to cause the following of your body movement?
3026600	3029600	Or is it the movement of your body
3029600	3032600	that causes the improvement of music?
3032600	3033600	I don't know.
3033600	3036600	Because if you can't see your body sway
3036600	3037600	or follow each other,
3037600	3040600	it doesn't mean visual communication.
3040600	3043600	It is the natural body reaction
3043600	3047600	caused by the essence of hearing or music.
3047600	3048600	So it is a side effect,
3048600	3050600	not a real cause.
3050600	3052600	I didn't say it is a cause.
3052600	3055600	I just said it is a reaction indicator.
3055600	3057600	It is a measurement indicator.
3057600	3059600	I said it is
3059600	3061600	when we play music,
3061600	3063600	our body does this movement,
3063600	3064600	but we still do it.
3064600	3066600	This information seems to reflect
3066600	3069600	the direction of information transmission
3069600	3071600	and the quality of cooperation.
3071600	3075600	So you don't think it is functional.
3075600	3076600	You don't think it has a function.
3076600	3078600	It is just an indicator.
3078600	3081600	It is just a measurement indicator.
3081600	3083600	I am conservative.
3083600	3084600	I am conservative.
3084600	3085600	I think I don't know.
3085600	3086600	I just said
3086600	3089600	I can't prove it is functional yet.
3089600	3091600	In my research,
3091600	3094600	some people block the whole person
3094600	3096600	and measure the time difference
3096600	3098600	between each other's buttons.
3098600	3099600	When all the buttons are blocked,
3099600	3101600	the time difference between the buttons
3101600	3103600	will be affected.
3103600	3106600	But I think
3106600	3108600	the conclusion is
3108600	3110600	in my research,
3110600	3111600	I can only say
3111600	3113600	the result can be reflected.
3113600	3115600	Maybe it is just a related indicator.
3115600	3116600	But is the function
3116600	3118600	a part of communication itself?
3118600	3120600	Is it a part of seeing
3120600	3122600	other people's body movements?
3122600	3123600	I don't know.
3123600	3124600	Because like you said,
3124600	3125600	even if you can't see,
3125600	3127600	the body movements have this effect.
3127600	3128600	Got it.
3128600	3130600	Thank you.
3130600	3133600	I have another question for Zhang Ting.
3133600	3135600	But it is not directly
3135600	3137600	about your research itself.
3137600	3139600	We want something interesting
3139600	3141600	from your research.
3141600	3143600	If we look at Baha,
3143600	3145600	you just emphasized that
3145600	3146600	the four characters
3146600	3148600	are relatively...
3148600	3149600	What is it called?
3149600	3151600	The responsibilities are more or less equal.
3151600	3153600	So you can randomly assign
3153600	3154600	who you are.
3154600	3155600	But if we change it to
3155600	3156600	four-part jazz,
3156600	3158600	the kind of music with strong characters,
3158600	3160600	do you expect that
3160600	3162600	the effect size will be very strong?
3162600	3163600	Or will they break down?
3163600	3164600	They can't play
3164600	3165600	because they don't know
3165600	3166600	who they are.
3166600	3167600	If you don't assign,
3167600	3168600	who will lead?
3168600	3169600	I know.
3169600	3171600	This is our...
3173600	3175600	Actually, we did it.
3175600	3176600	I didn't put it here today.
3176600	3177600	But this is Experiment 2.
3177600	3178600	In the case of Experiment 2,
3178600	3180600	we don't have that kind of jazz.
3180600	3182600	We want them to play
3184600	3185600	Mozart's music.
3185600	3187600	If you look at Mozart's music,
3187600	3188600	if you look at the score,
3188600	3189600	all the melodies
3189600	3190600	are in the first violin.
3190600	3191600	The other parts
3191600	3193600	are just beats.
3193600	3194600	But we still do
3194600	3195600	the same manipulation.
3195600	3196600	Even if the cello
3196600	3197600	is just playing beats,
3197600	3199600	you still have to lead the violin
3199600	3200600	to play its music.
3200600	3201600	So this is basically
3201600	3202600	the same manipulation
3202600	3203600	as you think.
3203600	3204600	It's all the same.
3204600	3205600	The result is...
3205600	3207600	I go back to the previous slide.
3208600	3209600	This is the replication
3209600	3210600	I just talked about.
3210600	3211600	We still have
3211600	3213600	the three lines above.
3213600	3215600	The three lines below are gone.
3217600	3220600	So we're in a task.
3220600	3223600	It's an unbalanced starting point.
3223600	3224600	We're going to do manipulation.
3224600	3226600	We still see the above effects.
3226600	3227600	But it's actually
3227600	3229600	a lot weaker overall.
3229600	3231600	And then we measure
3231600	3233600	the strength of the
3233600	3235600	grandiosity between each other
3235600	3237600	in the case of the bass line.
3237600	3238600	We found that
3238600	3240600	in the case of playing Mozart's music,
3240600	3242600	the bass line is more uneven.
3242600	3243600	In the case of playing Bach,
3243600	3245600	the bass line is even.
3245600	3246600	So it does have
3246600	3248600	the effect of the bass line.
3249600	3250600	This effect actually
3250600	3252600	shows that this is functional.
3252600	3253600	Because in the case of non-syncing,
3253600	3255600	when the music itself
3255600	3257600	doesn't have this message,
3257600	3258600	when the music itself
3258600	3259600	has an obvious bias,
3259600	3260600	it's hard for you to have
3260600	3261600	this effect.
3261600	3262600	For example,
3262600	3263600	in the case of playing the cello,
3263600	3264600	if you don't see it,
3264600	3266600	your body swing is not connected.
3266600	3269600	But when you see it,
3269600	3271600	it still has an effect.
3271600	3275600	It means it's causally linked.
3275600	3276600	Wait a minute.
3276600	3277600	I suddenly feel like
3277600	3278600	I'm talking illogically.
3278600	3280600	Because although the body...
3280600	3282600	But we didn't...
3282600	3283600	But the music itself
3283600	3286600	is actually explained.
3286600	3289600	I think it's a little hard
3290600	3292600	I think even if there is such a difference,
3292600	3295600	it's just possible.
3295600	3297600	But to answer that question directly,
3297600	3298600	for example,
3298600	3300600	if I tie the musician to the chair
3300600	3301600	so that he can't move,
3301600	3303600	let's see what the effect of their performance is.
3303600	3305600	This is a more direct manipulation.
3307600	3309600	Do you agree with me?
3309600	3310600	I don't know. I can't figure it out.
3310600	3311600	I have to think about it again.
3313600	3314600	That is to say,
3314600	3315600	I can't move your body today.
3315600	3316600	Let's see if your performance quality
3316600	3318600	will be reduced.
3319600	3320600	Obviously,
3320600	3321600	there will be a lot of confounders.
3321600	3322600	You can't do that.
3322600	3325600	But I'm still thinking about
3325600	3327600	the lack of evidence just now.
3327600	3329600	It seems that it can only prove that
3329600	3330600	you still find that
3330600	3332600	the reaction between the body
3332600	3334600	is causally linked.
3334600	3337600	It's the connection between the follower and the leader.
3337600	3338600	But the causality of this connection
3338600	3340600	does not represent the causality
3340600	3341600	between the performance of music
3341600	3343600	and the body sway.
3343600	3345600	So it's not a good evidence.
3345600	3346600	Do you mean that?
3346600	3347600	I'm a little confused.
3349600	3350600	I'm confused, too.
3350600	3351600	Forget it.
3352600	3353600	When we were writing the paper,
3353600	3355600	different authors were thinking about it.
3355600	3356600	Some authors directly argued that
3356600	3358600	body sway is communication.
3359600	3360600	But...
3360600	3362600	I don't think you have that evidence.
3362600	3364600	I think the evidence is direct.
3364600	3366600	I just said that I was a little bit safe.
3366600	3367600	Then in the discussion,
3367600	3368600	I said it might be like this.
3368600	3369600	But I don't know.
3370600	3371600	I think there are indeed
3371600	3373600	two causes and conditions for discussion.
3373600	3374600	One is that
3374600	3375600	the body sway of the leader
3375600	3377600	leads to the body sway of the follower.
3377600	3379600	This is the analysis you are doing now.
3379600	3381600	As long as the bar on your left is higher,
3381600	3383600	it means that the causality exists.
3383600	3384600	But...
3385600	3386600	But...
3386600	3387600	You go first.
3388600	3390600	But the other cause is
3390600	3392600	the connection between the music
3392600	3395600	and the body sway.
3395600	3396600	Is body sway
3396600	3400600	the connection between the music itself?
3400600	3401600	Yes.
3401600	3402600	OK.
3402600	3403600	The first point is
3403600	3405600	about grunge causality.
3405600	3407600	I guess many listeners may know that
3407600	3409600	it is actually argued that
3409600	3411600	causality is a big problem.
3411600	3412600	Mathematically,
3412600	3413600	causality is a big problem?
3413600	3414600	Yes.
3414600	3415600	Mathematically,
3415600	3416600	it can only say that
3416600	3418600	the amount of information transfer.
3418600	3420600	Is there really a cause?
3420600	3422600	There must be some other situations.
3422600	3423600	For example,
3423600	3424600	I have to sample
3424600	3426600	the whole universe
3426600	3428600	to make it possible.
3428600	3430600	In some cases,
3430600	3432600	it is conservative.
3432600	3433600	Mathematically,
3433600	3434600	I can only say
3434600	3435600	A predict B.
3435600	3437600	I can't say A cause B.
3437600	3438600	In this example,
3438600	3440600	you can say causality.
3440600	3442600	Because it is the difference in time.
3442600	3443600	This information
3443600	3445600	leads to this information change.
3445600	3446600	What other factors
3446600	3447600	in body sway
3447600	3448600	will lead to this change?
3448600	3449600	Maybe music
3449600	3451600	has a third reason.
3451600	3452600	In short,
3452600	3454600	I think the alternative is limited.
3454600	3456600	There is no possibility.
3456600	3457600	These alternatives
3457600	3458600	sound
3458600	3459600	not very
3459600	3461600	compelling.
3461600	3462600	So I think
3462600	3464600	even if it is a little risky,
3464600	3465600	you can still argue
3465600	3467600	that this is a causal relationship.
3467600	3468600	On the other hand,
3468600	3469600	what you really care about
3469600	3471600	is the body movement reaction.
3471600	3472600	Is this information
3472600	3473600	transmitted
3473600	3475600	by music communication itself?
3475600	3476600	Does it cause
3476600	3477600	better music quality?
3477600	3478600	Does it cause
3478600	3479600	better communication?
3479600	3480600	But
3480600	3481600	I don't think
3481600	3483600	there is a causal relationship.
3483600	3484600	I think
3484600	3486600	there is a causal relationship.
3486600	3487600	But this seems
3487600	3488600	to need other evidence.
3488600	3489600	Yes.
3493600	3495600	I am conservative.
3495600	3497600	I think you are conservative.
3500600	3501600	My bubble is gone.
3501600	3502600	So everyone is welcome
3502600	3503600	to discuss freely.
3503600	3505600	It doesn't matter if it is three-dimensional.
3505600	3506600	I would like to ask
3506600	3507600	this experiment
3507600	3509600	that you are talking about now.
3509600	3510600	For example,
3510600	3511600	how many groups
3511600	3512600	do you need
3513600	3514600	or how many musicians
3514600	3515600	do you need
3515600	3516600	to be able to
3516600	3517600	get a
3517600	3518600	less
3518600	3519600	influenced
3519600	3520600	culture
3520600	3521600	or training
3521600	3523600	from the performers?
3526600	3527600	I think
3527600	3528600	this question
3528600	3529600	is very good.
3529600	3530600	I think
3530600	3531600	this is the weakness
3531600	3532600	of this study.
3532600	3533600	First of all,
3533600	3534600	we are looking for
3534600	3536600	very high-level musicians.
3536600	3537600	You have to pay a lot of money
3537600	3539600	to buy a concert hall
3539600	3540600	for them to come.
3543600	3545600	Because of the financial constraints,
3545600	3546600	we found two groups.
3546600	3547600	We found two groups.
3547600	3549600	In terms of statistics,
3549600	3551600	we think it is better to say
3551600	3553600	that these are
3553600	3555600	called within-subject comparison.
3555600	3556600	That is to say,
3556600	3557600	compare yourself with yourself.
3557600	3558600	That is to say,
3558600	3559600	how much stronger
3559600	3560600	this effect is
3560600	3561600	compared to
3561600	3562600	yourself as a follower.
3562600	3563600	So even if
3563600	3565600	the sample we take
3565600	3566600	is very limited,
3566600	3567600	that is,
3567600	3568600	two groups of musicians,
3568600	3569600	a total of eight people.
3569600	3571600	But within each person,
3571600	3572600	the direction of their effect
3572600	3574600	is the same.
3574600	3575600	Is it possible that
3575600	3576600	I took some
3576600	3578600	very biased samples?
3578600	3579600	For example,
3579600	3580600	these musicians
3580600	3581600	do not represent all humans.
3581600	3582600	It is possible.
3582600	3583600	This is the weakness of this study.
3583600	3585600	I don't know
3585600	3587600	how representative this is.
3587600	3588600	I can only say
3588600	3589600	that from other
3589600	3590600	currently known studies,
3590600	3592600	the representativeness of musicians
3592600	3593600	and normal humans
3593600	3594600	is actually
3594600	3595600	similar.
3595600	3596600	It can represent
3596600	3597600	ordinary humans.
3597600	3600600	Other cultures
3600600	3601600	also have a problem
3601600	3602600	with representativeness.
3602600	3603600	At present,
3603600	3604600	it is also said that
3604600	3605600	representativeness is still OK.
3605600	3606600	It's just that
3606600	3607600	I don't have direct evidence
3607600	3608600	to say that
3608600	3609600	this effect
3609600	3610600	can represent
3610600	3611600	the effect of all humans.
3611600	3612600	I don't know.
3614600	3615600	Is it conservative?
3618600	3619600	It's OK.
3622600	3623600	I have a question.
3623600	3624600	OK.
3624600	3625600	You ask first.
3625600	3626600	You finish first.
3628600	3629600	It's OK.
3629600	3630600	The next question
3630600	3631600	has nothing to do with this.
3631600	3632600	You can continue
3632600	3633600	to ask other questions.
3633600	3634600	OK.
3634600	3635600	I have a question.
3635600	3636600	At the beginning,
3636600	3637600	you mentioned quarreling.
3637600	3638600	But quarreling
3638600	3639600	doesn't seem to be sung.
3639600	3640600	It's spoken.
3640600	3641600	So I want to know
3641600	3642600	that it can also be sung.
3642600	3643600	It's weird.
3645600	3646600	So the question I want to ask
3646600	3647600	is that
3647600	3649600	your research results
3649600	3650600	are already here.
3650600	3653600	How much do you think
3653600	3656600	it can allow us to predict
3656600	3657600	or provide us
3657600	3658600	with knowledge
3658600	3659600	about language communication
3659600	3662600	and interaction?
3662600	3664600	What kind of implications
3664600	3665600	will there be?
3665600	3669600	If there are some weaknesses
3669600	3671600	that can't be inferred,
3671600	3673600	what research
3673600	3675600	do you need to make up for
3675600	3677600	in terms of speech?
3677600	3678600	OK.
3679600	3680600	First of all,
3680600	3682600	most of the research
3682600	3683600	on body movements
3683600	3684600	and body shaking
3684600	3685600	is done
3685600	3686600	in the context of speech.
3688600	3689600	But they do it
3689600	3690600	in a small lab.
3690600	3691600	There are usually two people.
3691600	3694600	They use relevant methods
3694600	3695600	to see how similar
3695600	3696600	the information is.
3699600	3701600	There are other studies
3701600	3702600	that show
3702600	3705600	that the psychological process
3705600	3707600	used in music performance
3707600	3708600	and speech
3708600	3709600	are very similar.
3709600	3712600	In terms of music,
3712600	3713600	we also observed
3713600	3714600	a similar effect
3714600	3715600	in body movements.
3715600	3716600	Of course,
3716600	3717600	it's not exactly the same.
3717600	3718600	It's extended,
3718600	3719600	but the effect
3719600	3722600	is the same.
3722600	3726600	Although there is no direct evidence,
3726600	3727600	I think
3727600	3728600	the effect
3728600	3729600	should be the same
3729600	3731600	in terms of speech.
3735600	3737600	That's my guess.
3737600	3738600	OK, thank you.
3740600	3742600	I have a related question.
3742600	3743600	Can I interrupt you?
3745600	3746600	Do you have a number?
3747600	3748600	Someone said he had a question.
3748600	3750600	I'm afraid I'll keep interrupting.
3750600	3751600	I asked too many questions.
3752600	3754600	You just said language.
3754600	3755600	In fact,
3755600	3756600	I think
3757600	3758600	more broadly,
3758600	3759600	do you think
3759600	3760600	these are all
3760600	3762600	the phenomenon of hearing?
3762600	3763600	Or is it actually
3763600	3764600	a wider perception
3764600	3765600	or even a mental operation?
3766600	3767600	Or is it
3767600	3768600	a specific phenomenon
3768600	3769600	of hearing?
3769600	3770600	For example,
3770600	3771600	in science,
3771600	3772600	regularity
3772600	3773600	determines
3773600	3774600	how you
3774600	3775600	can anticipate
3775600	3776600	how to
3776600	3777600	process
3777600	3778600	cognitive information.
3778600	3779600	Obviously,
3779600	3780600	this also works
3780600	3781600	visually.
3781600	3782600	Next,
3782600	3783600	is the communication
3783600	3784600	of music collaborators
3784600	3785600	really limited to
3785600	3786600	the performance of music?
3786600	3787600	Or is it
3787600	3788600	all about
3788600	3789600	cooperation?
3789600	3790600	All the cooperation,
3790600	3791600	like the example
3791600	3792600	you just gave,
3792600	3793600	do they all
3793600	3794600	have the same phenomenon?
3794600	3795600	Does the sway of the body
3795600	3796600	also affect it?
3796600	3797600	Or is there
3797600	3798600	a more general mechanism?
3798600	3799600	For example,
3799600	3800600	is there any
3800600	3801600	synchronization
3801600	3802600	that helps
3802600	3803600	communication?
3807600	3808600	Can you remind me
3808600	3809600	what the first part
3809600	3810600	is?
3811600	3812600	I think
3812600	3813600	these are all examples.
3813600	3814600	The main question is
3814600	3815600	do you think
3815600	3816600	this is a domain-specific
3816600	3817600	phenomenon
3817600	3818600	or
3818600	3819600	a wider
3819600	3820600	mental operation
3820600	3821600	principle?
3822600	3823600	I don't think
3823600	3824600	there is a standard answer.
3824600	3825600	I'm just curious.
3825600	3826600	OK.
3826600	3827600	I'm curious.
3827600	3828600	According to
3828600	3829600	other studies,
3829600	3830600	in fact,
3830600	3831600	we found
3831600	3832600	that
3832600	3834600	time synchronization
3834600	3835600	is still
3835600	3836600	a bit different
3836600	3837600	from hearing
3837600	3838600	and vision.
3839600	3840600	For example,
3842600	3843600	the sense of rhythm
3843600	3844600	of vision
3844600	3845600	is actually
3845600	3846600	quite difficult
3846600	3847600	to produce
3847600	3848600	compared to hearing.
3848600	3849600	The accuracy of
3849600	3850600	tracking time
3850600	3851600	does not seem
3851600	3852600	to be as high
3852600	3853600	as the results
3853600	3854600	of the study.
3854600	3855600	But some people
3855600	3856600	have succeeded.
3856600	3857600	Vision still has
3857600	3858600	this effect.
3858600	3859600	But
3859600	3860600	what I mean is
3860600	3861600	that it may not be
3861600	3862600	the same.
3862600	3863600	The domain of hearing
3863600	3864600	is obviously
3864600	3865600	frequency and time.
3865600	3866600	But
3866600	3867600	in vision,
3867600	3868600	it will be
3868600	3869600	space and
3869600	3870600	location.
3870600	3871600	Yes, space and location.
3871600	3872600	Translated,
3872600	3873600	it becomes
3873600	3874600	statistical learning.
3874600	3875600	If there is a
3875600	3876600	fixed pattern,
3877600	3878600	I can't speak Chinese.
3878600	3879600	If there is a
3879600	3880600	fixed pattern
3880600	3881600	that appears
3881600	3882600	repeatedly,
3882600	3883600	your processing
3883600	3884600	will be faster,
3884600	3885600	better,
3885600	3886600	and more accurate.
3886600	3887600	Do you think
3887600	3889600	this is a similar phenomenon?
3889600	3890600	Or is there
3890600	3891600	a specialized
3891600	3892600	process
3893600	3894600	in the brain
3894600	3895600	to process
3895600	3896600	different areas?
3896600	3897600	OK.
3897600	3898600	I think
3898600	3899600	the special process
3899600	3900600	is because
3900600	3901600	time is
3901600	3902600	one-dimensional.
3902600	3903600	Although
3903600	3904600	it is a
3904600	3905600	single-direction
3905600	3906600	dimension,
3906600	3907600	you are always
3907600	3908600	going to the future
3908600	3909600	to make guesses.
3910600	3911600	This is
3911600	3912600	different from
3912600	3913600	the visual
3914600	3915600	pattern.
3915600	3916600	For example,
3916600	3917600	if I give you
3917600	3918600	a very regular
3918600	3919600	pattern,
3919600	3920600	this pattern
3920600	3921600	is not the same.
3921600	3922600	But it must be
3922600	3923600	future-oriented.
3923600	3924600	So,
3924600	3925600	based on your
3925600	3926600	existing information,
3926600	3927600	you keep guessing
3927600	3928600	what the
3928600	3929600	future information
3929600	3930600	is.
3930600	3931600	In fact,
3931600	3932600	it is
3932600	3933600	online processing.
3933600	3934600	So,
3934600	3935600	I think
3935600	3936600	these details
3936600	3937600	make time
3937600	3938600	different from
3938600	3939600	other senses
3939600	3940600	when it
3940600	3941600	comes to
3941600	3942600	hearing.
3942600	3943600	Because the information
3943600	3944600	is opened
3944600	3945600	at any time.
3945600	3946600	Let me give you
3946600	3947600	an example.
3947600	3948600	In the visual phenomenon,
3948600	3949600	there is also
3949600	3950600	a temporal
3950600	3951600	anticipation
3951600	3952600	phenomenon.
3952600	3953600	For example,
3953600	3954600	you should
3954600	3955600	know
3955600	3956600	this experiment.
3956600	3957600	It is
3957600	3958600	a combination
3958600	3959600	of three
3959600	3960600	random
3960600	3961600	sounds.
3961600	3962600	What is
3962600	3963600	this experiment?
3963600	3964600	This is the
3964600	3965600	first experiment
3965600	3966600	in learning
3966600	3967600	language.
3967600	3968600	For example,
3968600	3969600	there are
3969600	3970600	nine possible
3970600	3971600	notes.
3971600	3972600	There are
3972600	3973600	three notes
3973600	3974600	that are
3974600	3975600	always
3975600	3976600	connected.
3976600	3977600	Three notes
3977600	3978600	are always
3978600	3979600	in pairs.
3979600	3980600	These phrases
3980600	3981600	can be
3981600	3982600	randomly
3982600	3983600	combined.
3983600	3984600	This phenomenon
3984600	3985600	is hearing.
3985600	3986600	In fact,
3986600	3987600	if you
3987600	3988600	do the same
3988600	3989600	experiment
3989600	3990600	with visual stimulation,
3990600	3991600	all the results
3991600	3992600	are the same.
3992600	3993600	So,
3993600	3994600	this is
3994600	3995600	an online
3995600	3996600	processing
3996600	3997600	that affects
3997600	3998600	your
3998600	3999600	intuition
3999600	4000600	in the
4000600	4001600	visual phenomenon.
4001600	4002600	I know.
4002600	4003600	In each
4003600	4004600	special case,
4004600	4005600	some cases
4005600	4006600	are replicated.
4006600	4007600	But in many cases,
4007600	4008600	visually,
4008600	4009600	it is difficult
4009600	4010600	to do it.
4010600	4011600	For example,
4011600	4012600	the effect of
4012600	4013600	rhythm.
4013600	4014600	Temporal
4014600	4015600	grouping.
4015600	4016600	I know you
4016600	4017600	have done it
4017600	4018600	once in the
4018600	4019600	lab,
4019600	4020600	but
4020600	4021600	you can see
4021600	4022600	that many people
4022600	4023600	failed.
4023600	4024600	It doesn't matter.
4024600	4025600	I know.
4025600	4026600	I have done
4026600	4027600	multi-sensory.
4027600	4028600	I know it is
4028600	4029600	difficult.
4029600	4030600	It is very
4030600	4031600	simple.
4031600	4032600	You just need to
4032600	4033600	show 4 notes,
4033600	4034600	5 notes,
4034600	4035600	and people will
4035600	4036600	know.
4036600	4037600	So,
4037600	4038600	you mean
4038600	4039600	there are
4039600	4040600	domain-specific
4040600	4041600	parts.
4041600	4042600	Temporal
4042600	4043600	regularity
4043600	4044600	is a
4044600	4045600	domain-specific
4045600	4046600	part.
4046600	4047600	What do you
4047600	4048600	think is
4048600	4049600	the difference
4049600	4050600	between
4050600	4051600	hearing
4051600	4052600	and visual
4052600	4053600	regularity?
4053600	4054600	I think
4054600	4055600	the effect
4055600	4056600	is the same,
4056600	4057600	but the
4057600	4058600	processing
4058600	4059600	is different.
4059600	4060600	In
4060600	4061600	primary
4061600	4062600	auditory
4062600	4063600	cortex,
4063600	4064600	there is
4064600	4065600	temporal
4065600	4066600	coding.
4066600	4067600	In
4067600	4068600	visual cortex,
4068600	4069600	it is
4069600	4070600	where
4070600	4071600	domain.
4071600	4072600	I don't
4072600	4073600	know.
4073600	4074600	It takes
4074600	4075600	a long time
4075600	4076600	to
4076600	4077600	process
4077600	4078600	the information.
4078600	4079600	Is it
4079600	4080600	because
4080600	4081600	hearing
4081600	4082600	mechanism
4082600	4083600	makes it
4083600	4084600	noisy?
4084600	4085600	For example,
4085600	4086600	hearing
4086600	4087600	and visual
4087600	4088600	are
4088600	4089600	basically
4089600	4090600	different.
4090600	4091600	Okay.
4091600	4092600	I've been standing here
4092600	4093600	for too long.
4093600	4094600	Let me
4094600	4095600	guess.
4095600	4096600	Is it okay?
4096600	4097600	I'm done.
4097600	4098600	Please go ahead.
4098600	4099600	I read
4099600	4100600	an article
4100600	4101600	that said
4101600	4102600	if...
4102600	4103600	It's from
4103600	4104600	Sexy.
4104600	4105600	It said
4105600	4106600	if the
4106600	4107600	trigger
4107600	4108600	is
4108600	4109600	language
4109600	4110600	or
4110600	4111600	sound,
4111600	4112600	that is,
4112600	4113600	hearing,
4113600	4114600	the trigger
4114600	4115600	is
4115600	4116600	the
4116600	4117600	subject's
4117600	4118600	abstract
4118600	4119600	image.
4119600	4120600	It's
4120600	4121600	about
4121600	4122600	describing
4122600	4123600	the material
4123600	4124600	in a
4124600	4125600	more abstract
4125600	4126600	and
4126600	4127600	far-reaching
4127600	4128600	way
4128600	4129600	compared to
4129600	4131600	visual materials.
4131600	4132600	I don't know
4132600	4133600	if
4133600	4134600	it's
4134600	4135600	similar
4135600	4136600	to
4136600	4137600	processing
4137600	4138600	or
4138600	4139600	listening to
4139600	4140600	music.
4140600	4141600	If
4141600	4142600	it's
4142600	4143600	similar
4143600	4144600	to
4144600	4145600	listening
4145600	4146600	to
4146600	4147600	music,
4147600	4148600	I think
4148600	4149600	it's
4149600	4150600	similar.
4150600	4151600	If
4151600	4152600	it's
4152600	4153600	similar,
4153600	4154600	I think
4154600	4155600	it's
4155600	4156600	similar.
4156600	4157600	Is it
4157600	4158600	similar?
4158600	4159600	I'm
4159600	4160600	not sure.
4160600	4161600	I think
4161600	4162600	it's
4162600	4163600	similar.
4163600	4164600	It's
4164600	4165600	similar.
4165600	4166600	Okay.
4166600	4167600	So
4167600	4168600	I
4168600	4169600	don't
4169600	4170600	know
4170600	4171600	all the
4171600	4172600	details
4172600	4173600	about
4173600	4174600	the
4174600	4175600	song.
4175600	4176600	I
4176600	4177600	don't
4177600	4178600	know.
4178600	4179600	I
4179600	4180600	really don't
4180600	4181600	know.
4181600	4182600	Hello.
4182600	4183600	Are
4183600	4184600	you
4184600	4185600	calling me?
4185600	4186600	I'm done.
4186600	4187600	I'm done.
4187600	4188600	I just
4188600	4189600	said I
4189600	4190600	don't
4190600	4191600	know.
4191600	4192600	Sorry.
4192600	4193600	Did I
4193600	4194600	disconnect?
4194600	4195600	Okay.
4195600	4196600	Does
4196600	4197600	anyone
4197600	4198600	else have
4198600	4199600	any
4199600	4200600	questions?
4200600	4201600	Someone
4201600	4202600	is
4202600	4203600	asking
4203600	4204600	questions.
4204600	4205600	Can
4205600	4206600	I
4206600	4207600	ask
4207600	4208600	a question?
4208600	4209600	Okay.
4209600	4210600	Please.
4210600	4211600	I'm
4211600	4212600	thinking
4212600	4213600	that
4213600	4214600	if
4214600	4215600	you
4215600	4216600	tell
4216600	4217600	the
4217600	4218600	musicians
4218600	4219600	that
4219600	4220600	you
4220600	4221600	have
4221600	4222600	three
4222600	4223600	people
4223600	4224600	following
4224600	4225600	you
4225600	4226600	and
4226600	4227600	one
4227600	4228600	is
4228600	4229600	the
4229600	4230600	leader,
4230600	4231600	will
4231600	4232600	they
4232600	4233600	fight?
4233600	4234600	Yes.
4234600	4235600	We
4235600	4236600	actually
4236600	4237600	did this
4237600	4238600	experiment.
4238600	4239600	Our
4239600	4240600	condition
4240600	4241600	is
4241600	4242600	Beach,
4242600	4243600	I'm
4243600	4244600	the
4244600	4245600	leader.
4245600	4246600	But
4246600	4247600	we
4247600	4248600	originally
4248600	4249600	thought
4249600	4250600	that
4250600	4251600	in your
4251600	4252600	leadership
4252600	4253600	assignment,
4253600	4254600	if there
4254600	4255600	is
4255600	4256600	a
4256600	4257600	conflict,
4257600	4258600	how
4258600	4259600	can we
4259600	4260600	solve
4260600	4261600	the
4261600	4262600	conflict?
4262600	4263600	We
4263600	4264600	originally
4264600	4265600	wanted to
4265600	4266600	see this
4266600	4267600	situation.
4267600	4268600	But
4268600	4269600	the result of
4269600	4270600	the experiment
4270600	4271600	is that
4271600	4272600	we found
4272600	4273600	that only
4273600	4274600	when
4274600	4275600	everyone
4275600	4276600	can see
4276600	4277600	each other
4277600	4278600	and
4278600	4279600	everyone
4279600	4280600	is assigned
4280600	4281600	as
4281600	4282600	followers,
4282600	4283600	can we
4283600	4284600	solve
4284600	4285600	this
4285600	4286600	conflict
4286600	4287600	smoothly.
4287600	4288600	At
4288600	4289600	that
4289600	4290600	time,
4290600	4291600	we
4291600	4292600	thought
4292600	4293600	that
4293600	4294600	if
4294600	4295600	everyone
4295600	4296600	is
4296600	4297600	the
4297600	4298600	leader,
4298600	4299600	or
4299600	4300600	can't
4300600	4301600	see each
4301600	4302600	other,
4302600	4303600	they
4303600	4304600	can't
4304600	4305600	solve
4305600	4306600	the
4306600	4307600	conflict.
4307600	4308600	So
4308600	4309600	we
4309600	4310600	called it
4310600	4311600	Beach,
4311600	4312600	I'm
4312600	4313600	the
4313600	4314600	leader.
4314600	4315600	Have
4315600	4316600	you ever
4316600	4317600	tried
4317600	4318600	to solve
4318600	4319600	the
4319600	4320600	conflict?
4320600	4321600	We
4321600	4322600	thought that
4322600	4323600	if
4323600	4324600	everyone
4324600	4325600	can see
4325600	4326600	each other
4326600	4327600	and
4327600	4328600	no one
4328600	4329600	is the
4329600	4330600	leader,
4330600	4331600	they can
4331600	4332600	solve
4332600	4333600	the
4333600	4334600	conflict
4334600	4335600	smoothly.
4335600	4336600	But
4336600	4337600	only in
4337600	4338600	Bach's
4338600	4339600	music,
4339600	4340600	if
4340600	4341600	the
4341600	4342600	bassline
4342600	4343600	is
4343600	4344600	unbalanced,
4344600	4345600	this
4345600	4346600	effect
4346600	4347600	can't
4347600	4348600	be
4348600	4349600	achieved.
4349600	4350600	We
4350600	4351600	also asked
4351600	4352600	them to
4352600	4353600	guess who
4353600	4354600	is the
4354600	4355600	leader.
4355600	4356600	We
4356600	4357600	forced them
4357600	4358600	to choose
4358600	4359600	the other
4359600	4360600	three,
4360600	4361600	but
4361600	4362600	they
4362600	4363600	were
4363600	4364600	so good
4364600	4365600	that
4365600	4366600	they
4366600	4367600	wrote
4367600	4368600	NO
4368600	4369600	LEADER
4369600	4370600	on
4370600	4371600	the
4371600	4372600	answer sheet.
4372600	4373600	So
4373600	4374600	this
4374600	4375600	part
4375600	4376600	is
4376600	4377600	not
4377600	4378600	clear.
4378600	4379600	And
4379600	4380600	we
4380600	4381600	tried to
4381600	4382600	avoid
4382600	4383600	the
4383600	4384600	conflict
4384600	4385600	when
4385600	4386600	everyone
4386600	4387600	is the
4387600	4388600	leader.
4388600	4389600	We
4389600	4390600	played the
4390600	4391600	beat
4391600	4392600	two seconds
4392600	4393600	before
4393600	4394600	their
4394600	4395600	performance,
4395600	4396600	and
4396600	4397600	we
4397600	4398600	removed
4398600	4399600	the
4399600	4400600	beat
4400600	4401600	before
4401600	4402600	their
4402600	4403600	performance.
4403600	4404600	So
4404600	4405600	this
4405600	4406600	part is
4406600	4407600	not
4407600	4408600	clear.
4408600	4409600	We
4409600	4410600	also
4410600	4411600	asked
4411600	4412600	them to
4412600	4413600	guess
4413600	4414600	who
4414600	4415600	is the
4415600	4416600	leader.
4416600	4417600	We
4417600	4418600	forced them
4418600	4419600	to
4419600	4420600	choose
4420600	4421600	the
4421600	4422600	other
4422600	4423600	three,
4423600	4424600	but
4424600	4425600	they
4425600	4426600	were
4426600	4427600	so good
4427600	4428600	that
4428600	4429600	they
4429600	4430600	wrote

4436600	4437600	So

4438600	4439600	were
4439600	4440600	so good
4440600	4441600	that
