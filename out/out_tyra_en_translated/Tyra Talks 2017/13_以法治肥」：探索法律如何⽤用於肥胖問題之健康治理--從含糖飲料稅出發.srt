1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's start recording.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, I got it. Thank you.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's start.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Yanping.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm your host today.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But I'll probably talk for a while

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then I'll be gone.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Because my wife's waist is twisted

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to the point where she can't hold the baby.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So...

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to have an emergency meeting later.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So today,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
let's welcome Hanxi to share

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
with us...

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He's the only one who has a webcam

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so he's Hanxi.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He's going to share

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
with us about the

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
law related to

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
public safety.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Because

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hanxi...

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is Hanxi right?

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, that's right.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My Chinese isn't very good.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hanxi used to

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
study law.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But then he went to the police station

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to study...

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He studied for a while

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in Yang Ming's police station.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then he came back to study law.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
His major is

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the law related to

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
public safety.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hanxi will share the details with us later.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No problem.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're happy to have Hanxi here today

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
because he's probably our first law student.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Also, he's probably our first...

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I guess,

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
pure humanist.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So we're happy that we can finally

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
expand to a more complete

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
academic field.

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There are people in all fields.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Without further ado,

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
let's give a round of applause to welcome Hanxi.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm the only one in charge of filming.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Because

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
today's guest is not alone.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Today's guest is not alone.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me briefly introduce myself.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm a friend of Yuhui.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's get to know each other.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why is my microphone

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
turned off all of a sudden?

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's like

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
a small roundtable.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's like a chat.

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not a formal report.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Since we have the opportunity,

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
let's get to know each other.

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay.

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not sure

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
which school you're from.

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So let's...

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let me introduce myself.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me introduce myself.

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm from UNC.

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm from Beka.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm majoring in social psychology.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Who's next?

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello.

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hi.

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let me introduce myself first.

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm from DC.

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm George Washington.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm majoring in mechanical engineering.

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm majoring in

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
high-performance computing.

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's related to supercomputers.

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's related to supercomputers.

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm doing an internship

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in Tennessee.

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So you're not in DC.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll be back in September.

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll be back in September.

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Cool.

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So your name is

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Zhuang Ping...

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Bi Yue.

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Zhuang Bi Yue.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Bi Yue Xuan Hua.

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's switch to Caltech.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We have two people here.

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm Zhuang Ye You.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm working in Caltech

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and NASA JPL.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm working on dark matter experiments.

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm Yu Zhe Jing.

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can call me Zhe.

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm studying in Taiwan University.

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm studying in Taiwan University.

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm working in Caltech.

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I used to work in chemical engineering.

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm working in environmental engineering.

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's cool.

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's cool.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So there's one more person.

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He left a comment

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
in the chat room.

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, okay.

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's studying geography.

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's studying geography.

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What field is he studying?

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Geography is pretty broad.

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It ranges from biology to natural science.

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm pretty interested in this.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we're going to

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
chat with Zhuang.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Physical Geography.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You've been to Charleston.

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to start.

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm going to hand over my video.

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to hand over my video.

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hello, everyone.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm at Georgetown

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
studying law.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you have any questions,

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
feel free to ask.

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can see my screen.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think you can hear me.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you have any questions,

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
feel free to ask.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm happy to share

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
my research topic with you.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm at Georgetown Law School.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm at Georgetown Law School.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a big classroom.

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The signal here is very good.

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm preparing this topic

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
about obesity

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and soda tax.

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm preparing this topic

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
about obesity

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and soda tax.

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm preparing this topic

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
about obesity

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and soda tax.

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm happy to share

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
my research topic

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
with you.

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
As for this topic,

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
as for this topic,

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've seen your research background

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and your interest.

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and your interest.

168
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You are a Law student,

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
after my research.

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You have a reputation

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
as an authority

172
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
in social science

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You have a reputation as an authority

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
in social science

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
in social science

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and with the social issue.

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and with the social issue.

178
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I am not sure

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
If we are too

180
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,000
boring or too hard Louise.

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I am not sure

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is a good

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
introduction.

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Briefly is a bit

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
complicated because

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Actually I have

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
been to many schools

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and by the way

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
this is the 5th

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
University of Charleston

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So there are

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
my field

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
On the one hand, I was born with a legal background

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
as you all know

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I studied law

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and then became a lawyer

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I was born with a legal background and trained

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I also studied law

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and now I am studying law

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
On the other hand, I have

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
a different background

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
from other law students

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in my work experience

205
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and medical background

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How to say

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My first

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
political work

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I put a small picture here

210
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My first political work

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
was in Seattle

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
ICHS

213
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
International Community Health Service

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
International Community Health Service

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
hospital work

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
At that time, I was in UW

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
2007

218
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
After graduating from the University of Charleston

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I went there to work

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is my first political work

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because I was a lawyer in Taiwan before

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I haven't worked in Taiwan

223
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That was my first political work

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
For a lawyer in Taiwan

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I worked in a hospital

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I think this is a very surprising thing

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Anyway

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So that year

229
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
to some extent

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I got interested in medical law

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and then

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
jumped out

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
When I returned to Taiwan

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I tried to keep it as relevant as possible

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So I continued to specialize in medical law

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
in the field of public health law

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So can everyone hear me?

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because I found this

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
quite strange

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I can't hear everyone's voice

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We can hear you

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Welcome everyone to speak at any time

243
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Otherwise

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's my first time to find this kind of self-talk

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It feels strange

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can't see anyone

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's like practicing a speech

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can hear you

249
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can hear you

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Will it be better if I turn it on?

251
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you don't mind

252
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I feel like I can see your face

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Because I'm not wearing clothes right now

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So I don't want to see

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So I don't want to see

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But other people who are wearing clothes can turn it on

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Other people who are wearing clothes can turn it on

258
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If there is an answer, we will turn it on

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay, no problem, thank you

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Can we turn on the video?

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Can we turn on the video?

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, you can turn off the sound

263
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, you can turn off the sound

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
At least there is a video

265
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It feels better to talk to a real person

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It feels better to talk to a real person

267
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay, thank you

268
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
To put it simply

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm basically a lawyer

270
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I went to Taiwan to study law

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I'm interested in public health law

272
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I chose this topic

273
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
OK, I'm probably

274
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's 6.20 right now

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's actually quite simple

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
My presentation is divided into three parts

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The first one is introduction

278
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to introduce the background of this research

279
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why did we choose sugar?

280
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why did we choose soda

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And the intervention of public health

282
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And the intervention of public health

283
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The second one

284
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I reported a case study

285
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
One of the things I studied was the case of Sodatex

286
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
One of the things I studied was the case of Sodatex

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Finally, I hope to leave some time for discussion

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Finally, I hope to leave some time for discussion

289
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
About Sodatex

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because Caltech should be in LA

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because Caltech should be in LA

292
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So if there are students from

293
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So if there are students from

294
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
San Francisco or Berkeley

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They are really

296
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Within the scope of the use of Sodatex

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because there is Sodatex in the city

298
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
May feel better

299
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But this is a trend

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So all cities in the United States

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
are moving in this direction

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So maybe you will have this problem

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So maybe you will have this problem

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I have talked to the LA public health officials

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I have talked to the LA public health officials

306
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So it may not be in the short term

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But this proposal has always existed

308
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It is possible

309
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
After the discussion

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
After the discussion

311
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
After the discussion

312
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There must be pros and cons

313
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There must be pros and cons

314
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There must be pros and cons

315
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I will use my time

316
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So I will use my time

317
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What is the concept of Sodatex?

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I will use my time

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Isn't there any in California?

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Isn't there any in California?

321
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
People in California

322
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
People in California

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
People in California

324
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Are using cities as units

325
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Are using cities as units

326
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
To increase the Sodatex

327
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
To increase the Sodatex

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Most correct names are

329
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
more accurate translation is

330
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
more accurate translation is

331
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
it is except this Salestex

332
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
it is except this Salestex

333
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
it is in addition to a SodaTex

334
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
it is the at the top

335
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
more than now

336
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,060
700

337
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This trend continues

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
more and more places

339
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
plus tax

340
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
plus tax

341
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
When buying fuel

342
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
it is more expensive

343
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
like buying cigarettes and drinking alcohol

344
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The tax on it has a higher price

345
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The tax on it has a higher price

346
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Not exactly

347
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
extent

348
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Not exactly

349
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
not exactly

350
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know if you will talk about it later

351
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't know if you will talk about it later

352
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I just want to ask

353
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Does the tax cover

354
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
hand shake drinks

355
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
like bubble milk tea

356
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
For now

357
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
for bubble milk

358
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
This is a good question

359
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because most of it

360
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
in tax

361
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
is made

362
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the finished product

363
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But

364
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
if it is a

365
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
freshly made drink

366
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
freshly made juice

367
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It doesn't look like it

368
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But I can

369
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think it is not included in terms of definition

370
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But I can check again

371
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This is a good question

372
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Especially in Taiwan

373
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If you want to pass

374
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Does this hand shake drink include

375
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think it is not included in terms of definition

376
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But I can help you confirm this

377
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can check again

378
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Thank you

379
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We will cut it into three parts

380
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We will cut it into three parts

381
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I will do the introduction part first

382
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I will do the introduction part first

383
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to tell you

384
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why we choose sugar

385
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why we choose soda

386
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
