00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Okay, no problem.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.680
Hello everyone, I'm Dinghao.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.480
I'm a postdoc at Caltech.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.920
The topic I'm going to talk about

00:11.920 --> 00:15.360
is mainly my research on some of my papers.

00:15.360 --> 00:19.440
My research is about

00:19.440 --> 00:23.320
designing an artificial system

00:23.320 --> 00:28.320
and hoping to use that system to detect cell-cell contacts.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.520
My ultimate goal is to use this system

00:32.520 --> 00:36.360
to dissect the entire neural circuit.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.800
Oh, in the field of neuroscience,

00:42.800 --> 00:47.520
the most important answer that everyone wants to know

00:47.520 --> 00:50.560
is how our brain functions,

00:50.560 --> 00:55.040
so that we have all kinds of different emotions

00:55.040 --> 01:00.040
and how reactions to the environment stimulate.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.440
How to stimulate.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.560
But about 100 years ago,

01:10.200 --> 01:15.200
Raymond Kahar had a very elegant study.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.680
And the elegant study proved that

01:21.680 --> 01:26.680
our brain or neural system

01:28.040 --> 01:33.040
is mainly operated by these neurons or other cells

01:34.160 --> 01:38.840
to transmit all kinds of neural messages

01:38.840 --> 01:40.880
and ultimately have a behavior.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.920
This is a very famous neural doctrine.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.520
So a lot of research now

01:51.320 --> 01:56.320
is focused on how different neurons

01:58.280 --> 02:01.760
communicate with each other.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.840
This is a very complicated problem

02:03.840 --> 02:08.800
because our brain is a huge machine.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.680
Like what I'm showing in this picture,

02:10.680 --> 02:12.040
it's a reward circuit.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.840
This actually includes a lot of brain areas,

02:15.840 --> 02:18.600
like the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex,

02:18.600 --> 02:22.480
and the famous basal ganglia,

02:22.480 --> 02:25.880
nucleus, convent, VTA.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.120
These different brain areas connect with each other

02:29.120 --> 02:33.040
and operate and calculate

02:33.040 --> 02:36.160
to achieve a goal.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.800
And another more complicated aspect

02:39.800 --> 02:42.280
is that even in the same brain area,

02:42.280 --> 02:44.120
there are different neurons

02:44.120 --> 02:46.320
that receive different messages.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.960
And after synchronization,

02:48.960 --> 02:50.200
it's transmitted to another brain area.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.160
And the calculation of the other brain area

02:52.160 --> 02:53.760
may be transmitted back.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.920
So these connections are what we...

02:58.920 --> 03:01.880
What we want to answer right now

03:01.880 --> 03:05.200
is the idea of connectome.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.440
We hope that by understanding these connectome,

03:08.440 --> 03:11.880
we can have a blueprint

03:11.880 --> 03:15.240
of how our brain or neural system

03:15.240 --> 03:18.440
is wired.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.560
And then we can use this basic knowledge

03:21.560 --> 03:23.600
to calculate

03:23.600 --> 03:28.160
the changes in the message transmission

03:28.160 --> 03:31.080
of the neural cells

03:31.080 --> 03:33.120
that may lead to different behaviors.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.120
Like this.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.480
But in fact,

03:37.480 --> 03:39.680
in addition to neural cells,

03:39.680 --> 03:42.160
there are many other different cells,

03:42.160 --> 03:43.800
such as glial cells.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.560
Many studies have found that

03:47.560 --> 03:48.720
these glial cells

03:48.720 --> 03:53.080
actually affect the function of our neural neurons.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.600
For example,

03:56.600 --> 03:58.000
like this astrocyte,

03:59.320 --> 04:01.600
the heart-shaped neural cell,

04:01.600 --> 04:02.440
is...

04:03.600 --> 04:06.920
It has been found that it can actually

04:06.920 --> 04:10.480
clean up some of our neurotransmitters

04:11.600 --> 04:14.480
and make it turn over faster.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.040
And it's also found that...

04:18.080 --> 04:18.960
Sorry.

04:18.960 --> 04:23.040
It's found that it can actually transmit some signal

04:23.040 --> 04:28.040
and affect the whole synaptic property.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.560
So the connectome or microcircuit

04:33.560 --> 04:36.120
that we originally thought of

04:36.120 --> 04:37.440
is like this.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.640
In addition to neural cells,

04:38.640 --> 04:40.320
we still need to consider

04:40.320 --> 04:42.960
the function of these neural glial cells

04:42.960 --> 04:45.480
to have a more complete picture

04:45.480 --> 04:48.240
of how our brain functions.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.480
And then I mentioned earlier

04:51.480 --> 04:54.720
that understanding these microcircuits

04:54.720 --> 04:58.480
can help us know how our brain works.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.480
Another point is that

05:00.480 --> 05:01.320
many...

05:01.320 --> 05:04.320
We already know that there are many neurological disorders.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.600
It actually has something to do with

05:07.600 --> 05:12.600
the wiring of the neural circuit.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.920
Like schizophrenia,

05:15.920 --> 05:16.760
phrenia,

05:16.760 --> 05:21.440
or some psychological diseases.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.760
It actually has something to do with it.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.200
If we know how the normal brain works,

05:26.200 --> 05:29.760
we can further study

05:29.760 --> 05:32.400
the causes of these disorders.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.520
I hope to get some answers

05:36.520 --> 05:38.400
to help these patients.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.640
So far,

05:42.680 --> 05:46.200
there are many different tools

05:46.200 --> 05:47.840
that have been developed

05:47.840 --> 05:50.240
to help us understand

05:50.240 --> 05:51.520
how to dissect,

05:51.520 --> 05:55.360
that is, to analyze the entire brain circuit

05:55.360 --> 05:57.760
or neural connection.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.600
Here are some examples that are commonly used.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.800
For example, Serial Electron Microscopy,

06:04.800 --> 06:06.720
which is an electronic microscope.

06:09.360 --> 06:15.200
There is another one called GRASP.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.640
Its full name is

06:16.640 --> 06:21.600
GFP Green Fluorescent Protein Reconstitution

06:21.600 --> 06:24.160
Across Synaptic Partner.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.680
This means that it has a fluorescent protein

06:26.680 --> 06:29.640
that divides engineering into two parts.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.200
I will explain this later.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.280
There is also Tango.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.760
There is another popular tool

06:40.760 --> 06:42.840
called Rabie Virus

06:42.840 --> 06:45.520
to trace neural connection.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.040
These are all great tools,

06:51.040 --> 06:54.320
but they all have different

06:55.320 --> 06:56.560
shortcomings.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.920
For example, Serial EM

06:58.920 --> 07:02.240
is to take a small sample

07:02.240 --> 07:05.760
and cut it into pieces.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.880
Then use EM to take the whole image

07:09.880 --> 07:13.880
and then reconstruct it.

07:13.880 --> 07:18.240
Then look at its very fine-detailed

07:20.120 --> 07:21.240
neural morphology

07:21.480 --> 07:25.120
or the connection of different neural cells.

07:25.120 --> 07:30.160
Usually, a small one-millimeter-cube

07:32.040 --> 07:34.880
size sample

07:34.880 --> 07:38.920
takes about five or six years

07:38.920 --> 07:42.800
to complete its analysis.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.680
It also requires a lot of human power.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.000
So this is not a very efficient method.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.800
Because it is not very efficient,

07:53.800 --> 07:59.040
it can only analyze a small sample of an animal.

07:59.040 --> 08:03.320
If you want to analyze 10 different animals,

08:03.320 --> 08:04.320
different variations,

08:04.320 --> 08:06.600
it may be a bit difficult

08:06.600 --> 08:09.360
or require more time and more manpower.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.480
Another is CRESP, a genetic tool.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.880
It can be used in

08:15.880 --> 08:18.320
mice or

08:18.320 --> 08:21.120
I'm going to talk about Drosophila fruit flies.

08:21.120 --> 08:25.800
It is mainly divided into two parts of this fluorescent protein.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.040
Normally, it emits green light.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.120
After dividing it into two parts,

08:30.120 --> 08:32.680
they will not emit light.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.960
Only when the two parts are very close,

08:34.960 --> 08:38.800
they will be re-combined

08:41.640 --> 08:43.280
like this.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.480
So the two parts themselves do not emit light.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.280
When they are re-combined, they will emit light,

08:48.280 --> 08:50.120
and you can see the green light.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.800
Then it can detect

08:53.120 --> 08:57.880
that two cells are close to each other.

08:57.880 --> 09:02.440
Its disadvantage is that

09:04.240 --> 09:05.080
it...

09:08.600 --> 09:09.440
Sorry.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.520
It can only see where it is in contact with.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.560
It can't make any further modifications

09:18.560 --> 09:20.600
to affect cell poverty.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.720
In addition,

09:21.720 --> 09:26.720
its binding is irreversible.

09:26.720 --> 09:31.360
So there is a concern that

09:31.360 --> 09:35.280
it may affect the connection between the cells.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.640
The dynamic.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.920
Connection to dynamic.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.800
Another system is called Tango.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.400
It mainly has a G-protein couple receptor.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.760
Its feature is that

09:48.760 --> 09:51.040
when it binds its ligand,

09:51.040 --> 09:54.400
it will recruit a protein called arresting.

09:54.400 --> 09:58.120
Arresting comes to activate

09:58.120 --> 10:03.120
its downstream signaling transduction.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.800
Then the engineer added a protease to this protein.

10:08.800 --> 10:13.600
Then this receptor has a transcription factor.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.400
Then there is a sequence in front of it

10:15.400 --> 10:18.680
that will be cut by this protease.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.600
So when the protein is binded,

10:21.600 --> 10:23.280
the protease will cut this part.

10:23.280 --> 10:28.280
Then it will release the intracellular transcription factor

10:29.360 --> 10:32.000
and drive downstream gene excretion.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.920
Its advantage is that

10:36.920 --> 10:40.840
it has these reported proteins,

10:42.320 --> 10:43.800
either fluorescent proteins

10:43.800 --> 10:47.880
or mutant proteins.

10:49.360 --> 10:54.360
You can control some of the features in its cells.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.680
But the disadvantage is that

11:02.680 --> 11:05.960
it is only limited to G-protein couple receptors.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.480
In our neural system,

11:10.480 --> 11:11.320
there are many...

11:13.160 --> 11:14.800
For example, this is a dopamine receptor.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.840
It is a G-protein couple receptor.

11:16.840 --> 11:21.640
But there are many receptors that are just IN channels.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.920
So it can't be used in this place.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.680
In the mammalian,

11:30.680 --> 11:35.680
there is a very popular tool

11:35.720 --> 11:40.480
called re-engineering the RebVirus.

11:40.480 --> 11:45.480
It can monosynaptically trace upstream neurons.

11:48.480 --> 11:53.480
The point that needs to be considered

11:53.960 --> 11:57.360
is that we need to do surgery

11:57.360 --> 12:00.360
to inject this virus into the brain

12:00.360 --> 12:03.080
to express,

12:03.080 --> 12:06.480
to let this virus

12:06.480 --> 12:11.480
to transmit to its Gag cells.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.560
It has cytotoxicity.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.200
So usually the research

12:16.200 --> 12:19.240
can only be completed within a week.

12:19.240 --> 12:20.840
Otherwise, the cells will die.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.040
But another point is that

12:24.040 --> 12:29.040
I just mentioned that it can only be used in the mammalian.

12:33.200 --> 12:37.000
Even so, its efficiency is not very good.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.440
I have tried this tool before.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.160
Different brain regions.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.760
Some brain regions may have special neurons.

12:45.760 --> 12:50.760
It's harder to let the RebVirus

12:52.200 --> 12:55.040
jump to their upstream partner.

12:57.480 --> 13:01.960
So the important purpose of my research

13:02.000 --> 13:04.880
is to generate a system

13:04.880 --> 13:09.240
that can be used on all transgenic animals.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.480
I hope it won't have any toxicity.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.680
So we can safely study

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
the property and function of these cells.

13:23.400 --> 13:28.280
In addition to tracing the neuron

13:28.280 --> 13:31.360
or the connection between the cells,

13:31.720 --> 13:34.000
we can also manipulate their property.

13:36.760 --> 13:41.760
So my main design here is that

13:42.240 --> 13:46.560
if a cell, not necessarily a neuron,

13:46.560 --> 13:50.240
has a ligand

13:50.240 --> 13:55.240
and the other cells have a corresponding receptor,

13:56.120 --> 14:01.120
when these two cells have contact,

14:02.040 --> 14:06.440
the binding will generate a cell signaling

14:06.440 --> 14:09.240
to the downstream cell.

14:10.360 --> 14:15.360
Then we can either express some fluorescent reporter protein,

14:16.680 --> 14:21.680
or express some gene or mutant that we are interested in.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.080
Or it can be RNAi.

14:25.080 --> 14:29.080
So here, we used a very important

14:29.080 --> 14:34.080
signaling pathway in animals,

14:34.080 --> 14:38.080
Delta protein and Notch protein's signaling pathway.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.080
So let me briefly introduce

14:40.080 --> 14:42.080
the structure of Notch protein.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.080
It has a very long hRSA domain.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.080
Most of it is EGF repeat.

14:48.080 --> 14:52.080
This domain will bind its ligand, Delta,

14:53.080 --> 14:58.080
and when they bind,

14:58.080 --> 15:03.080
the current hypothesis is that

15:03.080 --> 15:06.080
if the ligand is endocytosed,

15:06.080 --> 15:11.080
that is, if it is brought in by the cell membrane,

15:11.080 --> 15:13.080
it will generate a force.

15:13.080 --> 15:18.080
It will open this structure called NRR.

15:19.080 --> 15:24.080
After Notch binds,

15:24.080 --> 15:29.080
there will be two cutting points

15:29.080 --> 15:34.080
that will be cut off by Proteus.

15:34.080 --> 15:39.080
One is S2 and the other is S3.

15:39.080 --> 15:43.080
So the original S2 cutting point

15:43.080 --> 15:46.080
is in the NRR structure.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.080
So it's embedded inside the structure,

15:51.080 --> 15:56.080
and Proteus can't digest the S2 site.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.080
So it won't be cut off

16:02.080 --> 16:04.080
until Delta binds.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.080
After it binds, it opens this structure,

16:08.080 --> 16:12.080
and the S2 site can be cut off.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.080
Next, its transmembrane domain

16:15.080 --> 16:17.080
also has a cutting point called S3.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.080
S3 will also be cut off.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.080
Then its intracellular domain

16:23.080 --> 16:25.080
is a transcription factor.

16:25.080 --> 16:28.080
It can move to the cell membrane

16:28.080 --> 16:33.080
to activate downstream gene expression.

16:34.080 --> 16:40.080
So here we use this logic.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.080
We replace some domains

16:44.080 --> 16:49.080
that will affect the cell's endogenous domain,

16:49.080 --> 16:51.080
like EGF repeat,

16:51.080 --> 16:53.080
it will bind the endogenous Delta ligand.

16:53.080 --> 17:00.080
So we replace it with an antibody here.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.080
Then its intracellular domain

17:02.080 --> 17:06.080
will drive endogenous downstream gene expression.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
So we also replace it

17:07.080 --> 17:11.080
with a yeast transcription factor called GAL4.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.080
So our idea is that

17:19.080 --> 17:22.080
our new synthetic receptor

17:22.080 --> 17:26.080
can recognize its own ligand.

17:26.080 --> 17:29.080
I'm using CD19 here.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.080
After it binds,

17:33.080 --> 17:36.080
it uses the NRR domain in the middle

17:36.080 --> 17:38.080
and transmembrane domain.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.080
It will have S2, S3 cleavage.

17:41.080 --> 17:47.080
Then it will release intracellular GAL4.

17:47.080 --> 17:52.080
Then it can drive either GFP

17:52.080 --> 17:55.080
or any gene expression.

17:55.080 --> 17:58.080
It depends on what kind of study we want to do.

18:00.080 --> 18:05.080
We call this whole section track.

18:05.080 --> 18:10.080
It's Transcellular Activation of Transcription.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.080
First, I'll test

18:15.080 --> 18:20.080
whether our designed ligand and receptor can work.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.080
So we use it in the cell line.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.080
Here I show you the control.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.080
Red represents the ligand.

18:29.080 --> 18:33.080
The cell line with or without ligand.

18:35.080 --> 18:40.080
My reporter is GFP.

18:40.080 --> 18:47.080
So when you see the cell with receptor,

18:47.080 --> 18:49.080
it has no GFP

18:49.080 --> 18:53.080
because the co-culture cell has no ligand.

18:53.080 --> 18:59.080
When I change the co-culture cell

19:00.080 --> 19:05.080
to the cell with CD19,

19:05.080 --> 19:13.080
you can see that most of the receptors

19:13.080 --> 19:16.080
and positive cells

19:16.080 --> 19:21.080
start to show GFP.

19:22.080 --> 19:29.080
Here you can see the difference in the amount of GFP.

19:29.080 --> 19:34.080
You can see that the amount of GFP

19:34.080 --> 19:37.080
increases with the co-culture time.

19:37.080 --> 19:42.080
The blue line is the control cell.

19:42.080 --> 19:46.080
The orange line is the test group.

19:47.080 --> 19:53.080
To make sure that they have cell-cell contact,

19:53.080 --> 19:57.080
not because my ligand-positive cell

19:57.080 --> 20:00.080
releases any weird factor

20:00.080 --> 20:03.080
to trigger the downstream gene expression.

20:03.080 --> 20:11.080
So I put the receptor cell

20:11.080 --> 20:14.080
and the ligand-positive cell

20:14.080 --> 20:18.080
in the same play.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.080
But I put less CD19.

20:20.080 --> 20:25.080
So they generate their own colonies.

20:25.080 --> 20:30.080
When they grow up,

20:30.080 --> 20:32.080
only when the two colonies

20:32.080 --> 20:34.080
have direct contact with each other,

20:34.080 --> 20:37.080
the ligand-cell line and the receptor-cell line

20:37.080 --> 20:39.080
will have contact.

20:39.080 --> 20:45.080
This is the receptor-positive colony.

20:45.080 --> 20:48.080
This is the ligand-positive colony.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.080
Only when they have direct contact with each other,

20:52.080 --> 20:57.080
the cells produce green ligand.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.080
The rest are dark.

21:01.080 --> 21:05.080
We use the cell-cell line to prove

21:05.080 --> 21:10.080
that our system can function normally

21:10.080 --> 21:14.080
and detect cell-cell contact.

21:14.080 --> 21:18.080
We hope to use it in the in vivo system.

21:18.080 --> 21:22.080
We use the fruit-gene model.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.080
It is a well-established genetic model.

21:28.080 --> 21:35.080
We have a lot of tools to study it.

21:35.080 --> 21:39.080
The life cycle is relatively short.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.080
The fruit-gene model is about two weeks

21:43.080 --> 21:48.080
from the soft to the mature.

21:48.080 --> 21:53.080
The most important thing is that

21:53.080 --> 21:58.080
the nerve system is similar to the mammalian brain.

21:58.080 --> 22:03.080
We hope to use the nerve system

22:03.080 --> 22:08.080
to imply the mammalian brain.

22:08.080 --> 22:13.080
We hope to use the nerve system

22:13.080 --> 22:18.080
to imply the mammalian brain.

22:18.080 --> 22:24.080
Let me briefly introduce the central nervous system of Drosophila.

22:24.080 --> 22:30.080
They still have neurons and glia.

22:30.080 --> 22:35.080
Their neurons are not like our brain.

22:35.080 --> 22:40.080
There are a bunch of neurons in the brain.

22:40.080 --> 22:45.080
Their synapses are in the same area.

22:45.080 --> 22:50.080
Drosophila's cell body is mainly

22:50.080 --> 22:55.080
around the edge of the nervous system.

22:55.080 --> 23:00.080
around the edge of the nervous system.

23:00.080 --> 23:05.080
These regions have no synapses or connections.

23:05.080 --> 23:10.080
These regions have no synapses or connections.

23:10.080 --> 23:15.080
This is the area where the synapse is located.

23:15.080 --> 23:20.080
This is the area where the synapse is located.

23:20.080 --> 23:25.080
Besides neurons, there are many other glia cells.

23:25.080 --> 23:30.080
I will introduce these in more detail later.

23:30.080 --> 23:35.080
I will introduce these in more detail later.

23:35.080 --> 23:40.080
One thing to remember is that

23:40.080 --> 23:45.080
most of the things I will talk about later are not neurons.

23:45.080 --> 23:50.080
most of the things I will talk about later are not neurons.

23:50.080 --> 23:55.080
First, we want to test

23:55.080 --> 24:00.080
whether our system can detect any different cell-cell contact.

24:00.080 --> 24:05.080
First, we want to test

24:05.080 --> 24:10.080
whether our system can detect any different cell-cell contact.

24:10.080 --> 24:15.080
Next, we want to see

24:15.080 --> 24:25.080
whether our system can detect

24:25.080 --> 24:30.080
neural-to-neural contact.

24:30.080 --> 24:35.080
Next, we want to see

24:35.080 --> 24:40.080
whether our system can detect

24:40.080 --> 24:45.080
neural-to-neural contact.

24:45.080 --> 24:50.080
First, it's glial-to-neural.

24:50.080 --> 24:55.080
There are different types of glial cells

24:55.080 --> 25:00.080
in ToSoftware.

25:00.080 --> 25:05.080
Different glial cells

25:05.080 --> 25:10.080
have different levels of contact.

25:10.080 --> 25:15.080
For example,

25:15.080 --> 25:20.080
surface glial

25:20.080 --> 25:25.080
is like a protective film.

25:25.080 --> 25:30.080
They don't have much contact

25:30.080 --> 25:35.080
with other types of glial cells.

25:35.080 --> 25:40.080
For example, cortex glial

25:40.080 --> 25:45.080
is protected by

25:45.080 --> 25:50.080
neural soma.

25:50.080 --> 25:55.080
Astrocyte is infiltrated

25:55.080 --> 26:00.080
by synapse.

26:00.080 --> 26:05.080
Different types of astrocyte

26:05.080 --> 26:10.080
have more contact with neural soma.

26:10.080 --> 26:15.080
First,

26:15.080 --> 26:20.080
if a person is in a glial cell,

26:20.080 --> 26:27.080
can we detect neural-to-neural contact?

26:27.080 --> 26:32.080
We display receptor protein

26:32.080 --> 26:37.080
in all neurons.

26:37.080 --> 26:42.080
Next, we display it

26:42.080 --> 26:47.080
in glial cell ligand.

26:47.080 --> 26:52.080
The diagram shows

26:52.080 --> 26:57.080
the lava brain of Drosophila.

26:57.080 --> 27:02.080
There are two parts, the central brain

27:02.080 --> 27:07.080
and the ventral nerve core,

27:07.080 --> 27:12.080
which is like the spinal cord.

27:12.080 --> 27:17.080
If there is no ligand,

27:17.080 --> 27:22.080
Drosophila's background is weak.

27:22.080 --> 27:27.080
Only in other tissues.

27:27.080 --> 27:32.080
When ligand is shown in astrocytes,

27:32.080 --> 27:37.080
many neurons are labeled.

27:37.080 --> 27:42.080
This is because

27:42.080 --> 27:47.080
ligand and receptor are combined

27:47.080 --> 27:52.080
to trigger GFP protein.

27:52.080 --> 27:57.080
This is another driver.

27:57.080 --> 28:02.080
It is called ELAM.

28:02.080 --> 28:07.080
This is an astrocyte-specific gene.

28:07.080 --> 28:12.080
As you can see,

28:12.080 --> 28:17.080
ligand is shown in astrocytes.

28:17.080 --> 28:22.080
Ripple is shown in glial cells.

28:22.080 --> 28:27.080
The pattern is different.

28:27.080 --> 28:32.080
The pattern is different.

28:32.080 --> 28:37.080
The pattern is different.

28:37.080 --> 28:42.080
I will zoom in later.

28:42.080 --> 28:47.080
I will zoom in later.

28:47.080 --> 28:52.080
We don't see much GFP expression.

28:52.080 --> 28:57.080
We don't see much GFP expression.

28:57.080 --> 29:02.080
I will zoom in later.

29:02.080 --> 29:07.080
I will zoom in later.

29:07.080 --> 29:12.080
I will zoom in later.

29:12.080 --> 29:17.080
I will zoom in later.

29:17.080 --> 29:22.080
We don't see much ligand expression.

29:22.080 --> 29:27.080
We don't see much ligand expression.

29:27.080 --> 29:32.080
The neurons project the process

29:32.080 --> 29:37.080
to the glial cells.

29:37.080 --> 29:42.080
to the glial cells.

29:42.080 --> 29:47.080
That's the reason

29:47.080 --> 29:52.080
the neurons show strong GFP expression.

29:52.080 --> 29:57.080
that's the reason the neurons show strong GFP expression.

29:57.080 --> 30:02.080
Now,

30:02.080 --> 30:07.080
this proves

30:07.080 --> 30:12.080
that this tool can work in Drosophila.

30:12.080 --> 30:17.080
Can we use our system

30:17.080 --> 30:22.080
to label astrocytes?

30:22.080 --> 30:27.080
Mainly because

30:27.080 --> 30:32.080
astrocytes has been proven

30:32.080 --> 30:37.080
to control synaptic function.

30:37.080 --> 30:42.080
to control synaptic function.

30:42.080 --> 30:47.080
It can adjust synaptic contact

30:47.080 --> 30:52.080
It can adjust synaptic contact

30:52.080 --> 30:57.080
to remove unused synaptic

30:57.080 --> 31:02.080
It can help synaptic formation

31:02.080 --> 31:07.080
It can help synaptic formation

31:07.080 --> 31:12.080
It can help synaptic formation

31:12.080 --> 31:17.080
astrocyte is able to help

31:17.080 --> 31:22.080
neurotransmitter

31:22.080 --> 31:26.080
it can control the neurotransmitter release

31:26.080 --> 31:33.080
It can control neuronal activity

31:33.080 --> 31:38.080
In theory, all these studies depict

31:38.080 --> 31:43.080
that astrocytes are homogenous

31:43.080 --> 31:48.080
So now they explore

31:48.080 --> 31:55.080
if you knock down gene function

31:55.080 --> 31:58.080
or mutate gene

31:58.080 --> 32:04.080
all the astrocytes will be affected

32:04.080 --> 32:08.080
Studies can't say

32:08.080 --> 32:11.080
I want to look at this area

32:11.080 --> 32:18.080
to change this part of the astrocyte

32:18.080 --> 32:24.080
to look at the specific function of this part of the astrocyte

32:24.080 --> 32:29.080
So we want to use our system

32:29.080 --> 32:33.080
if we can selectively label

32:33.080 --> 32:40.080
the neurons in the brain

32:40.080 --> 32:45.080
we can selectively label

32:45.080 --> 32:52.080
the astrocytes in the brain

32:52.080 --> 32:57.080
So our idea is

32:57.080 --> 33:02.080
we want to show the ligand in a different way

33:02.080 --> 33:04.080
in the neuron

33:04.080 --> 33:07.080
this neuron innovates this neuron

33:07.080 --> 33:12.080
There are many different astrocytes around here

33:12.080 --> 33:15.080
Maybe only a part of it will go to this place

33:15.080 --> 33:18.080
to control the function of this neuron

33:18.080 --> 33:21.080
We just want to selectively label this astrocyte

33:21.080 --> 33:28.080
and not this astrocyte

33:28.080 --> 33:35.080
So we want to show the receptor in all the astrocytes

33:35.080 --> 33:41.080
and show the ligand in different neurons

33:41.080 --> 33:48.080
and selectively label the sub-population of the astrocytes

33:48.080 --> 33:56.080
I hope we can study the astrocyte function more precisely after the improvement

33:56.080 --> 34:00.080
So the first thing I use is

34:00.080 --> 34:06.080
the same brain of the fruit fly

34:06.080 --> 34:12.080
The first choice is the mushroom body neuron

34:12.080 --> 34:24.080
There are about 600 mushroom body neurons called K-on cells in the brain

34:24.080 --> 34:30.080
The reason why people are interested in mushroom body

34:30.080 --> 34:38.080
is because it is an important structure of alphanumeric learning and memory

34:39.080 --> 34:43.080
So here we show you a control

34:43.080 --> 34:47.080
If there is no ligand in the K-on cells

34:47.080 --> 34:52.080
then we see very few alphanumeric cells

34:52.080 --> 34:56.080
The purple here is the glial cell marker

34:56.080 --> 35:00.080
So I just want to tell you

35:00.080 --> 35:05.080
After we label these cells, it will actually be a glial cell

35:06.080 --> 35:13.080
So when I show the ligand in the mushroom body

35:13.080 --> 35:21.080
We can see that we label the astrocytes around it

35:21.080 --> 35:25.080
So the red here is the mushroom body

35:26.080 --> 35:34.080
We can see that these astrocytes

35:34.080 --> 35:38.080
This is a single-plane confocal image

35:38.080 --> 35:42.080
So we can see that these astrocytes are really

35:42.080 --> 35:45.080
how to say

35:45.080 --> 35:50.080
next to the ligand positive neuron process

35:50.080 --> 35:54.080
They have intermingled to each other

35:54.080 --> 35:59.080
It's surrounded by the ligand positive cell

35:59.080 --> 36:04.080
We want to further test our system

36:04.080 --> 36:08.080
how robust our system is

36:08.080 --> 36:11.080
So we want to use fewer cells

36:11.080 --> 36:15.080
So there were about 600 mushroom body neurons

36:15.080 --> 36:20.080
Now there are only 21 alphanumeric neurons

36:20.080 --> 36:24.080
The alphanumeric neuron is the cell body

36:24.080 --> 36:27.080
It's at the tip of the head

36:27.080 --> 36:31.080
It will project a very long axon

36:31.080 --> 36:35.080
to the Drosophila lava brain

36:35.080 --> 36:38.080
This area is called the antenna lobe

36:38.080 --> 36:44.080
It's a bit like our mammalian sleeves

36:44.080 --> 36:49.080
They will receive the olfactory sensory input

36:49.080 --> 36:53.080
The first thing we see here is the control

36:53.080 --> 36:58.080
Without ligand, the antenna lobe is very clean

36:58.080 --> 37:06.080
When the ligand is shown in the olfactory sensory neuron axon terminal

37:07.080 --> 37:12.080
We can label these astrocytes

37:12.080 --> 37:17.080
that infiltrate the antenna lobe region

37:22.080 --> 37:26.080
We want to narrow it down further

37:26.080 --> 37:29.080
to four cells

37:29.080 --> 37:33.080
Here we use a PDF neuron

37:33.080 --> 37:37.080
It's a very important circadian pacemaker

37:37.080 --> 37:43.080
If you remember, this year's Nobel Peace Prize

37:43.080 --> 37:47.080
was about the function of the PDF neuron

37:47.080 --> 37:51.080
There are only four PDF neurons in the lava brain

37:51.080 --> 37:56.080
in each hemisphere

37:56.080 --> 38:00.080
They only have a very thin axon

38:01.080 --> 38:06.080
and project to the dorsal part of the brain

38:06.080 --> 38:11.080
We want to see if our system can detect

38:11.080 --> 38:21.080
such a small connection between the astrocyte and the axon

38:21.080 --> 38:23.080
Contact

38:23.080 --> 38:26.080
Here I show you the control

38:27.080 --> 38:31.080
I forgot to mention

38:31.080 --> 38:35.080
The PDF neurons I use

38:35.080 --> 38:40.080
are not only in the central brain

38:40.080 --> 38:44.080
but also in the ventral nerve core

38:44.080 --> 38:49.080
These are the PDF positive neurons

38:49.080 --> 38:55.080
I also look at the ventral nerve core

38:55.080 --> 39:00.080
Here we can see that the control is very clean

39:00.080 --> 39:05.080
If a ligand is present in the PDF neuron

39:05.080 --> 39:09.080
We can label the astrocytes

39:09.080 --> 39:13.080
that make contact with the PDF neuron

39:15.080 --> 39:19.080
Here I show you a few different samples

39:19.080 --> 39:24.080
We can see that our system is very consistent

39:24.080 --> 39:31.080
We can see consistent labeling in different animals

39:36.080 --> 39:40.080
The next question we want to ask is

39:40.080 --> 39:46.080
Can our system let us understand

39:47.080 --> 39:50.080
compared to the previous study

39:50.080 --> 39:57.080
what's the new thing that we can know by our system

39:57.080 --> 40:03.080
The previous study showed that

40:03.080 --> 40:10.080
the astrocyte in the ventral nerve core

40:10.080 --> 40:18.080
the distribution is very stereotypical

40:18.080 --> 40:22.080
Different astrocytes

40:22.080 --> 40:29.080
are located in different locations

40:29.080 --> 40:32.080
They are located in different locations

40:32.080 --> 40:36.080
They are located in a fixed area

40:36.080 --> 40:39.080
For example, the red astrocyte

40:39.080 --> 40:43.080
is in the dorsal lateral part of the ventral nerve core

40:43.080 --> 40:49.080
It only innovates the dorsal lateral part

40:49.080 --> 40:55.080
It only labels the lateral part of the ventral nerve core

40:55.080 --> 40:59.080
The yellow one is in the dorsal midline

40:59.080 --> 41:05.080
It labels the dorsal midline part of the ventral nerve core

41:05.080 --> 41:08.080
The astrocyte in the ventral part

41:08.080 --> 41:15.080
labels the ventral midline part of the ventral nerve core

41:15.080 --> 41:20.080
This study shows that

41:20.080 --> 41:23.080
the astrocyte is boring

41:23.080 --> 41:26.080
It doesn't change much

41:26.080 --> 41:32.080
The ventral nerve core is a very stereotypical structure

41:32.080 --> 41:37.080
It's a different repeat of the neural mirror

41:37.080 --> 41:44.080
It's a different repeat of the neural mirror

41:44.080 --> 41:47.080
It's a repeated circuit

41:47.080 --> 41:53.080
I don't know if the central brain has a more complex system

41:53.080 --> 41:56.080
I don't know if the central brain has a more complex system

41:56.080 --> 42:07.080
I use LIGAND to represent the Ophiatory Sensor Neuron

42:07.080 --> 42:17.080
I use LIGAND to represent the Ophiatory Sensor Neuron

42:17.080 --> 42:23.080
We want to know if the astrocyte near the ventral nerve

42:23.080 --> 42:28.080
has a different distribution

42:28.080 --> 42:33.080
We have the induction

42:33.080 --> 42:37.080
We divide the ventral nerve into 8 different areas

42:37.080 --> 42:44.080
I want to see where the astrocyte is

42:44.080 --> 42:49.080
I found that the cell body of the astrocyte

42:49.080 --> 42:54.080
I found that the cell body of the astrocyte

42:54.080 --> 42:57.080
is mainly in the medial part

42:57.080 --> 43:02.080
is mainly in the medial part

43:02.080 --> 43:10.080
the medial sector and the ventral lateral sector

43:10.080 --> 43:17.080
This is more in line with the previous research

43:17.080 --> 43:20.080
where is the astrocyte near the ventral nerve

43:20.080 --> 43:27.080
They also know that it is mainly in these two parts

43:27.080 --> 43:34.080
But further research on the distribution of different individuals

43:34.080 --> 43:47.080
I found that the astrocyte infiltration is different

43:47.080 --> 43:56.080
In the brain, the astrocyte is mainly located in the lateral part

43:56.080 --> 44:01.080
In the brain, the astrocyte is mainly located in the lateral part

44:01.080 --> 44:06.080
The astrocyte is mainly in the medial part

44:06.080 --> 44:12.080
The astrocyte is mainly in the medial part

44:12.080 --> 44:21.080
The two areas are only one astrocyte

44:21.080 --> 44:24.080
The two areas are only one astrocyte

44:24.080 --> 44:31.080
But in this area, I have labeled three different astrocytes

44:31.080 --> 44:39.080
In conclusion, in the central brain of Drosophila

44:39.080 --> 44:43.080
it is not as stereotypical as the ventral nerve core

44:43.080 --> 44:46.080
it has more diversity or change

44:46.080 --> 44:52.080
it has more diversity or change

44:52.080 --> 44:57.080
We hope that in the future

44:57.080 --> 45:04.080
we can use our system to manipulate the astrocyte properties

45:04.080 --> 45:10.080
and see if the population of the astrocyte

45:10.080 --> 45:15.080
will affect any special function

45:15.080 --> 45:18.080
or it actually needs a larger population

45:18.080 --> 45:21.080
or it actually needs a larger population

45:21.080 --> 45:30.080
to manipulate the neural signaling path

45:30.080 --> 45:36.080
In addition, I only study the astrocyte

45:36.080 --> 45:41.080
In the future, we hope to expand our tool

45:41.080 --> 45:43.080
In addition to the astrocyte glial cell

45:43.080 --> 45:46.080
we can study other different glial cells

45:46.080 --> 45:49.080
such as cortex glial

45:49.080 --> 45:53.080
It is wrapped outside the cell neurons

45:53.080 --> 45:58.080
Its function is probably very different from the astrocyte

45:58.080 --> 46:03.080
We hope to do further research in the future

46:03.080 --> 46:10.080
In the next part, I want to focus on neural-to-neural

46:11.080 --> 46:24.080
We use the same design

46:24.080 --> 46:29.080
to test whether it can be used in

46:29.080 --> 46:31.080
tracing neural-to-neural connection

46:31.080 --> 46:37.080
We mainly focus on Drosophila's olfactory system

46:37.080 --> 46:41.080
I mentioned the olfactory sensor neuron

46:46.080 --> 46:49.080
Why do we want to use this system?

46:49.080 --> 46:54.080
Because the connectome here has been studied very thoroughly

46:54.080 --> 46:59.080
It can be used in DSN or EM

46:59.080 --> 47:05.080
It can be used in DSN or EM

47:05.080 --> 47:07.080
So we know that

47:07.080 --> 47:14.080
if we express the ligand on a certain type of neuron

47:14.080 --> 47:18.080
it may be connected to some different neurons

47:18.080 --> 47:21.080
So we can know if our system

47:21.080 --> 47:24.080
has only labeled some new things

47:24.080 --> 47:28.080
or if it has missed some different things

47:28.080 --> 47:33.080
to test whether our system is perfect

47:34.080 --> 47:38.080
So in the antenna lobe

47:40.080 --> 47:44.080
the olfactory sensor neuron we just mentioned

47:44.080 --> 47:47.080
will project its axon to the antenna lobe

47:47.080 --> 47:51.080
Different olfactory sensor neurons

47:51.080 --> 47:55.080
will only show one olfactory receptor

47:56.080 --> 48:04.080
These olfactory sensor neurons

48:04.080 --> 48:07.080
will only innovate to a certain

48:07.080 --> 48:15.080
antenna lobe called gomulus

48:15.080 --> 48:23.080
It will be connected to a certain type of projection neuron

48:24.080 --> 48:29.080
The projection neuron is green

48:29.080 --> 48:34.080
It will pass the olfactory sensor input

48:34.080 --> 48:37.080
to the olfactory system

48:37.080 --> 48:39.080
like the mushroom body

48:39.080 --> 48:41.080
In addition to the projection neuron

48:41.080 --> 48:44.080
the antenna lobe has another type of neuron

48:44.080 --> 48:46.080
called local interneuron

48:46.080 --> 48:50.080
It is a GABAergic inhibitor neuron

48:50.080 --> 48:55.080
It will innovate the entire antenna lobe

48:55.080 --> 49:05.080
to be a bridge between different gomulus

49:08.080 --> 49:14.080
In the LABA central nervous system

49:14.080 --> 49:16.080
if there is no ligand

49:16.080 --> 49:21.080
we can see that the background is very weak

49:21.080 --> 49:26.080
There is no other labeling

49:26.080 --> 49:34.080
But if I put the ligand in the olfactory sensor neuron

49:34.080 --> 49:36.080
we can see that

49:36.080 --> 49:45.080
we can label a few downstream neurons

49:46.080 --> 49:50.080
There are some markers

49:50.080 --> 49:55.080
These neurons are GABAergic neurons

49:55.080 --> 50:01.080
It means that they are local interneurons

50:01.080 --> 50:05.080
But in this case

50:05.080 --> 50:09.080
we don't see the main projection neurons

50:09.080 --> 50:11.080
being labeled

50:11.080 --> 50:13.080
So

50:13.080 --> 50:15.080
So

50:15.080 --> 50:17.080
So

50:17.080 --> 50:19.080
So

50:19.080 --> 50:21.080
So

50:21.080 --> 50:23.080
So

50:23.080 --> 50:27.080
In the current design

50:27.080 --> 50:32.080
The track system

50:32.080 --> 50:34.080
is not yet

50:34.080 --> 50:36.080
How to say

50:36.080 --> 50:38.080
optimized

50:38.080 --> 50:40.080
to detect

50:40.080 --> 50:42.080
neural neural contact

50:42.080 --> 50:44.080
So

50:44.080 --> 50:48.080
We missed a lot

50:48.080 --> 50:52.080
We want to say that there will be labels

50:52.080 --> 50:54.080
Maybe

50:54.080 --> 50:56.080
labeled neurons

50:56.080 --> 50:58.080
So in the future

50:58.080 --> 51:02.080
we may need to make further improvements

51:02.080 --> 51:04.080
to improve our system

51:04.080 --> 51:08.080
to make use of the new neural circuits

51:08.080 --> 51:13.080
There are some new promising results

51:13.080 --> 51:17.080
Hope to share with you soon

51:23.080 --> 51:25.080
I think that's it

51:25.080 --> 51:27.080
Thank you

51:34.080 --> 51:40.080
Hello

51:40.080 --> 51:49.080
How this is

51:49.080 --> 51:56.080
Hello

51:56.080 --> 52:01.080
Hi

52:01.080 --> 52:06.080
Hello

52:06.080 --> 52:08.080
Can you hear me?

52:08.080 --> 52:10.080
Yes

52:10.080 --> 52:14.080
I see a question

52:14.080 --> 52:19.080
Can we use it on humans?

52:19.080 --> 52:23.080
At the moment, we can't

52:23.080 --> 52:27.080
Because we can't

52:28.080 --> 52:32.080
Because my system is mainly used on

52:32.080 --> 52:34.080
transgenic animals

52:34.080 --> 52:37.080
So I don't know if CRISPR

52:37.080 --> 52:39.080
will develop to what level

52:39.080 --> 52:43.080
Will it be able to generate transgenic humans?

52:43.080 --> 52:45.080
If it doesn't work

52:45.080 --> 52:47.080
then we probably

52:47.080 --> 52:49.080
can't use it

52:49.080 --> 52:51.080
And

52:52.080 --> 52:56.080
But the advantage of this tool is

52:56.080 --> 53:01.080
we can use it on different animals

53:01.080 --> 53:04.080
If CRISPR is so successful

53:04.080 --> 53:07.080
then it can be very convenient

53:07.080 --> 53:11.080
to use it on transgenic

53:11.080 --> 53:14.080
like a fish

53:14.080 --> 53:17.080
or other non-genetic

53:17.080 --> 53:21.080
or other non-genetic

53:21.080 --> 53:25.080
For example

53:25.080 --> 53:29.080
I saw a dolphin

53:29.080 --> 53:33.080
It has a very special behavior

53:33.080 --> 53:37.080
It draws a beautiful picture to attract the opposite sex

53:37.080 --> 53:41.080
I think its neural circuit is really amazing

53:41.080 --> 53:43.080
I want to study it

53:44.080 --> 53:46.080
If we use my tool

53:46.080 --> 53:48.080
and add CRISPR

53:48.080 --> 53:54.080
I think it can be used on different animals

53:54.080 --> 53:57.080
That is to say

53:57.080 --> 53:59.080
But

53:59.080 --> 54:03.080
We still need to improve

54:03.080 --> 54:07.080
to make my system more promising

54:07.080 --> 54:09.080
more robust

54:10.080 --> 54:12.080
And

54:12.080 --> 54:16.080
I don't know if there are any other questions

54:26.080 --> 54:28.080
Hello

54:31.080 --> 54:33.080
I have a question

54:33.080 --> 54:36.080
It's a simple question

54:36.080 --> 54:40.080
Do you experiment with mice?

54:40.080 --> 54:42.080
Is it a mouse?

54:42.080 --> 54:44.080
Or a bird?

54:44.080 --> 54:46.080
You just said a mouse

54:46.080 --> 54:48.080
Do you experiment with a bird?

54:48.080 --> 54:50.080
Yes

54:50.080 --> 54:52.080
Is it alive?

54:55.080 --> 54:58.080
The experiments on behavior are all alive

54:58.080 --> 55:01.080
But in the end we need to sacrifice them

55:01.080 --> 55:06.080
and study the changes in their brains

55:06.080 --> 55:08.080
or something

55:08.080 --> 55:14.080
Is it still alive?

55:14.080 --> 55:19.080
Is it conscious?

55:19.080 --> 55:22.080
Or is it dead?

55:22.080 --> 55:25.080
Just take out its brain

55:25.080 --> 55:27.080
and see what happens

55:27.080 --> 55:29.080
Both

55:29.080 --> 55:33.080
Now we have a postdoc

55:33.080 --> 55:35.080
He is using

55:35.080 --> 55:39.080
He is making a miniature microscope

55:41.080 --> 55:43.080
Let me see if I can

55:48.080 --> 55:50.080
Sorry, can you hear me?

55:50.080 --> 55:52.080
Yes

55:54.080 --> 55:56.080
Our house was on fire

55:56.080 --> 55:58.080
and I was kicked out

55:59.080 --> 56:01.080
What happened?

56:01.080 --> 56:03.080
Anyway, I was kicked out

56:03.080 --> 56:05.080
and now I'm back

56:05.080 --> 56:07.080
There is no internet out there

56:07.080 --> 56:09.080
It's ok

56:09.080 --> 56:11.080
You just said

56:11.080 --> 56:13.080
Yuqing

56:13.080 --> 56:15.080
Yuqing, right?

56:15.080 --> 56:17.080
Yes

56:17.080 --> 56:19.080
He asked

56:19.080 --> 56:21.080
Do you experiment with a mouse?

56:21.080 --> 56:23.080
Is it alive?

56:25.080 --> 56:27.080
The experiments on behavior are all alive

56:27.080 --> 56:29.080
We have a postdoc

56:29.080 --> 56:31.080
who made a small microscope

56:31.080 --> 56:33.080
and put it on their heads

56:33.080 --> 56:35.080
and put it on their heads

56:35.080 --> 56:37.080
and put it on their heads

56:37.080 --> 56:39.080
We hope that

56:39.080 --> 56:41.080
we can see

56:41.080 --> 56:43.080
and add some

56:43.080 --> 56:45.080
photoreceptors

56:45.080 --> 56:47.080
and they can see

56:47.080 --> 56:49.080
the neural activity

56:49.080 --> 56:51.080
We want to use these two things

56:51.080 --> 56:53.080
to see the brain of a living animal

56:53.080 --> 56:55.080
to see the brain of a living animal

56:55.080 --> 56:57.080
how a living animal

56:57.080 --> 56:59.080
how a living animal

56:59.080 --> 57:01.080
how a living animal

57:01.080 --> 57:03.080
lives

57:07.080 --> 57:09.080
Most of the cases are

57:09.080 --> 57:11.080
after we do the research

57:11.080 --> 57:13.080
even after the behavior

57:13.080 --> 57:15.080
we will sacrifice the mouse

57:15.080 --> 57:17.080
we will sacrifice the mouse

57:17.080 --> 57:19.080
and then see

57:19.080 --> 57:21.080
whether our modifications

57:21.080 --> 57:23.080
have changed

57:23.080 --> 57:25.080
whether our modifications

57:25.080 --> 57:27.080
have changed

57:29.080 --> 57:31.080
How do I get my video out?

57:47.080 --> 57:49.080
I feel like you said

57:49.080 --> 57:51.080
you made the microscope very small

57:51.080 --> 57:53.080
and then put it on your head

57:53.080 --> 57:55.080
and look at it

57:55.080 --> 57:57.080
I feel like it's amazing

57:57.080 --> 57:59.080
There is a company

57:59.080 --> 58:01.080
that specializes in

58:01.080 --> 58:03.080
selling this device

58:03.080 --> 58:05.080
selling this device

58:05.080 --> 58:07.080
selling a super small microscope

58:07.080 --> 58:09.080
selling a super small microscope

58:09.080 --> 58:11.080
but it still has some

58:11.080 --> 58:13.080
but it still has some

58:13.080 --> 58:15.080
disadvantages

58:15.080 --> 58:17.080
like it can't adjust

58:17.080 --> 58:19.080
focus

58:19.080 --> 58:21.080
it can only observe

58:21.080 --> 58:23.080
the surface

58:23.080 --> 58:25.080
the surface

58:25.080 --> 58:27.080
of the brain

58:33.080 --> 58:35.080
Isn't that supposed to be

58:35.080 --> 58:37.080
on the head?

58:37.080 --> 58:39.080
Isn't that supposed to be

58:39.080 --> 58:41.080
on the head?

58:41.080 --> 58:43.080
Isn't that supposed to be

58:43.080 --> 58:45.080
on the head?

58:49.080 --> 58:51.080
Do you have that

58:51.080 --> 58:53.080
Do you have that

58:53.080 --> 58:55.080
I can't remember his name

58:55.080 --> 58:57.080
I can't remember his name

58:57.080 --> 58:59.080
I can't remember his name

58:59.080 --> 59:01.080
Let me think

59:01.080 --> 59:03.080
KALTECH

59:03.080 --> 59:05.080
Ni Yuli

59:05.080 --> 59:07.080
Ni Yuli

59:07.080 --> 59:09.080
Did you talk to him?

59:09.080 --> 59:11.080
because they now

59:11.080 --> 59:13.080
do non-invasive

59:13.080 --> 59:15.080
do non-invasive

59:15.080 --> 59:17.080
and they want to

59:17.080 --> 59:19.080
the firing pattern

59:19.080 --> 59:21.080
the firing pattern

59:21.080 --> 59:23.080
but they want to

59:23.080 --> 59:25.080
do it on people

59:25.080 --> 59:27.080
because you can't

59:27.080 --> 59:29.080
do it on people

59:29.080 --> 59:31.080
and I was thinking

59:31.080 --> 59:33.080
I don't know if you talked about this

59:33.080 --> 59:35.080
I posted a question

59:35.080 --> 59:37.080
because

59:37.080 --> 59:39.080
if you do it like this

59:39.080 --> 59:41.080
either

59:41.080 --> 59:43.080
Guoying's head

59:43.080 --> 59:45.080
has to be very transparent

59:45.080 --> 59:47.080
or you have to

59:47.080 --> 59:49.080
put something on the rat's bone

59:49.080 --> 59:51.080
but I don't think it's possible on people

59:51.080 --> 59:53.080
yeah

59:53.080 --> 59:55.080
because

59:55.080 --> 59:57.080
my system

59:57.080 --> 59:59.080
has two things

59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.080
you have to etopic express

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.080
two ligand and receptor

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.080
and reporter, three

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.080
yeah

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.080
if you can't

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.080
do something like

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.080
transgenic animal or

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.080
other virus

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.080
there's nothing you can do

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.080
and human brain

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.080
has limitations

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.080
but

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.080
I mentioned

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.080
I don't know if you're here

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.080
and

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.080
CRISPR

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.080
is very popular

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.080
it can

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.080
make it easier

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.080
for us

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.080
to change

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.080
different animal

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.080
genetic profile

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.080
you can do transgenic animal

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.080
so

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.080
using

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.080
CRISPR

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.080
we should have more opportunities

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.080
to test on different

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.080
animals

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.080
like rabies virus

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.080
this

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.080
tool is very good

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.080
there's a lot of paper

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.080
published

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.080
but the problem is

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.080
we can't use

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.080
on birds

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.080
because

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.080
birds can't get rabies

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.080
that's rabies virus

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.080
so

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.080
this tool

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.080
because it's transgenic

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.080
if CRISPR looks promising

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.080
we can use it

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.080
on different animals

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.080
like I mentioned

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.080
I saw

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.080
dolphin

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.080
not dolphin

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.080
dolphin

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.080
puffer fish

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.080
puffer fish

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.080
dolphin

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.080
it has

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.080
a very strange

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.080
behavior

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.080
it will draw

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.080
on the sand

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.080
very

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.080
symmetric pattern

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.080
to attract

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.080
it will feel

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.080
amazing

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.080
if I have a chance

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.080
I want to study

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.080
animal brain

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.080
really?

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.080
why?

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.080
I don't know

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.080
but the pattern

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.080
it draws

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.080
is like

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.080
wheat field

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.080
very big

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.080
like this

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.080
for its size

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.080
it's big

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.080
so I think

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.080
it's interesting

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.080
ok

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.080
but for humans

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.080
because it's transgenic

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.080
the tool we can use

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.080
is functional MRI

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.080
but

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.080
it can't be that good

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.080
so I'm

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.080
thinking

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.080
how to

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.080
understand

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.080
our

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.080
animal brain

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.080
I was thinking

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.080
if you change

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.080
LIGAND to

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.080
some

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.080
magnetic field

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.080
or electrical field

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.080
you can use

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.080
MRI

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.080
to locate it

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.080
but the resolution

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.080
is not high enough

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.080
it looks like a piece

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.080
here and there

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.080
so it's useless

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.080
yes

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.080
I remember

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.080
I saw

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.080
a speech

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.080
he was using

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.080
X-ray

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.080
to look at

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.080
the structure

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.080
of the brain

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.080
he

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.080
he chose

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.080
very small

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.080
X-ray is very traditional

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.080
so I think

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.080
they want to say

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.080
if they use X-ray

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.080
to dissect the brain

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.080
the resolution will be good

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.080
maybe in the future

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.080
it can be used

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.080
in human

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.080
or large animals

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.080
ok

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.080
like this

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.080
but

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.080
I don't know

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.080
how much

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.080
it can be

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.080
maybe in the future

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.080
maybe

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.080
I think

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.080
there's a big gap

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.080
I think

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.080
animal model

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.080
can help a lot

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.080
but animal model

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.080
and human

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.080
there's a gap

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.080
both sides

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.080
both sides

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.080
don't know how to cross

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.080
there's no bridge

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.080
yes

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.080
maybe

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.080
the closest

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.080
is

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.080
primate

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.080
primate

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.080
yes

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080
I think

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.080
especially in my department

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.080
it's very obvious

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.080
if it's primate

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.080
it's

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.080
obvious

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.080
like

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.080
aggression

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.080
mating behavior

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.080
or even

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.080
hierarchy

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.080
but if it's higher

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.080
like stroke

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.080
primate

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.080
it's very close

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.080
but if it's

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.080
social, complicated social behavior

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.080
like

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.080
psychology

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.080
people do jealousy

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.080
this thing

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.080
I've heard people say

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.080
that

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.080
they do love

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.080
on mice

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.080
and they say

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.080
it's not just mating, it's love

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.080
and I think

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.080
how do you know what love is

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.080
it hurts

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.080
yes

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.080
yes

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.080
so

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.080
I was thinking

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.080
this system

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.080
the limit

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.080
but

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.080
on human

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.080
there's still

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.080
human

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.080
brain function

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.080
limitation

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.080
yes

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.080
yes

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.080
yes

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.080
but

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.080
human

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.080
can't do research

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.080
yes

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.080
but I think it's cool

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.080
I think your

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.080
resolution is really high

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.080
it's quite

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.080
quite big

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.080
I don't know where the people in the front sit

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.080
but I feel it's quite amazing

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.080
and

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.080
it increases a lot

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.080
you can see very detailed things

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.080
actually

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.080
because it's mainly

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.080
social contact

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.080
so it depends on

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.080
we can test

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.080
its sensitivity

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.080
what minimal

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.080
area you need

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.080
to detect

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.080
to see the difference

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.080
so

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.080
yes

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.080
it depends on

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.080
how much

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.080
you can touch

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.080
and your

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.080
concentration

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.080
is it high enough

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.080
to see

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.080
downstream

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.080
but you can

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.080
adjust it

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.080
my main work

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.080
is to adjust

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.080
this tool

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.080
so it can be used

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.080
on

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.080
neural circuits

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.080
and

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.080
yes

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.080
don't

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.080
I'm the only one talking

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.080
do you have questions?

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.080
do you have questions?

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.080
YuQing

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.080
asked a question

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.080
I don't know

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.080
is Jenny still here?

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.080
I don't know

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.080
I'm here

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.080
YuQing is here

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.080
Jenny

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.080
there's another one

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.080
I think

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.080
in the future

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.080
maybe

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.080
after more information

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.080
maybe

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.080
this is the basic

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.080
maybe in the future

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.080
we still need

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.080
telekinesis

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.080
or computer simulation

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.080
to understand

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.080
brain function

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.080
now

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.080
I can only provide a tool

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.080
or a blueprint

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.080
an established

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.080
blueprint

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.080
in the future

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.080
as I mentioned

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.080
we can adjust

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.080
the level

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.080
of cell poverty

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.080
to be more selective

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.080
to do research

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.080
do you have questions?

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.080
please

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.080
there's a medicine

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.080
called LSD

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.080
is it

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.080
I think

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.080
I don't know

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.080
if it's related

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.080
after taking the medicine

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.080
does the brain

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.080
how

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.080
is it related

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.080
to the research

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080
after taking it

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.080
LSD is

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.080
like

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.080
hallucination

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.080
it's like

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.080
I don't know

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.080
I don't know

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.080
it's mainly

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.080
related to

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.080
I'm not sure

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.080
what's it called

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.080
it's like

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.080
in the same place

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.080
I forgot the word

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.080
what's it called

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.080
it's in the

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.080
circuit

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.080
so

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.080
it's like

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.080
reward circuit

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.080
mainly in that part

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.080
like

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.080
that area

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.080
the brain area

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.080
it's related to

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.080
reward

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.080
and addiction

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.080
it's related

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.080
talking about

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.080
reward system

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.080
I'm not a

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.080
biopsychologist

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.080
but

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.080
reward system is very popular

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.080
you might have mentioned

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.080
but I missed it

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.080
besides addiction

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.080
it's also

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.080
like

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.080
many psychological diseases

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.080
like

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.080
autism

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.080
or

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.080
they have

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.080
abnormal

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.080
repetitive behaviors

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.080
they keep doing it

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.080
and they'll

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.080
what

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.080
like OCD

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.080
they said

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.080
it's because of their reward system

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.080
so when they do

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.080
these behaviors

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.080
their reward system will keep firing

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.080
and it's abnormal

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.080
you don't need

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.080
to do it

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.080
they're doing

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.080
imaging research

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.080
right

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.080
so like

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.080
I mentioned

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.080
we're

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.080
researching

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.080
connectome

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.080
the other purpose is

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.080
we have a normal

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.080
reference

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080
then we can

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.080
look into

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.080
schizophrenia

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.080
it's related to

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.080
brain problems

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.080
related

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.080
diseases

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.080
what's the difference

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.080
like schizophrenia

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.080
there's a theory

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080
excitatory and inhibitory

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.080
balance

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.080
there's a difference

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.080
is there less connection

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.080
or

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.080
synaptic strength

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.080
less

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.080
I think our department has many

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.080
researchers who like your research

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.080
because our department

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.080
our department's

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.080
biopsychology and

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.080
clinical psychology are quite similar

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.080
clinical psychology is

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080
doing schizophrenia

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.080
they push people in

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.080
all kinds of patients

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.080
but

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.080
I remember

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.080
there's a talk

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.080
about functional MRI

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080
right

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.080
it's about ADHD

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080
I remember

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.080
it's about imaging

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.080
they're doing

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.080
they're doing

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.080
function structure

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.080
MRI used to do

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.080
too big or too small

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.080
which side is thick

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.080
which side is thin

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.080
they're doing

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.080
firing pattern

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.080
it's called functional

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.080
right

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.080
I remember

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.080
it's 7.25

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.080
any questions

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.080
if not

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.080
3, 2, 1

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.080
thank you

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.080
thank you

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.080
thank you

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.080
sorry

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.080
we'll continue

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.080
any ideas

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.080
ok

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.080
ok

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.080
thank you

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.080
I don't know which one

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.080
the blue one

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.080
fire station
