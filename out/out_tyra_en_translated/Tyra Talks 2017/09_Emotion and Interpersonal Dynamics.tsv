0	10000	Hi, everyone. We're going to have the fourth Q&A session this year.
10000	22000	We're honored to have Zhang Yanping here to talk about positive emotions and human relations.
22000	33000	Zhang Yanping is a Ph.D. candidate at UNC-Chapel Hill.
33000	39000	He has been studying at UNC-Chapel Hill since 2013.
39000	45000	Prior to that, he obtained a Ph.D. and a master's degree in psychology at NTU.
45000	64000	His research focuses on positive psychology, positive emotion, gratitude, self-transcendent emotion, well-being, cultural psychology, and moral psychology.
64000	78000	His research includes emotional communication, interpersonal dynamics, Taiwanese indigenous psychology, prosocial behavior, political participation, and moral judgment.
79000	92000	As you can see, Zhang Yanping's research focuses on social psychology and social participation.
92000	108000	Today, he's going to talk about emotional and interpersonal dynamics.
108000	112000	Let's welcome him.
113000	115000	Thank you, everyone.
115000	117000	First, I'd like to say I'm sorry.
117000	119000	I thought I'd be here next week.
119000	126000	So the content I'm going to talk about today is a little different from what I wrote for Zhang Yanping.
126000	128000	Wait a minute. I'll close the door.
128000	140000	I was going to prepare a more general content next week.
140000	145000	I'm going to talk about a lot of projects that I've done before.
145000	152000	I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I'm going to put them all together and talk about a big direction and what to do next.
152000	154000	But I got the time wrong.
154000	156000	So I didn't prepare that.
156000	162000	So what I'm going to talk about today is one of the projects I was going to cover.
162000	165000	But I'm going to talk about this project.
165000	170000	The bad thing is that I'm going to talk about it in more detail.
170000	174000	So if you have any technical questions, you can just ask.
174000	183000	The good thing is that I'm not going to talk about the studies I shared last spring.
184000	188000	So if you've heard of it, you won't repeat it.
188000	190000	This is the first one. I'm sorry. I got the time wrong.
190000	192000	The second one.
192000	195000	The second one is when I was talking about my research interests.
195000	198000	It sounds like a lot of answers.
198000	200000	It sounds like independent things.
200000	202000	But in fact, it's like this.
202000	204000	Imagine.
204000	209000	I'm actually interested in how people communicate and understand each other.
209000	211000	What the other person wants to do.
211000	212000	Who is the other person?
212000	214000	What is the other person thinking?
214000	216000	Wait a minute.
228000	232000	In this process of interpersonal communication,
232000	235000	In the past, people have been pointing out a lot.
235000	239000	That is to say, our speech and communication.
239000	243000	In fact, non-verbal communication is a big part of it.
243000	245000	And it's not just a big part.
245000	247000	In fact, it's a relatively large part.
247000	249000	Compared to verbal communication.
249000	253000	For example, if I say hello to everyone today.
253000	255000	Thank you very much for coming to my speech.
255000	256000	But from start to finish.
256000	258000	Then you must find it strange.
258000	259000	But in fact, that's a constant behavior.
259000	260000	I didn't even move.
260000	262000	You can just say that my hands are stiff.
263000	265000	But in fact, it's not.
265000	266000	Just that little action.
266000	269000	The whole process of communication has changed.
269000	275000	What I'm interested in is non-verbal communication.
275000	278000	Non-verbal communication is largely related to emotions.
278000	281000	If I'm angry, I'll just crack my teeth.
281000	283000	Even if I haven't hit you yet.
283000	285000	I also crack my teeth.
285000	289000	I don't know if you've seen that.
290000	295000	There is a very famous photo of an Olympic gold medalist.
295000	297000	He once won a silver medal.
297000	299000	I don't remember his name.
299000	301000	Very famous recently.
303000	306000	Then his mouth is on one side of his mouth.
306000	307000	Because he's very ungrateful.
307000	309000	That's actually a content performance.
309000	311000	Will it affect
311000	313000	If you're talking to your partner.
313000	315000	It's like this.
315000	317000	A very ungrateful look.
317000	319000	There's going to be a problem with communication.
319000	321000	So what I'm interested in is
321000	326000	Emotions in non-verbal communication.
326000	330000	How does this have anything to do with moral psychology?
330000	331000	Because it's simple.
331000	334000	Because if I'm talking to my partner today.
334000	336000	Then show a very ungrateful look.
336000	337000	There will be a fight later.
337000	338000	There will be a fight.
338000	340000	It's about morality.
340000	342000	It's about who's right and who's wrong.
342000	345000	Why do you think I shouldn't do this?
345000	349000	Why should I listen to you?
349000	352000	But I give you this ungrateful look.
352000	354000	You think this is morally wrong.
354000	357000	Where do you see this signal from?
357000	358000	Then next.
358000	360000	For example, I walked on the street.
360000	364000	Then there was a street friend.
364000	370000	He showed me some emotional non-verbal communication signals.
370000	374000	But then it will affect my judgment of his situation.
374000	375000	For example, this guy deserves it.
375000	377000	He didn't work hard to get there.
377000	380000	Or do I think he must have been bullied.
380000	382000	So this society is not fair.
382000	383000	So I have to help him.
383000	387000	So moral behavior or moral judgment
387000	389000	And the next moral behavior
389000	392000	It's all in this kind of interpersonal communication.
392000	394000	It's all in this kind of interaction.
394000	397000	So it's actually a line that keeps pulling down.
397000	399000	And then finally.
399000	402000	I'm very interested in culture.
402000	405000	Because that's what we're going to talk about today.
405000	409000	Culture greatly affects how we understand others.
409000	412000	Like this.
414000	416000	We'll talk about culture later.
416000	417000	I won't talk about it now.
417000	419000	Anyway, you can imagine it.
419000	420000	Then I started.
426000	427000	Because I have two screens.
427000	430000	So if you leave a message, I can see it.
430000	432000	It won't affect my PowerPoint.
432000	435000	So if you have any questions, you can leave a message.
435000	437000	You can also speak directly through the microphone.
437000	438000	It doesn't matter.
438000	440000	So I should be able to see it.
440000	442000	Okay, let's get started.
442000	447000	First of all, thank you all for coming to listen to me today.
447000	450000	And it's under such late notice.
450000	451000	So.
454000	456000	I was interrupted just now.
456000	457000	Thank you all.
457000	459000	In order to express my gratitude to everyone.
463000	467000	This is what I used in my dissertation proposal defense.
467000	468000	So it's funny.
468000	469000	Maybe it's weird here.
471000	472000	That's what I said at the time.
472000	475000	In order to express my gratitude to everyone.
475000	480000	Please let me kiss your feet.
481000	484000	Okay.
484000	486000	This behavior.
486000	488000	Especially in Taiwan.
488000	489000	It's very bizarre.
489000	491000	Why would you do this?
491000	494000	But in India.
494000	495000	I don't know if you know.
495000	497000	In India.
497000	501000	Kissing someone's feet is the highest expression.
501000	504000	Respect.
504000	505000	And gratitude.
505000	508000	Grateful for the help of these people.
508000	509000	And cultivation.
509000	511000	And incense.
511000	513000	So this behavior is usually for.
513000	515000	This.
515000	516000	It's usually for the elders.
516000	519000	Or this monk.
519000	521000	This monk.
521000	524000	It's what the monks do.
524000	526000	Of course, it's not limited to these people.
526000	528000	But it's usually like this.
528000	529000	This behavior looks very bizarre.
529000	531000	But in fact, in this part of the world.
531000	532000	This is what everyone does.
532000	533000	And don't forget.
533000	536000	This is not a small island in the Pacific Ocean.
536000	537000	Then there are only a few hundred people.
537000	538000	This is India.
538000	541000	There are hundreds of millions of people in India.
541000	542000	Very, very many.
542000	547000	So it's not a.
547000	550000	So it's actually not a.
550000	553000	Very rare event.
553000	556000	But we don't know about these events.
556000	558000	I don't know.
558000	559000	So for us.
559000	561000	Grateful is to express gratitude.
561000	562000	Just say thank you.
562000	565000	Hug.
565000	566000	But.
566000	567000	This thing.
567000	568000	In the example just now.
568000	569000	It shows that.
569000	571000	This is often not the case.
571000	574000	Before we start.
574000	575000	Before analyzing culture.
575000	576000	Let's talk about why.
576000	578000	So why do we need to study gratitude?
578000	580000	Because.
580000	582000	We know that gratitude is a positive emotion.
582000	584000	I'm going to talk about gratitude today.
584000	586000	Gratitude is a positive emotion.
586000	588000	When we feel grateful.
588000	589000	We feel very happy.
589000	591000	Warm.
591000	593000	So he.
593000	594000	Psychologically.
594000	595000	Comfortable.
595000	598000	And the study also shows.
598000	599000	Feel positive emotion.
599000	601000	Will make us.
601000	604000	There are many benefits of mental health.
604000	605000	Come again.
605000	609000	In addition to mental health.
609000	610000	Physical health.
610000	611000	The study also shows that.
611000	613000	When feeling positive emotion.
613000	614000	All kinds of positive emotions.
614000	616000	Physical health will be better.
616000	617000	Not to mention gratitude.
617000	620000	Because gratitude is usually between people.
620000	621000	I thank a person.
622000	624000	Then a person is good to me.
624000	625000	He gives me social support.
625000	626000	So I feel grateful.
626000	628000	Then I might return it later.
628000	629000	So give him social support.
629000	630000	The study found that.
630000	631000	Social support.
631000	632000	For this.
632000	636000	Mortality rate.
636000	638000	Will it hang anyway?
638000	640000	Will people die?
640000	641000	This prediction.
641000	642000	Very high.
642000	643000	How high is it?
643000	645000	Higher than smoking.
645000	646000	Then.
646000	649000	Let me see if I can.
649000	650000	Find this information for everyone.
650000	657000	Take a quick look.
657000	659000	This is a big one in the past.
659000	663000	This review paper.
663000	671000	Then he found that.
671000	672000	Everyone can see me now.
672000	676000	This powerpoint is affiliation.
676000	678000	Or the one just now.
678000	680000	I can see it.
680000	681000	Affiliation, right?
681000	687000	Very good.
687000	688000	This is.
688000	691000	In the past, this study is.
691000	693000	He did it like this.
693000	694000	Everyone can see this.
694000	695000	There are a lot of bars here.
695000	696000	This bar.
696000	698000	Is these items on the left.
698000	700000	For mortality risk.
700000	701000	Prediction.
701000	702000	This effect size.
702000	704000	If you don't know what effect size is.
704000	705000	Don't care about it.
705000	707000	The longer the prediction, the stronger the prediction.
707000	708000	The less noise.
708000	710000	The top.
710000	711000	This pile.
711000	714000	Is a variety of different ways to measure social support.
714000	715000	Then social support.
715000	717000	Or good quality.
717000	719000	High quality social relationship.
719000	721000	For the mortality rate.
721000	722000	The prediction is very high.
722000	724000	If you have good quality.
724000	725000	These.
725000	726000	Quality relationship.
726000	727000	Then.
727000	729000	The mortality rate is relatively low.
729000	732000	Prediction is stronger than smoking.
732000	733000	And this smoking is not what.
733000	734000	Pick two a day.
734000	735000	What is it?
735000	736000	Less than 15.
736000	737000	Everyone can see here.
737000	738000	Less than 15.
738000	739000	So this is a crazy pile.
739000	740000	You.
740000	741000	A crazy pile.
741000	742000	You are not necessarily.
742000	744000	Not necessarily dead.
744000	746000	It will be faster than those who do not have social support.
746000	748000	Social support is so important.
748000	749000	Then there are below.
749000	750000	But.
750000	752000	Aren't they consistent?
752000	753000	You have an error bar.
753000	755000	What is it called?
755000	756000	They are not consistent.
756000	758000	Your social relationship.
758000	760000	After adding the error bar.
760000	762000	Within one sigma.
762000	764000	Consistent with smoking.
764000	765000	I can accept.
765000	767000	You said alcohol consumption.
767000	769000	But I don't think smoking is good.
769000	770000	Smoking is right.
770000	771000	This is not wrong.
771000	773000	This is true.
773000	774000	And this.
774000	775000	You can see this.
775000	776000	The size of the error bar.
776000	779000	In fact, it has a lot to do with the method of measurement.
779000	780000	Because if you are today.
780000	782000	Especially when you.
782000	783000	If you ask about this smoking.
783000	784000	Then you pick a few.
784000	786000	This can be counted one by one.
786000	788000	But how to measure the relationship quality.
788000	790000	Is a very tricky question.
790000	791000	So it will have three different categories.
791000	792000	Then there are several categories.
792000	794000	The error bar is super big.
794000	795000	Because it is obvious.
795000	797000	The way of measuring is not very good.
797000	798000	It's not accurate.
798000	800000	But generally the idea is.
800000	801000	Social support.
801000	802000	At least.
802000	804000	At least it is with.
804000	806000	Smoking.
806000	807000	Can't be distinguished.
807000	808000	Just like this.
808000	810000	Like you don't have friends.
810000	812000	It's like you smoke every day.
812000	813000	Yeah, that's fine.
813000	814000	It's not bigger.
814000	815000	But at least it can't.
815000	817000	Not lower.
817000	818000	And then alcohol.
818000	819000	In this place.
819000	821000	Alcohol is a little lower.
821000	822000	But it.
822000	824000	It is still lower than social support.
824000	826000	Then there is the flu vaccine.
826000	828000	The flu vaccine is even lower.
828000	830000	Physical activity is here.
831000	832000	It's lower.
832000	833000	Then.
833000	834000	Okay, that's it.
834000	836000	These are the more important ones.
836000	837000	So.
837000	838000	What is the point?
838000	839000	The point is that social support.
839000	840000	It is for.
840000	841000	Mortality risk.
841000	843000	The prediction is so strong.
843000	844000	So we.
844000	845000	I want to have a good relationship.
845000	847000	In the end.
848000	849000	Wait a minute.
849000	850000	I see someone.
850000	851000	Oh.
851000	852000	Is the edge wrong?
852000	853000	Okay.
853000	854000	The edge is not wrong.
854000	855000	The edge needs help.
855000	856000	Need help.
856000	857000	But we just want to talk about this.
857000	858000	That is to say.
858000	859000	There is no social support.
859000	860000	In fact, it is a very.
860000	862000	A serious problem.
862000	864000	So it's not just about teenagers.
864000	866000	Teenage smoking is not good.
866000	868000	It's just that teenagers are excluded.
868000	869000	He might die faster.
869000	870000	Anyway, think about it.
870000	871000	This is actually quite reasonable.
871000	872000	This smoking.
872000	873000	You still have smoking.
873000	874000	But.
874000	875000	People who are excluded.
875000	876000	It's easy to commit suicide in the end.
876000	878000	So this is really a serious problem.
878000	879000	Okay, finally.
879000	881000	This past research has been considered.
881000	882000	It's not research.
882000	883000	This is a philosopher.
883000	886000	Many philosophers.
886000	887000	Maybe not many.
887000	888000	But there are a few important philosophers.
888000	889000	They believe that.
889000	891000	Gratitude is a very important emotion.
891000	893000	Because it brings people together.
893000	894000	He.
894000	896000	It is the foundation of our modern society.
896000	898000	Just social exchange.
898000	899000	Or this.
899000	902000	Rational exchange is not enough.
902000	904000	So it's a bit like a lubricant.
904000	906000	That's why we need to study gratitude.
906000	907000	But the problem is.
907000	910000	Just like the example we just saw.
910000	911000	We're not really sure.
911000	912000	How to express gratitude.
912000	914000	Or what to do with gratitude.
914000	916000	Because the cultural difference is so big.
916000	917000	So in this project.
917000	919000	I'm going to do this.
919000	921000	The question is.
921000	924000	Cultural variation in good expressions.
924000	925000	Different cultures.
925000	926000	How to express.
926000	929000	Express gratitude.
929000	930000	And then.
930000	931000	Especially I will focus on.
931000	933000	The difference between the United States and Taiwan.
934000	936000	I will explain later.
936000	938000	Why the United States and Taiwan.
940000	941000	Except.
941000	943000	Of course there are some theoretical reasons.
943000	944000	I will explain later.
944000	945000	Another one is because.
945000	946000	I'm in the United States.
946000	948000	So it's easy for me to get American samples.
948000	950000	Then I have connections in Taiwan.
950000	951000	So I get connections in Taiwan.
951000	952000	This is a.
952000	954000	This is a practical reason.
954000	955000	I'll talk about this first.
955000	957000	The theoretical reason.
957000	958000	I'll talk about it later.
958000	959000	OK.
959000	960000	Then it officially started.
960000	962000	We've already spent half an hour.
962000	963000	It's really funny.
963000	964000	Anyway.
967000	968000	OK.
968000	969000	So what is gratitude?
969000	970000	Gratitude.
970000	971000	This emotion.
971000	972000	We just.
972000	974000	Define it a little bit.
974000	975000	It's a kind of.
975000	977000	When we receive help from others.
977000	978000	Or goodwill.
978000	979000	When goodwill.
979000	980000	Will feel a kind of.
980000	981000	Positive.
981000	982000	Happy.
982000	983000	Joyful.
983000	984000	Warm.
984000	985000	This feeling.
985000	986000	This emotion.
986000	987000	We.
987000	989000	We call this feeling gratitude.
989000	990000	Or say.
990000	991000	We call this feeling gratitude.
991000	992000	It's usually not wrong.
992000	993000	As for whether.
993000	995000	Only this feeling is called gratitude.
995000	996000	We don't care about it now.
996000	997000	Don't care about it now.
999000	1000000	In this place.
1000000	1001000	Gratitude has several characteristics.
1001000	1003000	Compared with other positive emotions.
1003000	1004000	The first one is.
1005000	1006000	It's usually.
1006000	1008000	In interpersonal relationships.
1008000	1009000	Produced.
1009000	1010000	Someone helped me.
1010000	1011000	Give me a gift.
1011000	1012000	Or.
1012000	1013000	Say something nice to me.
1013000	1014000	Or.
1014000	1015000	Give me.
1015000	1016000	Just.
1016000	1017000	Do something for me.
1017000	1018000	Teach me something I don't know.
1018000	1019000	I feel very grateful.
1020000	1021000	This is different from.
1021000	1022000	Other positive emotions.
1022000	1023000	But I'm happy today.
1023000	1024000	I don't need anyone else.
1024000	1025000	I feel great.
1025000	1026000	This is positive emotion.
1026000	1027000	This is joy.
1027000	1028000	But this is not grateful.
1028000	1029000	You won't because.
1030000	1031000	I'm happy.
1031000	1032000	Feel grateful.
1032000	1033000	Usually not.
1033000	1035000	We can discuss later.
1035000	1036000	If you are happy.
1036000	1037000	Feel grateful.
1037000	1038000	Why is that?
1038000	1039000	I think this question is very interesting.
1039000	1040000	But basically.
1040000	1041000	Gratefulness.
1041000	1042000	Its characteristics are.
1042000	1043000	Produced directly from interpersonal relationships.
1043000	1044000	Usually.
1044000	1045000	In addition.
1045000	1046000	It will have.
1046000	1048000	Results in interpersonal relationships.
1048000	1049000	Or effect.
1049000	1050000	We receive a person.
1050000	1051000	Gratefulness.
1051000	1052000	We usually.
1052000	1053000	Repay.
1053000	1054000	Or at least say thank you.
1054000	1055000	This thank you.
1055000	1056000	Not in the air.
1056000	1057000	Say it to another person.
1057000	1058000	So.
1058000	1059000	Gratefulness is a very interpersonal.
1059000	1060000	Emotion.
1060000	1061000	Relative to.
1061000	1062000	Other positive emotions.
1062000	1063000	So.
1063000	1064000	This is.
1064000	1065000	Later.
1065000	1066000	There is a.
1066000	1067000	Because of these phenomena.
1067000	1068000	There is a theory.
1068000	1069000	Called.
1069000	1070000	Find.
1070000	1071000	Find.
1071000	1072000	Remind.
1072000	1073000	And.
1073000	1074000	Find.
1074000	1075000	Theory.
1075000	1076000	This theory says so.
1076000	1077000	He said.
1077000	1078000	Gratefulness.
1078000	1079000	The reason why people.
1079000	1080000	Have this emotion.
1080000	1081000	Is because.
1081000	1082000	Gratefulness.
1082000	1083000	It's like this.
1085000	1086000	Think about it.
1086000	1087000	It's like a light bulb.
1087000	1089000	We usually wear a light bulb.
1089000	1090000	Then.
1090000	1091000	When.
1091000	1092000	Someone is nice to me.
1092000	1093000	I think this person.
1093000	1094000	This person is a good.
1094000	1095000	Social partner.
1095000	1096000	This.
1096000	1097000	I deserve to continue.
1097000	1098000	With him.
1098000	1099000	This light will be like this.
1099000	1100000	Will light up.
1100000	1101000	Then remind me.
1101000	1102000	This guy is a good guy.
1102000	1103000	This is gratefulness.
1103000	1104000	The thing that lights up.
1104000	1105000	Is gratefulness.
1105000	1106000	So he.
1106000	1107000	Help us.
1107000	1108000	Find.
1108000	1109000	Good.
1109000	1110000	Social partners.
1110000	1111000	And.
1111000	1112000	If.
1112000	1113000	Next time.
1113000	1114000	I meet this person.
1114000	1115000	My light bulb.
1115000	1116000	Will be like this.
1116000	1117000	Will light up again.
1117000	1118000	Remind me.
1118000	1119000	This guy was nice to me last time.
1119000	1120000	So.
1120000	1121000	I should repay him now.
1121000	1122000	Or.
1122000	1123000	I should pay attention to this person.
1123000	1124000	Next.
1124000	1125000	Make good friends with him.
1125000	1126000	So.
1126000	1127000	Can build social partners.
1127000	1128000	This social relationship.
1128000	1129000	So.
1129000	1130000	He helped me.
1130000	1131000	Find.
1131000	1132000	And.
1132000	1133000	Remind me.
1133000	1134000	And.
1134000	1135000	Put the two of us together.
1135000	1136000	That.
1136000	1137000	We all know.
1137000	1138000	It's easy to die.
1138000	1139000	But if there is.
1139000	1140000	Cooperation.
1140000	1141000	It's easier to live.
1141000	1142000	Especially.
1142000	1143000	Good.
1143000	1144000	With good.
1144000	1145000	Partners.
1145000	1146000	Cooperate together.
1146000	1147000	Then.
1147000	1148000	OK.
1148000	1149000	Then.
1149000	1150000	OK.
1150000	1151000	Then.
1151000	1152000	OK.

1560120	1561120	So.
1562120	1563120	So.
1566120	1567120	So.
1569120	1569920	This is.
1571120	1573120	he is very famous in recent research.
1573120	1575120	If you're interested in it, we can talk about it later.
1575120	1578120	But this is a concept.
1579120	1580120	This is collective culture.
1580120	1583120	Everybody image of this dimensions are different.
1584120	1585120	So what's the result.
1585120	1587120	The result is.
1587120	1589120	If in to personalistic culture change.
1590120	1594120	We all think about change the role of society already and social norm.
1595120	1596120	It's easy.
1596120	1597120	It's allowed.
1597120	1598120	Let them do it.
1598120	1599120	It's allowed.
1599120	1600120	But in extremism.
1600120	1602120	Especially in extreme extremism.
1602120	1603120	It's very difficult.
1604120	1605120	Let me give you an example.
1605120	1606120	You're in Japan.
1606120	1608120	If you want to quit the black society, you have to cut your finger, right?
1610120	1611120	You have to.
1611120	1613120	This is very serious.
1614120	1616120	There will be very serious consequences.
1616120	1618120	And usually the result is that you won't quit.
1618120	1620120	Otherwise you will die.
1620120	1621120	So you actually didn't quit.
1622120	1623120	Or you really cut a finger.
1623120	1625120	Then your whole life changed.
1626120	1627120	Ok.
1628120	1631120	Then we put the culture into the emotion.
1631120	1632120	What's the result?
1633120	1634120	The result is.
1635120	1639120	In the left side of the personalistic culture.
1639120	1641120	It's easy to see.
1642120	1647120	Everybody's emotional expression is a lot of big body movements.
1648120	1649120	Then easy to see.
1649120	1650120	And I say it is easy to see.
1650120	1651120	It's literally easy to see.
1651120	1653120	You push that person far away.
1653120	1654120	Then you see that person is far away.
1654120	1656120	He is saying hello to you and waving his hand.
1656120	1658120	It's literally easy to see.
1659120	1660120	But.
1661120	1662120	If it is.
1662120	1664120	This collective culture.
1664120	1666120	Everyone's expression is relatively small.
1666120	1668120	That is, he may smile at you.
1668120	1669120	Even the teeth did not show.
1669120	1671120	So if you are two meters away.
1671120	1672120	You just.
1672120	1673120	This face is.
1673120	1674120	It looks like a flat one.
1674120	1675120	Won't move.
1675120	1676120	So why is that?
1677120	1678120	Because.
1679120	1681120	Back to that American.
1681120	1682120	Back to that American.
1682120	1684120	The example of panic.
1684120	1686120	Everyone is really two meters away.
1686120	1687120	You can't see.
1687120	1688120	Then you express.
1688120	1689120	Express.
1689120	1690120	Sour.
1690120	1691120	But if it is.
1691120	1692120	If you.
1692120	1693120	On the right.
1693120	1694120	In Taiwan or Japan.
1694120	1696120	You have a very special.
1696120	1697120	Fixed social position.
1697120	1698120	You don't even need to express.
1698120	1699120	You know what you want to do.
1699120	1700120	Others know what you want to do.
1700120	1702120	You also know what others know what you want to do.
1702120	1704120	So why do you have to use emotions to communicate?
1704120	1705120	No need.
1705120	1706120	The most is to do a little adjustment.
1706120	1707120	Then you just smile.
1707120	1708120	A smile is probably enough.
1712120	1713120	So the result is.
1713120	1714120	In addition to people.
1714120	1716120	There are different ways of expression.
1717120	1718120	We will also.
1718120	1721120	There are different ways of understanding other people's expressions.
1721120	1722120	In fact, this is.
1722120	1723120	This.
1724120	1725120	The other side of the board.
1725120	1726120	I don't need to explain.
1726120	1727120	It's easy to understand.
1728120	1730120	As a result, we call this thing.
1730120	1732120	Emotional culture.
1732120	1734120	Every culture.
1734120	1735120	Or every group of people.
1735120	1737120	Because of their.
1737120	1739120	The structure of interpersonal relationships.
1739120	1740120	The structure of their natural relationships.
1740120	1742120	Form a set.
1742120	1744120	A unique way of expression and understanding emotions.
1744120	1746120	It's called emotional culture.
1749120	1750120	Emotional culture.
1750120	1751120	Good.
1754120	1755120	So.
1758120	1759120	So we.
1759120	1760120	In this.
1760120	1761120	In my research.
1761120	1762120	In fact, what we are going to study is.
1763120	1765120	The difference in emotional culture.
1765120	1766120	Then I will.
1766120	1767120	I will.
1767120	1769120	Select the United States and Taiwan.
1771120	1772120	The reason is.
1773120	1774120	I just told you.
1774120	1778120	The United States is a country with a very high percentage of individualism.
1778120	1779120	So he is.
1779120	1780120	One of the dimensions.
1780120	1781120	Taiwan.
1781120	1782120	Although not the highest.
1782120	1783120	But also.
1784120	1786120	Among the three highest.
1786120	1787120	One of them.
1787120	1788120	South Korea.
1788120	1789120	South Korea, Japan, Taiwan.
1791120	1792120	One of them.
1793120	1794120	Then.
1796120	1797120	So.
1797120	1798120	So.
1798120	1799120	Select these two countries.
1799120	1800120	He is.
1800120	1801120	This kind of.
1801120	1802120	This is called.
1802120	1803120	Select these two countries.
1804120	1805120	Can increase us.
1805120	1806120	In fact, after the increase.
1806120	1807120	This finding.
1807120	1808120	This.
1808120	1809120	Generalizability.
1810120	1811120	Interpretability.
1811120	1812120	It can also be used at a lower cost.
1812120	1813120	Because we put.
1813120	1814120	This is equal to.
1814120	1815120	This contrast.
1815120	1816120	Pull to the maximum.
1817120	1818120	We use the lowest cost.
1818120	1819120	See this effect.
1821120	1822120	Good.
1822120	1823120	The next question is.
1823120	1825120	If you go to identify.
1825120	1826120	These two countries.
1827120	1828120	Then these two countries.
1828120	1829120	When expressing gratitude.
1829120	1831120	What kind of behavior will be used?
1832120	1833120	That has just been said.
1833120	1834120	Individualism.
1834120	1835120	This kind of panic country.
1836120	1837120	They will form.
1837120	1838120	Is big.
1839120	1840120	In theory.
1840120	1841120	They have to form big.
1841120	1842120	Because big will be effective.
1842120	1843120	Emotional expression.
1845120	1846120	And.
1846120	1847120	Generally.
1847120	1848120	More.
1848120	1849120	Expressive.
1849120	1850120	Or more.
1850120	1851120	Observable.
1851120	1852120	This.
1852120	1853120	Emotional expression.
1853120	1854120	In the past.
1854120	1855120	For gratitude.
1855120	1856120	In the United States.
1856120	1857120	At the same time.
1857120	1858120	Oh.
1858120	1859120	When people feel grateful.
1859120	1860120	In addition to saying thank you.
1860120	1861120	This seems.
1861120	1862120	There is no cultural difference.
1862120	1863120	In addition.
1863120	1864120	Americans will.
1865120	1866120	Very inclined to.
1866120	1868120	Body contact.
1868120	1869120	Including.
1870120	1871120	Hug.
1871120	1872120	Including.
1872120	1873120	Handshake.
1873120	1874120	Including kiss.
1874120	1875120	Including high five.
1875120	1876120	Or slap.
1876120	1877120	And so on.
1877120	1878120	In the past.
1878120	1879120	I found that.
1879120	1880120	If you are grateful.
1880120	1881120	Ask him what he wants to do.
1881120	1882120	He will.
1882120	1883120	Come out.
1883120	1884120	That's because it's.
1884120	1885120	Body.
1885120	1886120	Body interaction.
1886120	1887120	He has bodily contact.
1887120	1888120	So he will.
1888120	1889120	In relation to.
1889120	1890120	Just say thank you.
1891120	1892120	Or.
1892120	1893120	Say thank you.
1893120	1894120	This.
1895120	1896120	Is the sound.
1896120	1897120	This.
1897120	1898120	Sound.
1898120	1899120	This.
1899120	1900120	Communicate.
1900120	1901120	Communicate.
1901120	1902120	Channel.
1902120	1903120	But if you add bodily contact.
1903120	1904120	There will be one more.
1904120	1905120	The channel.
1905120	1906120	So.
1907120	1908120	It's not easy.
1909120	1910120	Oh.
1910120	1911120	Is.
1911120	1912120	This is.
1912120	1913120	This.
1913120	1914120	This is why.
1915120	1916120	A lot of emotional.
1916120	1917120	Reason.
1917120	1918120	So.
1918120	1919120	Assuming that it will become here.
1919120	1920120	The United States is relative to Taiwan.
1921120	1922120	Because of its cultural factors.
1923120	1924120	So.
1924120	1925120	When they express their gratitude.
1925120	1926120	There should be more.
1926120	1927120	Body.
1927120	1928120	Behavior.
1928120	1929120	Conversely.
1929120	1930120	In fact, it is more special.
1930120	1931120	Not the other way around.
1931120	1932120	But on the other hand.
1932120	1933120	I think this is more special.
1933120	1934120	Is.
1934120	1935120	So what is Taiwan going to do?
1935120	1936120	To express.
1936120	1937120	In this study.
1937120	1938120	We put forward a.
1938120	1939120	Called.
1939120	1940120	The other.
1940120	1941120	Question together.
1953120	1954120	I am now reading.
1954120	1955120	There is a question.
1960120	1961120	You read it out.
1961120	1962120	Because we record.
1962120	1963120	Or do you let me read it out.
1963120	1964120	You read it out.
1965120	1966120	OK, I read it out.
1966120	1967120	page change.
1967120	1968120	I understand now.
1968120	1969120	Because of them.
1969120	1970120	This question is like this.
1970120	1971120	Is it because they are a panic-type country?
1971120	1973120	So raise extreme individualism.
1973120	1974120	Or because of the original
1974120	1975120	People who want to panic.
1975120	1977120	It was originally an individualistic feature.
1977120	1978120	So I want to panic.
1979120	1980120	OK, this one.
1983120	1984120	I think it's a very good question.
1985120	1986120	I'll answer it later.
1986120	1988120	Because this is not actually.
1989120	1991120	This is actually not this project.
1992120	1993120	The question to be discussed.
1993120	1994120	Right.
1994120	1995120	In this project.
1995120	1996120	They are a
1996120	1997120	Individualistic culture.
1997120	1998120	In fact, it is a given.
1999120	2000120	Then this given.
2000120	2001120	There is also a lot of data knowledge.
2001120	2002120	So I don't want to discuss it now.
2003120	2004120	Why did it become like this?
2005120	2006120	So I don't want to answer the question now.
2006120	2007120	But we'll talk about it later.
2007120	2008120	Discussion time.
2008120	2009120	Let's talk about this question.
2009120	2010120	What happened to the culture?
2010120	2011120	I think this question is very interesting.
2011120	2012120	Can I do this?
2016120	2017120	OK, back to Taiwan.
2017120	2019120	How do you express your gratitude to Taiwan?
2019120	2020120	We found one.
2020120	2021120	We went to
2021120	2022120	Translate some books.
2022120	2023120	Then I found an act.
2023120	2024120	Called self-improvement.
2025120	2026120	English translated into self-improvement.
2027120	2029120	But this is very strange.
2029120	2031120	But his Chinese is actually called self-improvement.
2031120	2032120	Or self-cultivation.
2033120	2034120	In fact, it is self-cultivation.
2034120	2035120	Or
2036120	2037120	Self-cultivation.
2037120	2038120	Such a thing.
2039120	2040120	The definition is like this.
2047120	2048120	Basically, if you are
2048120	2049120	A good student.
2049120	2050120	Study hard.
2050120	2051120	If it's a good kid.
2052120	2053120	You have to respect your parents.
2053120	2054120	Because these are your social responsibility.
2054120	2055120	And social role.
2058120	2059120	Why is this behavior
2059120	2061120	A possible way to express gratitude?
2063120	2064120	Because
2066120	2067120	Big brother.
2070120	2071120	Why is it
2071120	2072120	A possible way to express gratitude?
2072120	2073120	Because we said before.
2073120	2074120	Gratitude.
2074120	2076120	The existence of this emotion.
2078120	2079120	Because it can help
2079120	2081120	Promote interpersonal relations.
2082120	2083120	Then in a
2084120	2085120	Interpersonal relations.
2086120	2087120	The structure is already stable.
2087120	2089120	And it's almost a spoken place.
2090120	2092120	How do you promote interpersonal relations?
2092120	2093120	You can't.
2094120	2096120	You are not expected to build a new relationship.
2096120	2097120	Or destroy a new relationship.
2097120	2099120	Or destroy an old relationship.
2099120	2101120	So what you can do is maintenance.
2102120	2103120	This is to let the relationship.
2104120	2105120	In three.
2106120	2108120	What can be done is to do maintenance.
2108120	2109120	Or do buy.
2109120	2110120	No more buy.
2110120	2111120	No more
2111120	2112120	Initiate or what.
2113120	2114120	So this
2114120	2115120	Buy.
2115120	2116120	Can do is to put your
2116120	2117120	Position well.
2117120	2119120	Because past research has found that.
2120120	2121120	In this.
2121120	2122120	I actually.
2122120	2123120	In our society.
2123120	2124120	If you put
2124120	2125120	Own.
2125120	2126120	This role.
2126120	2127120	Do it well.
2127120	2129120	Or when your responsibility is done.
2131120	2132120	Others will see it.
2133120	2135120	The result that others can see is that he will come.
2136120	2138120	Willing to invest in your relationship with you.
2138120	2139120	And then.
2140120	2141120	Put your original
2141120	2142120	This bonding.
2143120	2144120	Or bond.
2146120	2147120	Think it's important.
2148120	2150120	So self-cultivation can actually help.
2152120	2153120	Relationship.
2153120	2154120	Stability.
2154120	2155120	And maintenance.
2155120	2157120	In our culture.
2158120	2159120	Give you an example.
2159120	2160120	This is a big brother.
2160120	2161120	What am I going to say?
2161120	2162120	The window on his head.
2164120	2166120	Why tie a window in that place?
2169120	2170120	Because this is his job.
2171120	2172120	This is his job.
2172120	2173120	His job.
2173120	2174120	He's playing.
2174120	2175120	Most people can say.
2175120	2176120	I must win.
2176120	2177120	That's because I'm a player.
2177120	2178120	I just want to win.
2178120	2179120	I'm cool.
2179120	2180120	This is not good.
2180120	2181120	But everyone has.
2181120	2182120	If there is.
2182120	2183120	For.
2183120	2184120	I think everyone is from Taiwan.
2184120	2186120	So what does it mean to win?
2186120	2187120	Is.
2188120	2190120	There should be a little feeling.
2190120	2191120	That is to say.
2191120	2193120	Usually we are talking about winning.
2193120	2194120	I am determined to win.
2194120	2196120	When you do this thing well.
2196120	2197120	Usually this thing is our responsibility.
2197120	2198120	Then we.
2198120	2199120	For the society.
2199120	2200120	Or for us.
2200120	2201120	The surrounding social face.
2201120	2202120	Including parents.
2202120	2203120	Or the teacher.
2203120	2204120	The mayor.
2205120	2206120	There is a sense of responsibility.
2206120	2207120	So I'm going to do this thing.
2207120	2208120	Give him a hard time.
2208120	2209120	Not just.
2209120	2210120	It's cool to win.
2212120	2213120	This is also.
2213120	2214120	At the same time.
2214120	2215120	This is what the big brother said.
2215120	2216120	He said.
2217120	2218120	I remember in a place.
2218120	2219120	He said.
2220120	2221120	He will work hard to play.
2221120	2222120	Because of fans.
2222120	2223120	Because of the coach.
2223120	2224120	Because of teammates.
2224120	2225120	Not just.
2226120	2227120	Because it's cool to win.
2227120	2228120	So he is not.
2228120	2229120	So he is a grateful expression.
2229120	2230120	But his result.
2230120	2232120	On the other hand.
2232120	2234120	He wants to do his job well.
2236120	2237120	And then.
2237120	2239120	This is our data.
2239120	2240120	I can talk a little bit first.
2240120	2241120	That is to say.
2241120	2242120	Indeed.
2242120	2243120	There are victims.
2243120	2244120	When he feels grateful.
2244120	2245120	He will.
2245120	2247120	I will show up to work.
2247120	2248120	Hard every day.
2248120	2249120	During practice.
2249120	2250120	I don't know.
2250120	2251120	Is this person an athlete?
2251120	2252120	Or what?
2252120	2253120	Because he wrote.
2253120	2254120	Not very sure.
2254120	2255120	But you can see.
2255120	2256120	When you feel grateful.
2256120	2257120	People really want to.
2257120	2258120	Do your job well.
2260120	2261120	So the assumption is.
2261120	2262120	The assumption is.
2262120	2263120	When grateful.
2263120	2264120	In the United States.
2264120	2265120	For Americans.
2265120	2266120	They would like to.
2266120	2267120	Use physical contact.
2267120	2268120	To express gratitude.
2268120	2269120	In Taiwan.
2271120	2272120	There will be more.
2273120	2274120	Want this.
2274120	2275120	Self-improvement impulse.
2276120	2277120	Is there a problem here?
2277120	2278120	Is there a problem here?
2283120	2285120	Because I'm going to talk about the experiment later.
2287120	2288120	Very fast.
2288120	2289120	Very short.
2289120	2290120	Later.
2293120	2294120	3.
2294120	2295120	2.
2295120	2296120	1.
2296120	2297120	No good.
2297120	2298120	We continue.
2298120	2299120	Good.
2299120	2300120	Good.
2300120	2301120	There is a problem.
2301120	2302120	There is a problem.
2305120	2306120	Please say.
2306120	2307120	You can speak into the microphone.
2307120	2308120	If this is easier.
2312120	2313120	Can you hear me?
2313120	2314120	Yes, I can hear you.
2314120	2315120	In fact, it's good to speak into the microphone.
2315120	2317120	Because then we can record the voice directly.
2318120	2320120	Don't have to repeat.
2320120	2321120	There are others next to you.
2321120	2322120	Sorry.
2323120	2324120	I want to ask.
2324120	2325120	That self-contact.
2325120	2326120	With that.
2326120	2327120	Self-improvement.
2327120	2328120	These two.
2328120	2329120	Outcome.
2329120	2330120	There is no conflict.
2330120	2331120	Not two.
2331120	2332120	Conflict.
2332120	2333120	Things.
2333120	2334120	That.
2334120	2335120	Why.
2335120	2336120	It's possible.
2336120	2337120	In fact, it will.
2337120	2338120	Two outcomes.
2338120	2339120	Is it mixed together?
2341120	2342120	Oh.
2342120	2343120	It's possible.
2343120	2344120	It's possible.
2344120	2345120	Oh.
2345120	2346120	What you say is not confident.
2346120	2347120	Wait a minute.
2347120	2348120	What are you not confident about?
2348120	2349120	You say.
2349120	2350120	He wants to have a physical contact.
2350120	2351120	You can also want.
2351120	2352120	Self-improvement.
2352120	2353120	Or.
2353120	2354120	There is a kind of behavior.
2354120	2355120	He is self-improvement at the same time.
2355120	2356120	Self-contact.
2356120	2357120	Self-contact.
2357120	2358120	For example.
2358120	2359120	You say.
2359120	2360120	When you say Americans.
2360120	2361120	They are more.
2361120	2362120	Feel.
2362120	2363120	When there is a sense of gratitude.
2363120	2364120	That.
2364120	2365120	Taiwanese.
2365120	2366120	When he feels grateful.
2366120	2367120	He wants.
2367120	2368120	Self-improvement.
2368120	2369120	That.
2369120	2370120	But.
2370120	2371120	Physical contact.
2371120	2372120	With self-improvement.
2372120	2373120	These two.
2373120	2374120	There is no conflict.
2374120	2375120	So is it possible.
2375120	2376120	In fact, Americans.
2376120	2377120	When they are grateful.
2377120	2378120	In addition to wanting physical contact.
2378120	2379120	I also want self-improvement.
2379120	2380120	Or.
2380120	2381120	Taiwanese.
2381120	2382120	Feel.
2382120	2383120	When grateful.
2383120	2384120	Want self-improvement.
2384120	2385120	Then.
2385120	2386120	But at the same time.
2386120	2387120	I also want to do physical contact.
2387120	2388120	Hey.
2388120	2389120	Okay.
2389120	2390120	Hey.
2390120	2391120	I think.
2391120	2392120	I think it's possible.
2392120	2393120	Both behaviors.
2393120	2394120	Are motivated.
2394120	2395120	Right.
2395120	2396120	Okay.
2396120	2397120	But why do I think.
2398120	2399120	So.
2399120	2400120	Let's talk about it.
2400120	2401120	Physical contact.
2401120	2402120	In.
2402120	2403120	Americans will be higher.
2403120	2404120	Because.
2404120	2405120	Physical contact.
2405120	2406120	Is a big move.
2406120	2407120	It is often used in.
2407120	2408120	Initiate.
2408120	2409120	New relationship.
2411120	2412120	Because you want.
2412120	2413120	From.
2413120	2414120	Originally.
2414120	2415120	Far.
2415120	2416120	Social distance.
2416120	2417120	Become.
2417120	2418120	Literally.
2418120	2419120	You can meet this person.
2420120	2421120	But this.
2421120	2422120	Relationship.
2423120	2424120	Change.
2424120	2425120	In a.
2425120	2426120	Relationship.
2426120	2427120	Is in the culture of painting.
2430120	2432120	In fact, it is not easy to happen.
2432120	2433120	Not even.
2433120	2434120	Not allowed.
2434120	2435120	Like you said.
2435120	2436120	Thank you very much for your teacher.
2436120	2437120	Then you go.
2437120	2438120	Kiss him.
2438120	2439120	This.
2439120	2440120	Isn't it weird?
2441120	2442120	But.
2444120	2445120	In.
2446120	2447120	Physical contact.
2447120	2448120	Is fluid.
2448120	2449120	Can.
2449120	2450120	Be allowed to change.
2450120	2451120	The place.
2451120	2452120	The relationship between Zhenjing and the teacher.
2452120	2453120	Maybe it can be allowed.
2454120	2455120	So I.
2455120	2456120	These two behaviors.
2456120	2457120	Is.
2457120	2458120	When I assume.
2458120	2459120	Independent assumption.
2459120	2460120	That is to say.
2460120	2461120	Not a.
2461120	2462120	But a.
2463120	2464120	Do you know what I mean?
2464120	2465120	It's not a blow.
2465120	2466120	That is to say.
2466120	2467120	If your enemy.
2467120	2468120	The other one will be high.
2468120	2469120	But I assume the first one.
2470120	2471120	This.
2471120	2472120	Physical contact.
2472120	2473120	Then the United States will be higher than Taiwan.
2473120	2474120	Then the second is.
2474120	2475120	Self intimacy.
2475120	2476120	Taiwan will be higher than the United States.
2476120	2477120	But it's not a.
2477120	2478120	Relationship.
2478120	2479120	Do you know what I'm talking about?
2479120	2480120	I understand.
2480120	2481120	Thank you.
2482120	2483120	it is good.
2483120	2484120	Oh, by the way.
2484120	2485120	And then.
2485120	2486120	I didn't finish this just now.
2486120	2487120	Self intimacy in the United States.
2487120	2488120	It's not supposed to be.
2488120	2489120	I assume it's not very effective.
2489120	2490120	Relatively ineffective.
2490120	2491120	Not being used.
2491120	2492120	The reason is.
2492120	2493120	Because it's too small.
2493120	2494120	You're here.
2494120	2495120	Kill yourself.
2495120	2496120	Do that.
2496120	2497120	This behavior is very.
2497120	2498120	Obviously.
2498120	2499120	Not very.
2499120	2500120	Noticeable.
2500120	2501120	The effect is not dirty.
2501120	2502120	Especially in.
2502120	2504120	People don't pay attention to others.
2504120	2505120	What are you doing.
2505120	2506120	When.
2507120	2508120	So this effect is not dirty.
2508120	2509120	This is not very.
2509120	2510120	There is no.
2510120	2511120	Function.
2511120	2512120	It's not functional.
2516120	2517120	Check these two.
2517120	2518120	Two assumptions.
2518120	2519120	Oh, by the way.
2519120	2520120	We chose these two assumptions.
2520120	2521120	Is deliberately.
2521120	2522120	One high.
2522120	2523120	Another low.
2523120	2524120	Another high.
2524120	2525120	This low.
2525120	2526120	Make that contrast.
2528120	2529120	So it is.
2529120	2530120	Strategically selected.
2531120	2532120	it is good.
2532120	2533120	What about study1?
2533120	2534120	We'll ask the recipient.
2534120	2535120	Write some first.
2535120	2536120	He was helped.
2536120	2537120	Very happy.
2537120	2538120	Very grateful experience.
2538120	2539120	And then.
2539120	2540120	Ask him to do one.
2540120	2541120	No relevant.
2541120	2542120	Task.
2542120	2543120	In this task.
2543120	2545120	Please write something casually.
2545120	2546120	He usually.
2546120	2547120	In everyday life.
2547120	2549120	Will be used to express gratitude.
2549120	2550120	He can write one to seven.
2550120	2551120	He wrote it himself.
2552120	2553120	See how many he wants to write.
2553120	2554120	At least one.
2554120	2555120	At most seven.
2555120	2556120	But this is with the previous.
2556120	2557120	The experience of writing is not related.
2558120	2559120	Come again.
2559120	2560120	We asked him to go back.
2560120	2561120	Uh.
2561120	2562120	The previous writing experience.
2562120	2563120	And then in front of the camera.
2563120	2564120	Record a passage.
2565120	2566120	With.
2566120	2567120	He felt.
2567120	2568120	Let him feel grateful.
2568120	2569120	This person.
2569120	2570120	Express his gratitude.
2571120	2572120	And.
2572120	2573120	That instruction is to say.
2573120	2574120	Let him.
2574120	2576120	It's like interacting with this person.
2576120	2577120	The same.
2578120	2579120	And then this movie.
2579120	2580120	It looks like this.
2580120	2581120	Like this.
2582120	2583120	So.
2583120	2584120	Zha Yong said this movie.
2584120	2585120	If I broadcast it.
2585120	2587120	There will be a very serious lag.
2587120	2588120	So I put this.
2589120	2590120	This.
2591120	2593120	The website is pasted in the dialogue window.
2593120	2594120	Then everyone went to click on it.
2594120	2595120	Separately.
2595120	2596120	Tell me after watching.
2625120	2626120	It should be.
2644120	2645120	Sorry.
2645120	2655120	I made a mistake. I didn't cut this video.
2655120	2660120	You only need to watch 1 minute and a half.
2660120	2662120	1 minute should be enough.
2662120	2664120	There's nothing after that.
2664120	2666120	He doesn't know what to say.
2675120	2685120	Sorry.
2685120	2687120	I made a mistake.
2687120	2689120	You only need to watch 1 minute and a half.
2689120	2691120	1 minute should be enough.
2691120	2693120	He doesn't know what to say.
2693120	2695120	He doesn't know what to say.
2695120	2697120	This is an example.
2697120	2699120	This is an example.
2699120	2701120	This is an example.
2701120	2708120	This is an example.
2708120	2715120	After all, he insists that his self-improvement is needed.
2715120	2721120	Or when he has no one to support him, he argues withkh his facial expression.
2721120	2728120	Or when he has no one to support him, he argues withkh his facial expression.
2728120	2735120	Self-improvement is a nonsense.
2735120	2740120	This is the data we have collected.
2740120	2750120	Next, we will ask some research assistants to grade these videos.
2750120	2760120	If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.
2760120	2770120	If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.
2770120	2780120	If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.
2780120	2790120	If this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.
2790120	2803120	Lastly, if this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.
2803120	2810120	Lastly, if this video has hug or bodily contact, this video will get 1 point.
2810120	2822120	If this video has reciprocity, this video will get 1 point.
2822120	2837120	If this video has reciprocity, this video will get 1 point.
2837120	2850120	So we are going to compare the presence and absence of these videos.
2850120	2854120	So we are going to compare the presence and absence of these videos.
2854120	2858120	It's a Logistic Multi-Level Linear Model.
2858120	2863120	It's a Logistic Multi-Level Linear Model.
2864120	2882120	In this video, we have written 1-7 different ways of expression.
2882120	2888120	In this video, we have written 1-7 different ways of expression.
2888120	2907120	Based on these, we can classify the body contact, self-improvement, reciprocity.
2907120	2916120	Based on these, we can classify the body contact, self-improvement, reciprocity.
2917120	2923120	There are two of them are self-improvement, and three of them are body contact.
2923120	2932120	My self-improvement is 1 out of 3, so it's 33%.
2932120	2943120	My body contact is 50%, because it's 50% of my expression toolbox.
2943120	2944120	Do you understand?
2944120	2946120	So we can classify the data in this way.
2946120	2956120	In this task, we have self-improvement, body contact, and reciprocity.
2956120	2959120	We use uTest to analyze the data.
2959120	2963120	You don't need to care about the test, it's just an analysis of the data.
2966120	2968120	Let's see the result.
2968120	2971120	In this result, there is a bar.
2971120	2975120	This bar is the video data.
2975120	2983120	The box above is the task data.
2983120	2989120	Do you know what p-value is?
2989120	2992120	If you don't know, just say you don't know.
2998120	3002120	3, 2, 1
3002120	3004120	Ok, everyone knows.
3004120	3006120	Let's say everyone knows what p-value is.
3012120	3017120	In the body contact, the blue bar is America, and the red bar is Taiwan.
3017120	3024120	I don't like the red bar is Taiwan, but I didn't think about it when I chose the color.
3025120	3030120	The Americans also don't know why I don't like the red bar.
3030120	3032120	Anyway, it's red.
3032120	3038120	As you can see, the body contact is higher than Taiwan in general touch.
3038120	3041120	You can't see the error bar here, but it's higher.
3041120	3044120	The hug is also high.
3045120	3056120	In the writing data, the Americans also mentioned more body contact-related methods.
3056120	3060120	But this one is close, p-value is 0.055.
3062120	3064120	Let's look at self-improvement.
3064120	3068120	The results of self-improvement are also close, but now the direction is all the opposite.
3068120	3074120	Taiwan is better at self-improvement than the U.S.
3074120	3080120	I don't know how they do it, but at least they say they do it well.
3080120	3097120	There are more videos explaining that self-improvement is a way of expression.
3097120	3103120	In the writing data, the Americans also mentioned more self-improvement-related methods.
3104120	3110120	Finally, there is no noticeable difference in reciprocity or reciprocating kindness.
3110120	3119120	Even though the blue bar is higher, but there is no noticeable difference.
3119120	3125120	The results support our assumption.
3125120	3132120	Taiwan is better at self-improvement than the U.S.
3132120	3134120	The U.S. uses more body contact.
3134120	3136120	There is no noticeable difference in reciprocity.
3136120	3142120	The background information of the victim is not important.
3142120	3145120	The only thing I want to talk about is this.
3146120	3148120	In this study,
3148120	3168120	Taiwan is in NTSU, National Taiwan Sport University.
3168120	3177120	The victim is in NTSU, and the U.S. is in UNC.
3177120	3179120	This will cause a problem.
3179120	3181120	I don't know if you can see my slide.
3181120	3185120	The U.S. is in the U.S., and the Taiwanese are in Taiwan.
3185120	3187120	This will cause a problem.
3187120	3194120	This is because the two groups of people have different cultures, so they have different behaviors and preferences.
3194120	3200120	Or because they were experimented in different places.
3200120	3203120	Or because they were experimented in different places, so they have different languages.
3203120	3208120	If the U.S. people can understand Chinese, they will also behave like Taiwanese.
3208120	3211120	Or do the same in Taiwan.
3211120	3213120	This is a confounding.
3213120	3221120	In Study 2, a methodological change is that we collect information from Taiwanese in the U.S.
3221120	3227120	We collect information from Taiwanese in the U.N.C.
3227120	3234120	We use English, so there is no linguistic priming.
3234120	3242120	We were asked by a reviewer, how do you know this has anything to do with gratitude?
3242120	3245120	For example, if you ask a Taiwanese, what are you doing right now?
3245120	3249120	You don't need any background information.
3249120	3251120	You will see that Taiwanese are more self-improving.
3251120	3254120	They are self-improving. They are studying and working all day.
3254120	3257120	The U.S. people will report to the U.N.C. at any time.
3257120	3262120	The reviewer will ask, how do you know this is not a baseline difference?
3262120	3269120	How does this have anything to do with gratitude?
3269120	3274120	Another example, when we are happy, we watch a comedy.
3274120	3277120	It's funny. We bump into each other.
3277120	3279120	Look at the NBA players.
3279120	3282120	One shot, three points.
3282120	3284120	They bump into each other.
3284120	3287120	This has nothing to do with gratitude.
3287120	3289120	I bumped into him.
3289120	3291120	It's not his fault.
3291120	3293120	Maybe he passed the ball to me.
3293120	3295120	Not necessarily.
3295120	3297120	So body contact doesn't have to happen in gratitude.
3297120	3299120	There may be other positive emotions.
3299120	3304120	On the other hand, is self-improvement possible in other positive emotions?
3304120	3306120	It's possible.
3306120	3310120	When I feel that I am more powerful, I am more capable.
3310120	3314120	Am I theoretically more capable of self-improvement?
3314120	3316120	It's possible.
3316120	3318120	So self-improvement may not necessarily be gratitude.
3318120	3320120	It's just a general positivity.
3320120	3324120	This positivity indicates that I have more resources now to do this.
3324120	3329120	Another thing we need to control in Study 2 is
3333120	3335120	another positive emotion.
3335120	3337120	We need to show that this difference
3339120	3341120	is not entirely caused by gratitude,
3341120	3343120	but gratitude has a special effect
3343120	3345120	on the cultural difference.
3345120	3347120	So we ask the reader
3347120	3351120	when a stranger or a close other
3351120	3353120	feels grateful
3353120	3355120	or amused
3355120	3357120	by our positive emotions.
3357120	3359120	There are 4 conditions.
3359120	3361120	2x2
3361120	3363120	4 conditions
3363120	3365120	The reader will answer 4 times
3365120	3367120	in different combinations.
3369120	3371120	The reader will ask
3371120	3373120	if you want to thank this person
3373120	3375120	verbally
3375120	3377120	or touch that person
3377120	3379120	for whom you feel thankful.
3379120	3381120	This is body contact.
3381120	3383120	Repay the person.
3383120	3385120	This is reciprocity.
3385120	3387120	Pay you forward means
3387120	3389120	you are good to me,
3389120	3391120	I am good to the third person.
3391120	3393120	Socialize with the person.
3393120	3395120	This is another thing that was mentioned in Study 1.
3395120	3397120	He is good to me.
3397120	3399120	I feel grateful.
3399120	3401120	Let's go shopping with him tomorrow morning.
3401120	3403120	In this behavior,
3403120	3405120	shopping does not really do anything to this person.
3405120	3407120	But this is a socialization behavior.
3407120	3409120	Let's play together.
3409120	3411120	We think this behavior cannot be
3411120	3413120	because it does not
3413120	3415120	have a direct benefit to the other person.
3415120	3417120	So it cannot be reciprocity.
3417120	3419120	He did not pay you forward because there is no third person.
3419120	3421120	Will there be touch? I don't know.
3421120	3423120	It's not verbally thanks.
3423120	3425120	Verbal thanks means I will thank him.
3425120	3427120	So he is isolated.
3427120	3429120	Finally, improve yourself.
3429120	3431120	This is self-improvement.
3431120	3433120	So how many questions does the reader answer?
3433120	3435120	2x2x123456
3435120	3437120	Answer 24 questions.
3437120	3439120	Finally,
3439120	3441120	for each behavior,
3441120	3443120	for each emotion,
3443120	3445120	for each relationship,
3445120	3447120	we ask two different questions.
3447120	3449120	The first one is
3449120	3451120	how likely you are
3451120	3453120	to do this behavior.
3453120	3455120	This is the likelihood
3455120	3457120	and preference of their behavior.
3457120	3459120	The other one is
3459120	3461120	whether you want to do it or not.
3461120	3463120	But generally, if someone does it,
3463120	3465120	do you think this behavior is bizarre?
3465120	3467120	Can you understand?
3467120	3469120	This is the second question.
3469120	3471120	Is it understandable?
3471120	3473120	OK.
3473120	3475120	What's the question?
3475120	3477120	The reader did a lot of rating.
3481120	3483120	3, 2, 1
3483120	3485120	Let's assume there is no question.
3485120	3487120	Let's look at the result.
3489120	3491120	This analysis is tricky
3491120	3493120	because we don't compare
3493120	3495120	the scores of Taiwanese and Americans.
3495120	3497120	In the past,
3497120	3499120	I found that
3499120	3501120	this kind of rating scale
3501120	3503120	is problematic in cross-cultural research.
3503120	3505120	Because some people
3505120	3507120	such as Japanese, Taiwanese,
3507120	3509120	and South Korean
3509120	3511120	will deliberately avoid
3511120	3513120	extreme scores.
3513120	3515120	For example,
3515120	3517120	if the score is 1 to 9,
3517120	3519120	we will cut it off.
3519120	3521120	If the score is 2 to 8,
3521120	3523120	we will cut it off.
3523120	3525120	No matter what the score is,
3525120	3527120	we will cut it off.
3527120	3529120	Why?
3529120	3531120	Because
3531120	3533120	if you think about
3533120	3535120	the world of Tai Chi,
3535120	3537120	or the so-called
3537120	3539120	bias thinking,
3539120	3541120	if I ask you
3541120	3543120	if you think you are smart,
3543120	3545120	you might say
3545120	3547120	you think you are smart,
3547120	3549120	but are you extremely smart?
3549120	3551120	You might say no.
3551120	3553120	Then you might think
3553120	3555120	there are smart people in the world.
3555120	3557120	But are you really stupid?
3557120	3559120	Probably not.
3559120	3561120	There are probably more stupid people in the world.
3561120	3563120	So you go down to the bottom,
3563120	3565120	but you don't see the bottom,
3565120	3567120	and you go back.
3567120	3569120	So in such a
3569120	3571120	extremist culture,
3571120	3573120	people tend to avoid extreme scores.
3573120	3575120	Any score is.
3575120	3577120	Any score is.
3577120	3579120	Any score is.
3581120	3583120	So we made a
3583120	3585120	adjustment here.
3585120	3587120	We standardize the scores
3587120	3589120	of Taiwan and the US.
3589120	3591120	We standardize the scores of Taiwan and the US.
3591120	3593120	We only keep within cultural variation.
3593120	3595120	Then we do
3595120	3597120	the principal component analysis.
3597120	3599120	the principal component analysis.
3599120	3601120	No matter what you know,
3601120	3603120	I don't need to explain.
3603120	3605120	I don't need to explain.
3605120	3607120	I will explain how to interpret the result later.
3607120	3609120	Then we put these six
3609120	3611120	behaviors
3611120	3613120	in each culture.
3613120	3615120	So the scores of each culture
3615120	3617120	are standardized to 0.
3617120	3619120	mean to 0, standard deviation to 1.
3619120	3621120	mean to 0, standard deviation to 1.
3621120	3623120	Then for these six scores, we run the principal component analysis.
3623120	3625120	Then for these six scores, we run the principal component analysis.
3629120	3631120	Then we found that
3631120	3633120	these six scores
3633120	3635120	can form two components.
3635120	3637120	can form two components.
3637120	3639120	With these two components,
3639120	3641120	we can effectively summarize
3641120	3643120	the variation of these six behaviors.
3643120	3645120	the variation of these six behaviors.
3645120	3647120	We named these two components
3647120	3649120	We named these two components
3649120	3651120	expression and affiliation.
3651120	3653120	You will know why later.
3653120	3655120	But let's talk about how to interpret the result.
3655120	3657120	But let's talk about how to interpret the result.
3657120	3659120	As you can see,
3659120	3661120	there are six behaviors.
3661120	3663120	there are six behaviors.
3671120	3673120	The inner circle of the radar
3673120	3675120	is negative 0.5 to 0.
3675120	3677120	is negative 0.5 to 0.
3677120	3679120	For example,
3679120	3681120	if reciprocating kindness is 0,
3681120	3683120	if reciprocating kindness is 0,
3683120	3685120	it has nothing to do with the expression component.
3685120	3687120	it has nothing to do with the expression component.
3687120	3689120	If it is negative,
3689120	3691120	it is completely negative.
3693120	3695120	If the component is higher,
3695120	3697120	the reciprocating kindness will be lower.
3699120	3701120	The middle circle is 0 to 0.5.
3701120	3703120	The middle circle is 0 to 0.5.
3703120	3705120	The outer circle is 0.5 to 1.
3705120	3707120	The outer circle is 0.5 to 1.
3707120	3709120	It's a strong link.
3709120	3711120	It's a strong link.
3711120	3713120	There are six behaviors.
3713120	3715120	There are six behaviors.
3715120	3717120	The blue line is the same as the United States.
3717120	3719120	The blue line is the same as the United States.
3719120	3721120	For the United States,
3721120	3723120	the expression component
3723120	3725120	can summarize
3725120	3727120	can summarize
3727120	3729120	some behavior variations.
3729120	3731120	The most is verbal acknowledgement.
3731120	3733120	It's almost equal to verbal acknowledgement.
3735120	3737120	Perfect correlation.
3737120	3739120	There is also reciprocating kindness.
3739120	3741120	There is also reciprocating kindness.
3741120	3743120	These three behaviors
3743120	3745120	can be used on the spot.
3745120	3747120	can be used on the spot.
3747120	3749120	Body contact
3749120	3751120	has a high loading.
3753120	3755120	For the Americans,
3755120	3757120	for the Americans,
3757120	3759120	for the Americans,
3759120	3761120	the use of body contact
3761120	3763120	is similar to verbal acknowledgement.
3763120	3765120	is similar to verbal acknowledgement.
3765120	3767120	is similar to verbal acknowledgement.
3767120	3769120	Self-improvement is almost zero.
3769120	3771120	Self-improvement is almost zero.
3771120	3773120	But if you look at the results in Taiwan,
3773120	3775120	But if you look at the results in Taiwan,
3775120	3777120	verbal acknowledgement,
3777120	3779120	reciprocating kindness,
3779120	3781120	and pay you forward are all outside the circle.
3781120	3783120	We will use these three behaviors
3783120	3785120	to express gratitude.
3785120	3787120	We all know in our lives.
3787120	3789120	But body contact is now
3789120	3791120	I remember this point 3.
3791120	3793120	A very awkward position.
3793120	3795120	A very awkward position.
3795120	3797120	But at the same time,
3797120	3799120	self-improvement has gone out.
3799120	3801120	Self-improvement
3801120	3803120	Self-improvement
3803120	3805120	is similar to
3805120	3807120	verbal acknowledgement,
3807120	3809120	pay you forward,
3809120	3811120	and reciprocating kindness.
3811120	3813120	We see that
3813120	3815120	these three behaviors
3815120	3817120	verbal acknowledgement, pay you forward,
3817120	3819120	and reciprocating kindness
3819120	3821120	are not cultural differences.
3821120	3823120	But
3823120	3825120	But
3825120	3827120	the two behaviors
3827120	3829120	self-improvement and body contact
3829120	3831120	the two behaviors
3831120	3833120	are different.
3833120	3835120	The two behaviors are different.
3837120	3839120	This component is named
3839120	3841120	expression
3841120	3843120	because it is
3843120	3845120	derived from verbal acknowledgement
3845120	3847120	and reciprocating kindness.
3847120	3849120	derived from verbal acknowledgement
3849120	3851120	It is very expressive.
3851120	3853120	On the other hand,
3853120	3855120	the second component
3855120	3857120	is socializing.
3857120	3859120	It is more interactive.
3859120	3861120	It is more interactive.
3861120	3863120	It is more interactive.
3863120	3865120	The two cultures are relatively high.
3865120	3867120	The two cultures are relatively high.
3867120	3869120	Interestingly,
3869120	3871120	if the component 1
3871120	3873120	if the component 1
3873120	3875120	is not explained,
3875120	3877120	it will be pushed here, including socializing.
3877120	3879120	For both cultures, socializing is pushed here.
3879120	3881120	For both cultures, socializing is pushed here.
3881120	3883120	We call it affiliation.
3883120	3885120	But for Americans,
3885120	3887120	self-improvement is pushed here.
3887120	3889120	Body contact is negative.
3889120	3891120	Body contact is negative.
3891120	3893120	For Taiwanese,
3893120	3895120	For Taiwanese,
3895120	3897120	self-improvement is not
3897120	3899120	under the same category as socializing.
3899120	3901120	self-improvement is not under the same category as socializing.
3901120	3903120	But body contact is.
3903120	3905120	You can imagine.
3905120	3907120	You can imagine.
3907120	3909120	You can imagine.
3909120	3911120	You can imagine.
3911120	3913120	When do we have contact with others?
3913120	3915120	When do we have contact with others?
3915120	3917120	Only in a long-term, intimate relationship.
3917120	3919120	Only in a long-term, intimate relationship.
3919120	3921120	But when can we do self-improvement?
3921120	3923120	When can we do self-improvement?
3923120	3925120	When it's time to do it.
3925120	3927120	So it is expression.
3927120	3929120	So it is expression.
3929120	3931120	But affiliation-wise,
3931120	3933120	body contact is the concept.
3933120	3935120	But in contrast,
3935120	3937120	body contact is the concept.
3937120	3939120	body contact is the concept.
3939120	3941120	What to do is your own business.
3941120	3943120	But for long-term relationship,
3943120	3945120	they will do self-improvement.
3945120	3947120	they will do self-improvement.
3947120	3949120	But it's not in the same context.
3949120	3951120	But it's not in the same context.
3951120	3953120	Last one.
3953120	3955120	Last one.
3955120	3957120	Last one.
3957120	3959120	Excluding asking people in these two cultures,
3959120	3961120	asking people in these two cultures,
3961120	3963120	can you understand?
3963120	3965120	If someone did it,
3965120	3967120	if someone did it,
3967120	3969120	It was not very well understood.
3969120	3971120	The picture you see is the part of understanding.
3971120	3973120	The picture you see is the part of understanding.
3973120	3975120	There is little difference between the two cultures,
3975120	3977120	Especially the expression,
3977120	3979120	the Americans and Taiwanese
3979120	3981120	almost overlap.
3981120	3983120	This shows that Americans
3983120	3985120	can understand what self-improvement is.
3985120	3987120	It can be used to express gratitude.
3987120	3989120	It can be used to express gratitude.
3989120	3991120	Taiwan is OK.
3991120	3993120	Taiwan is OK.
3993120	3995120	But naturally,
3995120	3997120	it's not that the two cultures can't understand each other.
3997120	3999120	It's just that their behavior choices are different.
3999120	4001120	It's just that their behavior choices are different.
4001120	4003120	The implication of this is that
4003120	4005120	the expression of gratitude
4005120	4007120	The expression of gratitude
4007120	4009120	is a conscious behavior.
4009120	4011120	is a conscious behavior.
4011120	4013120	In front of me,
4013120	4015120	I can think of these options,
4015120	4017120	and I consciously choose this
4017120	4019120	and I consciously choose this
4019120	4021120	because it fits my context
4021120	4023120	or my culture or cultural context.
4023120	4025120	or my cultural context.
4025120	4027120	My options are only some.
4027120	4029120	My options are only some.
4029120	4031120	Only in my culture.
4031120	4033120	Only in my culture.
4033120	4035120	Let's summarize it.
4035120	4037120	Verbal acknowledgment,
4037120	4039120	reciprocal kindness, and paying you forward
4039120	4041120	are the same in both cultures.
4041120	4043120	But bodily contact
4043120	4045120	But bodily contact
4045120	4047120	Bye-bye.
4047120	4049120	Bye-bye.
4049120	4051120	Sky is gone.
4051120	4053120	Sky is gone.
4053120	4055120	Sky is gone.
4055120	4057120	Sky is gone.
4057120	4059120	In the US,
4059120	4061120	bodily contact
4061120	4063120	and these three universal behaviors
4063120	4065120	and these three universal behaviors
4065120	4067120	are tied together,
4067120	4069120	but there is no self-improvement.
4069120	4071120	On the other hand, in Taiwan,
4071120	4073120	self-improvement is tied,
4073120	4075120	but bodily contact is not.
4075120	4077120	What is implication?
4077120	4079120	What is implication?
4079120	4081120	We call it universal.
4081120	4083120	We call it universal.
4083120	4085120	Obviously,
4085120	4087120	emotions are expressed
4087120	4089120	in different cultures.
4089120	4091120	Is there anything
4091120	4093120	in cross-cultural
4093120	4095120	that is universal?
4095120	4097120	that is universal?
4097120	4099120	In our research,
4099120	4101120	although the behavior is different,
4101120	4103120	although the behavior is different,
4103120	4105120	but the function,
4105120	4107120	at least gratitude,
4107120	4109120	is the same.
4109120	4111120	It is to build or maintain relationships.
4111120	4113120	Gratitude is used to support
4113120	4115120	interpersonal relationships.
4115120	4117120	Just because interpersonal relationships
4117120	4119120	are in different cultures,
4119120	4121120	in different structures,
4121120	4123120	in different ways,
4123120	4125120	so you have to fit the relational structure
4125120	4127120	to use different relationships.
4127120	4129120	So functional universal exists.
4129120	4131120	If you keep this function
4131120	4133120	in the second line,
4133120	4135120	if you make this function
4135120	4137120	a constant,
4137120	4139120	then you have to adjust the behavior
4139120	4141120	to fit the culture.
4141120	4143120	That's what we want to say.
4143120	4145120	Thank you.
4149120	4151120	Any questions?
4153120	4155120	Let me answer the question.
4157120	4159120	Is it because the country is
4159120	4161120	confused, so it develops extreme
4161120	4163120	individualism, or
4163120	4165120	is it because the people in the country
4165120	4167120	have the characteristics of individualism?
4167120	4169120	I think this question can be divided into
4169120	4171120	two levels.
4171120	4173120	The first is that
4173120	4175120	they are such a country,
4175120	4177120	so they develop such a culture.
4177120	4179120	Then you dig up the culture,
4179120	4181120	it may not be individualism,
4181120	4183120	it may not be confusion.
4183120	4185120	So is it the current situation
4185120	4187120	that affects their culture,
4187120	4189120	or is it the current culture
4189120	4191120	that affects their current situation?
4191120	4193120	Or is it a specific culture,
4193120	4195120	or is it American culture?
4195120	4197120	Is it because they are in a
4197120	4199120	confused environment,
4199120	4201120	or is it American culture?
4201120	4203120	Is it a specific case,
4203120	4205120	or is it a general culture?
4205120	4207120	Let me make it simple.
4207120	4209120	It's the United States.
4209120	4211120	I think both exist in the United States.
4211120	4213120	The history of the United States
4213120	4215120	is about immigration.
4215120	4217120	Immigration to a new continent.
4217120	4219120	So it's a country
4219120	4221120	that's in a state of confusion.
4221120	4223120	In such a natural environment,
4223120	4225120	as I just argued,
4225120	4227120	you need to form
4227120	4229120	a form of individualism
4229120	4231120	and a way of
4231120	4233120	living
4233120	4235120	to create
4235120	4237120	a new natural environment,
4237120	4239120	a new continent.
4239120	4241120	So it looks like
4241120	4243120	it's possible for
4243120	4245120	confusion to form individualism.
4245120	4247120	But at the same time,
4247120	4249120	why did Mayflower
4249120	4251120	come to the United States in the first place?
4251120	4253120	Because of religious reform.
4253120	4255120	What is religious reform?
4255120	4257120	It's when churches
4257120	4259120	form a rigid
4259120	4261120	social organization.
4261120	4263120	They want to
4263120	4265120	connect with God.
4265120	4267120	Is this religious reform?
4267120	4269120	No, it's not.
4269120	4271120	Mayflower is the UK.
4271120	4273120	But if we
4273120	4275120	look at new religion reform
4275120	4277120	it's a form of individualism.
4277120	4279120	Individualism
4279120	4281120	forces people to
4281120	4283120	live in a state of confusion.
4283120	4285120	That's where the UK came from.
4285120	4287120	But what I'm talking about
4287120	4289120	is American culture and natural environment.
4289120	4291120	If you
4291120	4293120	dig it up
4293120	4295120	into an empty X,
4295120	4297120	what would it be?
4297120	4299120	If you dig it up into an empty X,
4299120	4301120	what would it be?
4301120	4303120	I think both are possible.
4303120	4305120	Maybe
4305120	4307120	we need more
4307120	4309120	evidence to support it.
4309120	4311120	But at least
4313120	4315120	in East Asian culture,
4315120	4317120	I think both
4317120	4319120	are possible.
4321120	4323120	A study found that
4323120	4325120	in places where
4325120	4327120	there's a flood,
4327120	4329120	compared to
4329120	4331120	wheat fields,
4331120	4333120	it's easier to
4333120	4335120	form collectivism.
4335120	4337120	Why?
4337120	4339120	Because you need to
4339120	4341120	work with others.
4341120	4343120	So natural environment
4343120	4345120	creates culture.
4345120	4347120	On the other hand,
4347120	4349120	people who are
4349120	4351120	used to collectivism
4351120	4353120	will they
4353120	4355120	enhance the environment?
4355120	4357120	I think they will.
4357120	4359120	It's simple.
4359120	4361120	You can't
4361120	4363120	just let it go.
4363120	4365120	It's been happening in history.
4365120	4367120	So
4367120	4369120	I think the UK-UK relationship
4369120	4371120	is also possible, at least in East Asian culture.
4371120	4373120	But I can't say
4373120	4375120	how far it can go.
4375120	4377120	I've answered this question.
4379120	4381120	Here's another question.
4383120	4385120	There's a small question.
4385120	4387120	Have you seen a similar research
4387120	4389120	but in European culture?
4389120	4391120	I'm curious
4391120	4393120	if European culture is similar to
4393120	4395120	American or Asian culture.
4395120	4397120	Some European cultures
4397120	4399120	are similar.
4399120	4401120	I've seen
4401120	4403120	a similar article.
4403120	4405120	It's from the UK.
4405120	4407120	The result
4407120	4409120	is my interpretation.
4409120	4411120	The UK's gratitude
4411120	4413120	is stuck
4413120	4415120	in the American way
4415120	4417120	and the
4417120	4419120	collectivism way.
4419120	4421120	I think the article
4421120	4423120	is funny.
4423120	4425120	It's like
4425120	4427120	all people see white people
4427120	4429120	as the same race,
4429120	4431120	but all research is about Americans.
4431120	4433120	All people see
4433120	4435120	Western culture as the same race,
4435120	4437120	but it's all about Americans.
4437120	4439120	He can't stand it
4439120	4441120	because he's British.
4441120	4443120	Fukuyama
4443120	4445120	talks about
4445120	4447120	trust between people
4447120	4449120	as a
4449120	4451120	social capital.
4451120	4453120	Social capital is
4453120	4455120	something that can be fulfilled.
4455120	4457120	Let me put it this way.
4457120	4459120	He thinks people's trust
4459120	4461120	can be fulfilled.
4461120	4463120	He's a
4463120	4465120	Japanese-American.
4465120	4467120	His first name is
4467120	4469120	Francis.
4469120	4471120	He's American.
4471120	4473120	He has a strong Japanese identity.
4473120	4475120	He thinks
4475120	4477120	culture should be divided.
4477120	4479120	He looks at Italy,
4479120	4481120	Germany,
4481120	4483120	France, South and North.
4483120	4485120	He divides them.
4485120	4487120	His argument is
4487120	4489120	that
4489120	4491120	he divides
4491120	4493120	several different collectivism.
4493120	4495120	At least he thinks
4495120	4497120	Italy,
4497120	4499120	South and
4499120	4501120	Mexico,
4501120	4503120	and some South American countries
4503120	4505120	are collectivism.
4505120	4507120	I don't know if you have
4507120	4509120	friends in Mexico.
4509120	4511120	Their family concept is anti-Semitism.
4511120	4513120	It's like
4513120	4515120	East Asian culture.
4515120	4517120	They also have
4519120	4521120	honor culture.
4521120	4523120	If you insult
4523120	4525120	my family,
4525120	4527120	I'll kill you.
4527120	4529120	If you insult my family,
4529120	4531120	I'll kill you.
4531120	4533120	But I have to kill you.
4533120	4535120	You can see this
4535120	4537120	in the UK
4537120	4539120	and Mexico.
4539120	4541120	That's right.
4541120	4543120	Fashion Fury is like this.
4543120	4545120	Everything is for family.
4545120	4547120	When I was in class,
4547120	4549120	I told my students
4549120	4551120	that it's quite special.
4551120	4553120	You're investigating
4553120	4555120	a car thief.
4555120	4557120	You can catch him.
4557120	4559120	But you can't.
4559120	4561120	He felt the strong family bond.
4561120	4563120	So he
4563120	4565120	stole a car.
4565120	4567120	That's Fashion Fury.
4567120	4569120	So
4569120	4571120	there's
4571120	4573120	another thing
4573120	4575120	I want to say.
4575120	4577120	We didn't
4577120	4579120	push it
4579120	4581120	to individualism
4581120	4583120	and collectivism.
4583120	4585120	When we talk about
4585120	4587120	individualism, we're talking about
4587120	4589120	America.
4589120	4591120	Collectivism is like
4591120	4593120	Taiwan, Japan, Korea.
4593120	4595120	We don't know
4595120	4597120	whether other countries
4597120	4599120	can fit
4599120	4601120	this
4601120	4603120	dimensionalized
4603120	4605120	distinction.
4605120	4607120	So I'm careful
4607120	4609120	comparing Taiwan and America.
4609120	4611120	These two specific
4611120	4613120	entities.
4613120	4615120	We're not
4615120	4617120	drawing two dots on a dimension.
4617120	4619120	But when we draw,
4619120	4621120	we still follow
4621120	4623120	the past research.
4625120	4627120	It's a limitation.
4627120	4629120	Any other questions?
4631120	4633120	Hello.
4633120	4635120	Hello.
4635120	4637120	You go first.
4637120	4639120	The self-improvement
4639120	4641120	you mentioned earlier.
4641120	4643120	Is it
4643120	4645120	a common
4645120	4647120	professional term?
4647120	4649120	Or
4649120	4651120	is it special?
4651120	4653120	It sounds
4653120	4655120	like
4655120	4657120	you're grateful
4657120	4659120	for the self-improvement.
4659120	4661120	It sounds like
4661120	4663120	you want to do
4663120	4665120	what you want
4665120	4667120	according to your expectations.
4667120	4669120	You want to satisfy
4669120	4671120	your partner's expectations.
4671120	4673120	But what I do
4673120	4675120	when I satisfy
4675120	4677120	my partner's expectations
4677120	4679120	doesn't mean
4679120	4681120	I'm improving something.
4681120	4683120	Do you understand?
4683120	4685120	I understand.
4685120	4687120	In this case,
4687120	4689120	your research still
4689120	4691120	classified as self-improvement.
4691120	4693120	But in fact,
4693120	4695120	it's not improving anything.
4695120	4697120	It's just satisfying
4697120	4699120	your partner's expectations.
4699120	4701120	That's what I mean.
4707120	4709120	I agree.
4709120	4711120	From this perspective,
4711120	4713120	it's still
4713120	4715120	satisfying your partner's expectations.
4715120	4717120	It's like reciprocity.
4717120	4719120	But interestingly,
4719120	4721120	if we ask
4721120	4723120	what you expect
4723120	4725120	from your partner,
4725120	4727120	you expect
4727120	4729120	a better
4729120	4731120	social role.
4731120	4733120	For example,
4733120	4735120	if my mom wants me to become
4735120	4737120	a better student,
4737120	4739120	or she wants me to repay her.
4739120	4741120	There's a cultural difference
4741120	4743120	in expectation.
4743120	4745120	If you say
4745120	4747120	you satisfy your partner's expectations,
4747120	4749120	but we found
4749120	4751120	cultural differences.
4751120	4753120	You're just
4753120	4755120	using the difference
4755120	4757120	in expectation
4757120	4759120	to explain.
4759120	4761120	Otherwise,
4761120	4763120	the result won't be there.
4763120	4765120	I think
4765120	4767120	your question is
4767120	4769120	interesting and good.
4769120	4771120	Because it shows
4771120	4773120	that
4773120	4775120	on the surface,
4775120	4777120	there's a cultural difference
4777120	4779120	in appreciation
4779120	4781120	and universality.
4781120	4783120	But
4783120	4785120	we need to dig deeper.
4785120	4787120	For example,
4787120	4789120	you think the expectation is the same,
4789120	4791120	but the result
4791120	4793120	is different.
4793120	4795120	I can accept that.
4799120	4801120	Do you have an answer?
4801120	4803120	Yes.
4803120	4805120	There's an interesting point
4805120	4807120	about expectation.
4807120	4809120	I didn't expect that.
4809120	4811120	I have another question.
4811120	4813120	You said that
4813120	4815120	appreciation can help
4815120	4817120	interpersonal relationships.
4817120	4819120	Am I right?
4819120	4821120	Yes.
4821120	4823120	When you talk about interpersonal relationships,
4823120	4825120	you need to think about yourself
4825120	4827120	and your partner.
4827120	4829120	When I appreciate my partner,
4829120	4831120	it's just a one-way relationship.
4831120	4833120	It's not about
4833120	4835120	how my partner reacts to my appreciation.
4835120	4837120	If it's not about
4837120	4839120	how my partner reacts to my appreciation,
4839120	4841120	it's hard to talk about
4841120	4843120	the impact of appreciation
4843120	4845120	on interpersonal relationships.
4845120	4847120	I only talked about one-way relationship.
4847120	4849120	I didn't talk about
4849120	4851120	how my partner reacts to my appreciation.
4851120	4853120	I can't talk about
4853120	4855120	how my relationship
4855120	4857120	with my partner
4857120	4859120	will improve
4859120	4861120	after the whole process.
4861120	4863120	If we need to think about
4863120	4865120	how to improve
4865120	4867120	interpersonal relationships,
4867120	4869120	we need to think about
4869120	4871120	how to improve
4871120	4873120	our partner's reaction.
4873120	4875120	How to design
4875120	4877120	such a research?
4877120	4879120	I think
4879120	4881120	this is a
4881120	4883120	good question.
4883120	4885120	I think
4885120	4887120	this is a good question.
4887120	4889120	It sounds like
4889120	4891120	it's a compliment.
4891120	4893120	I think
4893120	4895120	it's a good question.
4895120	4897120	As I said before,
4897120	4899120	I totally agree with you.
4899120	4901120	As I said before,
4901120	4903120	emotion culture
4903120	4905120	has a set of
4905120	4907120	ways of expression.
4907120	4909120	In addition to a group of people
4909120	4911120	who are used to this way of expression,
4911120	4913120	at the same time,
4913120	4915120	a group of people
4915120	4917120	who can understand
4917120	4919120	their partner's way of expression
4919120	4921120	can achieve
4921120	4923120	their goal.
4923120	4925120	Otherwise, it's useless.
4925120	4927120	So,
4927120	4929120	in this project,
4929120	4931120	in addition to the difference in expression,
4931120	4933120	we also assume
4933120	4935120	the difference in perception.
4935120	4937120	As you said,
4937120	4939120	people who receive appreciation
4939120	4941120	can interpret it
4941120	4943120	as expected,
4943120	4945120	and turn this interpretation
4945120	4947120	into
4947120	4949120	a friendly signal
4949120	4951120	to promote the relationship.
4951120	4953120	We are doing this now.
4953120	4955120	We are doing this now.
4955120	4957120	This should not be
4957120	4959120	an answer to your question.
4959120	4961120	I just said I agree.
4961120	4963120	We are doing this now.
4963120	4965120	But I understand.
4965120	4967120	As you said,
4967120	4969120	when we study
4969120	4971120	how a person expresses
4971120	4973120	his appreciation,
4973120	4975120	it also represents
4975120	4977120	appreciation.
4977120	4979120	I can understand.
4979120	4981120	Thank you.
4981120	4983120	Okay.
4983120	4985120	Thank you, everyone.
4985120	4987120	We are running out of time.
4987120	4989120	But it was a great talk.
4989120	4991120	Thank you for your questions.
4991120	4993120	Thank you again to our speaker,
4993120	4995120	Zhang Yanping.

5001120	5003120	Wait for me.
5005120	5007120	Now,
5007120	5009120	can you see
5009120	5011120	my screen?
5015120	5017120	Can you?
5019120	5021120	I can see myself.
5021120	5023120	So,

5067120	5069120	The topic is
5069120	5071120	quite technical.
5071120	5073120	Next week, it's cryogenic engineering
5073120	5075120	in various
5075120	5077120	advanced experiments.
5077120	5079120	See you next week.
