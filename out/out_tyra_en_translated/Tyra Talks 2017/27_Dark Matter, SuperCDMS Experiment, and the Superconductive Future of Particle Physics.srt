1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
F

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, I forgot

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Share

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Share screen

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Wow

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dark Matter Super CDMS

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
which is what I'm doing right now

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and the Super Conductive Future

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
of Particle Physics

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which is

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
what I'm doing right now

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, next page

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The topic I'm going to talk about today

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
will be divided into two parts

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The first part is

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the physical part

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to talk about Dark Matter

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which is mainly

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
focused on

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the direct detection

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
part of the experiment

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What is its physics?

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is the current

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
state of the field?

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is everyone's goal? What are the difficulties?

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How to do this experiment? How to measure this thing?

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It should be more reliable

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and more interesting

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The second part will be my own work

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which is quite R&D

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
People who are interested in

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
technology may be more interested

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But it should be very related

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My screen is a bit laggy

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
First of all, because we have already

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
introduced it before

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What is

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the basic example

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of a

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
model and a theoretical basis

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So I'm going to talk about it very quickly

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So basically

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Can you see my mouse?

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can you see my mouse?

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can you see it?

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There are many basic examples

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We think these basic examples

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
are the basic materials

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we know

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in the universe

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because of some reasons

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
we think there are still things in the universe

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that we don't know

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We can't use this model to explain

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But anyway, this is called Standard Model

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It is the best description

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you are

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
interested in this

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can look it up on Wikipedia

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are six quarks

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
three leptons

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
neutrinos

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and X

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The point I want to talk about today

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
will focus on

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the ones you can see on the screen

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The red one is a mole

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The blue one is a neutrino

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Basically, this is

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the most important example for us

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Because honestly, in life

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the most important thing is

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the things you are interested in

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the things you breathe

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and the things that make up you

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
These are the only two

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sorry, there are electrons

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
These are the three

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There is another important one

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The white ghost

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It is called light

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It sounds very mysterious

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
like a laser gun

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
these things

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
exchange light like baseball

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and they will

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
reach the energy balance

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Basically, the heat balance

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
After reaching the heat balance

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
everything will have a black hole

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is very important

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because my family often ask me

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is dark matter a black hole?

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Actually, it is not

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You will know why

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It is very vague

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is the universe we usually see

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
When we look at it

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the whole universe is black

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then you will say

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why do we think

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
everything is the matter we know

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and it will exchange light

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
like a baseball

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is actually

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the universe we see

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
with a good instrument

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Like this

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The whole universe is basically bright

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The different colors

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
are basically the same as the black hole

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It corresponds to different temperatures

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You see the brightest one in the middle

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It is the galactic plane

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There are many planets

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and a lot of energy

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So there will be a lot of energy

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My mouse

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay, you see the back

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This part is very red

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The energy here is very low

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It only has a foreground

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It only has a background

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The background is the whole background of the universe

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It is very cold

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It is only 3 degrees K

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But basically it has a temperature

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we can still see it

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This picture is basically

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
filled with colors

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How can we say there is any dark matter

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
that we don't know

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let me see the next page

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because there was a very wise man

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He said

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Vader was seduced by

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The dark side of the force

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The dark side of the force

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The force is what gives Jedi his power

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's an energy field

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
created by all living things

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It surrounds us

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It permits us

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It binds the galaxy together

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It sounds very confusing

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know what he is talking about

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I will focus on it

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The dark side of the force

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It is the dark side that binds us together

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This phrase is from 1976

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So you can imagine

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is probably the time

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
when we started to be interested in

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
dark matter

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think this statement is correct

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We started to have dark matter

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Actually

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What does this mean

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There is a picture here

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The center is the brightest part

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The brightest part is the center of our galaxy

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Then the horizontal axis

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is the distance from the center of the galaxy

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to the outside

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The vertical axis is

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the particle

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
in that position

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The speed of rotation around the center of the galaxy

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then you can see

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the yellow data

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The yellow data is

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the stars over there

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, like the sun

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So we can see those stars

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
are moving

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We know how fast they are moving

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then the yellow data

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
is the part of the galaxy

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That is

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the size of the galaxy

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
300 years ago

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But then we found

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We can keep looking out

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
According to the dark radiation we just used

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Our instrument is getting better

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We can see the infrared

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then we see

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the blue hyperfine structure

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The blue dot

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's basically

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the light source

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can keep pushing

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to the outside

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The position of 50,000 light years

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It can be connected

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is what we know now

214
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The size of a galaxy

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then we go through

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
to see

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What we see

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The speed of these particles

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We can go

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay, there's a point

222
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
According to the relativity

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's basically Newton's law

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
According to

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the traditional law we know

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can guess

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We just see the speed

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We can guess how much mass there is

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It goes around this kind of thing

230
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It goes around the inner side of the orbit

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So we get

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We get the following line

233
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But actually

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What we observe

236
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The speed of rotation is the line above

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So in the middle

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You will find that

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The speed of rotation

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
is the speed of the line above

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The actual weight of the orbit

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is much more than

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
what we can see

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay

246
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So we really can't see it

247
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In the 1980s

248
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's because our instrumentation

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
is not good enough

250
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There's nothing you can't see

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay

252
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So for a while

253
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Dark matter still had some

254
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
controversy

255
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Then in the 1980s to the 1990s

256
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We started to know

257
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that everything we can see is almost right

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So we started to think

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Is it that the particles we know

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
can meet this nature

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The answer is yes

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There are three kinds of particles

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There are three kinds

264
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Anyway, there is one

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There are three kinds of particles

266
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It does have this nature

267
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But what we know

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Here is a point

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We think we don't know

270
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Some people

271
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What we already know

272
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It basically has something to do

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
with the particles we already know

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because the particles and the particles

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
are composite

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They have a proportional relationship

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Because they will

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
use it when they change

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So according to all the stars we observe

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Those stars are the particles and the particles

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We can reverse the most

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How many particles are there

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Can it

284
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
cover our

285
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
missing mass budget

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The answer is that it can't exceed 6%

287
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Can't exceed 6% at most

288
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay

289
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So basically we think

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It may be new physics

291
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The more things

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The answer is that it shouldn't be like this

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because the quality you see

294
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You estimate it as a line

295
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So you mean

296
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If I have more images I can't see

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Will fit the original data

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That is to say, when the upper line is

299
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
When the upper line is more

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So why is it bigger when the upper line is more

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's write a book

302
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Is it easier to turn like this

303
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Then assume that the middle is symmetrical

304
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You can think of it as all in the middle

305
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ok

306
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Just that

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Transverse speed

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes yes yes

309
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh no

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's the speed of turning

311
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So actually you can see

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Its speed

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What is the real speed

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hundreds of kilometers per hour

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That every second

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So it's really slow

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Basically it is

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It doesn't have to be close to the speed of light

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Ok

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This number will be a bit important

321
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So actually darkmatter

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There are a lot of clues

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I won't say it's evidence

324
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I haven't measured it yet

325
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So there are a lot of clues

326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This clue is actually the most suspicious

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There are a lot of reasons for him

328
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't think like this

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But darkmatter has a lot of other clues

330
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I put it in the background

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you are interested, you can ask

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Ok

333
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So anyway

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We have to have extra quality

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
To produce extra power

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Or somehow you want your theory

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
To produce extra power

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
To explain this question

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Is there any use of darkmatter?

340
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ok

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Then I will jump directly to

342
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is what I saw recently

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think it's very interesting

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That article

345
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I think you should know better than me

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Ok

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Ok

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You should know who this is

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes

350
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This is my

351
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is the latest issue of CERN Courier

352
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
An article

353
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I magnified the focus

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I still have citations

356
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So I magnified the citation

357
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It says

358
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Let's see where to start

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Ok

360
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's see

361
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's see

362
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's see

363
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Here

364
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It says

365
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Basically they say

366
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
EPR pair

367
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
EPR pair

368
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Refer to ER Einstein Rosenbridge

369
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And one part that connects the two

370
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Part of the black hole geometry

371
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And then

372
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This idea spring

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
By many theorists

374
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
In particular in the context

375
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Of ADS-CFT correspondence

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ok

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's look back

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The point is

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The problem with this theory is

380
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think it's motivated by

381
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What I just said

382
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So it can work

383
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
In galaxy scale

384
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But the problem is

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It can't

386
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Or it's not good enough

387
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
In phenomenology

388
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
To work

389
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
To estimate

390
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Something bigger

391
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Something bigger

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
For example, I just said

393
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
A galaxy

394
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Then it will have a

395
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Modified gravity effect

396
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But the problem is

397
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We have another observation

398
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If there are two galaxies

399
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Then these two galaxies

400
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Have a dark matter

401
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then they contrast

402
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We can see two

403
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Things like matter

404
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Dark matter and non-active matter

405
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This kind of local

406
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Dynamic behavior

407
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It doesn't have a good way to explain

408
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Its work now

409
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Is to say

410
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If it is a whole universe

411
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It will have

412
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Modified CMB

413
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is it effective?

414
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Ok

415
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I actually framed another part

416
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How would

417
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Emergent gravity affect

418
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The physics

419
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Someone asked me

420
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There are many different explanations

421
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
For example, extra dimension

422
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
EREPR

423
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Modified gravity

424
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Modified Newtonian dynamics

425
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's a standard name

426
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But why do we want to do dark matter

427
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think the reason is simple

428
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Because dark matter can be done

429
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Even if you

430
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't think it's a good

431
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Maybe it's the right theory

432
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But rule out and prove it

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Should be equally important

434
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So we are doing this now

435
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I would say this mod is difficult to do

436
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But someone is thinking

437
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
For example, microgravity

438
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Some light experiment

439
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That

440
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The details

441
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think you should know better than me

442
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So I don't really understand

443
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There can be special

444
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That

445
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It means

446
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Right

447
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So what I just imagined

448
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Assuming there is an extra dimension

449
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Contact

450
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Then your thinking

451
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
3 plus 1

452
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Will be proportional to

453
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This contact

454
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Its size

455
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So if you are here

456
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Bigger or smaller

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's more likely to be proportional

458
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
To the outside

459
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But this

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Compactify

461
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Dimension

462
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Right

463
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Assuming the size

464
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Is not constant

465
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Here is so big

466
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then it means in different places

467
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Four or more

468
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Its size will be different

469
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Should be possible

470
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't know how they do it

471
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But

472
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The point is that someone thinks so

473
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Then

474
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I think

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll jump back

476
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Faster

477
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where did I say

478
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Ok

479
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Actually

480
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's more interesting

481
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That

482
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If someone is interested in other

483
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Various

484
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Prediction

485
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Prediction

486
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Various observations

487
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So

488
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We have a missing mass

489
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
A

490
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So

491
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What you see now

492
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Is our Milky Way

493
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This is what we think of Milky Way

494
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The Milky Way we see

495
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Then next to it, I help you zoom in

496
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's our solar system

497
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Then we go around the sun

498
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The third one over there

499
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why is this important

500
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because we do experiments on the earth

501
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Everyone knows how important it is

502
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What about the picture in the upper left corner

503
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Is to say

504
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is not a special phenomenon

505
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That is to say, only our Milky Way Galaxy

506
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Because before

507
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
A lot of people think

508
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Will you observe like this

509
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Is it because we are in the Milky Way

510
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So we are in the Milky Way

511
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That is not the center of gravity

512
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Then observe there

513
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Then you have to correct it

514
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Such a

515
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
A constant change

516
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That

517
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Will there be a problem with this experiment

518
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But this thing

519
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's basically a

520
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A

521
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
A whole observation of the 70s

522
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Completely broken

523
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This person later got that

524
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
President's Freedom Award

525
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He observed a lot of galaxies

526
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Then there is such a phenomenon

527
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So what you see in the upper left corner is

528
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I said that

529
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The speed of rotation

530
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's really flat, isn't it?

531
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But if you

532
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Gmm is equal to R squared

533
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In fact, it should be

534
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
In contrast to once

535
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That is, it will keep going down

536
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Uh, once

537
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
V squared will be in contrast to R

538
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
V squared will be in contrast to R

539
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
OK, so we really think

540
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What should it look like

541
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It should look like this

542
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a little bit of lag

543
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There is a halo

544
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Something like a light cloud

545
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
OK, so this thing is called Dark Matter Halo

546
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Then we are in that

547
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Inside, so we have been constantly

548
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
In Dark Matter Halo

549
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Uh, moving is being soaked inside

550
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
A feeling of being soaked inside

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I have a question, then you

552
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Uh, that is to say

553
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How big is it

554
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Its scale

555
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Its effect will come out slowly

556
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because you want to look at the Galaxy scale

557
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Then I said, for example, the solar system scale or the galaxy group scale

558
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It will also have a laser curve

559
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Then when you draw it out

560
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Is it the same as that

561
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, I forgot to put that thing

562
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That is

563
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This is very interesting, you can ask a question

564
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That is

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How long does it take for us to turn the sun

566
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
One year, right?

567
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Then we solar system

568
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
How long does it take to turn the galaxy

569
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
OK

570
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Basically, there is no life

571
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Can feel the difference

572
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So you can imagine

573
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We are in a

574
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
With

575
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The center of the galaxy as the origin

576
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Coordinate inside

577
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Surrounding the sun to do local rotation

578
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Can you

579
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So basically in this Dark Matter Halo

580
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Inside

581
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We are actually in a fixed position

582
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Local place will keep turning

583
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So what will you get in the end

584
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You will

585
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If you measure the local

586
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The speed of that halo

587
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I said

588
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Dark Matter

589
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Wait a minute, you just asked

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The speed of the planet

591
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Ok, let me tell you

592
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The speed of the earth itself around the sun

593
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Will dominate this

594
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This measurement

595
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
OK

596
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So actually someone found something very interesting

597
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It should be said that Propose is a very interesting concept

598
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Because we are

599
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Relative to our life

600
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And the time scale we use

601
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We are in Dark Matter Halo

602
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Solar system in Dark Matter Halo

603
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Basically fixed

604
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That point is not moving

605
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Your whole life will not change

606
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A pixel on the earth

607
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But the earth has been around

608
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So the earth is equal to

609
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The solar system is sitting in a

610
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Constant Dark Matter Week

611
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
A Dark Matter

612
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Wind inside

613
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Keep moving in the same direction

614
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Then we have half a year

615
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Half a year is against it

616
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Half a year is against it

617
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
This is called Dark Matter Annual Modulation

618
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It can be a

619
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Probing

620
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Dark Matter as a particle

621
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
A very important phenomenon

622
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
About ten years ago

623
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
They measured

624
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And then all the other people couldn't

625
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Reproduce that experiment

626
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Do you know this

627
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
In addition to the

628
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The scale of the solar system

629
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's a little bit bigger

630
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But smaller than the galaxy

631
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But smaller than the galaxy

632
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
See

633
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There are a lot of stars in the galaxy

634
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Is a lot of

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, I don't know

636
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't know

637
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know

638
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Because usually we

639
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We are

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Anyway, everyone is talking about

641
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What clues are there in Dark Matter

642
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Just use a few scales

643
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Galaxy

644
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's a bunch of galaxies

645
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's called Megastructure

646
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And then there's the whole universe

647
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
There are about four

648
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Will there be a star group in the middle

649
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't know

650
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Maybe someone is doing it

651
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't know

652
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know

653
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The next one

654
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But

655
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh, yeah, I have that doll up there

656
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's it

657
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So

658
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Then we think it's weird

659
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Since we're sitting on the whole earth

660
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Including ourselves

661
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Do you feel like you're being blown by the wind

662
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Or has the ghost been pushing you

663
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The answer is no

664
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So

665
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
A very popular theory

666
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That is

667
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We're all surrounded by

668
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Dark Matter

669
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
OK, just like we're all surrounded by air

670
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But they basically

671
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Won't put their

672
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Momentum to us

673
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It won't interact with us

674
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
OK

675
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This is smaller than air

676
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Because we're actually air

677
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't feel the interaction

678
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But Dark Matter basically has a theory

679
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The first two are the substances we already know

680
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And then they interact with each other

681
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
In the form of throwing the ball

682
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So they can pass on

683
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's what we know

684
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And then

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's all Dark Matter next to it

686
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But Dark Matter has no way to catch the ball

687
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Just stand there and watch

688
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Of course

689
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But he has gravity

690
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, so

691
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So we put one over there

692
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Gravity pole

693
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's the only thing that can interact with us

694
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's pulling us

695
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So we can

696
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Basically this is the only

697
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We can see that

698
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The reason for the Rotational Curve

699
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
OK

700
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Because it has a gravitational interaction with us

701
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Can this be localized?

702
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's say we have a

703
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Dark Matter here

704
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Let's say it's a ball

705
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Would it enhance

706
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The gravitational pull between the substances?

707
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
How does it interact with you?

708
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, yeah, that's what I just said

709
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Microgravity

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
This thing is very interesting

711
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You either measure a very large scale

712
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
why

713
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because you can have a very large group of Dark Matter

714
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You can measure the great pull

715
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Then this approach will become

716
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
There is a

717
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What is it called?

718
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Lensing is Gravitational Lensing

719
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
In fact, we can use what we know

720
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Baryonic Matter

721
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But a lot of people are doing

722
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
There is a galaxy far away

723
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Then it also has a

724
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Dark Matter Halo

725
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And then there's something behind it

726
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So we can see what's behind it

727
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Then we can see

728
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The effect of this galaxy

729
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Can we go to

730
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So this lens

731
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
How heavy is it?

732
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Then we can see how bright this lens is

733
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So we can guess how heavy its Baryonic Matter is

734
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know

735
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't know why I have to talk about Baryonic Matter when I do astronomy

736
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Standard Model of Matter

737
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
How heavy is it?

738
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Then this is a way

739
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
There are a lot of measurements

740
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Measurement and

741
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Does it match?

742
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But it's a total

743
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Because if you measure it like this, it's a total

744
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Because you're looking at a very far

745
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
A very far galaxy

746
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
As a mirror

747
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
A lens is not a mirror

748
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So a lot of people are doing

749
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Is what you said

750
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Can I do it on Earth?

751
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
For example, I'm on the table

752
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I know how heavy this apple is

753
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
How heavy that banana is

754
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
How big is the gravitational pull between them

755
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But if there's Dark Matter in the middle

756
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
How much should it change

757
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The problem with this is that you can control all the experiments

758
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But their signals are small

759
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because things are light

760
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So it's hard to do

761
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But if there's a breakthrough in this part

762
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It will be a completely different

763
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
For Theory

764
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But this is

765
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This is more like what you're talking about

766
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We're measuring the magnitude of the current current

767
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
This we know

768
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Because if Dark Matter

769
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If it's small, it's not

770
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But it's like this

771
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So

772
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The problem here is

773
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
How big is your sensitivity?

774
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
How big is your experiment sensitivity?

775
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because we're measuring the magnitude

776
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It should all be from astronomy

777
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Just look at the big

778
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Gravitational Source

779
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I don't know

780
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't know what they're doing right now

781
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But someone is doing it

782
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
This is actually a very interesting experiment for me

783
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But I think it's been five or ten years

784
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Should all be very

785
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Test performance

786
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
There will be no breakthrough

787
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I have a question

788
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Dark Matter seems to be man-made

789
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh

790
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This is a completely

791
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Different idea

792
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You have to talk about

793
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Just talk about man-made

794
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That's what LHC wants to do

795
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'll talk about it later

796
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah, because if it's man-made

797
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Maybe you can measure the difference

798
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, I know what you mean

799
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Theoretically, right?

800
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's Gravity

801
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
If it's a pile of matter

802
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

803
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But I don't think I can measure it

804
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The reason is the same as just now

805
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Because your weight is small, it's hard to measure

806
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So now the problem is

807
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Of course we know there is

808
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Golden mass

809
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But I'm not sure if it's dark matter

810
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
No one knows what it is

811
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But what you can imagine is

812
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You can modify what you originally used to do

813
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Assuming something

814
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Assuming Newton's law is right

815
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That is, there is less matter

816
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Or Newton's law

817
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Then you have to modify that

818
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Anyway, either case

819
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You have to come up with a theory

820
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What we are doing is to treat it as a particle

821
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes, it's a particle

822
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
To do

823
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Its only interaction is gravity

824
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
OK

825
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
This is what I want to talk about

826
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So it just stands there and doesn't do anything, right?

827
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So our current assumption is

828
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Dark matter doesn't interact

829
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
This sentence is correct

830
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
If you talk to astronomers

831
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In all of our roles

832
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Dark matter will never work with you

833
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What are you doing

834
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
OK

835
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But what is our hope

836
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Our hope is

837
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Next page

838
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Next page

839
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It's a very, very, very

840
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Small chance

841
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's actually going to be with us

842
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This red

843
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Red is straight or neutral, I forgot

844
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Anyway, it interacts with our normal matter

845
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But what are its conditions

846
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Its condition is to be small

847
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That is to say

848
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You want this opportunity to be small

849
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In all previous experiments

850
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It looks like it has no interaction

851
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But you will feel that

852
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's already so small, so why do you have to assume it

853
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
There is actually another reason

854
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Because

855
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We are directly

856
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Attack Dark Matter

857
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Before we measure directly

858
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We have a lot of other theoretical examples

859
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It predicts

860
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
New example

861
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
OK

862
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's not just what we know now

863
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Then these new examples

864
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
With

865
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The whole complete

866
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The larger and more complete theory

867
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Its interaction is very weak

868
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Weak to all other

869
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The experiments we have done before

870
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It looks like it has no interaction

871
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But it is not completely

872
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This is the point

873
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Then it is more important

874
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That value

875
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Is what we should be able to measure

876
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
As long as we design a

877
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Dedicated experiment

878
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So some people think

879
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This is very important

880
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
In fact, we can't measure

881
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's not that it doesn't interact

882
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But we don't have a very sensitive way to measure it

883
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So we always thought it was completely

884
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But in fact

885
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
If we measure it today

886
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We think it should interact with us

887
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
This sensitive detector

888
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
There is still no interaction

889
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Then we can rule out the old theory

890
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Which we did many times

891
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I will talk about it later

892
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So what is the current situation

893
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
The current situation is

894
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The earth is over there

895
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Red is our experiment

896
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
We put it on the earth

897
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then we are in the dark matter

898
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So as the center of the coordinate

899
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Dark matter has been hitting us crazy

900
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Then we hope that many

901
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
One will hit our detector

902
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Then hit the detector

903
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The situation is actually quite serious

904
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Like you hit the ball

905
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I wrote it there

906
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Come in and out

907
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It passes a little bit of kinetic energy to the detector

908
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Then what we want to measure is this little bit of kinetic energy

909
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
it is good

910
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This is what we want to do

911
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
How do we actually do it?

912
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay, let's start to move on

913
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That is to say our project

914
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This is not our project

915
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But I want to talk about it first

916
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The two most popular methods on the earth

917
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Then I want to

918
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Then we have to say in our work

919
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Why do we think this is better

920
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
This is the first method

921
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Called Time Projection Chamber

922
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That red line is dark matter

923
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Dark matter comes in

924
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
After a lot of times

925
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It hit the bucket

926
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Detected matter in the basket

927
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Then like hitting the ball

928
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Then go out

929
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Then it passes the energy to the line like a caterpillar

930
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
What is that line?

931
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Inside the bucket

932
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Is our so-called

933
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Target Matter

934
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What do I usually talk about?

935
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Anyway, it's Target Matter

936
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Then it passes a little energy to this

937
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Material

938
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The atomic box of this element

939
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Then the atomic box

940
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
After some energy

941
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Pass this energy to it

942
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Electrons on the track

943
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The electrons will move forward and then fall

944
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Then the light will come out

945
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The light is the yellow line of the caterpillar

946
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
OK

947
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Then this flash of light

948
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It will spread out

949
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The PMT above and below

950
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
PMT is called Photon Multiplier Tube

951
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Photon Multiplier Tube

952
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Photon Multiplier Tube

953
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Basically it is a very sensitive light sensor

954
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You can measure that light

955
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then I just talked about it

956
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Then it will absorb the energy

957
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Pass it to the electrons and then fall

958
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Then you know that the moonlight

959
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The light released is a fixed color

960
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Is a fixed energy

961
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So you look at the energy of this color

962
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
How strong it means

963
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
How many electrons are released

964
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Then you can push it back

965
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
How much energy did it eat

966
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
OK

967
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
This is the first signal

968
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Then the second signal

969
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Did I just say

970
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It will have an electron moonlight

971
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Then the electron moonlight

972
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
In addition to this kind of falling

973
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
This ratio is separated

974
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
OK

975
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What about these electrons

976
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It is in this up and down vertical direction

977
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Put a very, very strong power plant

978
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I wrote it there

979
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's probably thousands of volts per centimeter

980
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
For one

981
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You look at the picture below

982
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The vertical direction of the barrel is probably tens of thousands of volts

983
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It will use this very strong power plant

984
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Put

985
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The electron is pulled all the way

986
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Just drag it all the way

987
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's a virtual caterpillar on top

988
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
OK, that virtual caterpillar hit the detector

989
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It has a secondary signal

990
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So there is such a method

991
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Can you

992
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Then because it is pulled up

993
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Speed ​​is a fixed speed

994
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's probably a fixed speed

995
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Is the electron in the material

996
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Drifting speed

997
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So you count that

998
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Flash, flash is basically a moment

999
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Just flash and see

1000
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The speed at which you receive the electron

1001
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The time difference in the middle

1002
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Can you reverse the distance

1003
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
OK, do you know what I mean

1004
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
If you have a row of electrons being drifted

1005
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Then every one reaches a different distance

1006
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You reverse the whole thing and you get a track

1007
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Then through this track

1008
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You can vary

1009
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Roughly

1010
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Different

1011
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Hit your example

1012
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So you can tell

1013
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Is it that we already know the particle hit us

1014
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Or its behavior is consistent

1015
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
This is what we should expect

1016
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This is called Time Projection Chamber

1017
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What about its problem

1018
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
OK, let's talk about its advantages

1019
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Its advantage is

1020
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
The material is usually

1021
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Liquified

1022
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What

1023
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That

1024
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Xenon

1025
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Or

1026
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Argon

1027
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Argon, Xenon

1028
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
These are the two types of deflection

1029
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So it's actually a very heavy element

1030
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Then we

1031
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
We know the heavy element

1032
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's a bit like

1033
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
If you hit a heavy thing today

1034
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Hit the air molecules with you

1035
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The air molecules will get more

1036
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Energy or something heavy

1037
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It should be heavy

1038
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So if today Dark Matter hits

1039
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Hit a heavier atomic box

1040
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It can leave more energy

1041
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Then we know that this energy is equal to the square of M

1042
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
The square of the atomic box

1043
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So the signal is very big

1044
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And it's actually easy to scale up

1045
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Why scale up is important

1046
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Because basically there are

1047
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
How many Dark Matters pass through your detector

1048
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
How big is it with your detector

1049
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
How many atomic boxes are there

1050
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So if you have a two-fold detector

1051
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Basically

1052
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The rate of the expected signal should be twice

1053
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
They are easy to put a lot of

1054
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
They are basically a big bucket

1055
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
A super high voltage

1056
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It sounds crazy, but it's actually easy

1057
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Basically

1058
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
To summarize

1059
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This is state-of-the-art optimization

1060
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Of a widely used

1061
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
High-energy physics technology

1062
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Invented in the 70s

1063
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
OK

1064
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
They want to state-of-the-art

1065
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Optimize this very widely used

1066
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What are the benefits

1067
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They can scale up very quickly

1068
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And they know what problems they will encounter

1069
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So currently this approach

1070
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Is the most sensitive

1071
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
In terms of event rate

1072
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
OK

1073
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The second one

1074
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Another one is Solid State Detector

1075
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Why is this thing

1076
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Let me talk about it

1077
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What you see on the picture now

1078
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The part that I enlarged

1079
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That little metal box

1080
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Inside that metal box is next to this

1081
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Carton

1082
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
That blue thing

1083
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Is a solid state

1084
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Its principle is actually the same as the one

1085
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The state of the art

1086
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You run in and hit it

1087
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Then give it energy

1088
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Energy makes it flash

1089
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
OK, and then the flash

1090
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Light

1091
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Can be blown out

1092
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And then the top and bottom of this picture

1093
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
That label

1094
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Called TES

1095
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
TES is

1096
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
We know the most sensitive on Earth

1097
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
What is it

1098
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's called Transition Edge Sensor

1099
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll talk about it later

1100
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
OK

1101
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's very, very sensitive

1102
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And then

1103
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
In addition to this signal

1104
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You can also get another signal

1105
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's a deposit

1106
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Basically it's heat

1107
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's heat in the crystal

1108
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Because energy is heat

1109
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
If you think about it

1110
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Then the heat will flow out

1111
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The whole box is hollow

1112
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Nothing

1113
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So heat can't get out

1114
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Heat stays inside

1115
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
OK

1116
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The only track that can be sent out

1117
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's the top and bottom

1118
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It has two caterpillar wires

1119
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It will send heat bath

1120
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So you can eat all these heat

1121
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Then measure the heat

1122
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Then you

1123
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What is it called

1124
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You can identify

1125
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What hit us

1126
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Is it a particle we know

1127
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Or a particle we don't know

1128
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
OK

1129
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
What is the advantage

1130
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This kind of Solid State Detector

1131
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Can be operated under cryogenic temperature

1132
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
For exquisite energy resolution

1133
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
With ultra-low noise

1134
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But

1135
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
What does it mean

1136
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's super expensive

1137
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
OK

1138
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It can have a lot of special phenomena

1139
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Our collaborators

1140
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
In Berkeley

1141
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
In different laboratories

1142
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
This kind of thing

1143
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It can play a lot of magic

1144
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Recoil threshold depends on material property

1145
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You can invent

1146
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Very exotic material

1147
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Then let them eat

1148
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
This

1149
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
After hitting the ball

1150
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
How to send it to you

1151
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Then you measure

1152
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
OK

1153
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I know that Chicago University is now leading

1154
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
They are doing CCD

1155
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
To put it bluntly

1156
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The CCD chip in your camera

1157
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Take it to Dark Matter

1158
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
After hitting

1159
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Then walk a small line

1160
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Different particles walk that line

1161
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The behavior will be different

1162
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So you can be very, very

1163
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Accurate judgment

1164
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
How much energy is flowing now

1165
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What kind of particle is it

1166
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Then come again

1167
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Because we do superconductor

1168
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It is also a very sensitive material

1169
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And graphene

1170
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
What is graphene?

1171
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
What is special about graphene?

1172
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Its conductivity

1173
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
is

1174
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Not all the same

1175
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's the same in every direction

1176
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Like your guide

1177
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's basically like this

1178
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's like this

1179
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's on the same plane

1180
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There are six directions

1181
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's not zero

1182
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Then in the other six directions

1183
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's not zero

1184
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Or it's the six-fold symmetry

1185
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's very interesting

1186
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
When your particles come in

1187
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
If it runs in the direction of the conductor

1188
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It can

1189
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
No matter how small the energy

1190
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It can pull

1191
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I should just talk about bandgap

1192
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Leave a place for bandgap

1193
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's even weirder

1194
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's superfluid

1195
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's superfluid

1196
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's also very sensitive

1197
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And it's even weirder

1198
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Fermi arc

1199
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This is what we did in Caltech

1200
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's basically in a certain direction

1201
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Its bandgap is also zero

1202
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You can imagine

1203
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
These things

1204
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
They are all superfluid

1205
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But what's the problem

1206
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The problem is that they look like

1207
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's the subject of research

1208
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Instead of using it to study other people

1209
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's very, very expensive

1210
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But why is this interesting

1211
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'll tell you later

1212
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Its dilemma

1213
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's harder to scale up

1214
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Without meeting new challenges

1215
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
While maintaining your budget and sensitivity

1216
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You know

1217
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The biggest experimental background is sensitivity

1218
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
No, it's your budget

1219
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Can you understand

1220
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
OK

1221
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So after talking about

1222
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Time projection chamber

1223
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And solid state detector

1224
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This is a monoplot

1225
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's the whole field

1226
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The current state

1227
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Horizontal

1228
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's your assumption

1229
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The quality of dark matter

1230
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Why do I say assumption

1231
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Because no one measured

1232
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
If you measure it, you know where it can be drawn

1233
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You assume

1234
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
How heavy is the dark matter you can't measure

1235
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
OK

1236
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Then you have to know

1237
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
How heavy is the dark matter particle

1238
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Then you know

1239
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The dark matter halo

1240
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
How heavy is the total dark matter

1241
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So you know

1242
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
How many

1243
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Particle in terms of number

1244
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The flux has been flowing through you

1245
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Then you can't measure

1246
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Then you can know

1247
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
The chance of interaction with me

1248
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Can't be greater than how much

1249
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Otherwise I should measure

1250
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So the axis is the chance of interaction

1251
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Is the upper limit of that opportunity

1252
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
This is

1253
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The interaction between dark matter and detector

1254
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
The chance must be less than that line

1255
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
If it's higher than that line

1256
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We should measure

1257
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
This is the logic of the picture

1258
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So it actually has two directions

1259
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
One way is that you

1260
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The bigger the detector

1261
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Like that time projection chamber

1262
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
In theory, you can expect more events

1263
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
If it can be measured

1264
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So if you can't measure it, you can keep the line down

1265
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It means that the higher the sensitivity

1266
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You still can't measure

1267
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Then the other one is that you can measure

1268
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The smaller the energy

1269
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Then can you know that

1270
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Because very light particles hit you

1271
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The energy left is very small

1272
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Then can you go to the left of this picture

1273
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
To draw that line

1274
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Because you know you can measure this kind of energy

1275
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But you didn't measure

1276
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Then you can put it there

1277
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This part

1278
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Is the solid state

1279
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
This is the main direction of this field

1280
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Everyone wants to push down

1281
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
To make the detector bigger

1282
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But if you want to push to the left

1283
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You need a better detector

1284
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Then you will ask

1285
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What if to the right

1286
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
To the right is like this

1287
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Why do we want to do a dedicated experiment

1288
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
To measure dark matter

1289
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Because we have a very very

1290
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Very powerful machine

1291
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
We have been using it

1292
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
When they built it

1293
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Their reason besides looking for

1294
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The exposure

1295
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They actually want to find

1296
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I think it's fair to say

1297
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The super symmetry theory

1298
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Then the example of the super symmetry theory

1299
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It used to be the best for dark matter

1300
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The most anticipated thing

1301
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Their goal

1302
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Basically around TEV

1303
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Or sub-TEV

1304
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So that's where I put the soil

1305
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Then you will ask

1306
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Do we want to measure them now

1307
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
The answer is that LHC has not been able to measure

1308
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And it has exceeded

1309
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The earliest version

1310
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Super symmetry theory

1311
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
In other words, we have basically ruled out

1312
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The original super symmetry theory

1313
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So now there are a lot of super symmetry theories

1314
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
They are looking at the original super symmetry theory

1315
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
According to our continuous measurement

1316
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They think it is a

1317
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Super symmetry theory should have

1318
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
What new phenomenon

1319
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Looking at this thing

1320
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So basically you keep going

1321
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Is more sensitive

1322
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
To measure the super symmetry theory

1323
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Is there anything wrong?

1324
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But it can't be measured

1325
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It's already weird

1326
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
If you are interested

1327
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You can ask me

1328
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So now Susie's

1329
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The expectations are probably all on the map

1330
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Everyone is surprised

1331
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Because almost all of them are in the places we have ruled out

1332
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So now a lot of new theories

1333
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Come out

1334
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If it's not a super symmetry theory

1335
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's another one we've never thought of

1336
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The dark side

1337
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Just like you know

1338
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's the dark world

1339
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
We can't see it

1340
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's very weak

1341
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Interact with the world we see

1342
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But it's a completely

1343
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Standalone dark world

1344
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It can have very light particles

1345
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Then we have to have

1346
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Very new technology

1347
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Go to the left of this picture

1348
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So this is our goal

1349
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Then you can see the top

1350
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Inside the SSD frame

The four lines on the far left

1352
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That's basically what we experimented

1353
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Four different operations

1354
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
This is the most leading

1355
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Then we are going to propose the next technology

1356
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Push us down again

1357
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Push it to the left

1358
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Sorry

1359
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So this should be

1360
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
OK, this is the last page

1361
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So the first part

1362
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Do you have any questions?

1363
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Oh, this is

1364
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Ok, this is

1365
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Our most popular theory now

1366
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's called

1367
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Let's talk about popular

1368
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Anyway, it's everyone

1369
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The theory that most people are experimenting

1370
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
