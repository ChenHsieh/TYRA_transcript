Hello everyone, I am Zhang Yanyong, the host today.
We are very happy to invite Xie Dayang, Diane Xie, to talk to us about her field of research and her current research topic.
Diane's main field of research is psychology and education psychology.
She is currently a second-year PhD student at UC Irvine.
In the field of education psychology, Diane is particularly interested in how family, culture, and so on outside of school affect young people's motivation and results in school.
Her topic today is Educational Inequality from a Psychology Perspective, Gender Gap in STEM as a Brief Example.
Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about gender in the Hollywood industry.
Everyone has different views on gender recognition.
We are very happy to invite Diane to talk to us about this topic.
Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that if you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone, otherwise you won't be able to hear me.
Okay, you can start.
This is very interesting.
Thank you, Diane, for your introduction.
It seems like I am very good at introducing myself, but I am actually not that good.
I am very honored to share my research with everyone today.
I don't know if I can see six people today.
I will ask questions later.
From the introduction of everyone, it seems that almost everyone is a science major.
So I chose a topic that is more related to science in education psychology.
It is about the inequality of education in STEM, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
As Diane said, this is one of the questions that I can answer in my research direction.
I am currently in the second year of UCI Education College.
Although I am in the Education College, the main research methods that I use and the methods that our professors and lab use are mainly from development psychology.
In general, I study social culture, interpersonal relationships, activity experience, and other things that are greater than the individual.
We call them social cultural factors.
How to affect the psychological development of the individual, which is the second link,
individual psychological development, and then affect the behavior and cognition of the individual, etc.
So this is a big direction.
It sounds very mysterious and very broad.
This is partly because my research has just started and I can't speak very professionally.
Also because my research has just started, so I will be very nervous today.
If you find that I speak faster and faster or start to be biased,
you are welcome to interrupt me at any time to ask questions or tell me to speak slower or I don't make sense.
I won't be angry.
I really hope everyone will help me.
Okay, so let's get into today's topic.
To start today's topic, I actually want to start with a question.
So if you can turn on the microphone, that would be great.
I just want to ask a very philosophical question.
Why are you here?
Specifically, why did you join Tyra?
Why did you choose a Saturday afternoon 3 o'clock and listen to some academic sharing here?
Why did you choose to get a Ph.D.?
Why did you choose to enter the academic circle with so many potential opportunities?
Does anyone want to share why?
Does anyone want to speak first?
Count to 10.
If no one wants to speak first, I will demonstrate.
Okay, 1, 2, 3, 10.
I will demonstrate first.
Why did I join Tyra?
I think this question is more like why I decided to join Tyra.
I think this has to do with why I chose to get a Ph.D. and why I chose to stay in the academic circle.
I think there's a very important reason.
It's because I think...
I thought about the reasons behind it.
Why is it like this?
I thought about it and found new things.
Then I threw it back to solve the problem I was facing.
If I succeeded, I felt very accomplished.
So I hope I can continue to use this to do what I want to do in my life.
So I will stay in the academic circle.
Of course, the condition of staying in the academic circle is to get a Ph.D.
Also, Tyra, to a certain extent, started from this motivation.
How should I put it?
If I can communicate with others and have more ideas,
then I can think about the problems I'm facing and solve them.
Then I can get this kind of feeling.
Something like that.
Anyone else wants to speak?
Don't just let me speak.
Don't be shy.
Can I speak?
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm Chi Chi.
Can you hear me clearly?
Why did I join Tyra?
Because I'm quite interested in interdisciplinary learning.
In the past, most of the people I met were interdisciplinary learners.
So I thought it was interesting.
But I wasn't very active.
I only participated in a few programs.
Actually, today is the second program.
Because I didn't quite understand the topic.
So it was a bit difficult.
But now I'm trying to develop.
I think my purpose is simple.
I hope I can be a public intellectual.
So what I write and talk can be heard by people from different fields.
Because my learning background in the past has made me narrow.
Because the people I talk to are all from the same field.
So I don't think I have the opportunity to talk to people from different fields.
So I participated in this activity.
On the one hand, I'm curious about things in different fields.
On the other hand, I hope to communicate with different people.
I can think about how to make people from different fields understand what I'm studying.
Thank you very much.
Does anyone else want to share?
I'll talk about it.
Hello everyone, my name is Qiyun.
I wanted to join Taira because I thought the plan was a bit cool.
I can use the Internet and hear that everyone is Taiwanese.
And research in different fields.
Why do I want to get a PhD?
Mainly because I'm interested in my major.
I do math.
And I want to keep doing research.
So I have to get a PhD.
That's about it.
Thank you very much.
Anyone else wants to share?
Okay, I'll assume this is a no.
I started with this question because I've always been interested in this topic.
I just wanted to hear everyone talk about it.
The second is to bring everyone into the topic I'm going to talk about today.
Education.
Education.
From what I just heard, we give it a lot of value.
Like someone said, I hope what I do today will be more valuable in the future.
Or I hope what I do today will be more valuable in the future.
So I see it mainly as knowledge and strength.
We can see that we believe that education is a positive thing.
Just like what I just shared, it's almost all positive.
But if my question is why I want to get a PhD.
You can also say that I lost something in the past few years.
But no one said that.
This gives a very positive value.
This is a very common idea that people don't even question.
Education can give us a better future.
So we want to learn.
Everyone has already gotten a PhD.
I don't need to say that everyone is the best example.
So if we want to look at the value we give to education.
If we look at the level of education alone and the so-called successful indicators.
For example, income.
We can see a very beautiful straight line.
If we look at education and unemployment rate.
We see a beautiful inverse relationship.
It seems that education can really bring social mobility.
The so-called opportunity to climb up.
Just like this picture next to it.
This is a very strong idea.
Just like I just said.
We give education a very just value.
So it's not hard to see that we put a lot of resources into education.
For example, this year the United States allocated nearly $700 million to the Department of Education.
If we look at the state level.
Take California as an example.
The cost of education is actually greater than human resource health.
It is also far greater than the cost of judicial administration or natural resource protection.
So this is just a quick introduction to the topic I want to talk about today.
Everything sounds very reasonable at the moment.
Because education is a channel for everyone to climb up.
So society should ensure that everyone gets equal education opportunities.
That's why we can see the role of the state government is to invest money in education.
This is also a very tempting idea.
Since education is a chance to turn around.
We can say that we give education to the disadvantaged.
They should climb up.
Education has become a tool to reduce inequality in society.
I will talk about the topic of inequality today.
Although this idea is very tempting.
But the problem is that if education itself is inequality.
Then it may amplify inequality in society.
Instead of reducing inequality.
Of course, we don't want to see the reduction of inequality.
So the question for scholars is to ask.
Is education itself inequality?
This is a big question.
The short answer is yes.
Education is inequality.
But inequality is very complicated.
There are many reasons behind it.
The second reason is that they are related to each other.
Let me give you an example.
In the United States, the most discussed inequality in education is racial inequality.
Specifically, it is the inequality between black and white people.
If we look at this picture.
The blue line is the performance of white children in mathematics.
This is the performance of the ninth grade.
We can see that the blue line is far higher than the black line.
The orange line is the performance of Latin children.
The green line.
This is just one example.
The same achievement gap can be seen at different ages.
It can be seen in different subjects.
I put a link below.
This is just one of the research units tracking these data.
To see how much racial inequality is now.
To see if there is any improvement.
From this picture, we can see that the X axis is the time.
After so many years, there is still no improvement.
The gap is still very large.
Many people will start to think about the reason for this gap.
Of course, some people will wonder if it is because the resources of black children's schools are poor.
It sounds like the racial discrimination of schools is outdated.
It should not be abolished after the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s.
Why do we still see such a big gap?
One of the reasons is that the reason just now is very good.
But if we look at the data, we will find that there is still isolation.
The fact is that most white children still go to schools for white children.
Most black children still go to schools for black children.
The schools that the latter go to are usually those schools that are less well-off.
One of the people just said that schools are different now.
We found that the problem of schools still exists.
Why does this problem still exist after so many years?
There are many reasons that are related to each other.
For example, why is there a difference in schools?
One of the reasons is that there is a difference in income.
On average, the income of black families is lower than that of white families.
So the places they can live in are different.
The places they live in are different, so the school district they go to is different.
So if we put the income gap and the achievement gap together,
we will find that this is happening at the same time, and it is probably related to each other.
So now things are getting more and more complicated.
We just said that it may be because the schools are different.
OK, now we find that their economic level is also different.
Then give another example.
In addition to these two, we can also look at the family.
If we add the family in, we will find that the parents' education level
also has a gap between black and white people.
This gap and the achievement gap just now are also affecting each other.
So now things are getting more and more complicated.
It's not just the school itself.
There is also a problem with the inequality of income in the whole society.
Now we say that the parents' education level is also problematic.
Sometimes I think it's a bit of a ghost gun.
It's a vicious cycle.
For example, if there is a so-called gap in the family,
you can imagine that the parents with a lower level of education
will naturally have fewer books at home.
Or they don't have those connections to participate in better extracurricular activities.
Then it leads to their next generation's poor income.
Then, as I said at the beginning, it's not about income, it's about education.
Then education is related to income.
Then it's like this, it's a vicious cycle.
So I want to stop here.
Because I find that I speak faster and faster.
It's probably because I'm getting more and more nervous.
And here...
I actually just have a question.
Please say it.
My question is like this.
For example, the income gap or the education gap.
I may not have heard what you just said.
What is its definition?
At least in this picture, what is the meaning of the gap?
Because I don't quite understand why there are so many dots.
Is there no face?
The dot is a week.
Every dot is a week.
Oh, the dot is a week.
It's too exaggerated to put it on.
So this should answer your question.
As I said, the education gap is...
Back to what I said at the beginning.
Education is a tool that can help people climb up.
But this gap means that some people climb higher, some people climb lower.
And if we're talking about the racial achievement gap,
white people climb higher, black people climb lower.
And if it's the income gap,
some people climb higher, some people climb lower.
So...
Can I ask a question?
This is the first time I've seen this graph.
What does it mean?
The dots and the axis.
What does that mean?
Right.
That axis, that gap.
For example, this graph is actually a combination of many graphs.
The x-axis is talking about the income gap.
Each dot is a week.
So if the income of white people in this week is twice as high as that of black people,
then the x-axis is a 2.
If it's higher...
It starts from 0.
So 0 and above mean that white people are higher than black people.
And the achievement gap means that
the learning performance of white people is higher than that of black people.
So there's a gap like this.
This graph means that
these two gaps are related to each other.
And it's a positive relationship.
For example, if your income gap is high in the same week,
then your learning performance gap will also be high.
Does that make sense?
Or is it getting more and more confusing?
Can I ask a question?
So the circle means that each week is different.
And the diagonal line is the standard line.
The middle line.
And the x-axis is the income gap.
What is the y-axis?
The y-axis is talking about
the gap between white people and black people.
So you can see that the y-axis is all 0 and above.
It means that every week,
the average income of white people is higher than that of black people.
And how much is higher
is proportional to the gap between white people and black people.
And the middle line is a standard line.
It seems like someone wants to ask a question.
Go ahead.
No, I just want to...
Because I've seen this graph.
But what I see is that
all the cities in the U.S.
and then make a comparison.
It's also racial inequity.
And then look at the gap between them.
The gap between cities and schools is the biggest.
So the bigger the circle,
it means that the city...
But in your graph, it's a state.
That state means that
the bigger the gap between the poor and the rich,
the bigger the circle.
And the smaller the circle means that
there's not much difference.
But that's what I see in the graph.
But you just said that
there's a lot of integration.
So I don't know if it's because
American education, at least before K-12,
was defined by property tax.
So because of this,
under the foundation of funding,
there will be the difference you just mentioned.
The better the school district,
if my parents can afford it,
the better the school district.
Of course, the more resources I have here,
the more money I have,
I can attract better teachers.
But if I'm poor in this area,
I can't...
Because this is a different education system from Taiwan.
It's the funding part.
So there will be a gap like this.
Thank you for the supplement.
And then I just said...
So this graph...
Like you said,
if you want to look for it,
it's related to education
and the achievement gap.
You can find any Y-axis
or X-axis you want.
But I made this introduction
mainly to introduce
the concept of
inequality in education.
And then I want to say
that there are many reasons
behind inequality in education.
And those reasons are
the reasons that affect and interfere with each other.
So to understand inequality in education,
you have to think about many aspects.
And this is the conclusion I will come back to.
And then...
Like the example I just gave,
if we only say that inequality in education
is because of the difference in school resources,
then we can say that
we will intervene.
We take black children
and take white children to school.
This thing has indeed been done.
But we will find that this is not enough.
Because you solve the difference in school hardware.
But like we just said,
there is still an income gap.
So you have to solve
why the income gap
in this society is so big.
Of course, this is not enough.
Because we still haven't solved
the problem of parents' education level.
Do we have to give parents
some employment guidance, etc.?
This is just...
to point out that
education should be a tool
to reduce inequality in society.
If we can think of it this way,
I think it's a very tempting idea.
But if we don't carefully measure
the social factors behind it,
such as race, class, etc.,
we may accidentally
cause more inequality.
So...
I want to bring this into today's topic.
My topic is
gender inequality in education.
What kind of inequality
does gender social factors
have in education?
So...
I forgot to show this page.
I put it here.
If you are interested in
finding out the picture
and reading it,
you can pause the video
and go to the link above.
But now...
I'm going to change it to
talk about the inequality of my topic today,
which is inequality in gender and education.
If we look at the 1960s,
there was a time when
girls couldn't even go to college.
Of course, we're a long way from that time.
A lot of things have happened in history,
such as the rise of feminism, etc.
We can see that the college degrees
and higher education degrees
that girls received
have been increasing.
It's getting higher and higher.
Very good.
If we look at the picture from 2016,
we can see that
the degrees that girls received
are even higher than that of boys
in colleges and universities.
So if we only look at
the effect of education,
we can say that
gender inequality
has been reduced to a very small extent
compared to before.
But today I still want to talk about this topic
because gender still has
an inequality in education.
If we don't look at the education level,
but look at what boys and girls are learning.
So I'm going to summarize this data
and compare different subjects,
and I chose the university level,
the university degrees given by different subjects
in 2015,
and draw the proportion of girls in those degrees.
So if we look at psychology,
we can see that
77% of psychology graduates
are girls.
So if we look at social science,
in the middle,
we can see that
half of the graduates are boys,
and half of the graduates are girls.
This picture is very interesting.
You can look at any subject you are interested in.
But one of the phenomena
is that if we look at the extreme level,
we can see that
there are very few girls
in the red area.
You will find that
they are all related to math,
including math itself,
physical science, engineering, and CS.
Especially if you look at engineering and CS,
there are only less than 20% of girls,
less than 20%.
Compared to the rest of the subjects,
it is very different.
The phenomenon I saw today
is that in math,
the number of boys is greater than the number of girls.
I call it gender inequality in STEM.
This phenomenon
has been studied by a lot of people.
It is also a phenomenon that everyone cares about.
Because there are a lot of people
who are interested in this phenomenon.
For example,
there are a lot of people
who are interested in STEM.
First of all,
STEM has been very popular in the past few years.
Many countries want to push STEM.
So you can imagine
if you don't let girls in,
do you lose a lot of your potential?
So now a lot of forces
want to push girls into STEM.
So this phenomenon
has been studied by a lot of people.
I will briefly summarize
some of the phenomena
that have been studied in STEM.
For example,
I divided this argument
into Nature and Nurture.
Of course,
most people will choose
the point they want to stand
between the two.
But if it is the Nurture side,
they will argue that
boys and girls are not equal
in the field of math.
This is a socialized phenomenon.
For example,
we have a stereotype
that boys study science
and girls study liberal arts.
This leads us to treat
boys and girls differently.
So it is a socialization process.
We socialize based on gender.
This is what we see today.
Other socialization processes,
for example,
when a child is just born,
he is a boy,
so we buy him a Lego.
If he is a girl,
we buy her a Lego.
We socialize based on gender.
This is what we see today.
Other socialization processes,
for example,
when a child is just born,
he is a boy,
so we buy him a Lego.
If he is a girl,
we buy her a Lego.
This is what we see today.
Other socialization processes,
for example,
when a child is just born,
he is a boy,
so we buy him a Lego.
If he is a girl,
we buy her a Lego.
This is what we see today.

for example,

he is a boy,
so we buy him a Lego.
This is what we see today.

he is a boy,
so we buy him a Lego.
This is what we see today.
Other socialization processes,
for example,
when a child is just born,
he is a boy.
This is what we see today.
If you look at the above topics,
family studies,
psychology, education,
you can study the gender inequality
in those areas.
However,
that is another group of people,
or another topic,
because you have to study
what is happening
in those areas.
However,
if there is no gender inequality,
then all the people
in the picture are in the 50s.
Obviously not.
This is what I want to talk about
today.
The following topics
are related to math.
So you mean
gender inequality
and inequality
of men
are two different things?
If you are simply saying
that the conclusion is
different in numbers,
of course it is the same.
However,
there are many reasons
behind the inequality.
For example,
in science,
science is a subject
that men study.
It is about science,
not psychology.
So if I use science
to explain psychology,
that is not right.
If I use psychology
to explain
gender inequality,
that is not right.
Does that make sense?
Does that make sense?
Okay.
Okay.
Maybe you are right.
Now I want to talk about
nature.
What I just said is
that the phenomenon
we see
is not caused by
individuals.
It is caused by
external social factors.
Nature is saying
that the phenomenon
we see
is caused by
gender inequality.
Whether it is
the degree of math,
or the attitude towards math,
it is different.
So we see
that
if everything
is socialized,
after so many years,
after so many years,
why is there still a gap?
It means that there is
an external force
to explain
this phenomenon.
And if
there is only
socialization,
then in a
gender-equal
society,
we should see this reduction,
but we don't.
They also
say that
there is a difference
between
women and men.
Women prefer
human-to-human interaction.
They also prefer
human-to-human interaction.
So maybe it is not
because of math,
but because women are
drawn to other areas,
such as medicine,
or architecture.
So if we
look at the numbers
and say that
we don't have 50%,
then it is incorrect.
Because we shouldn't have
set 50% at the beginning,
if women didn't want to
go into math.
It means that
although
there is no difference
in IQ
between men and women,
on average,
people don't say that
men are smarter than women.
However,
if you look at math,
men are better at
problem solving and mental rotation
than women,
and women are better at calculation.
So if you look at
higher education,
it is not about
basic calculation.
It is more about
problem solving
and mental rotation.
At that time,
you will see
the gender difference.
At the end,
both sides
will argue.
For example,
the last point,
even if there is
a gender difference at the beginning,
it is not over time.
For example,
when we take the exam,
we focus on the so-called
math that men are good at.
For example,
when you interview people,
you are looking at a specific
math talent.
So even if there is
a gender difference,
it is not over time.
That's it.
I briefly covered
some points
about gender inequality
in math.
I also posted a video
about two psychologists
who were invited
to give a speech
for Nature.
Although it was not
a public speech,
they gave a very
detailed and logical
speech.
You can watch it
if you are interested.
This list
can go on and on.
There are many
possible explanations.
At the beginning,
I said that
my research direction
is to see how social factors
affect personal development
and behavior.
As I said,
social factors affect
individuals,
I am more
on the side of Nature.
Next,
I will talk about
two projects I have done.
I will talk about
how they
discuss
how women
are more likely to
have more boys.
As I said,
social factors affect
individual psychological development
and behavior.
In the middle,
we need to identify
what we are interested in
in psychological development.
I chose to study motivation.
This is a psychological factor.
I am interested in
how social factors
affect psychological factors.
How does it affect
individual behavior?
The concept of
learning motivation
is abstract.
Many different scholars
have discussed it.
They use different theories
to define it.
Of course,
I can try different theories
and start from different theories.
The first project
I want to introduce
is a simple theory.
It is called
Fixed Growth Mindset.
The person who proposed this theory
wrote a book a few years ago.
It is very popular.
This theory has been studied a lot.
His theory
is very simple.
He divided learning motivation
into two categories.
The first one is
Fixed Mindset.
It means
whether you are good
in a certain subject.
Some people
don't have a good math brain.
This is Fixed Mindset.
Or
I am good at math.
Something like this.
The second category
is Growth Mindset.
It means
whether you are good
in a certain subject.
It depends on the person.
If I am lazy today,
no matter how smart I am,
after a while,
even if I am smart,
if I am lazy,
I might
turn from a math person
to a non-math person.
Even if I am not good at math,
if I work hard,
I might become a math person one day.
It is a very simple concept.
He proposed this
because he thinks
if we want to talk about
the outcome of math,
Growth Mindset
is healthier than Fixed Mindset.
Because
people always encounter setbacks.
If you are a Fixed Mindset person,
you can
put a label on yourself.
For example,
if I have a Fixed Mindset,
I am not a math person.
So,
it is less likely
to continue studying math.
On the other hand,
if you are a Growth Mindset person,
and you encounter setbacks,
your
learning motive will tell you
that it doesn't matter
because you still have room for improvement.
He proposed this
theory,
and there are many
researches that show
that Growth Mindset
is healthier
than Fixed Mindset.
It is also
better for future development.
If we add in gender,
I can ask
if the reason why
we see fewer girls
entering science classes
is because
of the setbacks
we encountered
before higher education.
If there are more
Growth Mindset students,
they can continue
entering higher education.
So,
we can see that
there are more boys
than girls.
So,
if we want to
improve our learning
motives,
we need to
think about
how to
improve our learning
motives.
So,
we need to
think about
how to
improve our learning
motives.
So,
we need to

So,
we need to
think about
