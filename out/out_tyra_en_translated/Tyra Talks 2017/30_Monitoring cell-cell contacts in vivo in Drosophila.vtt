00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Okay, no problem.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.680
Hello everyone, I'm Dinghao.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.480
I'm a postdoc at Caltech.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.920
The topic I'm going to talk about

00:11.920 --> 00:15.360
is mainly my research on some of my papers.

00:15.360 --> 00:19.440
My research is about

00:19.440 --> 00:23.320
designing an artificial system

00:23.320 --> 00:28.320
and hoping to use that system to detect cell-cell contacts.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.520
My ultimate goal is to use this system

00:32.520 --> 00:36.360
to dissect the entire neural circuit.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.800
Oh, in the field of neuroscience,

00:42.800 --> 00:47.520
the most important answer that everyone wants to know

00:47.520 --> 00:50.560
is how our brain functions,

00:50.560 --> 00:55.040
so that we have all kinds of different emotions

00:55.040 --> 01:00.040
and how reactions to the environment stimulate.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.440
How to stimulate.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.560
But about 100 years ago,

01:10.200 --> 01:15.200
Raymond Kahar had a very elegant study.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.680
And the elegant study proved that

01:21.680 --> 01:26.680
our brain or neural system

01:28.040 --> 01:33.040
is mainly operated by these neurons or other cells

01:34.160 --> 01:38.840
to transmit all kinds of neural messages

01:38.840 --> 01:40.880
and ultimately have a behavior.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.920
This is a very famous neural doctrine.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.520
So a lot of research now

01:51.320 --> 01:56.320
is focused on how different neurons

01:58.280 --> 02:01.760
communicate with each other.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.840
This is a very complicated problem

02:03.840 --> 02:08.800
because our brain is a huge machine.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.680
Like what I'm showing in this picture,

02:10.680 --> 02:12.040
it's a reward circuit.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.840
This actually includes a lot of brain areas,

02:15.840 --> 02:18.600
like the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex,

02:18.600 --> 02:22.480
and the famous basal ganglia,

02:22.480 --> 02:25.880
nucleus, convent, VTA.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.120
These different brain areas connect with each other

02:29.120 --> 02:33.040
and operate and calculate

02:33.040 --> 02:36.160
to achieve a goal.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.800
And another more complicated aspect

02:39.800 --> 02:42.280
is that even in the same brain area,

02:42.280 --> 02:44.120
there are different neurons

02:44.120 --> 02:46.320
that receive different messages.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.960
And after synchronization,

02:48.960 --> 02:50.200
it's transmitted to another brain area.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.160
And the calculation of the other brain area

02:52.160 --> 02:53.760
may be transmitted back.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.920
So these connections are what we...

02:58.920 --> 03:01.880
What we want to answer right now

03:01.880 --> 03:05.200
is the idea of connectome.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.440
We hope that by understanding these connectome,

03:08.440 --> 03:11.880
we can have a blueprint

03:11.880 --> 03:15.240
of how our brain or neural system

03:15.240 --> 03:18.440
is wired.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.560
And then we can use this basic knowledge

03:21.560 --> 03:23.600
to calculate

03:23.600 --> 03:28.160
the changes in the message transmission

03:28.160 --> 03:31.080
of the neural cells

03:31.080 --> 03:33.120
that may lead to different behaviors.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.120
Like this.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.480
But in fact,

03:37.480 --> 03:39.680
in addition to neural cells,

03:39.680 --> 03:42.160
there are many other different cells,

03:42.160 --> 03:43.800
such as glial cells.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.560
Many studies have found that

03:47.560 --> 03:48.720
these glial cells

03:48.720 --> 03:53.080
actually affect the function of our neural neurons.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.600
For example,

03:56.600 --> 03:58.000
like this astrocyte,

03:59.320 --> 04:01.600
the heart-shaped neural cell,

04:01.600 --> 04:02.440
is...

04:03.600 --> 04:06.920
It has been found that it can actually

04:06.920 --> 04:10.480
clean up some of our neurotransmitters

04:11.600 --> 04:14.480
and make it turn over faster.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.040
And it's also found that...

04:18.080 --> 04:18.960
Sorry.

04:18.960 --> 04:23.040
It's found that it can actually transmit some signal

04:23.040 --> 04:28.040
and affect the whole synaptic property.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.560
So the connectome or microcircuit

04:33.560 --> 04:36.120
that we originally thought of

04:36.120 --> 04:37.440
is like this.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.640
In addition to neural cells,

04:38.640 --> 04:40.320
we still need to consider

04:40.320 --> 04:42.960
the function of these neural glial cells

04:42.960 --> 04:45.480
to have a more complete picture

04:45.480 --> 04:48.240
of how our brain functions.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.480
And then I mentioned earlier

04:51.480 --> 04:54.720
that understanding these microcircuits

04:54.720 --> 04:58.480
can help us know how our brain works.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.480
Another point is that

05:00.480 --> 05:01.320
many...

05:01.320 --> 05:04.320
We already know that there are many neurological disorders.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.600
It actually has something to do with

05:07.600 --> 05:12.600
the wiring of the neural circuit.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.920
Like schizophrenia,

05:15.920 --> 05:16.760
phrenia,

05:16.760 --> 05:21.440
or some psychological diseases.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.760
It actually has something to do with it.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.200
If we know how the normal brain works,

05:26.200 --> 05:29.760
we can further study

05:29.760 --> 05:32.400
the causes of these disorders.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.520
I hope to get some answers

05:36.520 --> 05:38.400
to help these patients.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.640
So far,

05:42.680 --> 05:46.200
there are many different tools

05:46.200 --> 05:47.840
that have been developed

05:47.840 --> 05:50.240
to help us understand

05:50.240 --> 05:51.520
how to dissect,

05:51.520 --> 05:55.360
that is, to analyze the entire brain circuit

05:55.360 --> 05:57.760
or neural connection.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.600
Here are some examples that are commonly used.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.800
For example, Serial Electron Microscopy,

06:04.800 --> 06:06.720
which is an electronic microscope.

06:09.360 --> 06:15.200
There is another one called GRASP.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.640
Its full name is

06:16.640 --> 06:21.600
GFP Green Fluorescent Protein Reconstitution

06:21.600 --> 06:24.160
Across Synaptic Partner.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.680
This means that it has a fluorescent protein

06:26.680 --> 06:29.640
that divides engineering into two parts.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.200
I will explain this later.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.280
There is also Tango.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.760
There is another popular tool

06:40.760 --> 06:42.840
called Rabie Virus

06:42.840 --> 06:45.520
to trace neural connection.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.040
These are all great tools,

06:51.040 --> 06:54.320
but they all have different

06:55.320 --> 06:56.560
shortcomings.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.920
For example, Serial EM

06:58.920 --> 07:02.240
is to take a small sample

07:02.240 --> 07:05.760
and cut it into pieces.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.880
Then use EM to take the whole image

07:09.880 --> 07:13.880
and then reconstruct it.

07:13.880 --> 07:18.240
Then look at its very fine-detailed

07:20.120 --> 07:21.240
neural morphology

07:21.480 --> 07:25.120
or the connection of different neural cells.

07:25.120 --> 07:30.160
Usually, a small one-millimeter-cube

07:32.040 --> 07:34.880
size sample

07:34.880 --> 07:38.920
takes about five or six years

07:38.920 --> 07:42.800
to complete its analysis.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.680
It also requires a lot of human power.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.000
So this is not a very efficient method.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.800
Because it is not very efficient,

07:53.800 --> 07:59.040
it can only analyze a small sample of an animal.

07:59.040 --> 08:03.320
If you want to analyze 10 different animals,

08:03.320 --> 08:04.320
different variations,

08:04.320 --> 08:06.600
it may be a bit difficult

08:06.600 --> 08:09.360
or require more time and more manpower.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.480
Another is CRESP, a genetic tool.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.880
It can be used in

08:15.880 --> 08:18.320
mice or

08:18.320 --> 08:21.120
I'm going to talk about Drosophila fruit flies.

08:21.120 --> 08:25.800
It is mainly divided into two parts of this fluorescent protein.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.040
Normally, it emits green light.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.120
After dividing it into two parts,

08:30.120 --> 08:32.680
they will not emit light.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.960
Only when the two parts are very close,

08:34.960 --> 08:38.800
they will be re-combined

08:41.640 --> 08:43.280
like this.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.480
So the two parts themselves do not emit light.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.280
When they are re-combined, they will emit light,

08:48.280 --> 08:50.120
and you can see the green light.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.800
Then it can detect

08:53.120 --> 08:57.880
that two cells are close to each other.

08:57.880 --> 09:02.440
Its disadvantage is that

09:04.240 --> 09:05.080
it...

09:08.600 --> 09:09.440
Sorry.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.520
It can only see where it is in contact with.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.560
It can't make any further modifications

09:18.560 --> 09:20.600
to affect cell poverty.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.720
In addition,

09:21.720 --> 09:26.720
its binding is irreversible.

09:26.720 --> 09:31.360
So there is a concern that

09:31.360 --> 09:35.280
it may affect the connection between the cells.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.640
The dynamic.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.920
Connection to dynamic.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.800
Another system is called Tango.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.400
It mainly has a G-protein couple receptor.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.760
Its feature is that

09:48.760 --> 09:51.040
when it binds its ligand,

09:51.040 --> 09:54.400
it will recruit a protein called arresting.

09:54.400 --> 09:58.120
Arresting comes to activate

09:58.120 --> 10:03.120
its downstream signaling transduction.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.800
Then the engineer added a protease to this protein.

10:08.800 --> 10:13.600
Then this receptor has a transcription factor.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.400
Then there is a sequence in front of it

10:15.400 --> 10:18.680
that will be cut by this protease.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.600
So when the protein is binded,

10:21.600 --> 10:23.280
the protease will cut this part.

10:23.280 --> 10:28.280
Then it will release the intracellular transcription factor

10:29.360 --> 10:32.000
and drive downstream gene excretion.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.920
Its advantage is that

10:36.920 --> 10:40.840
it has these reported proteins,

10:42.320 --> 10:43.800
either fluorescent proteins

10:43.800 --> 10:47.880
or mutant proteins.

10:49.360 --> 10:54.360
You can control some of the features in its cells.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.680
But the disadvantage is that

11:02.680 --> 11:05.960
it is only limited to G-protein couple receptors.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.480
In our neural system,

11:10.480 --> 11:11.320
there are many...

11:13.160 --> 11:14.800
For example, this is a dopamine receptor.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.840
It is a G-protein couple receptor.

11:16.840 --> 11:21.640
But there are many receptors that are just IN channels.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.920
So it can't be used in this place.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.680
In the mammalian,

11:30.680 --> 11:35.680
there is a very popular tool

11:35.720 --> 11:40.480
called re-engineering the RebVirus.

11:40.480 --> 11:45.480
It can monosynaptically trace upstream neurons.

11:48.480 --> 11:53.480
The point that needs to be considered

11:53.960 --> 11:57.360
is that we need to do surgery

11:57.360 --> 12:00.360
to inject this virus into the brain

12:00.360 --> 12:03.080
to express,

12:03.080 --> 12:06.480
to let this virus

12:06.480 --> 12:11.480
to transmit to its Gag cells.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.560
It has cytotoxicity.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.200
So usually the research

12:16.200 --> 12:19.240
can only be completed within a week.

12:19.240 --> 12:20.840
Otherwise, the cells will die.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.040
But another point is that

12:24.040 --> 12:29.040
I just mentioned that it can only be used in the mammalian.

12:33.200 --> 12:37.000
Even so, its efficiency is not very good.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.440
I have tried this tool before.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.160
Different brain regions.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.760
Some brain regions may have special neurons.

12:45.760 --> 12:50.760
It's harder to let the RebVirus

12:52.200 --> 12:55.040
jump to their upstream partner.

12:57.480 --> 13:01.960
So the important purpose of my research

13:02.000 --> 13:04.880
is to generate a system

13:04.880 --> 13:09.240
that can be used on all transgenic animals.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.480
I hope it won't have any toxicity.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.680
So we can safely study

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
the property and function of these cells.

13:23.400 --> 13:28.280
In addition to tracing the neuron

13:28.280 --> 13:31.360
or the connection between the cells,

13:31.720 --> 13:34.000
we can also manipulate their property.

13:36.760 --> 13:41.760
So my main design here is that

13:42.240 --> 13:46.560
if a cell, not necessarily a neuron,

13:46.560 --> 13:50.240
has a ligand

13:50.240 --> 13:55.240
and the other cells have a corresponding receptor,

13:56.120 --> 14:01.120
when these two cells have contact,

14:02.040 --> 14:06.440
the binding will generate a cell signaling

14:06.440 --> 14:09.240
to the downstream cell.

14:10.360 --> 14:15.360
Then we can either express some fluorescent reporter protein,

14:16.680 --> 14:21.680
or express some gene or mutant that we are interested in.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.080
Or it can be RNAi.

14:25.080 --> 14:29.080
So here, we used a very important

14:29.080 --> 14:34.080
signaling pathway in animals,

14:34.080 --> 14:38.080
Delta protein and Notch protein's signaling pathway.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.080
So let me briefly introduce

14:40.080 --> 14:42.080
the structure of Notch protein.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.080
It has a very long hRSA domain.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.080
Most of it is EGF repeat.

14:48.080 --> 14:52.080
This domain will bind its ligand, Delta,

14:53.080 --> 14:58.080
and when they bind,

14:58.080 --> 15:03.080
the current hypothesis is that

15:03.080 --> 15:06.080
if the ligand is endocytosed,

15:06.080 --> 15:11.080
that is, if it is brought in by the cell membrane,

15:11.080 --> 15:13.080
it will generate a force.

15:13.080 --> 15:18.080
It will open this structure called NRR.

15:19.080 --> 15:24.080
After Notch binds,

15:24.080 --> 15:29.080
there will be two cutting points

15:29.080 --> 15:34.080
that will be cut off by Proteus.

15:34.080 --> 15:39.080
One is S2 and the other is S3.

15:39.080 --> 15:43.080
So the original S2 cutting point

15:43.080 --> 15:46.080
is in the NRR structure.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.080
So it's embedded inside the structure,

15:51.080 --> 15:56.080
and Proteus can't digest the S2 site.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.080
So it won't be cut off

16:02.080 --> 16:04.080
until Delta binds.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.080
After it binds, it opens this structure,

16:08.080 --> 16:12.080
and the S2 site can be cut off.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.080
Next, its transmembrane domain

16:15.080 --> 16:17.080
also has a cutting point called S3.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.080
S3 will also be cut off.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.080
Then its intracellular domain

16:23.080 --> 16:25.080
is a transcription factor.

16:25.080 --> 16:28.080
It can move to the cell membrane

16:28.080 --> 16:33.080
to activate downstream gene expression.

16:34.080 --> 16:40.080
So here we use this logic.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.080
We replace some domains

16:44.080 --> 16:49.080
that will affect the cell's endogenous domain,

16:49.080 --> 16:51.080
like EGF repeat,

16:51.080 --> 16:53.080
it will bind the endogenous Delta ligand.

16:53.080 --> 17:00.080
So we replace it with an antibody here.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.080
Then its intracellular domain

17:02.080 --> 17:06.080
will drive endogenous downstream gene expression.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
So we also replace it

17:07.080 --> 17:11.080
with a yeast transcription factor called GAL4.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.080
So our idea is that

17:19.080 --> 17:22.080
our new synthetic receptor

17:22.080 --> 17:26.080
can recognize its own ligand.

17:26.080 --> 17:29.080
I'm using CD19 here.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.080
After it binds,

17:33.080 --> 17:36.080
it uses the NRR domain in the middle

17:36.080 --> 17:38.080
and transmembrane domain.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.080
It will have S2, S3 cleavage.

17:41.080 --> 17:47.080
Then it will release intracellular GAL4.

17:47.080 --> 17:52.080
Then it can drive either GFP

17:52.080 --> 17:55.080
or any gene expression.

17:55.080 --> 17:58.080
It depends on what kind of study we want to do.

18:00.080 --> 18:05.080
We call this whole section track.

18:05.080 --> 18:10.080
It's Transcellular Activation of Transcription.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.080
First, I'll test

18:15.080 --> 18:20.080
whether our designed ligand and receptor can work.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.080
So we use it in the cell line.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.080
Here I show you the control.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.080
Red represents the ligand.

18:29.080 --> 18:33.080
The cell line with or without ligand.

18:35.080 --> 18:40.080
My reporter is GFP.

18:40.080 --> 18:47.080
So when you see the cell with receptor,

18:47.080 --> 18:49.080
it has no GFP

18:49.080 --> 18:53.080
because the co-culture cell has no ligand.

18:53.080 --> 18:59.080
When I change the co-culture cell

19:00.080 --> 19:05.080
to the cell with CD19,

19:05.080 --> 19:13.080
you can see that most of the receptors

19:13.080 --> 19:16.080
and positive cells

19:16.080 --> 19:21.080
start to show GFP.

19:22.080 --> 19:29.080
Here you can see the difference in the amount of GFP.

19:29.080 --> 19:34.080
You can see that the amount of GFP

19:34.080 --> 19:37.080
increases with the co-culture time.

19:37.080 --> 19:42.080
The blue line is the control cell.

19:42.080 --> 19:46.080
The orange line is the test group.

19:47.080 --> 19:53.080
To make sure that they have cell-cell contact,

19:53.080 --> 19:57.080
not because my ligand-positive cell

19:57.080 --> 20:00.080
releases any weird factor

20:00.080 --> 20:03.080
to trigger the downstream gene expression.

20:03.080 --> 20:11.080
So I put the receptor cell

20:11.080 --> 20:14.080
and the ligand-positive cell

20:14.080 --> 20:18.080
in the same play.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.080
But I put less CD19.

20:20.080 --> 20:25.080
So they generate their own colonies.

20:25.080 --> 20:30.080
When they grow up,

20:30.080 --> 20:32.080
only when the two colonies

20:32.080 --> 20:34.080
have direct contact with each other,

20:34.080 --> 20:37.080
the ligand-cell line and the receptor-cell line

20:37.080 --> 20:39.080
will have contact.

20:39.080 --> 20:45.080
This is the receptor-positive colony.

20:45.080 --> 20:48.080
This is the ligand-positive colony.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.080
Only when they have direct contact with each other,

20:52.080 --> 20:57.080
the cells produce green ligand.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.080
The rest are dark.

21:01.080 --> 21:05.080
We use the cell-cell line to prove

21:05.080 --> 21:10.080
that our system can function normally

21:10.080 --> 21:14.080
and detect cell-cell contact.

21:14.080 --> 21:18.080
We hope to use it in the in vivo system.

21:18.080 --> 21:22.080
We use the fruit-gene model.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.080
It is a well-established genetic model.

21:28.080 --> 21:35.080
We have a lot of tools to study it.

21:35.080 --> 21:39.080
The life cycle is relatively short.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.080
The fruit-gene model is about two weeks

21:43.080 --> 21:48.080
from the soft to the mature.

21:48.080 --> 21:53.080
The most important thing is that

21:53.080 --> 21:58.080
the nerve system is similar to the mammalian brain.

21:58.080 --> 22:03.080
We hope to use the nerve system

22:03.080 --> 22:08.080
to imply the mammalian brain.

22:08.080 --> 22:13.080
We hope to use the nerve system

22:13.080 --> 22:18.080
to imply the mammalian brain.

22:18.080 --> 22:24.080
Let me briefly introduce the central nervous system of Drosophila.

22:24.080 --> 22:30.080
They still have neurons and glia.

22:30.080 --> 22:35.080
Their neurons are not like our brain.

22:35.080 --> 22:40.080
There are a bunch of neurons in the brain.

22:40.080 --> 22:45.080
Their synapses are in the same area.

22:45.080 --> 22:50.080
Drosophila's cell body is mainly

22:50.080 --> 22:55.080
around the edge of the nervous system.

22:55.080 --> 23:00.080
around the edge of the nervous system.

23:00.080 --> 23:05.080
These regions have no synapses or connections.

23:05.080 --> 23:10.080
These regions have no synapses or connections.

23:10.080 --> 23:15.080
In this area, the synapse is only there.

23:15.080 --> 23:20.080
In this area, the synapse is only there.

23:20.080 --> 23:25.080
Besides neurons, there are many other glial cells.

23:25.080 --> 23:30.080
I will go into more detail about these later.

23:30.080 --> 23:35.080
I will go into more detail about these later.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.080
One thing to remember is that

23:38.080 --> 23:44.080
what I will talk about later is not about the neural pill itself,

23:44.080 --> 23:49.080
what I will talk about later is not about the neural pill itself,

23:49.080 --> 23:51.080
but about the cells themselves.

23:51.080 --> 23:58.080
First, we want to test whether our system can detect

23:58.080 --> 24:02.080
First, we want to test whether our system can detect

24:02.080 --> 24:07.080
the contact between glial cells and neurons.

24:07.080 --> 24:12.080
the contact between glial cells and neurons.

24:12.080 --> 24:17.080
We can see that neurons and glial cells...

24:17.080 --> 24:22.080
We can see that neurons and glial cells...

24:22.080 --> 24:27.080
The first part is to see if we can detect the contact

24:27.080 --> 24:30.080
The first part is to see if we can detect the contact

24:30.080 --> 24:34.080
between glial cells and neurons.

24:34.080 --> 24:39.080
Then we want to further use our system

24:39.080 --> 24:44.080
to see if we can trace the contact between neurons.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.080
to see if we can trace the contact between neurons.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.080
First, glial-to-neuron.

24:48.080 --> 24:58.080
There are different types of glial cells in the ToSoftware.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.080
There are different types of glial cells in the ToSoftware.

25:03.080 --> 25:14.080
The contact between neurons is different.

25:14.080 --> 25:21.080
For example, the surface glial is wrapped around the nervous system.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.080
It's more like a protective film.

25:24.080 --> 25:29.080
They don't have much contact with our neurons.

25:29.080 --> 25:35.080
They don't have much contact with our neurons.

25:35.080 --> 25:39.080
On the contrary, different types of glial cells,

25:39.080 --> 25:42.080
such as cortex glial,

25:42.080 --> 25:48.080
are mainly wrapped around the neural soma.

25:48.080 --> 25:52.080
Or the astrocytes are mainly

25:52.080 --> 25:55.080
infiltrated into the neural pill

25:55.080 --> 26:00.080
and wrapped around the synapse.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.080
These different types of astrocytes

26:03.080 --> 26:09.080
have more contact with neurons.

26:10.080 --> 26:14.080
So what we want to test here is

26:14.080 --> 26:20.080
to see if the ligand is present in the glial cell,

26:20.080 --> 26:27.080
can we detect the connection between neurons?

26:27.080 --> 26:32.080
So here I have all the bioreceptor proteins

26:32.080 --> 26:34.080
in all the neurons.

26:34.080 --> 26:42.080
Then we use the ligand in the glial cell

26:42.080 --> 26:46.080
to see what happens.

26:46.080 --> 26:51.080
This diagram shows

26:51.080 --> 26:55.080
what the ToSoftware's Lava Brain looks like.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.080
There are two main parts.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.080
The central brain,

27:00.080 --> 27:03.080
which is the main area of the brain.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.080
And the ventral nerve cord,

27:05.080 --> 27:10.080
which is like the spinal cord.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.080
The first thing I want to show is

27:15.080 --> 27:18.080
if our system doesn't have any ligand,

27:18.080 --> 27:20.080
its background is quite weak.

27:20.080 --> 27:25.080
It only shows up in different tissues.

27:26.080 --> 27:34.080
When the ligand is present in the astrocytes,

27:34.080 --> 27:39.080
we can see a lot of neurons are labeled.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.080
This is mainly because

27:41.080 --> 27:44.080
the ligand and the receptor present in the neurons

27:44.080 --> 27:46.080
are combined

27:46.080 --> 27:53.080
to stimulate the GFP protein in the lower part of the brain.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.080
Here I use another driver.

27:57.080 --> 28:01.080
This driver is called ELAM.

28:01.080 --> 28:07.080
This is an astrocyte-specific gene.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.080
So using its promoter,

28:09.080 --> 28:11.080
we can see that

28:11.080 --> 28:15.080
the ligand mainly shows up in the astrocytes.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.080
But the REPL

28:17.080 --> 28:23.080
is a protein found in all glial cells.

28:23.080 --> 28:26.080
You can see that the pattern between them is different.

28:26.080 --> 28:32.080
When these glial cells are shown in different populations,

28:32.080 --> 28:34.080
we can see that

28:34.080 --> 28:39.080
the pattern of the label changes a little bit.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.080
For example,

28:41.080 --> 28:43.080
in this brain area,

28:43.080 --> 28:48.080
I will zoom in to show you.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.080
In this area,

28:50.080 --> 28:55.080
the driver doesn't show a lot of GFP expression.

28:57.080 --> 29:00.080
In the next slide,

29:00.080 --> 29:03.080
I will zoom in to show you.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.080
I want to show you that

29:05.080 --> 29:08.080
our system is quite specific.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.080
This is mainly because

29:10.080 --> 29:14.080
we can see so many green neurons are labeled.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.080
This is mainly because

29:16.080 --> 29:18.080
in the same area,

29:18.080 --> 29:24.080
the cell body doesn't show a lot of ligand expression.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.080
It's darker here.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.080
It's mainly because

29:28.080 --> 29:30.080
the process of these neurons

29:30.080 --> 29:32.080
will have contact with

29:32.080 --> 29:34.080
this

29:34.080 --> 29:38.080
row of glial cells.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.080
But here,

29:40.080 --> 29:42.080
and these two places,

29:42.080 --> 29:44.080
that's why

29:44.080 --> 29:46.080
we have

29:46.080 --> 29:48.080
this

29:48.080 --> 29:50.080
strong

29:50.080 --> 29:52.080
GFP expression

29:52.080 --> 29:54.080
in these neurons.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.080
Next,

30:02.080 --> 30:04.080
we can prove that

30:04.080 --> 30:06.080
our system

30:06.080 --> 30:08.080
and our tool

30:08.080 --> 30:10.080
in Drosophila

30:10.080 --> 30:12.080
can work.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.080
The question we want to ask is

30:14.080 --> 30:16.080
can we use our system

30:16.080 --> 30:18.080
to label

30:18.080 --> 30:20.080
astrocytes?

30:22.080 --> 30:24.080
Mainly because

30:24.080 --> 30:26.080
astrocytes

30:26.080 --> 30:28.080
has been proven

30:28.080 --> 30:30.080
that

30:30.080 --> 30:32.080
it has

30:32.080 --> 30:34.080
a very important

30:34.080 --> 30:36.080
role

30:36.080 --> 30:38.080
to control

30:38.080 --> 30:40.080
synaptic function.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.080
For example,

30:44.080 --> 30:46.080
it can

30:46.080 --> 30:48.080
control synaptic contact

30:48.080 --> 30:50.080
by

30:50.080 --> 30:52.080
eating

30:52.080 --> 30:54.080
those

30:54.080 --> 30:56.080
unused synapses

30:56.080 --> 30:58.080
or unused processes.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.080
It can also

31:00.080 --> 31:02.080
help

31:02.080 --> 31:04.080
synaptic formation

31:04.080 --> 31:06.080
of

31:06.080 --> 31:08.080
neurons.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.080
Astrocytes

31:10.080 --> 31:12.080
have been studied

31:12.080 --> 31:14.080
that

31:14.080 --> 31:16.080
astrocytes can also

31:16.080 --> 31:18.080
react to

31:18.080 --> 31:20.080
neurotransmitters.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.080
It can

31:22.080 --> 31:24.080
control

31:24.080 --> 31:26.080
the level of

31:26.080 --> 31:28.080
neurotransmitter release.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.080
It can also

31:30.080 --> 31:32.080
control

31:32.080 --> 31:34.080
neuronal activity.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.080
However,

31:36.080 --> 31:38.080
all these studies

31:38.080 --> 31:40.080
assume

31:40.080 --> 31:42.080
that astrocytes are

31:42.080 --> 31:44.080
a homogeneous population.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.080
Some tools

59:26.080 --> 59:28.080
All astrocytes

59:28.080 --> 59:30.080
can be used

59:30.080 --> 59:32.080
to

59:32.080 --> 59:34.080
knock down

59:34.080 --> 59:36.080
gene function

59:36.080 --> 59:38.080
or

59:38.080 --> 59:40.080
mutant gene.

59:40.080 --> 59:42.080
Either

59:42.080 --> 59:44.080
your head

59:44.080 --> 59:46.080
has to be transparent

59:46.080 --> 59:48.080
or you have to

59:48.080 --> 59:50.080
punch something

59:50.080 --> 59:52.080
on a mouse's bone.

59:52.080 --> 59:54.080
It's not possible

59:54.080 --> 59:56.080
in real life.

59:56.080 --> 59:58.080
In my system,

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.080
you have to

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.080
express two

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.080
ligand and receptor

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.080
and three reporter.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.080
If you can't

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.080
use

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.080
transgenic animal

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.080
or other virus

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.080
to express, it's impossible.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.080
Also, human brain

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.080
has

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.080
limitations.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.080
I just mentioned

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.080
that I don't know

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.080
if you are there.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.080
Now CRISPR

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080
is very popular.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.080
It can

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.080
make it easier

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.080
to

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.080
change

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.080
the genetic profile

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.080
of different animals.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.080
You can

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.080
do transgenic animal.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.080
In other words,

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.080
using CRISPR,

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.080
we should have

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.080
more opportunities

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.080
to test

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.080
on different animals.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.080
Like rabies virus,

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.080
it's a good tool.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080
Many papers

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.080
published

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.080
about it.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.080
The problem is

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.080
we can't use it

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.080
on birds.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.080
Birds can't

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.080
get rabies.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.080
It's rabies virus.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.080
This tool

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.080
is transgenic.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.080
If CRISPR

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.080
looks promising,

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.080
we can use it

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.080
on different animals.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.080
As I mentioned,

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.080
there is a kind of

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.080
sea...

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.080
dolphin.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.080
Tuff fish.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.080
Tuff fish.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.080
Yes, dolphin.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.080
It has a strange

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.080
and special behavior.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.080
It will

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.080
draw on the sand

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.080
in the sea

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.080
in a symmetric pattern

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.080
to attract...

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.080
It's amazing.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.080
If I have a chance,

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.080
I want to study

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.080
its brain.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.080
Really?

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.080
Really?

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.080
Why is it like this?

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.080
I don't know.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.080
But the pattern

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.080
is like

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.080
the pattern

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.080
of a

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.080
shark.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.080
It's big.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.080
I think

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.080
it's interesting

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080
to study it.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.080
But

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.080
it's not

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.080
transgenic.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.080
We can only use

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.080
functional MRI.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.080
But it can't

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.080
be that good.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.080
I'm thinking

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.080
how to

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.080
develop it

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.080
so that we can

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.080
understand

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.080
its brain.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.080
I was thinking

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.080
if you change it

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.080
to a

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.080
magnetic field

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.080
or electrical field,

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.080
you can use

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.080
MRI technology

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.080
to locate it.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.080
But the resolution

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.080
is not high enough

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.080
to see such a small thing.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.080
It looks like a piece.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.080
It's bright here.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.080
So it's useless.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.080
I remember

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.080
I saw

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.080
a speech

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.080
or something.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.080
They were using X-ray

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.080
to look at

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.080
the structure

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.080
of the brain.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.080
The structure of the brain.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.080
The brain is

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.080
very small.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.080
X-ray

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.080
has a strong trajectory.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.080
I think they were thinking

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.080
if they can

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.080
use X-ray to dissect

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.080
such a small brain,

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.080
the resolution will be good.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.080
Maybe in the future,

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.080
we can use it

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.080
to dissect

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.080
large animals.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.080
But

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.080
I don't know

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.080
how long

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.080
the technology will last.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.080
Maybe in the future,

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.080
there will be a big breakthrough.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.080
I think

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.080
there is a big gap.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.080
I think

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.080
it's very helpful

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.080
for animal models.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.080
But animal model

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.080
literature and

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.080
human models

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.080
have a big gap.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.080
Both sides

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.080
don't know how to

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.080
cross the gap.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.080
There is no bridge.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.080
Maybe

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080
the closest

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.080
is primate.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.080
Primates

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.080
may have some...

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.080
Yes.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.080
I think

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.080
it's very obvious.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.080
If you are a primate,

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.080
you do some

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.080
obvious things

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.080
like

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.080
aggression

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.080
or mating behavior

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.080
or

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.080
hierarchy.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.080
But if you are

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.080
a high-ranking animal,

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.080
like a stork,

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.080
you are very close to a primate.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.080
But if you are

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.080
a high-ranking animal,

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.080
you are very close to a primate.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.080
But if you are

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.080
a high-ranking animal,

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.080
you are very close to a primate.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.080
I think

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.080
it's a very complicated social behavior.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.080
I heard people

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.080
do jealousy

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.080
on mice.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.080
I heard people

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.080
do jealousy on mice.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.080
I heard people

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.080
do love on mice.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.080
It's painful.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.080
Yes.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.080
Yes.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.080
I was thinking

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.080
how to use

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.080
this system.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.080
But

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.080
if you really use it on humans,

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.080
there will be some

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.080
limitations

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.080
on human brain function.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.080
on human brain function.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.080
Yes.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.080
Yes.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.080
Yes.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.080
But

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.080
we can't

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.080
do research on humans.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.080
we can't do research on humans.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.080
But I think it's cool.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.080
But I think it's cool.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.080
I think your resolution

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.080
is very high.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.080
It's quite

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.080
big.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.080
I don't know where the people in front sit.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.080
It's amazing.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.080
It's amazing.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.080
It's amazing.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.080
You can see everything in detail.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.080
It's mainly

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.080
through social contact.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.080
So we still have to

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.080
test

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.080
its sensitivity.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.080
its sensitivity.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.080
Minimal area

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.080
that you need to

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.080
see the difference.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.080
see the difference.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.080
So

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080
you still have to

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.080
see

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.080
how big is your contact area.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.080
And

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.080
if your concentration

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.080
is high enough

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.080
to see

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.080
its downstream

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.080
performance.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.080
You can adjust it

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.080
slowly.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.080
My main work is to adjust

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.080
this tool.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.080
So it can be used

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.080
in

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.080
tracing neural circuits.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.080
And

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.080
Yeah.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.080
Yeah.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.080
I don't want to talk alone.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.080
Do you have any questions?

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.080
Do you have any questions?

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080
Do you have any questions?

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.080
YuQing asked a question.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.080
YuQing asked a question.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.080
I don't know if Jenny is still here.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.080
I don't know.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.080
I'm here.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.080
YuQing is here.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.080
I mean Jenny.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.080
There's another one.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.080
Yeah.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.080
I think

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.080
maybe in the future

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.080
after I have more

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.080
information,

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.080
this is just the basics.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.080
Maybe in the future,

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.080
I still need something like

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.080
telekinesis or

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.080
computer simulation

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080
to really

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.080
understand

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.080
brain function.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.080
Now I can only

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.080
provide a tool

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.080
with a blueprint.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.080
Just an established

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.080
blueprint.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.080
In the future,

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.080
I want to

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.080
control

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.080
Apple's

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080
cell property.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.080
So I can be more selective

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.080
in my research.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.080
Does anyone else have a question?

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.080
Please go ahead.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080
There's a drug

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.080
called LSD.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.080
Is it...

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.080
I think...

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.080
I think...

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.080
I don't know if it's related to this.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.080
Is it that

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080
after taking the drug,

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.080
what will happen?

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.080
Is it related to

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.080
this research?

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.080
After taking the drug,

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.080
it will control...

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.080
LSD will

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.080
simulate

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.080
those things, right?

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.080
It's a bit like...

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.080
Yeah, I didn't say it myself.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.080
It should be like that.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.080
I don't know.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.080
It mainly works on...

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.080
I'm not sure

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.080
if it's doping

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.080
or that...

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.080
What's it called?

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.080
It's like

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.080
the same place

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.080
where the drugs work.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.080
I kind of

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.080
forgot what it's called.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.080
It works on

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.080
a certain neurotransmitter

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080
circuit.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.080
So it's like

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.080
what I just said.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.080
There's a reward

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.080
circuit.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.080
It's mainly

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080
in that area.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.080
Like that area.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.080
The brain area

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.080
is very popular.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.080
It's related to

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.080
reward and addiction.

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.080
It's related to reward and addiction.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.080
Talking about

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.080
reward system.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.080
I'm not a

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.080
biopsychologist,

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.080
so I'm not sure.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.080
But the reward system

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.080
is very popular now.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.080
It's related to addiction.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.080
You might have mentioned it, but I missed it.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.080
Other than addiction,

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.080
it's also

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.080
related to...

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.080
Like a lot of

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.080
psychological disorders,

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.080
like autism

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.080
or

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.080
etc.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.080
They have

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.080
abnormal repetitive behaviors.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.080
They keep doing it.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.080
It's like

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.080
what?

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.080
Like obsessive-compulsive disorder.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.080
Right.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.080
It's because their reward system

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.080
has a problem.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.080
When they do these behaviors,

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.080
their reward system will keep firing.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.080
As a result,

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.080
the abnormal

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.080
unnecessary behaviors

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.080
will keep firing.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.080
Some imaging researches

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.080
are doing this.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.080
ADHD.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.080
Right.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.080
As I mentioned,

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.080
we

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.080
research

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.080
connectome

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.080
in the brain.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.080
The purpose is

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.080
to make a normal reference.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.080
Then we can

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.080
study

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.080
schizophrenia

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.080
or other

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.080
brain related

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.080
disorders.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.080
What are

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.080
the differences

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.080
between them?

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.080
Right.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.080
Schizophrenia

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.080
has excitatory

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.080
and inhibitory

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.080
differences.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.080
Do they have

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.080
fewer connections?

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.080
Or

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.080
do they have

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.080
fewer synaptic strain?

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.080
I think

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080
many professors in our department

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.080
like your researches.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.080
Our department

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.080
has a close relationship

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.080
with

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.080
Engelsheim.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.080
They do

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.080
schizophrenia.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.080
Oh.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.080
Right.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.080
They push patients

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080
into the brain.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.080
Your image.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.080
I remember

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.080
there was a talk

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.080
about functional MRI.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.080
Right.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.080
It's about ADHD.

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.080
It's about

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.080
image.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.080
They do

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.080
function

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.080
structure.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.080
In the past, MRI

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.080
did anatomical

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080
structure.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.080
They did

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.080
anatomical structure.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.080
Now they do

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.080
firing pattern.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.080
It's called functional.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.080
Right.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.080
I remember.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.080
Right.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.080
It's 7.25 now.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.080
Any questions?

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.080
If not,

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.080
3, 2, 1.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.080
Thank you.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.080
Thank you.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.080
Thank you.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.080
Let's continue.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.080
If you have any ideas,

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.080
you can

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.080
share with us.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.080
Thank you.
