1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh, it's started.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh, it's started.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, let's start.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's give a round of applause.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's give a round of applause.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Wait a minute.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do I have to share my screen with you?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, you have to share your screen.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'll turn off my own screen.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You have to share your screen.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's take a look.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You should be able to choose your screen.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You can choose the one you want to share.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can share the one you want to share.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll turn off my screen.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll turn off my screen.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Can everyone see it?

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The sound is pretty clear.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
First of all, thank you, Yen Ping,

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
for introducing my past experience.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And then,

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
today, I mainly want to...

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
From the past to the present,

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
most of the time, I've been doing

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
air pollution analysis

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and air pollution model

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
analysis

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to understand some air pollution

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in the atmosphere

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and how it is from

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
emissions to transmission and then

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
affects the human body.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I know that in March this year,

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
you talked about the relationship

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
between air pollution and

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
public health.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We are in the same lab,

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but what we do

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
is a little bit different.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's more about

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
how to connect air pollution

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to public health.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm more about

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
how to understand

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
air pollution in the atmosphere

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and its movement and emissions

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
or some chemical

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
reaction mechanism, etc.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So,

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will introduce

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
three different

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
tools

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
to try to

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
share with you how to use

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
these tools to understand

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
how air pollution

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
is formed and

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
how it is transmitted.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then, atmospheric science is not

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
like other basic sciences

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
like physics and chemistry.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's more like application science.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then,

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
after combining knowledge

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
from different fields

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
of each discipline,

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
we use these knowledge

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to do atmospheric science

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
or atmospheric pollution analysis.

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
First of all,

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
we all know that

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
if there is no air pollution

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in the atmosphere,

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
we will see

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
a blue sky.

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's because of

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the relationship between

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
atmospheric dust and light.

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, we will see a blue sky.

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But once

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
there is air pollution activity,

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
for example,

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
human or natural combustion,

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
it will change

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the matter in the atmosphere

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and change the color of the sky.

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, you can see

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the two pictures below.

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The one on the left is the forest fire

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and the one on the right is

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the two explosions

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
in Mexico.

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
These two pictures

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
have similarities

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and differences.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The similarities are

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the high temperature and high energy

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
brought by combustion

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
will bring the pollution group

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to about 300 to 400 high altitudes

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and then it will be transmitted.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The difference between the two pictures

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
is that the one on the left

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
is more grayish.

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That means

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
it is more

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
organic carbon pollution group.

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The one on the right

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
is more

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
blackish.

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That means it is more

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
black carbon or elemental carbon

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
pollution group.

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Today, I mainly want to

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
introduce

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the background information

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
about pollution

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and how it is

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
transmitted

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
around the world.

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then,

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I will also

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
review the existing

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
air pollution documents,

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
tools used,

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and some popular

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
atmospheric science research.

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Finally, I will talk about

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
my research and

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
what problems Taiwan

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
is facing

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
when it comes to

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
atmospheric pollution.

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Can you hear me?

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, I can hear you.

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But your voice is a bit low.

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is it better now?

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes, it is clearer now.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
When you are

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
sharing the screen,

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
can you

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
see the dialogue window?

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No.

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You can't see it, right?

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can see it.

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you have any questions,

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you can post them on the dialogue window.

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Or you can turn on the microphone.

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If I see it,

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will talk to you.

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then,

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
a student

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
asked two questions.

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The first one is

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
who is Zhang Shiying?

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The second question is

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
what is organic carbon

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and what is elemental carbon?

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Who is Zhang Shiying?

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Our lab

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
talked about

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
air pollution and public health

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in March.

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He is

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
a Ph.D. graduate

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
from our lab.

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He is doing

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
atmospheric pollution

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
in Sonoma Technology.

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He is focusing on

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
integration model

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
with

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
original model

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and assessing

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
public health.

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He will calculate

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
how many people die

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
due to

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
air pollution.

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Organic carbon

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and elemental carbon

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
are

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
carbon

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
combined with

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
air pollution.

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It is more like organic carbon.

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Elemental carbon

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is pure carbon.

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can see

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
charcoal is

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
elemental carbon.

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
These are the two questions.

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Next,

199
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
we will talk about

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
air pollutants.

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There are three basic ways to classify them.

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The first one is

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
criteria air pollutants.

204
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
According to

205
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
US EPA,

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
there are 6 criteria air pollutants.

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
These 6 criteria air pollutants

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
must be classified

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
as standard air pollutants.

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They include PM2.5,

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
PM10,

212
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
NOx, SO2,

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and Ozone.

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The other one is

215
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
harmful air pollutants.

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
These pollutants are

217
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
more like organic matter.

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
For example,

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CHPCB,

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
or

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
heavy metal,

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
such as steel,

223
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and so on.

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
These pollutants are harmful to human body.

225
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Criteria air pollutants

226
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
are more harmful to

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
respiratory system,

228
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
circulatory system,

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and cardiovascular disease.

230
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
These pollutants

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
will accumulate in

232
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
human organs.

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The second way to classify them

234
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
is based on

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
physical characteristics.

236
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
For example, some air pollutants

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
are more likely to be harmful

238
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to the air

239
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
under high temperature.

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
These pollutants, such as

241
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SO2 and Ozone,

242
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
are similar to these pollutants.

243
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The other one is

244
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
more likely to be harmful to

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
aerosol phase.

246
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
For example,

247
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
many people think

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
PM2.5 is a solid particle.

249
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In fact,

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
PM2.5 not only contains

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
solid particles,

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
but also contains

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
liquid particles,

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
such as salt and acid,

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and so on.

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In addition, some pollutants

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
are in the middle

258
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
of these two phases.

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
These pollutants are

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
highly volatile compounds,

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
such as

262
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
organic compounds

263
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
or nitrate.

264
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
their vapor pressure

266
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
changes with temperature

267
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and pressure,

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
they are more likely to be harmful

269
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to the air under different conditions.

270
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The last one is

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
primary and secondary air pollutants.

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Primary means

273
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
they are directly released

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
from the air.

275
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Secondary means

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
they are released

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
from the air

278
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
through chemical reactions.

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Secondary means

280
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
they are toxic.

281
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Primary means

282
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
they are harmful to the air.

283
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
When we

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
study air pollutants,

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
we only study

286
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
a small amount.

287
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
For example,

288
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
PM2.5 contains

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
30 micrograms per cubic meter,

290
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
which is meaningless.

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But if you add

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
12 micrograms per cubic meter

293
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
in US standards

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and 15 micrograms per cubic meter

295
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in Taiwan standards,

296
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
you can start

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
calculating

298
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
your health risk

299
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
after studying

300
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
air pollutants.

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So

302
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
why do we

303
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
study air pollutants?

304
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Because we want to

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
connect with public health.

306
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
For humans,

307
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
air pollutants

308
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
cause

309
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
lung and

310
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
cardiovascular diseases.

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Secondly,

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
toxic substances

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
are released

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
from the air

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and are

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
absorbed by

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
rice,

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
other plants,

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
vegetables,

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and fish.

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When humans

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
eat them,

323
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
they accumulate.

324
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
For example,

325
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
PCV and PCVPH

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
are toxic substances

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
that are harmful to humans.

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Air pollutants

329
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
not only harm humans,

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
but also affect

331
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the environment.

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
First,

333
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
air pollutants

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
are reduced

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
by 150 to

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
200 kilometers per hour.

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
As pollutants

338
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
are produced,

339
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
especially particles,

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
they will

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
diffuse or absorb light.

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This will reduce

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
the visible distance.

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In sandstorms,

345
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the visible distance is

346
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
several meters.

347
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Secondly,

348
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
climate change

349
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
includes

350
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
traditional air pollutants

351
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
as well as

352
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
new air pollutants,

353
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
such as

354
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
greenhouse gases.

355
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They absorb

356
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
energy and

357
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
store it in the earth.

358
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This has a

359
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
huge impact on the earth's environment

360
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and climate.

361
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Thirdly,

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
acid rain

363
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
is from nitrate

364
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
or sulphate.

365
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Ok,

366
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
so

367
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
climate change

368
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
is a hot topic

369
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
especially in the US.

370
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Trump has been denying

371
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
this issue.

372
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He signed the Paris Agreement

373
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
last year.

374
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Didn't Trump

375
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
sign it?

376
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Trump didn't sign it.

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But

378
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
other countries have signed it.

379
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Only the US

380
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
didn't sign it.

381
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then,

382
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
this part

383
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
is

384
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
for example,

385
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
CO2 and ozone

386
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
are emitted into the atmosphere.

387
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This causes

388
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
global

389
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
global average temperature to rise.

390
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
However,

391
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
it has different effects

392
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
in some areas.

393
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The average temperature

394
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
is dropping.

395
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In my opinion,

396
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the word

397
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
global warming

398
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
is too

399
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
broad.

400
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It doesn't

401
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
accurately describe

402
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
what we are facing.

403
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What we are facing

404
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
is climate change.

405
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
For example,

406
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
global warming

407
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
in the US

408
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and the

409
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
storm in the

410
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
US

411
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and the

412
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
snow storm

413
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
can't be described

414
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
in one word.

415
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I think the word

416
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
climate change

417
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
is more accurate.

418
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It describes

419
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
what we are

420
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
facing.

421
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The third

422
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
is acid rain.

423
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Acid rain

424
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
can reduce the

425
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
harvest of crops.

426
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Many

427
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
ancient buildings

428
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
were built by marble.

429
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Acid rain can corrode

430
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
these buildings

431
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and affect

432
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the environment.

433
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've talked about

434
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
climate change.

435
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's talk about

436
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
the source of

437
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
greenhouse gases.

438
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The primary source

439
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
is the power system.

440
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Whether it's fuel,

441
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
gas, or coal,

442
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
coal has a big impact on

443
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
the environment

444
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
because it emits a lot of

445
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
oxygen.

446
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Whether it's

447
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
forest or industrial

448
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
power plants,

449
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
it has a big impact

450
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
on the environment.

451
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The third is

452
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
driving every day.

453
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Especially in LA,

454
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
traffic

455
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
is a high source of pollution.

456
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Other pollutants

457
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
such as natural pollutants,

458
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
volcanoes,

459
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and forest fires

460
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
are the source of

461
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
greenhouse gases.

462
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In the past,

463
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
people thought

464
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that the source of

465
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
greenhouse gases

466
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
is industrial emissions.

467
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
However,

468
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
in the past 20 years,

469
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the U.S. and Europe

470
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
have strictly

471
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
controlled

472
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the emission of

473
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
traffic and industrial pollutants.

474
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Some pollutants

475
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
have decreased.

476
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The next issue

477
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
is agricultural emissions.

478
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Taiwan and South Korea

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
have been facing this issue

480
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
for the past 10 years.

481
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
China and India

482
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
may face this issue later.

483
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
When you control

484
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
industrial and traffic pollutants,

485
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
agricultural pollutants

486
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
become important pollutants.

487
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The second is...

488
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Excuse me.

489
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You said agricultural air

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
pollution.

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I didn't hear you.

492
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hello?

493
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Can you hear me?

494
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Can you hear me?

495
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

496
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Can you repeat that?

497
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Did you mean

498
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
agricultural air pollution?

499
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes.

500
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's hard to imagine.

501
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Agricultural air pollution.

502
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll explain later.

503
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Please be patient.

504
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll explain later.

505
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The second issue

506
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
is

507
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
after some reactions,

508
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
some pollutants

509
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
are produced.

510
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We can see...

511
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We can see

512
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
after the pollutants

513
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
are emitted,

514
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
they enter the atmosphere

515
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and are transmitted by the gas plant.

516
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
After the gas plant

517
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
produces the pollutants,

518
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
the pollutants will be

519
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
decomposed in areas

520
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
such as national parks.

521
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
After the pollutants

522
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
are decomposed

523
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and enter the ecosystem,

524
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the pollutants will

525
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
enter the human body.

526
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The above

527
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
are some

528
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
basic

529
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
air pollution

530
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
introduction.

531
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Next, I'll talk about

532
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
some simple

533
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
secondary chemistry.

534
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This picture

535
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
is

536
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
secondary inorganic

537
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
chemistry.

538
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We can see

539
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
SO2 and NO2.

540
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
These two are mainly

541
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
from industrial pollutants.

542
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Industrial pollutants

543
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
are like the

544
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
coal, gas, fuel,

545
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and electricity plants.

546
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Transportation pollutants

547
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
emit NO2.

548
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
For example, the

549
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
iron industry

550
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
emits SO2 and NO2.

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They are the main

552
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
emitters of SO2 and NO2.

553
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
After some

554
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
radical reactions,

555
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
they produce

556
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
oxygen and nitrogen.

557
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Then,

558
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
they turn

559
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
SO2 and NO2

560
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
into common

561
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
particles in the air.

562
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
These are common

563
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
particles in the air.

564
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Ammonia bisulfate,

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
ammonia sulfate, and ammonia nitrate

566
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
account for

567
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
30% to 70% of

568
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
PM2.5 in the air.

569
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It depends on the region and season.

570
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
They are large.

571
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
However,

572
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
in South America,

573
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
industrial pollutants and

574
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
transportation pollutants

575
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
reduce PM2.5

576
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
significantly.

577
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
To produce

578
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
ammonia-related aerosols,

579
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
you need

580
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
ammonia.

581
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This is from agriculture.

582
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This is what I said

583
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
last night.

584
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
After controlling

585
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
transportation and industrial pollutants,

586
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
agricultural pollutants

587
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
contribute significantly.

588
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The U.S. Department of Environment

589
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
is thinking about

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
how to limit

591
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
ammonia emissions.

592
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Ammonia emissions are mainly

593
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
from fertilizers.

594
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They are thinking

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
how to control

596
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
the use of fertilizers.

597
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They can

598
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
gradually reduce

599
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
agricultural pollutants

600
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
in the air.

601
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't know

602
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
if that answers

603
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
your question.

604
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The second part is

605
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
secondary organic chemistry.

606
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Secondary organic chemistry

607
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
mainly

608
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
comes from

609
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
volatile organic compounds.

610
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Transportation pollutants

611
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
such as

612
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
toluene VOCs,

613
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
volatile organic compounds,

614
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and other

615
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
biogenic emissions

616
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
such as

617
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
alpha-pining or

618
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
beta-pining VOCs.

619
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
These VOCs

620
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
have a high

621
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
vapor pressure

622
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
in their original state.

623
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
They don't come

624
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
from aerosols.

625
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
However, when they react

626
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
with ozone, OH,

627
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
or nitrate,

628
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
they become

629
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
more volatile compounds.

630
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
These compounds

631
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
have higher

632
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
volatility and

633
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
lower vapor pressure.

634
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
They have a chance to

635
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
change from gas to solid.

636
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Organic chemistry

637
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
is very complicated

638
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
in the atmosphere.

639
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Its concentration is relatively low.

640
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
In the atmosphere,

641
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
there are

642
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
hundreds of

643
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
species.

644
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
In the atmosphere,

645
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
we know

646
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
very little about

647
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
organic chemistry.

648
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Unlike inorganic chemistry,

649
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
we know

650
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
a lot about

651
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
organic chemistry.

652
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
However, we know very little about

653
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
organic chemistry.

654
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The above two slides

655
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
are about

656
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
some basic

657
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
experiments in

658
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
atmospheric chemistry.

659
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Next, we are going to talk about

660
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the transmission part.

661
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We need to know

662
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
how to

663
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
transmit

664
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
at different scales

665
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
from emission

666
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
to

667
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
spatial distribution.

668
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I will divide it

669
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
into three different scales.

670
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The first one is

671
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
global transport.

672
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The second one is regional.

673
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The third one is local-urban transport.

674
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Global transport

675
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
is from NASA.

676
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It is a

677
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
high-altitude

678
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
wind speed map.

679
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It is in the range of

680
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
300 to 400 mb.

681
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
In the northern hemisphere,

682
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
we can see that

683
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the red color

684
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
represents

685
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
higher wind speed,

686
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
while the blue color represents

687
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
lower wind speed.

688
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Most pollutants

689
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
are in the northern hemisphere.

690
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The air pollutants in the southern hemisphere

691
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
are low.

692
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The air pollutants are low.

693
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
In the northern hemisphere,

694
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
most of it

695
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
are caused by

696
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
the influence of

697
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
the heavy wind and

698
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
the just-trained.

699
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
When we route

700
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
into the regional transport,

701
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
we can first see

702
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
the area in East Asia,

703
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
where the two high-pressure systems

704
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
are mainly affecting

705
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the region's

706
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
transmission.

707
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
For example,

708
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
the Mongolia high-pressure system

709
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and the Pacific high-pressure system

710
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
can be seen in different seasons.

711
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
For example,

712
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
the Mongolia high-pressure system

713
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
is stronger in the winter,

714
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
so we see the northeast wind in Taiwan.

715
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
In the summer,

716
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the Pacific high-pressure system

717
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
is stronger,

718
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
so we see the southeast wind.

719
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
How does this affect

720
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Taiwan's air pollution?

721
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
In the spring and summer,

722
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
the Pacific high-pressure system

723
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
is stronger,

724
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
so we see the southeast wind.

725
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
How does this affect

726
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Taiwan's air pollution?

727
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
In the northern hemisphere,

728
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
the northern hemisphere

729
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
is mainly affected

730
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
by the just-trained.

731
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The just-trained

732
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
has a different

733
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
route in winter and summer,

734
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
which is mainly

735
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
affected by polar vortex.

736
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
When the polar vortex is stronger,

737
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
it will shift the just-trained

738
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
from the north to the south.

739
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So you will see

740
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
different sources of pollution

741
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
depending on the season.

742
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Sometimes you will even see

743
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
sources of pollution in Asia.

744
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
In the United States,

745
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the contribution of

746
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
US air pollutants

747
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
is about 20-30%

748
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
from Asia in spring.

749
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Lastly,

750
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
the urban

751
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and local transmission

752
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
is affected

753
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
by the heat wave.

754
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
In the metropolitan area,

755
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
there is a lack

756
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
of vegetation.

757
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
In the morning,

758
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
the sun shines

759
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and the temperature

760
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
in the metropolitan area

761
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
is very high.

762
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
In the evening,

763
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
the air temperature

764
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
is down.

765
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
On the ground,

766
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
the air temperature

767
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
on the ground

768
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
is up.

769
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
them

770
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
are like a lid.

771
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The hot air

772
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
in the metropolitan area

773
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
can't escape

774
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
the heat wave,

775
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
so many pollutants

776
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
are trapped

777
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
in the air.

778
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
These three

779
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
transmission mechanisms

780
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
play an important role

781
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
in the air quality model.

782
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We use these three

783
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
transmission mechanisms

784
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
or different scale

785
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
transmission

786
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
to understand

787
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
what kind of

788
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
transmission mechanism

789
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
will affect

790
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the pollutants

791
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
in the air.

792
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
These are the

793
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
information about

794
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
air pollutants

795
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
from different

796
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
emission sources

797
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
to different

798
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
transmission scale.

799
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Next,

800
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
let's talk about

801
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
literature review.

802
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The first tool I want to

803
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
talk about is

804
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
source approachment

805
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
to

806
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the data

807
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
in the air.

808
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
We use

809
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
statistical analysis

810
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
to divide it into

811
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
different factors

812
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to find

813
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
the contribution

814
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
of the air

815
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
pollutants.

816
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
As I said,

817
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
the air pollution

818
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
is connected

819
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
with public health.

820
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We want to reduce

821
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
the concentration of pollutants in the air.

822
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The fastest way

823
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
to reduce the concentration of pollutants in the air

824
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
is to reduce the emission

825
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
of different emission sources.

826
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
To reduce the emission

827
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
of different emission sources

828
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and make different laws

829
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
for them,

830
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
we need to know their contribution.

831
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Source approachment

832
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
is a simple

833
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and easy way

834
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
to find the contribution

835
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
of different pollutants.

836
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The literature is an example

837
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
of

838
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
ICP analysis

839
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and

840
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
OC analysis.

841
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
We have

842
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
different elements

843
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and

844
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
four years

845
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
of sampling time.

846
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
When we do

847
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
factor analysis,

848
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
we get different

849
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
factors.

850
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Based on the different factors,

851
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
we can see

852
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
the characteristics of

853
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
organic carbon

854
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and elemental carbon.

855
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Labolution

856
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and

857
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
casing.

858
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Based on these,

859
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
the first factor

860
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
is the

861
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
carbon emission factor.

862
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Based on

863
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
time series analysis,

864
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
we can see

865
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
the contribution of

866
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
different pollutants

867
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
in different years

868
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and different seasons.

869
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We can use

870
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Lagrange's Heisberg model

871
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
to infer

872
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
the emission source

873
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
of

874
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
these pollutants.

875
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The second factor

876
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
is the dispersion model.

877
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Dispersion model

878
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
is a simple model

879
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
based on

880
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Gaussian dispersion

881
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
concept.

882
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It is

883
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
parallel to

884
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
the axis of

885
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the wind direction.

886
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It is based on

887
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
the equation of

888
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
the wind direction

889
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
using

890
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
dispersion to

891
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
calculate.

892
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
This

893
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
dispersion model is

894
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
suitable for small area

895
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
like tens of kilometers.

896
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It does not

897
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
include chemistry.

898
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Most dispersion models

899
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
do not include chemistry.

900
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Only a few have simple chemistry.

901
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It is suitable for primary

902
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000

It is suitable for

908
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000

909
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The third factor

910
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
is the chemical transport model.

911
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
