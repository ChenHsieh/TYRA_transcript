0	2000	Can you see me now?
2000	4000	Ok
4000	6000	Can you see my screen now?
6000	8000	Yes?
8000	10000	Yes, yes, yes
10000	12000	I will turn off my camera
12000	14000	So it will be smoother
14000	16000	Ok
16000	18000	Let me tell you
18000	20000	There are two more people here
20000	22000	One is here
22000	24000	One is over there
24000	26000	The camera may not be able to see
26000	28000	There are three people here
28000	30000	If they have any questions
30000	32000	Don't be surprised if they are real people
34000	36000	Sorry
36000	38000	There were some microphone issues
38000	40000	That's why we are delaying
40000	42000	The topic I am going to talk about
42000	44000	looks a bit
44000	46000	difficult to understand
46000	48000	Functional connectivity and dynamics
48000	50000	and burn organization
50000	52000	In short
52000	54000	The main purpose of my research
54000	56000	is to look at the functional connections
56000	58000	between neural networks
58000	60000	The so-called functional connections
60000	62000	are the neural signals
62000	64000	generated by neurons
64000	66000	during activation
66000	68000	How these neural signals
68000	70000	are transmitted between different brains
70000	72000	This is the main thing
72000	74000	I am going to talk about today
74000	76000	I will divide it into two parts
76000	78000	The first part is introduction
78000	80000	Introduction is a general
80000	82000	background idea
82000	84000	If you are not a neurologist
84000	86000	You need to know something
86000	88000	to make it easier for us to explain
90000	92000	This is one of the main research
92000	94000	The second part is
94000	96000	the current message
96000	98000	It is about a
98000	100000	special project
100000	102000	The last part is all about that project
102000	104000	The first part is
104000	106000	a little bit
106000	108000	scientific
108000	110000	The second part is more about
110000	112000	that research
112000	114000	I have seen
114000	116000	the comments
116000	118000	Some people are just
118000	120000	talking about science
120000	122000	So I want to talk about
122000	124000	what is neuroscience
124000	126000	I have seen
126000	128000	on the internet
128000	130000	Neuroscience is a
130000	132000	comprehensive research
132000	134000	It includes chemistry,
134000	136000	medicine, physiology, medicine
136000	138000	even computer science and engineering
138000	140000	There are a lot of subjects
140000	142000	From the perspective of
142000	144000	modern neuroscience
144000	146000	There are
146000	148000	cells
148000	150000	and neurons
152000	154000	If you
154000	156000	enlarge the scale
156000	158000	There are cognitive science
158000	160000	and behavioral science
160000	162000	Finally, there is transfer medicine
162000	164000	It is to apply the research
164000	166000	in the lab to clinical
166000	168000	If you want to
168000	170000	There are micro scale,
170000	172000	mesoscale and macroscale
172000	174000	The last part is
174000	176000	about the research
176000	178000	The first part is
178000	180000	between neurons
180000	182000	The research topic is
182000	184000	between neurons
184000	186000	Let me correct
186000	188000	The first part is
188000	190000	about single neurons
190000	192000	The second part is
192000	194000	between neurons
194000	196000	The last part is
196000	198000	between neurons
198000	200000	The biggest part
200000	202000	is what I have done
202000	204000	At the same time
204000	206000	What I have done
206000	208000	will cover the last part
208000	210000	I will use
210000	212000	a simple sentence
212000	214000	It is about
214000	216000	neural connectivity
216000	218000	You will hear
218000	220000	functional connectivity
220000	222000	It is about
222000	224000	the connectivity
224000	226000	of neurons
226000	228000	There is another point
228000	230000	We want to see
230000	232000	the connection of
232000	234000	human behavior
234000	236000	For example,
236000	238000	their behavior
238000	240000	in clinical
240000	242000	or in cognitive science
244000	246000	I will talk about
246000	248000	functional connectivity later
248000	250000	I will talk about
250000	252000	functional connectivity later
252000	254000	For example,
254000	256000	some of you
256000	258000	have studied psychology
258000	260000	or cognitive science
260000	262000	You may have heard
262000	264000	some theory
264000	266000	I will give you some examples
266000	268000	The left one is called localization
268000	270000	In short,
270000	272000	scientists study
272000	274000	brain function
274000	276000	or human behavior
276000	278000	They want to
278000	280000	target some function
280000	282000	in a specific area
282000	284000	This is the result
284000	286000	of an FMRI
286000	288000	on the Internet
288000	290000	You can see
290000	292000	the three colored areas
292000	294000	It means that
294000	296000	when the subject is doing something
296000	298000	the neurons in these three areas
298000	300000	are active
300000	302000	This is a more traditional theory
302000	304000	They think
304000	306000	they need to
306000	308000	classify
308000	310000	which brain area
310000	312000	is responsible for which function
312000	314000	The other one is called
314000	316000	distributed brain networks
316000	318000	These two schools
318000	320000	have been fighting for a long time
320000	322000	But recently
322000	324000	because of some new research methods
324000	326000	most people think
326000	328000	this is more like the human brain we expect
328000	330000	In this new school
330000	332000	their focus
332000	334000	is not on studying
334000	336000	a single brain area
336000	338000	Instead,
338000	340000	they focus on
340000	342000	the function between
342000	344000	different brain areas
344000	346000	For example,
346000	348000	this brain area
348000	350000	may send a message
350000	352000	to this area
352000	354000	This area
354000	356000	may send a message
356000	358000	to this area
358000	360000	This area
360000	362000	may send a message
362000	364000	to this area
364000	366000	This is a way
366000	368000	for them to communicate
368000	370000	between neurons
370000	372000	This is a way
372000	374000	for them to communicate
374000	376000	between neurons
376000	378000	This is a way
378000	380000	for them to communicate
380000	382000	between neurons
382000	384000	About
384000	386000	how to study
386000	388000	and measure
388000	390000	functional connectivity
390000	392000	From statistics
392000	394000	from different areas
394000	396000	For example
396000	398000	This is a brain
398000	400000	Let's say
400000	402000	you have 3 regions
402000	404000	1,2,3
404000	406000	The blue, red, and green lines
406000	408000	The blue, red, and green lines
408000	410000	are the time course
410000	412000	are the time course
412000	414000	I'm using FMRI
414000	416000	This is the signal change
416000	418000	caused by the activation
418000	420000	of a neuron
420000	422000	FMRI is used as basic
422000	424000	FMRI is used as basic
424000	426000	ingredients for cooking
426000	428000	ingredients for cooking
428000	430000	When you get the signal
430000	432000	You can see the relation
432000	434000	between neurons
434000	436000	You can use different machines
436000	438000	You can use different machines
438000	440000	You can use different machines
440000	442000	You can use different machines
442000	444000	I used FMRI for my research
444000	446000	I used FMRI for my research
446000	448000	Every functional connectivity
448000	450000	I use FMRI for my research
450000	452000	I use FMRI for my research
452000	454000	Time series
454000	456000	I use FMRI for my research
456000	458000	If you have 3 regions
458000	460000	If you have 3 regions
460000	462000	The first step is
462000	464000	to extract the signal
464000	466000	You start sending signals
466000	468000	You start sending signals
468000	470000	using different methods
470000	472000	to estimate the relation
472000	474000	to 2-3 brain regions
474000	476000	to estimate the relation
476000	478000	If you use Pairwise Correlation
478000	480000	You will see a lot of values
480000	482000	For example
482000	484000	This represents
484000	486000	the relation between
486000	488000	Ri2 and Ri1
488000	490000	If they are positive
490000	492000	For example, this is about 0.5
492000	494000	For example, this is about 0.5
494000	496000	This means that this region
496000	498000	and this region are connected
498000	500000	and this region and this region are connected
500000	502000	Don't look at this
502000	504000	Don't look at this
504000	506000	It means that you and yourself are connected
506000	508000	It means that you and yourself are connected
508000	510000	But this is not a normal situation
510000	512000	This is because we are calculating
512000	514000	After we get this evidence
514000	516000	After we get this evidence
516000	518000	We will force the line to 0
518000	520000	We will force the line to 0
520000	522000	This is the way we use
522000	524000	This is the way we use
524000	526000	Of course, you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation
526000	528000	Of course, you shouldn't use Pairwise Correlation
528000	530000	Many people use different methods
530000	532000	For example, Partial Correlation, Mutual Information
532000	534000	Many people use different methods
534000	536000	There is no specific method
536000	538000	It depends on what you want to see
538000	540000	It depends on what you want to see
540000	542000	It depends on what you want to see
542000	544000	After that
544000	546000	After that
546000	548000	After we get this evidence
548000	550000	We will be curious
550000	552000	What are we going to do next
552000	554000	After we get this evidence
554000	556000	We will be curious
556000	558000	There are too many signals
558000	560000	There are too many signals
560000	562000	So, I am going to report on this data
562000	564000	So, I am going to report on this data
582000	584000	So we got the evidence
584000	586000	So we got the evidence
586000	588000	So we got the evidence
588000	590000	We have two main topics
590000	592000	Now we have two main topics
592000	594000	Dynamic Functional Connectivity
594000	596000	Dynamic Functional Connectivity
596000	598000	Let me answer a question
598000	600000	Let me answer a question
602000	604000	Let me tell you
604000	606000	If you have any questions
608000	610000	You can type it into the chat
610000	612000	You can type it into the chat
612000	614000	and I will find time to answer
614000	616000	Or I will tell you to check with the organization
616000	618000	Or I will tell you to check with the organization
618000	620000	And I will ask you the questions
620000	622000	Because I can't see the chat
622000	624000	Because I can't see the chat
624000	626000	So I don't know the questions
626000	628000	If you have any questions, you can ask
628000	630000	If you have any questions, you can ask
630000	632000	Before we talk about graph theory
632000	634000	Before we talk about graph theory
634000	636000	Do you have any questions?
636000	638000	Do you have any questions?
640000	642000	If not, let's continue
642000	644000	If not, let's continue
644000	646000	There is a little bit of abstraction
648000	650000	Let me try
650000	652000	Later we can continue to discuss
652000	654000	Later we can continue to discuss
658000	660000	It's intentional
660000	662000	Describing the relationship between two points
662000	664000	Describing the relationship between two points
664000	666000	Describing the relationship between two points
670000	672000	It is a very good tool
672000	674000	If you use graph theory
674000	676000	You can get a lot of different values
676000	678000	Each value represents a specific feature of the network
678000	680000	Each value represents a specific feature of the network
680000	682000	For example
682000	684000	We'll talk about some different values later
684000	686000	Some values may represent
686000	688000	How well the signal is integrated in the entire brain
688000	690000	How well the signal is integrated in the entire brain
690000	692000	Or how well it is integrated in a single system
696000	698000	So there will be some different messages
698000	700000	So there will be some different messages
700000	702000	When you do graph theory
702000	704000	There are two things that are very important
704000	706000	These are the two files you must get
706000	708000	The first one is Node
708000	710000	The other one is Edge
710000	712000	Node is our so-called region of interest
712000	714000	For example, on the right
714000	716000	This is the data obtained by the actual receiver
716000	718000	I have 36
718000	720000	I have 36
720000	722000	So there are 36 areas of the brain
722000	724000	So there are 36 areas of the brain
724000	726000	So there are 36 areas of the brain
726000	728000	So there are 36 areas of the brain
728000	730000	One point to remember
730000	732000	One point to remember
732000	734000	Each of those 36 types of dots
734000	736000	Each of those 36 types of dots
736000	738000	Each of those 36 types of dots
738000	740000	Each of those 36 types of dots
740000	742000	Each of these 36 types of dots
742000	746000	Each of those 36 types of dots
746000	748000	Every one of those 38 dots
748000	752000	Every one of those 38 dots
842000	856000	Integration
856000	864000	Segregation

2041000	2044000	The patient will be sent to the center of the machine.
2044000	2047000	Because the magnetic field in the center is more stable.
2047000	2050000	Then we start scanning.
2050000	2052000	One thing you need to know is that
2052000	2054000	MRI has a very loud noise.
2054000	2057000	So we put earplugs on the patient.
2057000	2059000	To protect their hearing.
2059000	2061000	In addition, it is a magnetic field.
2061000	2064000	So there can't be any metal objects on the body.
2064000	2066000	For example, keys, wallets, rings, etc.
2066000	2067000	All have to be taken down.
2067000	2070000	Including women's underwear can also be brought in.
2070000	2073000	So we always ask the cleaner to change clothes.
2073000	2077000	This is the image we got.
2077000	2080000	In principle, we do this kind of thing.
2080000	2082000	We will scan two images.
2082000	2083000	The most basic.
2083000	2085000	One is called T1 Weighted Imaging.
2085000	2087000	This is to provide you a structural image.
2087000	2089000	You can see it clearly.
2089000	2091000	This image will tell you which one is which.
2091000	2093000	Gray is gray.
2093000	2095000	White is white.
2096000	2098000	The empty space in the middle is water.
2098000	2100000	There is a spinal cord.
2100000	2101000	Brain.
2101000	2103000	These two are eyeballs.
2103000	2104000	The middle is the air.
2104000	2109000	This image provides you with very clear structural information.
2109000	2112000	In addition, we will scan the functional imaging.
2112000	2113000	We call it Bolt Signal.
2113000	2114000	It is written here.
2116000	2118000	This image is physical observation.
2118000	2120000	If you don't deal with it, you can't see anything.
2120000	2123000	You can only see the middle is the CSF.
2124000	2127000	You can't clearly define the brain.
2127000	2129000	Or gray and white.
2129000	2131000	So when we analyze,
2131000	2133000	The most important thing is to analyze this image.
2137000	2139000	The principle of fMRI is quite complicated.
2139000	2141000	This is what I have found so far.
2141000	2144000	I have seen the simplest and most powerful picture.
2144000	2145000	I can introduce it to you.
2147000	2149000	When the neural source is active,
2149000	2152000	It needs oxygen, oxygen and blood.
2153000	2155000	Now the neural source is active.
2155000	2159000	The blood vessels near the neural source begin to increase blood flow.
2159000	2164000	Bring fresh oxygen blood cells to this place.
2164000	2168000	You will find a lot of fresh blood coming here.
2168000	2170000	Because oxygen needs to enter the neural source.
2170000	2172000	Fresh blood will come.
2172000	2175000	There are a lot of new oxygen here.
2176000	2181000	When the oxygen-blood-red and oxygen-blood-red interact,
2181000	2186000	We can generate a signal.
2186000	2189000	Because fMRI is a strong magnetic field.
2189000	2191000	We used to learn the Faraday's law.
2194000	2196000	Because of the change in the magnetic field, it will generate an electric signal.
2196000	2200000	It will be received by the current.
2201000	2205000	After a lot of image processing,
2205000	2209000	You will see this image.
2209000	2217000	Because of the imbalance of oxygen-blood-red and oxygen-blood-red,
2217000	2220000	It will generate a signal.
2220000	2223000	So the picture we just talked about,
2223000	2225000	The so-called Tom course,
2225000	2227000	It's this thing.
2227000	2229000	After we get this thing,
2229000	2232000	We can start the follow-up analysis.
2232000	2234000	Of course, the story is not that simple.
2234000	2237000	Because you can analyze from the signal to the magnetic field.
2237000	2239000	There are a lot of things to do in the middle.
2239000	2241000	For example, you have to correct the difference in time.
2241000	2243000	And then correct the space difference.
2243000	2246000	Sometimes the brain will move like this.
2246000	2248000	You can't just take the data and analyze it.
2248000	2250000	You have to correct these things first.
2250000	2252000	These things are called preprocessing.
2252000	2254000	I didn't talk too much today.
2254000	2258000	The main thing is to let you know that you have to correct the difference in time and space.
2258000	2260000	We will focus on the latter part.
2260000	2262000	How do you analyze them?
2262000	2264000	Wait a minute.
2264000	2268000	Did you have any questions about any image acquisition?
2268000	2270000	Can I ask a question?
2270000	2272000	Do you have any questions on the spot?
2272000	2275000	Did you get this picture on the spot?
2275000	2277000	You got this picture when you did it.
2277000	2279000	Then you turn it like this.
2280000	2284000	Then you turn it into this picture.
2284000	2287000	After sending this picture in, it will give you this.
2291000	2293000	You have to set a few points on the picture.
2293000	2295000	Then it will find it.
2295000	2297000	Otherwise, how do you know how many pictures are there?
2297000	2298000	Okay.
2298000	2303000	He asked if we get this picture from here to here.
2303000	2305000	Basically, how do you get there?
2305000	2307000	Yes.
2307000	2309000	Because I omitted a lot of things.
2309000	2313000	So I'm going to talk about it now.
2313000	2318000	If we process it in our lab, we will get this T1 and BOL signal.
2318000	2321000	Then we will throw T1 into a software called FreeSurfer.
2321000	2324000	The purpose is to do so-called cortical postulation.
2324000	2327000	That's why we get those R1, R2, R3, R4.
2327000	2335000	We take this T1, which means we label each brain area and give it an ID.
2335000	2340000	Then we do the pre-processing of the image obtained by the fMRI.
2340000	2347000	After the pre-processing, we have to put the T1 with the label and the pre-processed fMRI in place.
2347000	2351000	Because they say that the victim's head won't move too much.
2351000	2363000	But we still have to put these two images in place to ensure that the area we see on the T1 is the same area on the fMRI.
2363000	2365000	So this placement is very important.
2365000	2374000	After we put T1 and fMRI in place, we tell the software that we first define how many RIs you want from T1.
2374000	2378000	If there are 100, I tell the computer that I want 90.
2378000	2381000	Then I list all the 90 IDs.
2381000	2386000	There is a step called Time Course Extraction.
2386000	2393000	After we put these two IDs in place, I tell the software to extract the time course of the 90 RIs.
2393000	2395000	For example, the first RI is here.
2395000	2399000	I extract the time course of this RI.
2399000	2401000	The second RI is here.
2401000	2403000	I extract the time course of this RI.
2403000	2405000	It's like this.
2405000	2409000	How big is the RI?
2409000	2414000	It depends on how you do the protocol postulation.
2414000	2421000	Basically, the resolution of this RI is 1x1x1 mm.
2421000	2424000	But some areas are bigger.
2424000	2429000	For example, if you have a prefrontal cortex, it's very big.
2429000	2433000	But if you have a very small one, the anterior cingulate cortex will be smaller.
2433000	2436000	So it doesn't necessarily depend on the area of your brain.
2436000	2441000	So what do you usually decide to look at?
2441000	2444000	This is a very tricky question.
2444000	2449000	If you look at this area, you will find that this area has not changed at all.
2449000	2451000	It's just floating in another area.
2451000	2452000	Yes.
2452000	2455000	So now most people tend to use it.
2455000	2460000	It's a bit like looking at how many brain areas you have when you do postulation.
2460000	2465000	Usually, at least 90 or more.
2465000	2468000	I know there are more than 100 in FreeSurfer.
2468000	2471000	A lot of people take out more than 100 brain areas.
2471000	2473000	Because they don't know which one they want to look at.
2473000	2475000	So they just take out all the information about the brain areas.
2475000	2477000	Some people are very specific.
2477000	2479000	They have their assumptions.
2479000	2483000	They think which brain area has a special relationship with which brain area they want to look at.
2483000	2488000	Then they will have a purpose to choose those brain areas first.
2488000	2492000	Indeed, at the beginning, when you are writing articles,
2492000	2497000	the question that often comes back is why you choose these brain areas.
2497000	2501000	So now, I think it's better to avoid this question.
2501000	2504000	Plus, you really don't know where the changes are.
2504000	2506000	So you use all the brain areas.
2506000	2509000	So is it a problem that you already have?
2509000	2512000	Or is it a problem that you already have?
2512000	2516000	Or is it a problem that you already have?
2516000	2519000	Oh, I found that these PhD students have a lot of questions.
2519000	2526000	In fact, it should be said that we already have different software and different templates.
2526000	2528000	You will get different brain areas.
2528000	2533000	In fact, this is a big problem in video editing.
2533000	2539000	Generally speaking, my answer is that we will have a defined brain area.
2539000	2541000	For example, you use FreeSurfer.
2541000	2545000	Then you will definitely know which brain areas you can find in FreeSurfer.
2545000	2547000	This is a long list.
2547000	2551000	Then we will say that we want these brain areas in that list.
2551000	2553000	There is another one called AAL.
2553000	2555000	This is another template.
2555000	2556000	This is another software.
2556000	2559000	If you write an article and say that this is an AAL template.
2559000	2561000	Then we probably know which brain areas.
2561000	2565000	In principle, I don't think they are much different.
2565000	2569000	But there are a lot of people who specialize in the so-called postulation.
2569000	2574000	They will tell you which different templates will have which different shortcomings.
2574000	2579000	Then last year, I don't know if you have seen that report.
2579000	2582000	There was a paper in Nature last year.
2583000	2586000	There is a Human Connectome Project in the United States.
2586000	2588000	They scanned thousands of people.
2588000	2592000	Then they used the data of those thousands of people.
2592000	2595000	Then at the same time, it also contains different modalities.
2595000	2598000	For example, there is a functional image of MIT1.
2598000	2602000	There is also T2 or Proton Density Modeling.
2602000	2603000	There are many different images.
2603000	2605000	They put all the modalities together.
2605000	2609000	Use all these modalities to build another template.
2610000	2615000	My impression is that there are more than 100 brain areas than we currently know.
2615000	2618000	It seems to be more than 200.
2618000	2622000	So how do you define your brain area?
2622000	2624000	It's a bit tricky.
2624000	2627000	At present, we can only say which template you use.
2627000	2628000	Or if you use which software.
2628000	2632000	We probably know what your so-called brain areas are.
2632000	2634000	Is there any other questions?
2634000	2640000	For example, if the area is large or small,
2640000	2641000	you can set it to large or small.
2641000	2644000	For example, if the signal is very strong when you are small,
2644000	2646000	but when you are large,
2646000	2648000	you have to remove the signal.
2648000	2649000	Yes, there is.
2649000	2652000	This is what I don't believe.
2652000	2654000	For example, there are some things in the brain area
2654000	2656000	where the signal is very, very bad.
2656000	2659000	Because it just intersects with the air.
2659000	2661000	In fact, you can see it in this image.
2661000	2663000	You can see that there is still a brain area here.
2663000	2664000	This is the prefrontal cortex.
2664000	2669000	But it's already close to the sinus, the air area.
2669000	2671000	In T1, it looks okay.
2671000	2673000	But in FMR, you can see that it's super bad.
2673000	2676000	Half of the frontal area is gone.
2676000	2678000	For example, in the frontal area,
2678000	2680000	there are some very small areas, such as the frontal pole.
2680000	2682000	That area is very small.
2682000	2683000	And it's close to the air.
2683000	2686000	So the signal under FMR is super bad.
2686000	2690000	Usually, I don't look at that area.
2690000	2692000	If your signal is already bad,
2692000	2696000	and you find out that it's mutating,
2696000	2697000	what do you say?
2697000	2702000	Is it really caused by the difference in the vital signs of the nervous system?
2702000	2704000	Or is it because your own signal is bad?
2704000	2708000	So my approach is to put those too small areas
2708000	2711000	or in those areas where the signal is unclear.
2711000	2712000	I don't want those areas.
2712000	2718000	Which areas are often unclear when you draw like this?
2718000	2719000	Frontal
2719000	2720000	The closest to the frontal area
2720000	2721000	is the frontal area.
2721000	2723000	Because it's too close to the air.
2723000	2726000	There will be a so-called partial volume effect.
2726000	2727000	If you look at this picture,
2727000	2729000	the signal is bad in the front area.
2729000	2732000	And there's an area near here called the orbital frontal cortex.
2732000	2734000	It's close to the nasal cavity.
2734000	2736000	There's a lot of air there, so the signal is bad.
2736000	2738000	And the other area is the temporal pole.
2738000	2740000	It's at the tip of the temporal area.
2740000	2743000	And there's the inferior temporal cortex.
2743000	2745000	It's at the bottom of the temporal area.
2745000	2748000	Because it's close to the skull base.
2748000	2749000	So in those areas,
2749000	2754000	if I actually see the whole data sharing,
2754000	2756000	and find that there's an important change in the location,
2756000	2758000	I'll be a little hesitant.
2758000	2761000	And then I'll go back and see if my image blurring is good or not.
2761000	2763000	And then I'll decide whether to believe it or not.
2765000	2766000	Okay, anything else?
2768000	2769000	Okay, let's move on.
2769000	2770000	Okay, this is a little bit...
2770000	2772000	You have to be patient.
2772000	2774000	Because this is a little bit complicated.
2774000	2776000	This is the background I was talking about earlier.
2776000	2778000	The background for this experiment.
2778000	2782000	Now I'm going to talk about how to use it for this experiment.
2782000	2784000	And then you'll see...
2784000	2787000	First of all, I'm going to talk about dynamic functional connectivity.
2787000	2788000	I use sliding window.
2788000	2790000	This blue is the so-called fMRI timecord.
2790000	2792000	That's what we've been talking about.
2792000	2794000	When you're doing a sliding window,
2794000	2795000	the most important thing,
2795000	2798000	the first step is to define your so-called window length.
2798000	2802000	Which is how big your window is.
2802000	2804000	I'm using 20 time points here.
2804000	2806000	That is to say, I only need...
2806000	2810000	I only have the first 20 time points.
2810000	2812000	And then I'll do correlation.
2812000	2814000	I'm using Pearson's correlation here.
2814000	2816000	And then I'll get a matrix.
2816000	2818000	And this matrix represents...
2818000	2821000	I have 54 ROI here.
2821000	2824000	It represents the relationship between these 54 ROI.
2824000	2827000	And then I'm going to move my window forward.
2827000	2828000	Just one time point.
2828000	2831000	And do the same thing and you'll get the second matrix.
2831000	2832000	Wait a minute.
2832000	2834000	How long is a time point usually?
2834000	2837000	Oh, it depends on your MRI scan parameters.
2837000	2839000	We have two seconds here.
2840000	2842000	And then you just keep doing the same thing.
2842000	2846000	Until you've used up all the fMRI timecords.
2846000	2850000	I have a total of 221 window correlation matrices here.
2850000	2853000	And then the next very important thing is...
2853000	2855000	I've got so many matrices.
2855000	2857000	But not all of them are the same.
2857000	2861000	So how am I going to report their variability?
2861000	2864000	So we've calculated seven...
2864000	2866000	I call them network features.
2866000	2870000	According to these matrices,
2870000	2872000	I'm going to calculate some numbers.
2872000	2875000	And each number represents variability.
2875000	2877000	For example, the first one.
2877000	2879000	I call it network variation.
2879000	2880000	The first one is very simple.
2880000	2882000	In fact, we want to see the overall variability.
2882000	2886000	So let's just take the first one and the second one.
2886000	2890000	Take all the numbers in the matrix and subtract them.
2890000	2895000	And then do the same thing for each of the 221 matrices.
2895000	2896000	On average.
2896000	2899000	So the number we get is a bit like...
2899000	2905000	On average, the variability of your entire brain's connectivity.
2905000	2908000	And then the second one is called network power.
2908000	2909000	This is actually very simple.
2909000	2912000	It's mainly about adding up all the connectivity values.
2912000	2913000	On average.
2913000	2916000	And the purpose of this is to get...
2916000	2917000	It's a bit like...
2917000	2920000	On average, the strength of your connectivity.
2920000	2925000	And then these are very similar from C to G and A.
2925000	2926000	But the difference is...
2926000	2929000	A is measuring all the numbers in the whole brain.
2929000	2933000	All the elements in this matrix.
2933000	2938000	But C to G is for a specific connection.
2938000	2941000	For example, this is called Inter-Hemisphere Connection.
2941000	2945000	We only calculate the connection between the opposite brain areas.
2945000	2948000	And then this is Cross-Hemisphere.
2948000	2951000	And then this is Within-Hemisphere.
2951000	2953000	It's on the same side.
2953000	2956000	And then we divide it into the left and the right.
2956000	2959000	So you can see that the mathematics is actually quite similar.
2959000	2962000	It's just that when we calculate C to G.
2962000	2965000	The value we get is...
2965000	2968000	For example, when we calculate C, we take the right-angled line.
2968000	2973000	Because the right-angled line represents the connectivity from left to right.
2973000	2974000	And then...
2974000	2977000	This is how the sliding window runs.
2977000	2979000	What about the other graph theory?
2979000	2982000	I made it a little fancier here.
2982000	2984000	I have a little bit of a graph theory.
2984000	2987000	Combine the two sliding windows together.
2987000	2990000	So in the front, you'll find that it's exactly the same as the sliding window.
2990000	2992000	It's all the same until this step.
2992000	2995000	The difference is that after I got this matrix.
2995000	2998000	I didn't just add or subtract it.
2998000	3001000	Do some processing to calculate the so-called network feature.
3001000	3004000	But I first apply a threshold.
3004000	3006000	Above a certain threshold.
3006000	3008000	I think these connections are real connections.
3008000	3011000	There's no miscommunication under this threshold.
3011000	3016000	And then I'm going to throw this threshold edge.
3016000	3019000	There's something called Brain Connectivity Toolbox.
3019000	3021000	This is a free download on the Internet.
3022000	3024000	It's a graph theory.
3024000	3026000	After I throw it into the graph theory.
3026000	3030000	I'll get two global features in each window.
3030000	3031000	And a local measure.
3031000	3033000	In fact, you can get more.
3033000	3035000	I'm just using these three for now.
3035000	3037000	The so-called global measure is.
3037000	3040000	One subject will have one number.
3040000	3041000	The local measure is.
3041000	3043000	It depends on how many RRIs it has.
3043000	3044000	How many numbers will there be?
3044000	3048000	And then I'm going to have 221 sets.
3048000	3051000	Then there are three numbers in each window.
3051000	3053000	This is a bit complicated.
3053000	3055000	But in a nutshell.
3055000	3056000	It's a different way.
3056000	3058000	I got a lot of different numbers.
3058000	3059000	Or so-called network features.
3059000	3062000	Then the point is to look at the patient.
3062000	3065000	What's the difference between normal control and normal control?
3065000	3068000	And then the next one.
3068000	3069000	Okay.
3069000	3071000	Actually, this is a little bit.
3075000	3077000	Is there a problem?
3078000	3079000	It's okay. I'm going to ask this one.
3079000	3080000	Now you have it.
3080000	3081000	You can keep talking.
3081000	3082000	Don't talk to me.
3082000	3083000	Okay.
3083000	3084000	Okay.
3084000	3085000	It's okay.
3085000	3087000	After the analysis of the RRIs.
3087000	3089000	We got the so-called numbers.
3089000	3090000	These are the ones.
3090000	3092000	When we use the sliding window.
3092000	3094000	We'll get the power of the network variation.
3094000	3098000	And then the specific connections I just mentioned.
3098000	3100000	This is inter-hemisphere.
3100000	3102000	And then this is cross-hemisphere.
3102000	3104000	And in the same brain.
3104000	3106000	In the same brain.
3106000	3108000	And then there's the left and the right.
3108000	3109000	The so-called flexibility.
3109000	3110000	It's actually what we're going to do.
3110000	3112000	The number of correlations.
3112000	3114000	The number of correlations between the two windows.
3114000	3115000	Two minus.
3115000	3116000	And then on average.
3116000	3120000	So these are the numbers in the sliding window.
3120000	3121000	If the number is higher.
3121000	3124000	It means that his connectivity is more dynamic.
3124000	3126000	The more mutable, the bigger.
3126000	3129000	And then dynamic graphical approach.
3129000	3130000	That's what we just talked about.
3130000	3133000	Combined graph theory and sliding window.
3133000	3135000	It's the same global feature.
3135000	3136000	I have two.
3136000	3137000	One is called global efficiency.
3137000	3139000	One is called modularity.
3139000	3141000	It's a little hard to explain here.
3141000	3142000	I'll try to explain it.
3142000	3143000	I can't explain it.
3143000	3144000	If it's not clear.
3144000	3147000	Maybe you need to check that.
3147000	3149000	I'll show you a paper later.
3149000	3151000	There may be a complete one in there.
3151000	3152000	There's a complete math.
3152000	3153000	It's easier to understand.
3153000	3155000	In short, global efficiency.
3155000	3157000	The way it's calculated.
3157000	3161000	The shortest distance between these two points.
3161000	3164000	Make them equal.
3164000	3165000	Do the math first.
3165000	3166000	And then on average.
3166000	3169000	This global efficiency represents.
3169000	3173000	The information of the entire neural network.
3173000	3174000	In the whole brain.
3174000	3176000	How well is it integrated?
3176000	3180000	So it's also an indicator of integration.
3180000	3182000	Modularity is just the opposite.
3182000	3184000	It's an indicator of segregation.
3184000	3187000	Modularity is actually.
3187000	3189000	Under this network.
3190000	3192000	Will this network be.
3192000	3195000	Will it be divided into several different.
3195000	3197000	Small networks.
3197000	3201000	It's an indicator of segregation.
3201000	3203000	This means.
3203000	3205000	If the modularity value is higher.
3205000	3206000	It means.
3206000	3207000	Its signal.
3207000	3210000	In a single system.
3210000	3211000	It's better to be integrated.
3211000	3213000	These two points are the opposite.
3213000	3215000	Integration and segregation.
3215000	3217000	Another local measure.
3217000	3218000	Betweenness centrality.
3218000	3220000	In short.
3220000	3222000	You calculate this brain.
3222000	3223000	Brain area.
3223000	3224000	This RRI.
3224000	3226000	How important is it in the entire neural network?
3226000	3227000	That is to say.
3227000	3229000	How many.
3229000	3231000	The shortest path.
3231000	3233000	Through this brain.
3233000	3234000	This brain area.
3234000	3235000	This RRI.
3235000	3237000	If this number is higher.
3237000	3238000	It means.
3238000	3239000	This brain area is more important.
3239000	3240000	It could be.
3240000	3242000	The hubs we just talked about.
3242000	3244000	With these numbers.
3244000	3245000	The first thing we do.
3245000	3246000	Is to see.
3246000	3249000	What's the difference between the patient and the PD patient?
3249000	3250000	And the other is.
3250000	3251000	These values.
3251000	3253000	Do a forward return with the clinical indicator.
3253000	3255000	See what happens.
3255000	3257000	Then.
3257000	3258000	Next.
3259000	3260000	it is good.
3261000	3263000	I want to test the bed.
3263000	3265000	I'm here.
3265000	3266000	This is the result.
3266000	3267000	I can tell you.
3267000	3269000	If it's just a two-sample t-test.
3269000	3271000	I can't see any difference.
3271000	3273000	Between patients and normal people.
3273000	3274000	Those.
3274000	3276000	There is no difference at all.
3276000	3277000	But we do.
3277000	3278000	Simple.
3278000	3280000	When it's Pearson's correlation.
3280000	3281000	You can find out.
3281000	3282000	This is.
3282000	3283000	Sliding window.
3283000	3285000	The result of dynamic connectivity.
3285000	3287000	You can find out.
3287000	3289000	Let's look at the above two.
3289000	3290000	It's the age.
3290000	3291000	With the network power.
3291000	3292000	And.
3292000	3293000	I put a small picture.
3293000	3294000	You can know which one it is.
3294000	3295000	Connection.
3295000	3296000	Inter-Hermitian connectivity.
3296000	3297000	It's related.
3297000	3299000	But I can tell you first.
3299000	3301000	I think this is actually more like.
3301000	3303000	Normal human aging.
3303000	3304000	Will be produced.
3304000	3305000	Because I.
3305000	3307000	I see this on Parkinson's disease patients.
3307000	3309000	But I also see it on normal people.
3309000	3310000	So this.
3310000	3312000	We won't do so much discussion for the time being.
3312000	3313000	And then.
3313000	3314000	But.
3314000	3315000	This is more interesting.
3315000	3316000	This is that.
3316000	3317000	Postural instability.
3317000	3318000	Get disorder.
3318000	3319000	It's their balance.
3319000	3320000	Physical coordination.
3320000	3321000	That number.
3321000	3322000	With.
3322000	3323000	Enter.
3323000	3324000	On the right.
3324000	3325000	This.
3325000	3326000	This is the right.
3326000	3329000	Dynamic functional connectivity.
3329000	3330000	It's related to them.
3330000	3331000	That is to say.
3331000	3332000	The more serious the patient.
3332000	3333000	His right connectivity.
3333000	3334000	More.
3334000	3335000	Uh.
3335000	3336000	Stiff.
3336000	3337000	Can't.
3337000	3338000	Uh.
3338000	3339000	Change.
3339000	3340000	And then.
3340000	3341000	This is the dose of the drug.
3341000	3342000	It's the same.
3342000	3343000	When the dose of the drug.
3343000	3344000	When the higher.
3344000	3345000	They are also.
3345000	3346000	With.
3346000	3347000	Like.
3347000	3348000	They are.
3348000	3349000	Uh.
3349000	3350000	Crossing two brains.
3350000	3351000	This connectivity is also more rigid.
3351000	3352000	You can find.
3352000	3353000	In this way.
3353000	3354000	If based on these two.
3354000	3355000	If the relationship.
3355000	3356000	We can roughly think.
3356000	3357000	Uh.
3357000	3358000	Parkinson's disease.
3358000	3359000	The patient.
3359000	3360000	Their.
3360000	3361000	Uh.
3361000	3362000	Uh.
3362000	3363000	The.
3363000	3364000	Uh.
3364000	3365000	Uh.
3365000	3366000	Uh.
3366000	3367000	Yeah.
3367000	3368000	Uh.
3368000	3369000	This is.
3369000	3370000	Paras.
3370000	3371000	Uh.
3371000	3372000	Uh.
3372000	3373000	Uh.
3373000	3374000	Uh.
3374000	3380000	In the way.
3380000	3381000	It is.
3381000	3382000	Paras.
3382000	3383000	Uh.
3383000	3384000	Uh.
3384000	3385000	Uh.
3385000	3386000	Uh.
3386000	3387000	Uh.
3387000	3388000	Uh.
3388000	3389000	Uh.
3389000	3390000	Uh.
3390000	3391000	Uh.
3391000	3392000	Uh.
3392000	3394000	Uh.
3394000	3395000	Uh.
3395000	3396000	Uh.
3396000	3397000	Uh.
3397000	3398000	Paras.
