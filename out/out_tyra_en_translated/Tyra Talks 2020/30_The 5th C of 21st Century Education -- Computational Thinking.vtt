00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Welcome everyone to today's presentation.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Today's speaker is Joey Huang.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
We are very honored to invite him to give this presentation.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Let me briefly introduce today's speaker.

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
Joey Huang is currently a postdoc in the School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
She received her Ph.D. in Learning and Developmental Sciences from Indiana University, Bloomington.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
Coming from a background of educational psychology and computing, her research focuses on computational thinking, collaboration, and STEM learning.

00:48.000 --> 00:59.000
As a learning scientist by training, she aims to create more interesting and inspiring learning environments to promote equity and collaboration.

00:59.000 --> 01:17.000
Today's topic is the 5th C of 21st Century Education, Computational Thinking.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Without further ado, I will hand over to Joey Huang.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the chat area.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I will forward the questions to him.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Now I will ask him to start his presentation.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Thank you for your introduction, Haoran.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Has everyone seen my screen?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Thank you.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the chat area.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I can't see most of you right now.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Most of you didn't turn on the video.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
It's okay.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
As long as you can see me.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the chat area.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the chat area.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
As I mentioned, I am a PhD student at UCI.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
I have three main purposes for this presentation.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
I hope you can take this with you when you listen to it.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
First, this presentation will provide you with a basic idea of computational thinking.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
What is computational thinking?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Why do we need to care about it?

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Second, I hope you can take this with you when you listen to this presentation.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
You will experience the process of computational thinking.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
You will interact with each other.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Not interacting with each other.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I will give you a little experience.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Lastly, I hope you can take it easy.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Whether it's morning, afternoon, or evening.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
No matter where you are.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Thank you for coming today.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
I am happy to share this topic with you.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
This is my first time presenting my research in Chinese.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
It's a new experience for me.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
I don't think there are many people studying education or learning sciences in this group.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I hope you can take this with you when you listen to this presentation.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
You can also interact with each other.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
First, I will talk about computational thinking.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
It's called computational thinking in English.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
This is the 25th century education's 5th C.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
What is the 5th C?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
It means that there are 4 Cs in front of me.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
The 4 Cs in front of me come from a partnership for 21st century learning.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
It's a P21, a non-profit organization in the US.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
It's a collaborative research organization with a research team.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
There are 4 Cs in front of me.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Can you guess what the other 4 Cs are?

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, and Creativity.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Why is computational thinking the 5th C?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Next slide.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Let's talk about why we talk about computational thinking.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
The so-called question is often used in our research.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
People will say that it sounds good.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
So what?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
So why do we talk about it?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's talk about AI first.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Artificial Intelligence.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
I don't know if you have seen the Westworld documentary.

04:46.000 --> 04:58.000
It's a documentary about how humans interact with AI.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Hello, I can see the chat.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
If you don't have any questions, just type them in the chat.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I can see them.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
On the left, you can see a robot's hand.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
On the right, you can see a human's hand.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
This documentary is a bit exaggerated.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
If you look at it realistically,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
you may have heard that

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
some jobs will be replaced in the next few years.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Or some jobs will no longer exist.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
The professor is being discussed.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
My opinion is that

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
it's hard to replace the professor.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
He has a meaning.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
But teaching is dangerous.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
So in the future,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
there may be robots in classrooms

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
from K-12 to kindergarten.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
There may be robots in classrooms from 4 to 18.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
They will assist teachers and students.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
This development is not only a global trend.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I will use the United States as an example.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
This is a comment from the Wall Street Journal.

06:10.000 --> 06:19.000
This is a report from NSF this year.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
In August this year,

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
NSF was the first round of AI institutes.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
There are more than 20 million institutes.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
In the next five years,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
they will use this fund to develop different AI projects.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Some of these projects are related to the future of work.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Some of them are related to education.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Most of them are discussing

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
how to make AI more advanced.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
On the other hand,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
it's a bit like a turning point in education.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
How do we better prepare our next generation

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
to face this world?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
If you are interested,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
I will share all the resources at the end of the slide.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Now I have answered the question about digitalization.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
After all,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I want to talk about

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
the relationship between AI and technology.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
When I was young,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I may have revealed my age.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
When I was young,

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
the first day of computer class,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
the teacher taught me how to turn on and off.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Nowadays,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
every child has an iPad.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
In class,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
everyone uses an iPad with a computer,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
or the iPad is directly integrated into the class.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
This is very common.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
In fact,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
we have never experienced

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
such a technology-heavy age.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
In fact,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
this turning point,

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
knowledge loss,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
and experience

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
are all important in education.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
So it's not just about the development of AI.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
What is computational thinking?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
If we all agree that

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
computational thinking is an important concept,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
let's talk about the history of computational thinking.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
The history of computation

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
can be traced back to the 19th century.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
In the 20th century,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
in 1962,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Alan Perlis, a computer scientist,

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
said that

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
programming is not just a skill.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
It can be seen as a theory of computation.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
This skill can be applied to other subjects

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
through a way of practicing and thinking.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
So he started programming

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
beyond just a keyboard search.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
It connects to the thinking of human beings.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
It's a breakthrough.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
But he didn't talk about it later.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Then it continued to develop

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
until Pepper and Harrell in 1991,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
which is about 20 centuries later.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Their first term,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
this researcher,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
if you are in education,

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
you are familiar with it.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
There is a theory called constructionism.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
It's Simon Pepper.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Based on MIT Media Lab,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
they invented a program

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
called Logo Computation

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
for children to learn.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
It's a language for learning programming.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Looking back,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
you might think

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
it's a very low-resolution,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
and it's just a turtle

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
that teaches you how to draw shapes.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
But in 1991,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
it was a breakthrough.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So Simon Pepper

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
was the pioneer of constructionism.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
He emphasized learning from doing,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
gaining knowledge from doing.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So he was the first to

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
combine the terms

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
computation and thinking.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
He published this article.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
As for computational thinking,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
in his research in 1991,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
he didn't discuss it in depth.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
He just mentioned

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
this is computational thinking.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Computational thinking

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
became very popular

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
in 2006.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
A woman named Jeanette Wing,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
a computer scientist.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
She published a...

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Here's a screenshot.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
If you're interested,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
you can read it.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
This is what she said.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
She said computational thinking involves

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
solving problems,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
defining systems,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
and understanding human behavior

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
by drawing on the concepts

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
of fundamental to computer science.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
So she emphasized

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
what computational thinking is.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
She started to define it.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
She said it involves

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
defining systems,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
understanding human behavior,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
and using computational thinking

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
as a foundation

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
in computer science

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
to look at the world.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
This research

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
now has over 6,000 citations.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Almost 7,000.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
From 2006 to now,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
she was the first

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
to promote computational thinking

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
beyond just computation.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
It became a way of thinking

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
to look at the world.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
She also said

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
this skill becomes

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
the foundation

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
of reading,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
computing, and writing.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
In the 21st century,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
we're still pushing this concept.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
What is computational thinking

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
and how do we implement it?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
In general,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
computational thinking

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
can be divided into

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
logic,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
inference,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
calculation,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and pattern recognition.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I don't know if you've

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
ever done that kind of

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
intelligence test.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It usually has no words.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
It has a series of

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
logic for you to

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
infer what the answer is.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
This is just

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
one part of computational thinking.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
At the same time,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
you need to know how to

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
break down the problem

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
into different parts.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
How to solve the problem,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
guess, and then re-do it.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Abstraction is a more abstract concept.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
It's also called abstract.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
It's a more abstract concept.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
It's about how to think

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
in a higher level.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Before you solve the problem,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
you need to think

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
in a higher level.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
It's a bit like

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
if I want to design

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
a system today,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
what do I suppose it will

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
encounter?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
What do I need to solve?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
These are all important concepts

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
in computational thinking.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Currently,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
there are a few steps

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
in computational thinking.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
These are all actions.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
You can see it from

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
tinkering,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
or designing something,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
or solving a problem,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
or cooperating with others.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
These are all

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
the ways you can see

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
how computational thinking

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
occurs.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
When you are doing these

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
things,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
you may apply these

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
actions in computational thinking.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Today, I will use my research

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
as an example.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
My research focuses on

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
collaborating.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I will talk more

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
about this later.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
To sum up,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
computational thinking

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
includes a series of

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
problem-solving processes,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
such as recognizing patterns,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
systematically breaking down

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
the problem,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
or composing an algorithmic

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
solution.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
These are all part of

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
computational thinking.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
You can see that

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
this definition is very broad.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It's like,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
do I know how to program?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Do I know how to do computational thinking?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
For example,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I go to the supermarket

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
and list my food list.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Which side is which session?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
If I can do this

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
grocery shopping

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
in the fastest way,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
do I know how to do

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
computational thinking?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
For example,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
if I need to buy all these

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
in 10 minutes,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
do I know how to do

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
computational thinking

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
in the shortest way?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
These are all part of

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
computational thinking.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's been 14 years

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
since 2006.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
This field is not

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
well defined yet.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
This is our Bible.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Computational thinking

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
is still being discussed

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
and challenged.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
So, if you know

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
what computational thinking is,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
and analyze it with your expertise,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I think it will be very helpful

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
in this field.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Now, I will talk about

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
some organizations

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
with high credibility

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
and start

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
to define computational thinking.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
There are three of them.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
One is

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
CSTA,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
which stands for

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Center for Teaching Education

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
in the United States.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Another one is

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
ISTE,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
which stands for

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
International Society for

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Technology in Education.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It's a big organization

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
that not only deals with

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
computational thinking,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
but also all the applications

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
of technology in education.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
This framework is relatively new

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
compared to the other two.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
But these three organizations

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
have their own standards

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
and applications

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
for computational thinking.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
The curriculum and skills

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
they need

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
are already solid

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
and are being

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
implemented in education.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I will talk more about

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
how I study

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
computational thinking

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
in a moment.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
The framework I use

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
is from Brandon and Resnick.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Brandon is a professor

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
at Harvard Education.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Resnick is a professor

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
at MIT Media Lab.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
My advisor and my lab

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
have cooperated with them.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
This framework is

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
highly credible

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and is a group of people

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
who study and explain

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
computational thinking.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
You are welcome to discuss

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
this framework.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
If you have other

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
credible frameworks,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
you are welcome to talk about it.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Let me talk about

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
the definition of computational thinking.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I will give you

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
a clearer picture.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
If you look at the left side of the picture,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
you will see the definition of

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
the wide field.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
The right side is the definition of the narrow field.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You can divide

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
computational thinking into

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
a group of people who believe

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
humans and computers

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
can be computational agents.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
This means they believe

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
computational thinking

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
can exist outside of programming.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
For example,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
the example of grocery shopping.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
If you are in this group,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
you will think this is true.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
The example below is a weaving example.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I don't know if you like

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
weaving or knitting.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Whether it is a sweater,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
a sock, or a basket.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
There is a group of people

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
who are studying

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
the process of weaving.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I have a lot of logical thinking to look at.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
If you look at

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
some of the original works,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
you can see that their patterns

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
are very complicated.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
If you want to make these patterns by hand,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
there is a lot of complicated thinking

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
involved.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
There is a group of people

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
who believe that computational thinking

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
can be found in these places

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
and can be applied.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
They will do this series of research.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
The middle group of people

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
believe that computers

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
are computational agents.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
They did not completely exclude humans,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
but they did not completely agree.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
They basically believe

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
that computational systems

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
can be applied

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
outside of

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
programming and CS.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
It can also be benefited

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
by other subjects.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
They are more neutral.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
On the far right is a more narrow definition.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
They believe that humans

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
are not computational agents.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
More importantly,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
below this,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
we can't

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
do it.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Computational thinking is completely CS.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
If I am not a CS person,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I will not be benefited

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
by this.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
We can say that they are conservative.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Not everyone needs it.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Most people are discussing

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
these three groups.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
You can choose which group you are

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
or which one you think is right.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
There is no right or wrong.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It depends on your field

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
and your training and background

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
to train your method.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
My research is more

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
towards the middle and left

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
wide definition.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I will talk more about

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
my research in the future.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Before I talk about my research,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I want to provide you

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
a summary of

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
K-12 education

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
from kindergarten to

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
high school,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
from 4 to 18 years old.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
If you are in Taiwan,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
you are welcome to tell me

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
what CS education is like

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
in Taiwan.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I have done some research.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I want to know

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
if you are in Taiwan

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
or you have friends in Taiwan

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
who are doing this.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
In the US,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
this report is very new.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It was just released

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
this month.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
It is from Coda.org,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
CSTA, ECEP,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Alliance.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I will not go into details.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
It is a report with credibility.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
It is related to CS education

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
every year.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
This report was just released this month.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You can see on the upper left,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
CS standards

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
from 2017 to 2020,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
from 6 states to

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
37 states,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
all have K-12 CS standards.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
If we have standards,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
we need a teacher.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Teachers need to have the ability

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
to teach students.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
You may find that

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
in the classroom,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
teachers become

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
a weak point of knowledge.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Students use technology

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
too fast.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
They already know these things.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Teachers can't keep up

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
with students.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
This is like another topic.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
We can discuss the relationship

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
between teachers and students.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
If we go back to

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
the main topic,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
CS teacher certification

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
has been implemented

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
in 40 states.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It means that

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
if you graduate from a university,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
or get another degree,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
you can get the certification.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Then you can start teaching

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
CS in K-12.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
The last chart

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
shows the percentage

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
of students

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
who start teaching CS

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
in public schools.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Each state is different.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
This chart shows

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
47 states.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
This is all public schools,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
not all high schools.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
All public schools teach computer science.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Let's go back to the chart.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
You can see that

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
more than 50%

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
of students

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
are still in development.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Haoran introduced me

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
to Indiana.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I'm in California now.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
In addition to Indiana,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
California also has

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
more than 50% of students.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
You can see

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
where you are.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
This information

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
explains

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
that

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
less than half of

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
public schools

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
teach computer science

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
in the U.S.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
In addition,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
less than 50%

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
of students

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
are from

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
rural areas,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
low social status,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
and underrepresented groups.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
These people

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
are less likely

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
to take CS classes.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
CS underrepresented groups

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
are not Asian.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Asians and whites

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
are in CS dominant groups.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
CS underrepresented groups

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
are not Asian

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and white.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
How can we

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
keep this community

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
more diverse?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This is a very important

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
topic in CS education.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Many educators

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
support this.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
For example,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
if we want to define

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
gender as a traditional term,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
women are also

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
an underrepresented group.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
How can we attract

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
these underrepresented groups?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
This is a very important

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
topic in CS education in the U.S.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
How do we

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
start to use

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
these tools?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
K-12

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
has

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
thousands of

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
tools.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I will share

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
some of them with you.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Later,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I will share

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
some of them with you.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
If you have

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
kids at home,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
teachers,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
or researchers,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
you can download

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
these tools

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
and play with them.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
They are all free.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
The first category

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
is block-based programming.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
It is

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
a low-floor,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
high-ceiling tool.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Low-floor, high-ceiling

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
means

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
this tool

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
is easy to use.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
There is no

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
prior knowledge restriction.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
If I don't have

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
programming experience,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I can also

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
use it.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
It is easy to use.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It is for kids.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
No.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
High-ceiling means

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
it can be very complicated.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
How to design

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
this tool?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
It depends on

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
researchers' skills.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I listed a few

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
that are

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
related to

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
my research.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Lego is expensive.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I will talk about Lego later.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I am talking about free

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
block-based programming.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Blocky is

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Google-designed.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Tinker is

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
a combination of

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
blocks.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
You can

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
use colors

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
and squares

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
to make a simple

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
program.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Later...

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Thank you, David.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Later, I will

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
talk about Scratch.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Scratch is a tool

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
designed by MIT Media Lab

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
in 2007.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I will talk about Scratch later.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Taiwan has

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
a lot of

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
elementary education using Scratch.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
CodeCombat

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
is more like a game.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
You can use block-based

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
programming to

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
set your character's skills.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
You can...

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I haven't played it, but

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I saw the video.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
You can set your character's skills.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And you can...

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
You need to use coding

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
to build things in the world.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
It's like an indirect way

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
to build a world.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Robotics...

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Robotics is another big direction.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You can build

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
robots

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and introduce robots

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
to children.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Some people said

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Lego is expensive.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
These three

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
blocks are free.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
But these are

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
commercial products.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's not

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
very expensive.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
These two are

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
more than $100.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I forgot about Lego.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
But

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
it's not very expensive.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
You can see

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
it's in Lego.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
It's like a flowchart.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
You can play.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
It has motion sensor

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
and color sensor.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
After you build the robot,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
you can

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
use wheels

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
to recognize different colors

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and get different commands.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Sephiroth is

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
block-based.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
It's like a ball.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
After you program it,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
it can spin on the ground.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Tinkering,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
hand-made,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
and coding

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
are good

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
to introduce

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
to children.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Why does it move?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
You can use it

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
to introduce

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
programming concepts.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You can stick

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
these routes on the ground.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
You can program on the iPad.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
You can simulate how it runs.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
When it's programmed,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
it can run.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
You can see

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
how to solve

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
the problem

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and implement

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
the plan.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Data science and

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
3D printing

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
are also

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
a field.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
These two are

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
commonly used

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
in research and education.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Thank you for your comments.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I will answer

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
later for

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
time.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Please feel free to comment.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I promised

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
to introduce Scratch in detail.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Scratch

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
was first

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
introduced in

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
MIT Media Lab.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Mitch Resnick

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and Karen Brennan

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
were first

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
introduced in

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
2007.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The first beta version

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
was released.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
It's been 13 years.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
There are more than

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
70 languages,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
more than 61 million

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
project shares,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
and more than

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
2 million people registered.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
The goal is

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
as I said,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
low-floor, high-ceiling.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You can jump in

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
if you don't have

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
a programming background.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You can play

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
and make different

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
interactive stories,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
games,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
animations,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and music.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Some people may

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
make it a Mother's Day gift.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
You can share it

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
online.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
You can share it

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
with your friends.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
There may be

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
different animations

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
and music.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
For kids,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
application is their goal.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
They may think it's cool.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I want to know how to do it.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Scratch was designed

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
in this direction.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
It doesn't mean

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
every kid

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
is a computer scientist.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
On the contrary,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
programming is designed

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
as a design tool.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
A piece of paper

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
is a design tool.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
How do I fold it?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
You can think of programming

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
as a tool.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
With this tool,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
you can do different things.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
The core audience

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
is 8 to 16 years old.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
The maximum age is 12.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I've seen many

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
college students' projects

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
or complex projects.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
You can try it later.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
The environment

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
is at the bottom right.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
It's

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
block-based.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Different colors

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
represent different functions.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
What you need to do

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
is to drag from here

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
to this window.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Then you can start to build.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
You can see

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
what you just coded.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
You can click the play button

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
to see what you just programmed.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
As I said,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
you may be confused

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
if you don't have

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
experience with Scratch.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I have an example.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Let's play together

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
for 2 to 3 minutes.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
It doesn't matter if you don't have an account.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I'll post the link

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
on the chat.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I'll give you

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
some time

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
to open it.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I'm working with you now.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
If you open it,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
it should look like this.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
If you've already started,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
you can feel free to start.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
It's a...

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I think it's a theme

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
related game.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
So I chose a game

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
with a girl as the theme.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I'll start

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
to play with you now.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
If you open the window,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
feel free to click the play button.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I don't know if you can hear the music.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
But my headphones can hear it.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Sorry.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I really don't know how to play games.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
If I die,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
don't laugh at me.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Thank you, Yan Yong.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I think you can start playing now.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I'll give you some time.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I think I can't get past 5 minutes.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I'll just keep dying.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Okay, anyway.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
If I get past 2 minutes

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
or 5 minutes later, you can tell me.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Because I really think this game is a bit hard.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Okay, pause for a moment.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Did you? How did you play?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Because I'm really bad at this.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
So you know,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
calculating doesn't mean you know how to play.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Right?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
So...

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Okay.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Does anyone want to share their score?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Okay, if you...

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
If you're almost done,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
you can click on this project.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
It has a button called See Inside.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
This button.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I'm sure you're all in front of the computer.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
If you can watch it with me,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
you'll have a deeper experience.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
So there's a See Inside here.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
You can take a look at

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
what the project looks like.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
If you're a programmer,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
a programmer,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
you may need to spend some time

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
getting used to the interface.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Because it's different from

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
most text spaces.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
For example,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
C++ or Python

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
or JavaScript.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
It's very different.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Because you can see what I just said.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
The motion, look, sound,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
these events.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I'm going to pick one to introduce to you.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
For example,

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
If I create a new project here,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I drag

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
an event.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
For example, when green flags click.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
It's this green flag.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
It's very intuitive.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
What you see is what it is.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
I'm going to help this cat

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
do a 10-step forward.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
At the same time,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I want it to be able to say hello

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
in two minutes.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
It has a feature

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
that can insert sound.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It has a different meow sound.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
You can also record your own voice.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
So you've added a lot of

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
creativity to see what you want to do.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I'm going to use

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
what it defaults to do.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
What happens when I press this?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Do you hear that meow sound?

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
It will go 10 steps forward.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
The so-called 10 is x going 10.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It was just at 0.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
It will say hello.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I'll run it again.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
It goes another 10 steps forward.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
It will say hello in two seconds.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
It will make a meow sound.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
If you want to repeat

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
this action,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
the very important concept in programming

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
is called looped.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
You can insert a repeat here.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
If I just repeat

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
say hello and play sound,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
let's just repeat it twice.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
It will

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
go another 10 steps forward.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
You'll see

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
that after it's done

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
with these two commands,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
it will go back to say hello.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Say hello again.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
It just made a meow sound twice.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
You can play this at home.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
You can also

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
custom this cat.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
You can also

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
define or download.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
If you have some photos,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
you can download it.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
There are some backgrounds here

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
that can provide you with choices.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
There are different sprites here.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Our code sprite is called this object.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
It has different objects.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
You can also insert here.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
So when I click this

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
object,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
I'm here now.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Sorry, I cut this cat.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
You know.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
You can do

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
coding for this sprite.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I was coding under this cat.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Now I'm under Andy.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
This extends to

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
the project I just shared with you.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
You might think it's simple.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
But if you

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
take a closer look at

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
the project I just shared with you,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
it's very complicated.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
So under each sprite,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I can

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
command it to do something.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
After all, it's a game.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
So I need to do a lot of things

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
at the same time.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
For example, under this cat sprite,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I can see this green flag click.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
It will start doing the following action.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
It will demo it to you.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
In other sprites,

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I can also see

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
when green flag click,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
there are other variables

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
running.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
So this project

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
can be extended from

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
the project I just shared with you.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
It can extend to

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
such a complex game.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
This is

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
a low-floor-high-ceiling

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
tool I just talked about.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
OK.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Do you want to play a little longer?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
OK.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Because I can't see you.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I'll wait a minute.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I'll take a sip of water.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
OK.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
So this tool

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
is what I'm going to talk about

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
in my research today.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
It's a very important tool.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Children are co-designed

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
in this context.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
They have co-design, game, story,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
music, and animation.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
How much time

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
do I have left?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
OK.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I'll quickly

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
introduce my research

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
and current

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
computational thinking.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
From my perspective,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
how is computational thinking studied?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I just mentioned

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
computational thinking and cooperative learning.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
My research

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
and dissertation is mainly about

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
how computational thinking

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
is learned and used in a team.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I've brought some

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
most of the

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
literature and what people

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
say now.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
At present, computational thinking is still

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
identified as a very

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
individual thinking.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
If you take programming as an example,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I'm actually doing things

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
there myself.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I may not ask others sometimes,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
but I'm doing it with others.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Most of the research

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
direction is actually

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
an independent individual.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
For example, if this student

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
is exposed to this curriculum

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
or this tool,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
what is my learning process?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
What is my ability?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
What is my result?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Some researchers have begun to discuss

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
that if the computational participation

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
is in a face-to-face environment,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
if I'm online,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
for example, the place I just scratched

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
has a lot of opportunities to

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
collaborate on the Internet.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
What will it look like?

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
How will the child extend this project?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Some researchers have begun to

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
do computational thinking.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
This cooperative computational thinking is not

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
a digital game.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
When I'm playing games,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
how can we solve this problem

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
together?

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
How do we play

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
what role together?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Current research

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
is focused on

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
first, individual,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
second, online community,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
or under

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
desktop and non-programming.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
These researches are very few,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
especially cooperative computational thinking.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
This concept is actually

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
very limited now.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
No one is doing this.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Even though the standard

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
mentioned that cooperative learning

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
is very important,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
the current research direction

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
does not go in that direction.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
My research argues

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
that cooperative learning

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
is not only cooperative learning,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
but also an activity and process of

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
cooperative design.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
In fact, in the field of

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
learning or psychology,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
it has been found that students

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
actually know what to do.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
If I am in a cooperative environment,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I can deepen

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
the knowledge I have learned

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
and I can advance

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
my problem-solving skills.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
On the other hand,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
cooperation

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
has shown

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
a good way

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
to close the gender gap

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
in CS.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
For example,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
you may think that

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
computer science is more

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
independent,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
everyone is hiding in the dungeon.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It's dark in the basement,

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
and everyone is coding

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
at night.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Cooperative learning

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
shows that

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
it can attract more women

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
to join this industry.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
They may feel that

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
this is not a very isolated

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
job or

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
a programming thing.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
They may feel

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
that it is more welcoming.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
They may feel that

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
they can get some support

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
from their colleagues.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
My research goal is to

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
hope to learn

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
computational thinking

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
through the cooperation

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
between students.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
It's like bridging the research gap

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
that everyone has been doing

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
individually.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Oh, a good question.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Hong Yi-Chi asked

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
whether the closed gender gap

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
is effective at all ages.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
The study I quoted

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
was done by adults

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
only.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
She asked

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
some women

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
and their environment.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
The result was that

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
adults felt that

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
it was easier for women

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
to join the cooperation.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
This research is also a good point.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
This is what I want to do

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
in the future.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
If it's a collaboration,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
the younger students

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
will have the same result.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
This is a good research direction.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Finally, I want to extend

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
the current

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
computational thinking framework.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
As you can see,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
CS standards are

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
focused on individuals.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
How do you reach this level?

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I want to push it into

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
a team effort.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
This is my

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
research perspective.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I have a computational thinking

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
framework,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
K-12 CS education,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
and collaborative design activity.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
These are

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
the pieces

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
that I stand in the middle.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
This is me.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
It seems like I'm a little over time.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I'll try to finish

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
in 10 minutes.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
You can ask questions.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
My framework

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
is based on

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
the computational thinking

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
that I just explained.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
You might want to know

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
how to measure

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
and do research.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
This framework provides

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
a big direction.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
There are three types of

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
computational thinking.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
One is concept,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
which is the so-called loops

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
or events.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
There is also parallelism,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
which means

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
you can observe

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
what you are doing.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
For example,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I'm doing testing

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
or debugging.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Perspective is more like

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
how you interpret

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
computational thinking.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
How do you interpret

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
computational thinking?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
For example,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
what do you think of CS?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
What do you think of programming?

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
This is the direction.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
My research focuses on

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
the first two.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
How do children

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
in the team

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
apply these concepts?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
How do they

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
observe

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
what they are doing?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
These practices

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I just mentioned

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
can be observed.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Computational thinking

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
consists of four types.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Experimenting or iterating.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Testing or debugging.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Algorithm building

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Abstracting or modulizing.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Why do I have a

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
quote on the right?

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
These are

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
high-level practices.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
For example,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
how do children

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
experiment or iterate?

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
How do they test

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
what they are doing?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Algorithm building

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
is a high-level practice.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
It's the same as

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
abstracting or modulizing.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
It's hard to observe.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
This is just a heads-up.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Next,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I'll provide

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
my research direction

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
and context.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
My overarching question

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
is how do students

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
learn computational thinking

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
in the team?

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Collaborative design activity

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
refers to

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
how they

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
co-design their projects

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
on this platform.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
My setting is

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
a public school in Indiana.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I designed

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
a five-week course invitation

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
with the teacher.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I went to the school

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
and collected five-week data

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
in an intro

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
of programming course.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
There were 12 students.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
This is a training course,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
so there were not many students.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
There were 14 students in total,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
but 12 students were my focus group.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I collected the data of these 12 students.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
There were three people in one group.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
There were four groups in total.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
My context tool is

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Scratch, which I just introduced.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I collected the data

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
of these four groups of students

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
in each group.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
There were five different Scratch projects,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
so I collected them all.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I also recorded

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
how they did it.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I will explain

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
what the video looks like in the next chapter.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
There was also an intermittent

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
screen recording.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Because of school restrictions,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I could not record their screen all the time.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
But I had an iPad,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
so several undergrad students

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
helped me collect the data.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I collected the screen of

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
their front and back.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
The direction of my analysis

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
is from the front and back,

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
as well as the video of

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
my qualitative code.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I recorded what they did

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
every 10 seconds

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and whether they were engaged

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
in this computational thinking.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
This is

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
what my classroom looks like.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
This is the blackboard.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
There are two groups here,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
two people in each group.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
The rest are three people in each group.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
The red line represents

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
the number of girls.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Gender is spread out,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
so there is a girl in each group.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
There is a 360-degree camera

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
in the classroom.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I made the camera stick

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
by myself.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
It looks like this.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
You may not be used to it at first,

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
but this is the view of the camera.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
There are three students here.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
There are three people in each group.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
This is the teacher.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
There are three people in each group.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
The way I analyze

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
is that

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
these are all students.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I have renamed them.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
These are Meg, Lucas, and Ted.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Because of the time,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I will not explain much.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
However,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
every 10 seconds,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I will capture what they said

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
and transcribe it.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Then identify

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
if they did this practice.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Practice is what I just said.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
E is experimenting or iterating.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
They may be

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
from this time

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
to this time,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
about 9 minutes.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
They have been thinking

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
about whether to add this

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
sprite.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
After I add it,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
what should I change?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
They have been discussing

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and there is no complete answer.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
They don't know what to do.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
So they are all

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
at the forefront.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
They are not very deep into this problem.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Until about 2 minutes later,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
they found that

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
something was missing.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Then they started to test and debug this problem.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Then this thing moved to

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
algorithm building and modularizing.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
This thinking.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
So I will show you

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
what my data looks like.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
So every 10 seconds,

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I will capture what they did.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
This is in practice.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
So next,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I will use performance

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
and practice.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
In education,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
we usually do research

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
in learning sciences.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
How do we know if students really learned

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
algorithmic thinking?

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I give them a pre-test and a post-test.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
So I gave them a test

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
before 5 weeks.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
See if they have grown.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
That means they have improved.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
So in learning,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
the result is very important.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
But the process is also very important.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
The process is very tricky.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
It's hard to capture.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
But in my dissertation,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I tried to use

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
the result and the process

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
to explain algorithmic thinking.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
What is it?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
How do students learn?

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
So in performance,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I gave them a pre-test and a post-test.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Basically,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
they have improved.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
In team learning,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
in these 5 weeks,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
they have improved statistically.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
That means

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
in this learning,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
their algorithmic thinking

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
has improved.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
This is one example.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
This is the same group.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
They are in pre-test and post-test.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
One of the projects.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
One of the problems.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
In the beginning,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
the way to solve the problem is very straightforward.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
You can see

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
what they did in the beginning.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
There are many bugs.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
I won't talk about it.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Many of them can't reach

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
the goal of this test.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
But after the post-test,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I didn't give them any hints.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I just gave them questions.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Let them finish this small project.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
You can see

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
the trigger.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
It means

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
parallelism.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Other things will happen at the same time.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
This is very important

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
in CT.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
It can show

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
the player

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
or learner can receive

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
a higher level of thinking.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
A proof.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
As for the process,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
it's very tricky.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
You may think

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
it's easy.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
But it's not.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I focused on

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
one group.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
This is

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
the result of pre-test and post-test.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
There are 4 groups.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
You can see them.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
How can I prove

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
they learned

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
or applied?

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
You can imagine

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
a timeline.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
From left to right.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
You can see

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Lion

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
took the longest time

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
to finish.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
10 seconds for each group.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
1330 seconds for this group.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
16 minutes.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
20 minutes.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Lion took

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
the longest time.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
20 minutes.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
This is the pre-test.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
You can see

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
each group

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
has different practice.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Blue represents

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
experimenting or iterating.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Green, yellow, pink

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
represent different practice.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
If this group

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
doesn't do practice,

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
it can't do

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
every second.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It can't do

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
nothing.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
It's black.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
If it did

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
more than 2 practice

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
it's red.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
This picture

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
looks complicated.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
But you can see

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
the length of black

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
and its weight.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
You can see

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
most groups

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
have a lot of black.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
They didn't do practice.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
If they didn't do practice,

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
you can see

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
it's off-text.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
But they usually

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
didn't do

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
deep computation.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
In post-test,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
there's a lot of black.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
They

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
did the same practice

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
consecutively.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
They didn't do

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
blue, yellow, green,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
or red.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
They did experimenting.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
I did abstracting

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
for 30 seconds.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
But I did experimenting.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
You can see pink.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I said algorithm building

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
is a high-level

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
computational thinking.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
In post-test,

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
you can see they used

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
a lot of algorithm building.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
OK.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
In addition to

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
learning process and result,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I want to talk about

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
5-week class implementation.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
In class design,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
what can

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
I do?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I switch to

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
the teacher's role.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
There are 4 practices.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
This is 5-week data.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I followed

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
one group.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Lion, Tiger,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Bear, Cat.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Tiger.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
You can see

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
what practices

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
and when they used

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
in 5-week class.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
The main practices

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
are these 4.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
In this class,

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
students get a working sheet.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
They start planning

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
what they want to do.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
They move on to coding.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
You can see planning and coding

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
are intertwined.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
It's hard to tell.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I give you a piece of paper.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
You draw on it.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
It's not reasonable.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Planning and coding

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
are in the same group.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
They do the project together.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
They need to discuss

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
what the project should look like.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
What should I do?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
After this stage,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
there is a peer review.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
They have a feedback sheet.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
These 4 groups

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
give feedback to each other.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
After getting feedback,

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
they revise the project.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
The whole process

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
is 5-week project.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
There are 5 projects

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
in a week.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
They went through this process 5 times.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Planning, coding, revising.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
It's repeated.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
The total time

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
is here.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
The data I analyzed

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
is 6.3 hours.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
They are working together.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Sometimes,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
they are not focusing.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I don't count these.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
The data is 6.3 hours.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
The graph on the right

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
shows the ratio

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
of these 4 practices

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
in 6.3 hours.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
The blue and green

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
are common practices.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
They spend a lot of time

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
discussing

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
what to put

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
and what to do.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
The red is

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
the second time

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
debugging and testing.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
These are the others.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
You may ask

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
it's obvious.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Why do this?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
When do they do

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
testing and experimenting?

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
This can be

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
connected with teaching.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
When do you

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
give feedback to students?

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
When do you know

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
they are doing this?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
This is

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
a time series example.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Planning and coding

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
are revising.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
This is a segment.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
It's 60 minutes per class.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I use 20 minutes

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
to explain.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
There are 6 segments

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
in 1 minute.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
A segment is 10 seconds.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
A bigger one

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
is 30 seconds in a row.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
There are 6 segments

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
in total.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
The blue one

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
is from start to finish.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
The 20-minute segment

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
spends a lot of time

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
experimenting and iterating

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
their ideas.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
There are abstracting

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
and modularizing.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Algorithm building

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
doesn't happen completely.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
It happens a little bit,

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
but not at the beginning.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It happens a lot

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
when revising.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
This tells us

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
students need to spend

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
more time

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
to learn

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
at a higher level.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
If you are a teacher

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
who is in a hurry,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
for example,

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
it's hard to

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
reach the level

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
students want

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
in a team.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
The stage of revising

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
is testing or debugging.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Students spend a lot of time

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
on this green bar.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
They spend a lot of time

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
on testing or debugging.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
As a teacher,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
you can know

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
how to emphasize

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
the deeper level

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
when revising.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Do I have some

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
deep insights?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I can see

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
when they overlap.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Why do they overlap?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
What did they do?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
These are the

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
things you can discuss

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
in depth.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
You can provide

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
a pattern to the teacher.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
How do you apply

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
this pattern

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
to your teaching

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
and teaching plan?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
There are too many things

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
to talk about.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I'm already over time.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Next,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I'd like to talk about

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
the main

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
elements and results.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
As you can see,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
it's a bit

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
complicated.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
There are two main concepts.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I'd like to explain

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
the concept of

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
computational thinking

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
and the behavior

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
that can be observed.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
How to assess

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
students' learning

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
is still a concept.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Do students learn

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
from this concept?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I'd like to start

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
from the perspective of practice.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
What students do

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
can reflect

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
the concept of

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
computational thinking.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
No one has

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
combined these concepts yet.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But what you think

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and what you do

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
is not new in education.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Computational thinking

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
can be a breakthrough

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
in the future.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Next,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I'd like to talk about

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
the assessment

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
and how to improve

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
students' learning.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I'd like to

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
talk about

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
how to assess

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
students' learning

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
and practice

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
instead of

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
just giving them

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
a bunch of choices.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Finally,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I'd like to talk about

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
the ability of

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
computational thinking

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
not only for one person.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
When you study in a group,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
you can see

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
what I said

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and who gave me

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
which opinion.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
They are co-constructing

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
the experience and ability

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
of computational thinking.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
They learn as a group

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Next,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I'd like to talk about

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
the role of each student

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
in the learning

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
and cooperation.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
What's the role of

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
each student

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
in the learning

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
of computational thinking?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
For example,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
one of the students

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
is the leader of the group.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
How does he lead

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
and how does he do

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
computational thinking?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And how does

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
social behavior

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
intertwine with

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
computational thinking?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
These are

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
the general direction

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I'd like to focus on.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I'd like to focus on

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
the role of each student

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
in the group

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and then discuss it

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
as a group.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Thank you.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Over time,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I won't talk too much.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Thank you for listening.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
If you have any questions,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
feel free to ask.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Thank you,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Joey, for sharing

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
your research.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Let's start

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
the Q&A.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I see a question.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Lin Hui has a question.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
She'd like to ask

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
about Scratch

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
in Taiwan

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
and the students'

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and teachers' reactions.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Is there a teacher

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
from Taiwan?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Personally,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I went to Taiwan last year

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
to attend a conference

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
on computer science education

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
in Kenting.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
What I learned

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
was that Scratch

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
was widely used

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
in elementary school

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
in Taiwan

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
when I was

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
in the 6th grade.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
You can start

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
the Q&A.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
The way I see it,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
it's very much

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
about programming.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I want kids to learn

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
programming.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Besides programming,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I don't care

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
about their artistic development

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
or creativity.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
It's a little bit

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
against Scratch Team's

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
original intention.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Scratch Design Team

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
is one of

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
my current advisors.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I'm one of

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
the students

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
of our advisor.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So I continued

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
his original design.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
That's what I heard.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I'm not sure if there are

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Taiwanese students here.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
What I know is that

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
the Ministry of Education

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
came up with a budget planning

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
in 2016.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
This year,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
they've been pushing

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
the budget planning

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
to the middle school level.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
You can start

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
the Q&A.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Welcome to listen to your voice.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Another question is

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
if there is any difference

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
between individual project

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
and team learning

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and the effect.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I think I need

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
to talk to

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Ms. Hong.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I think this is a good question.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Why didn't I

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
do the research

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
on team learning?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
The reason is

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
you don't need to compare.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
No matter

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
whether it's programming,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
individual learning

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
is always better than

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
team learning.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
If I want to teach

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
a science concept today,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
if I teach science

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
in a team,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
if I test the results,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
individual learning is always better.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
You may find that

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
you need to focus

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
on learning.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
The test is

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
your unique ability.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
It saves time

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
if you learn by yourself.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Why is team learning important?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It can discuss

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
the application of

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
social skills

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
and learning.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
The content knowledge

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
of the subject

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
will save time.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
But the idea

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
is deeper

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and broader

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
than learning by yourself.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I think the learning effect

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
can be seen

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
in 5 weeks

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
or in a short time.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Individual learning

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
is better.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
But education depends on the long run.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
In the long run,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
what impact

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
individual learning has

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
has a lot to do with

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
new experience.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I argue that

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
in a team,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
they can learn

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
what individuals can't.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
To prove the value

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
of teamwork.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Thank you for your question.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I think it's important.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Is there any research?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Yes.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I can forward it to you.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Individual, indirect,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
and complete cooperation.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
The result is

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
what I just said.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Individual is better.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
But in the long run,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
team is better.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Hi, Joy. I'm Yoga.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Hi.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I can continue.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
My question is a bit long.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I can type.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
My main question is

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
to sum up

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
your computational thinking.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
It's like

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
teaching students.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
We cooperate

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
and use the same language

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
to solve a specific problem.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Is this

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
a process of

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
helping students

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
to socialize?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I have this question.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
This is my main question.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I have this question.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
It's like

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
your computational thinking

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
is different from

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
those of

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
computer science majors

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
or

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
seniors.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I guess

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
it's quite different.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I guess

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
it's quite different.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
For K-12

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
or

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
junior high school students,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
for K-12 or junior high school students,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
we have an open course.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
It's called

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Computer Science Anyway.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
It's a brand new course.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Although computer science has been developed

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
for 60 or 70 years,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
it's a brand new course

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
for medical education.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
it's a brand new course for medical education.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Although we have

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
a lot of materials,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
a lot of materials,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
such as textbooks,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
such as textbooks,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
these teaching methods

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
may not be suitable

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
for junior high school students.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
So you want to

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
develop a set of

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
teaching methods suitable for junior high school students,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and a set of

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
ways to test

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
whether they really

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
learn something from it.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
So this is

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
what your computational thinking

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
aims at.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Am I right?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Yes, to answer

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
your definition of CT.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
The researchers

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
in this framework are all

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
from CS.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
But you know,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
they may have different opinions

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
in the same discipline.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I just showed you the round one.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I'm in the middle

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and broad.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Computational thinking

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
needs to be completed under programming.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
It only has a

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
beneficial definition for CS.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So I'm happy

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
if you have different opinions,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I'd like to hear

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
what your research

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
is doing.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
If you are an educator,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
how would you interpret it?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
The second question,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I think it's right,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
but there are too many developments.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
We are still discussing

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
what computational thinking is.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
The assessment

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
is a very

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
big topic.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
A lot of NSF funding

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
focuses on the assessment.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
So I dare not say

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
my research has reached the assessment.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Because I'm not

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
studying students'

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
ability to learn in the end.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
In the process,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
how can we reflect the current evaluation?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
In the current evaluation,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
most of the tests

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
are choice questions.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It's not a project-based

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
test.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
This is a

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
very different field.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
My theme

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
is to provide

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
a different idea

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
to the current field.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I've been emphasizing

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
collaboration is very important in CS.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
But as for

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
how to apply

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
collaboration

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
in K-12,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
this is a completely

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
different topic.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I've been saying this is very important,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
but there is no research

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
or teacher who wants to try.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
But I have to say,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
it's a bit like digging a hole for yourself to jump.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
In research,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
we dig a hole for ourselves to jump

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
or get along with

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
ourselves in the hole.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It's very complicated.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
What I've done so far

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
is just the beginning.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
As for the question

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
you just mentioned,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
is it really better to

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
learn in collaboration?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Is it really good for the student's

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
content knowledge?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Or is it better for the student's

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
other skills and

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
interpretation of the field?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
These are all things that can be

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
studied and discussed in depth.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
What I hope to provide is

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
a process of

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
looking at their

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
computational thinking

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
to reflect on

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
how I can improve

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
the design of

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
this course

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
to facilitate

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
collaborative learning.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I'm still studying

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
student learning,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
but I hope to provide

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
some practical

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
help in the design of the course.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
As for the assessment,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I can provide you

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
a paper that is

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
specifically for CT

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
assessment research.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
You just mentioned

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
the so-called

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
collaborative learning.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I have a question.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
What I heard

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
when I was listening

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
is that

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
we need to train students

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
to learn how to collaborate.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Collaborative learning is like

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
three or five people

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
studying a problem

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
and discussing it together.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
This is collaborative learning.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
The meaning of

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
collaborative learning is

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
that the three of us

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
learn a language together.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
When someone writes a plan,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I can write it down

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
in this language.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
This language can be

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
used by three or four people.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
It can also be used by

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
a computer or other people

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
who have learned this language.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
In the process,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
three or five people

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
need to collaborate.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
They just need to read the script

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
and know how to play the role.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
This is the first question

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
about the process of

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
socialization.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Socialization is also

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
a process of learning

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
that provides a set of

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
basic languages,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
such as sequence, loop,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
and judgement.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
This language structure

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
allows everyone

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
to complete a task

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
according to a script.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I said that

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
this is a process of

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
socialization.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Is this what you mean?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I think what you said

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
is a bit like what ESPAN

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
is talking about now.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
What I see now is

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
how I learn

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
computational thinking

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
in the process of

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
team cooperation.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Just like what you said,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
how do I learn

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
the concept of sequence?

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I'm not just learning

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
by myself,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I'm learning

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
the concept of

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
the use of sequence

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
in a team.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I think it can be added

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
to a layer.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Collaborative

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
computational thinking

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
means that

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
you can design

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
a task

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
according to

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
your team.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
This is a way of

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
cooperation,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
not computational thinking.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Does this make sense?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Okay, thank you.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I got it.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Got it.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Stephen, can you

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
turn on the microphone?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
It's okay if you don't.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Oh, hi.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I'd like to ask

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
when do you

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
recommend

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
elementary school students

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
to start learning

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
computational thinking?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Oh,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
that's a good question.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
When?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I think

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I can go back to

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
the tour I just introduced.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
For example,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Blocky and Scratch

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
were designed for

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
6-year-olds.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
When you can start

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
learning,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
you can start

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
developing

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
tangible programming.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
It's especially for

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
2-3-year-olds.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
When you're still

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
holding and exploring

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
the world,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
you can

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
design a soft

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
thing.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
When you connect

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
two things,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
one of them will light up.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'd say

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
most of my research is

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
on how to

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
promote

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
computational thinking

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
and programming.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I think

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
computational thinking

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
is beyond programming.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
You can think

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
like a computer scientist

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
instead of

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
become a computer scientist.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Computational thinking

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
is based on CS.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
When you connect

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
two things,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
it looks like a hand,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
but you can think

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
about the logic of coding.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
If I connect

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
these two things,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
the light bulb will light up.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
For children,

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
many things

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
are developed

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
through

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
touching.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
For example,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
we train children

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
to react

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
to stimulations.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
There are more and more

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
early-stage tools

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
to do this.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It's not just pressing

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
to sing.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
When you

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
combine two things

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
into a complex pattern,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
it will move

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
or sing a song.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
When

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
you have

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
this resource,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
it's free.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
You can

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
let children

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
touch these things.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I don't think

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
it's a perfect age.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
If you want to know more,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
do you suggest

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
students

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
to learn this at school

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
or parents

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
to let children

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
learn this at school?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
At school,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
the US system

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
is based on

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
the state-by-state.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Indiana must have

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
CS this year.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I don't have

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
a complete opinion.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I think everyone is pushing

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
to get better as soon as possible.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I just mentioned

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
the world of AI.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I think everyone

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
will start to learn CS.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
In Taiwan,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
some primary schools

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
have already started to teach CS.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Thank you.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Thank you for your

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
questions.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
We have two more

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
questions.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Thank you.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
It's already 11.30

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
now.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I want to ask

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
a question.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Does computing

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
thinking

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
have anything

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
to do with math?

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
For example,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
is it because

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
primary schools

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
are starting to teach

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
math?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Or does it have

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
nothing to do with math?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Are you talking about

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
the US or Taiwan?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I think

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
the US and Taiwan

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
are not limited to

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
general teaching.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Math and

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
computing thinking

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
are

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
a good

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
direction.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I don't think

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
math and

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
computing thinking

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
have anything to do

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
with science.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I just mentioned

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
that CS teachers

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
are very short.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Very few people

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
become a teacher

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
because of

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
CS.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
In professional training,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
CS teachers are

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
very short.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I haven't heard

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
this concept

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
being incorporated

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
into math.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
But I think

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
we can find

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
a pattern.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
For example,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
we have to see

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
how computation

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
develops.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I don't see

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
anyone

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
doing overlap

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
between math and

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
computing thinking.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
It depends on how

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
computing thinking

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
is applied in

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
different subjects

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
and contexts.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
So far,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
no one has

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
discussed

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
the overlap

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
between math and

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
computing thinking.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Are you in math?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yes, if you're interested,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I think it's worth

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
doing.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
If you can think of

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
a way to overlap

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
math and computing

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
thinking,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
it would be a good

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
transition.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I see people

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
combining math and

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
computing thinking.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
But if we can

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
find a way to

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
combine math and

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
computing thinking,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
it would be a good

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
transition.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Thank you.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
You're welcome.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Let's open

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
the last question.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Anyone?

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
If not,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
please stay on

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
the platform

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
after the presentation.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I will

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
stop the recording

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
now.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Thank you.
