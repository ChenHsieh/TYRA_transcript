0	29980	OK, thank you all for participating in our speech today, I am the host today, Zhang Yanping, I represent everyone with a warm applause to welcome our speaker today, Li Xuanwei teacher, Li Xuanwei teacher, OK, are you shooting yourself?
29980	58960	OK, before I introduce Mr. Xuanwei, let me tell you about some of the events of today's housekeeping, because later when the speaker is speaking, his screen will be a projection of his own projection, so he may not be able to see the dialogue window, if you have any questions, if you want to stick to the dialogue window, if you do not know what the dialogue window is,
58960	85960	now everyone on the right hand side of the BlueJeans may be able to see a row of the audience, and then the second option chat can type, basically a chat window, if you have any questions, you can stick there, but because the speaker will not see, because he is looking at the powerpoint, so if you leave a message, it does not matter, everyone will leave, and then I will find a place to ask questions in time,
85960	112960	either to ask for everyone's behalf, or you can ask yourself, but just stay there, and then I will help the speaker to see, and then I will listen to the speaker today, this time is about 40 to 45 minutes, he will talk so much content, and then there will be 15 to 30 minutes of Q&A time in the back.
112960	142920	OK, so these are housekeeping, and then let me introduce today's speaker, I just said that Mr. Xuan Wei, he is called Li Xuan Wei, today's speaker is called Li Xuan Wei, and then his university is in the Taiwan University Department of State, and then he went to Zhengda Yingshu to read the master's degree, and then after reading the master's degree, his doctorate is in UNC,
143920	154920	the Department of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina, and then the specialized topic is Complex Network, and the topic of Social Network.
155920	169920	OK, after completing his doctorate in 2016, he went to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to do postdoc, and did it until 2018. Oh, by the way, if I say something wrong, you can correct me directly.
170920	172920	No, this is all public information.
173920	174920	OK, thank you.
174920	176920	I actually saw it on your website.
176920	199920	OK, and then after finishing the postdoc, in 2019, he returned to Taiwan and started his career as an assistant professor and assistant researcher at NTU Politics, NTU Society, and NTU Central Academy of Sciences until now.
200920	204920	Your position should be in NTU Central Academy of Sciences, right?
204920	205920	Yes.
206920	214920	In NTU Central Academy of Sciences, however, there are also students and teachers, and often come and go, on both sides.
214920	222920	In NTU Central Academy of Sciences, Wayne is in the Society, and part of NTU is NTU Politics and Social Peace.
222920	231920	OK, this is the background of today's speaker.
231920	237920	A fun fact is that Wayne likes to eat strawberry cake.
238920	241920	You have to laugh out loud.
241920	243920	That's right, I can testify.
243920	248920	Didn't you get muted?
249920	252920	Actually, this is what we are talking about.
252920	258920	I don't know if he really likes to eat strawberry cake, but if you buy him a strawberry cake, he will be very happy.
258920	265920	OK, let's leave today's event to Wayne.
265920	268920	Let him introduce the topic to everyone.
268920	271920	Let me clap on behalf of everyone again.
272920	276920	OK, thank you Wayne for the introduction.
276920	282920	I am very happy to be able to come to Terra today to share some of the research I did before.
282920	290920	It is also a fun fact that Wayne invited me to give a speech about two or three months ago.
290920	295920	I have heard of Terra before, and now I am very happy to have the opportunity to give a speech here.
296920	299920	It is quite related to Wayne.
299920	306920	We all graduated from UNC Chapel Hill, and we are still colleagues at the Central Academy of Sciences.
306920	308920	We also wrote an article together.
308920	310920	I don't know where the article will be posted.
310920	313920	But I think the world is very small.
313920	318920	We have been in UNC Chapel Hill for three or four years.
318920	322920	I didn't expect to come back to Taiwan and still be in the same place, which is the upper and lower floors.
322920	324920	I can still write articles now.
324920	326920	So things are hard to predict.
326920	329920	There are also many cross-field collaborations now.
329920	333920	Maybe I will share my research here.
333920	339920	Maybe everyone here has a degree or is studying for a degree.
339920	341920	Maybe you are interested after seeing it.
341920	345920	Maybe we can also start some cross-field cooperation in the future.
346920	352920	The time I want to share today is about 45 minutes.
352920	355920	It may be about 11 o'clock in Taiwan time.
355920	360920	I will stay for about 15 to 30 minutes to discuss with you.
360920	364920	If you have any questions, you can come here to discuss.
364920	371920	Although I see 56 pages here, I should say that many of my videos are relatively fast.
372920	377920	Because this is a compilation of two articles.
377920	380920	What I want to share today is within two articles.
380920	385920	So if you are interested, you can go directly to see the two articles.
385920	393920	Whether it is model setting or mathematical inference, I only introduce the concept of these articles to everyone.
393920	396920	If you are interested, you can find articles to read directly.
396920	403920	You are welcome to ask questions, discuss, or write to me after reading the article.
403920	406920	I am looking forward to interacting with everyone.
406920	410920	Okay, let me start by introducing the title of this article.
410920	412920	The title of this article is ...
412920	416920	I have just been responded by two friends that my title is too long and I do not understand.
416920	419920	So I will slowly talk about what this title means.
419920	421920	Using Perceptual Tomography
421920	424920	We want to use something called Perceptual Tomography.
424920	429920	Perceptual is a perceptual thing.
429920	432920	Tomography is a segmented scan.
432920	435920	We will see later why we use the term Tomography.
435920	439920	Of course, we are not really using segmented scanning to do social science research.
439920	444920	We use this Perceptual Tomography to define later.
444920	446920	We want to build a network.
446920	448920	It is a subjective network.
448920	455920	It is not a traditional social network built by the majority of people.
455920	458920	It is a third-party recognition.
458920	460920	What should this group look like?
460920	462920	We ask other people.
462920	464920	We ask some people on the Internet.
464920	467920	Do you think that A and B are related?
467920	472920	If A and B are related, are they close or do not know or are not familiar?
472920	477920	Use this third-party recognition to restore a network.
477920	480920	It is the same as a general social network.
480920	482920	I am talking about the Internet and the Internet.
482920	484920	Sociologists like to talk about the Internet.
484920	486920	Maybe other field scientists like to talk about the Internet.
486920	488920	But it is the same.
488920	491920	We use this third-party recognition to restore a network.
491920	495920	We can try to compare this network in the future.
495920	503920	The way to restore the Internet is different from the traditional social network that everyone likes to use.
503920	508920	The second part is that we want to see if we are in a network environment.
508920	512920	Do some intervention in the network environment.
512920	515920	This intervention may be some policy promulgation.
515920	521920	Or what we are talking about here is a policy promulgation that promotes public health.
521920	526920	We want to measure how effective this intervention is.
526920	530920	Can we use quantification to see how effective it is?
530920	537920	It is in a social network environment.
537920	541920	We can only find some people to participate in this intervention.
541920	544920	It's like giving them some public health education.
544920	550920	But we want to know if these interventions have spread out.
550920	557920	We want to see how effective it is in a community level network.
557920	559920	Can we quantify it?
559920	562920	So this is probably the meaning of this topic.
562920	564920	Then I will continue to go down.
564920	568920	This is the outline of today's speech.
568920	570920	I still divide it into three parts.
570920	573920	The first part is because I received a letter.
573920	576920	I want to know that this may have nothing to do with the speech.
576920	579920	He wants to know why I went from mathematics to sociology.
579920	585920	So I will spend about five minutes to talk about what I am doing during my doctorate.
586920	590920	I originally studied mathematics as introduced by Yanping.
590920	593920	Then I turned to sociology.
593920	596920	I want to talk about the turning point in the middle.
596920	598920	So it will take about five to ten minutes.
598920	602920	The remaining two parts are the introduction of two articles.
602920	607920	The first part is how to go from mathematics to social science.
607920	611920	So I want to talk about two concepts in this part.
611920	613920	The first is social dynamics modeling.
613920	615920	This is social dynamics.
615920	620920	How do we use modelization or form logic to study this matter?
620920	625920	We know that in the real world, there are actually a lot of interactions with people.
625920	628920	Then it is very complicated, but it may be a lot of faces.
628920	635920	Of course, there are ways to study this thing in various fields.
635920	640920	Then we look at it from the perspective of mathematics and physics.
640920	643920	It is a very, very high-dimensional complex system.
643920	646920	Because it interacts too much and has a lot of impact.
646920	648920	Then the things you want to test can be infinite.
648920	650920	You can find things to test.
650920	652920	What should we do? How do we deal with this kind of thing?
652920	655920	We will try to model it.
655920	658920	The way to model is to do some simple simplifications.
658920	662920	You have to look at the most important thing in this system.
662920	666920	What are the driving forces that you care about?
666920	668920	We have to find it out.
668920	674920	The way we do it is to think of it as an atom.
674920	681920	Economists may be called agents or social scientists may be called agents.
681920	689920	We use this very simple simplification to think of it as some examples with the same characteristics or agents.
689920	692920	Then look at the interaction between these examples and agents.
692920	696920	At the same time, we also simplify a lot of things they can do.
696920	700920	For example, if it is an example, it may be left-handed or right-handed.
700920	704920	If it is an agent, it may be happy or unhappy.
704920	708920	This is a very simple two-point method, or it may be a lot of cutting.
708920	712920	We cut these examples.
712920	718920	If we present it in a complex system or on the Internet, it is a point.
718920	720920	We call nodes.
720920	722920	These nodes will have a state.
722920	726920	As I said, it may be a binary, or it may be a multi-state.
726920	732920	It may be that you are in a very bad mood today, and it is very good.
732920	740920	This kind of multi-state, or it may be continuous, may be a continuous change, may be a healthy state, may be a healthy state.
740920	742920	Of course, it can also be multi-dimensional.
742920	746920	It depends on what you are interested in.
746920	750920	The other part we value is the structure of this system.
750920	754920	What kind of relationship do these people have with each other?
754920	760920	You can think of it as a social relationship, such as a family or a workplace.
760920	762920	You can also think of it as geographical.
762920	766920	It may be that if the distance between people is very close, there may be a risk of infectious diseases.
766920	772920	We have to look at these modes, these social networks, and the structure behind them.
772920	776920	How will it affect each of us in the above example or people?
776920	780920	Of course, I listed some of the ways to form this structure.
780920	784920	Systematic is that it has a system.
784920	786920	What we understand here is that it is determined.
786920	788920	It's like a person.
788920	792920	You may know that the grid has four neighbors.
792920	794920	It's like a barbecue net.
794920	796920	One person has about four neighbors.
796920	798920	This may be a systematic network.
798920	800920	Or random.
800920	806920	You may have heard of a very simple random network model.
806920	810920	In the system, any two people have a certain probability of being linked together.
810920	812920	Or heterogeneous.
812920	814920	It may be heterogeneous.
814920	816920	Every point has a different way of being linked together.
816920	818920	Or it can also change over time.
818920	824920	We can study the dynamic system or time series of this system that changes over time.
824920	832920	Our new method is to build a simplified model in this complex system.
832920	838920	But this simplified model has to be able to capture one or two key things that we are most interested in.
838920	842920	As Einstein said, a model should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.
842920	846920	We have to simplify it to the point where we can no longer simplify it.
846920	854920	The tool I use is the network theory in the complex system.
854920	860920	Network theory is a method of expression.
860920	862920	It is also a method of learning.
862920	864920	It is different from the previous research.
864920	868920	It is an interaction phenomenon that attaches more importance to the medium-length.
868920	870920	What is medium-length?
870920	874920	It is a length between micro and macro.
874920	882920	At the macro level, you can see all people as being able to interact with others.
882920	886920	For example, in a group, we see that everyone is the same.
886920	890920	Let's say we have a class of students.
890920	894920	Then we have to study how COVID-19 spreads in this place.
894920	896920	Then we say that every student is the same.
896920	900920	And they can interact with other students at will.
900920	904920	This may be seen as a large group.
904920	908920	This is the macro level.
908920	910920	What about micro?
910920	914920	Micro is another part of the macro.
914920	916920	It just sees everyone differently.
916920	920920	You have to emphasize that its personal characteristics are like its height, age and weight.
920920	922920	It may be different for everyone.
922920	926920	What we do at the network level is not this thing.
926920	928920	At the network level, we assume that everyone is the same.
928920	930920	Unless you want to eat different types of points.
930920	932920	Of course, that can also be extended.
932920	934920	But our basic assumption is that everyone is the same.
934920	938920	What we care about is the structure of this system.
938920	940920	Who has a connection with whom?
940920	942920	Who will influence each other?
942920	944920	Or who will get the message from which side?
944920	950920	So what we see is that the network is a medium-length research method.
950920	952920	It is between large and small.
952920	956920	The subject of my research is social networks.
956920	960920	Of course, there are different kinds of social networks.
960920	962920	Of course, there may be a lot of networks.
962920	970920	In the natural world, there may be biological networks, food chains, bacterial networks, or virus networks.
970920	974920	It may also be artificial, such as computer networks.
974920	976920	Topology is how computers and birds are grouped together.
976920	978920	Or triple-W network.
978920	980920	Or some traffic networks.
980920	982920	In fact, there are many layers of network composition.
982920	984920	The main type of research I do is social networks.
984920	986920	What is the difference between social networks and other networks?
986920	988920	Here I have listed three.
988920	990920	The first is that it has a phenomenon called homophily.
990920	992920	Homophily is translated into Chinese as homogeneity.
992920	994920	You like people with the same characteristics as you.
994920	996920	You have this tendency.
996920	998920	You are also in a relationship with a person.
998920	1000920	You would like to say that you are in a relationship with a similar person.
1000920	1002920	So it is a tree of spines.
1002920	1004920	Or birds of a feather flock together.
1004920	1006920	This is the first phenomenon.
1006920	1008920	This may not be as common as other networks.
1008920	1010920	The second is high clustering.
1010920	1012920	What is the meaning of high clustering?
1012920	1014920	It is the ability to create or store data.
1014920	1016920	It can be classified as a network or a network.
1016920	1018920	It can be classified as a network or a network.
1018920	1020920	It can be classified as a network or a network.
1021920	1023920	The second is high clustering.
1023920	1025920	The second is high clustering.
1025920	1027920	Watch out for'homoplasticity'.
1027920	1029920	Watch out for'homoplasticity'.
1029920	1031920	It means that there may be many Gabrielian stars on the network.
1031920	1033920	It means that there may be many Gabrielian stars on the network.
1033920	1035920	What is small triangle?
1035920	1037920	Devil's friends.
1037920	1039920	It may be that you know B.
1039920	1041920	B knows C.
1041920	1043920	If the two are in a strong relationship,
1043920	1045920	If the two are in a strong relationship,
1045920	1047920	Usually there will be a relationship that is at least an identity of 3 to 4.
1047920	1049920	Usually there will be a relationship that is at least an identity of 3 to 4.
1049920	1051920	Therefore, in general social networks,
1051920	1053920	Therefore, in general social networks,
1053920	1055920	abc is very rich in the network ratio.
1055920	1057920	abc is very rich in the network ratio.
1057920	1059920	abc is very rich in the network ratio.
1059920	1061920	abc is very rich in the network ratio.
1061920	1063920	You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.
1063920	1065920	You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.
1065920	1067920	You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.
1067920	1069920	There are many such small triangles.
1069920	1071920	There are many such small triangles.
1071920	1073920	Third, small world.
1073920	1075920	Most of people may have heard of the principle of 6-degree approximation.
1075920	1077920	Most of people may have heard of the principle of 6-degree approximation.
1077920	1079920	But in a system or in the world,
1079920	1081920	But in a system or in the world,
1081920	1083920	The distance between people may not be as far as you imagined.
1083920	1085920	The distance between people may not be as far as you imagined.
1085920	1087920	How?
1087920	1089920	How?
1089920	1092000	Influencers,
1092000	1092920	they come about 5 phase and 6 phase.
1092920	1094920	they come about 5 phase and 6 phase.
1094920	1096920	Although they may not be aware of the shortest way,
1096920	1098920	Although they may not be aware of the shortest way,
1098920	1100920	you can see the sky when you open your eyes.
1100920	1102920	you can see the sky when you open your eyes.
1102920	1104920	You and a person in Africa,
1104920	1105920	the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.
1105920	1107920	the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.
1107920	1109920	the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.
1109920	1110920	So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.
1110920	1112920	So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.
1112920	1114920	So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.
1114920	1116920	And that's why the world is much smaller than we thought.
1116920	1118920	And that's why the world is much smaller than we thought.
1118920	1120920	By small scale, I mean that your road is less long than you imagined.
1120920	1122920	By small scale, I mean that your road is less long than you imagined.
1122920	1124920	The way we talk here is the shortest way.
1124920	1126920	There are many shortcuts in the system.
1126920	1128920	Make it very easy to get close to the goal.
1128920	1130920	Make it very easy to get close to the goal.
1190920	1192920	And then we can see the state of the point.
1192920	1194920	Let's take a simple example.
1194920	1196920	Let's take a simple example.
1196920	1198920	You may see that your neighbor or friend
1198920	1200920	You may see that your neighbor or friend
1200920	1202920	has a high infectious disease.
1202920	1204920	has a high infectious disease.
1204920	1206920	People around him may need to stay away from him.
1206920	1208920	People around him may need to stay away from him.
1208920	1210920	You need to have social distancing.
1210920	1212920	You need to have social distancing.
1212920	1214920	Or you let him be isolated.
1214920	1216920	If he is sick today,
1216920	1218920	If he is sick today,
1218920	1220920	this limit to his surroundings.
1220920	1222920	This limit to his surroundings.
1222920	1224920	the overlapping network will be significantly changing.
1224920	1226920	the overlapping network will be significantly changing.
1226920	1228920	Because of the isolation,
1228920	1230920	for the time being, he has lost many connections.
1230920	1232920	His friends may have lost connections with his friend.
1232920	1234920	His friends may have lost connections with his friend.
1234920	1236920	His friends may find others to replace.
1236920	1238920	Or he has more resources and more time for socializing.
1238920	1240920	Or he has more resources and more time for socializing.
1240920	1242920	So when a person loses something,
1242920	1244920	Or when a person loses something,
1244920	1246920	he is isolated,
1426920	1428920	But in society,
1428920	1430920	But in society,
1430920	1432920	there are many real-life information.
1432920	1434920	But we need to reverse the model.
1434920	1436920	But we need to reverse the model.
1436920	1438920	What is it?
1438920	1440920	What is it?
1440920	1442920	I don't know if it's a problem with engineering.
1442920	1444920	reverse engineering
1444920	1446920	or inverse problem
1446920	1448920	How can we measure
1448920	1450920	We want to know
1450920	1452920	how can we measure
1452920	1454920	So I'm going back to my model
1454920	1456920	I think the process is interesting
1456920	1458920	good
1458920	1459920	The first one I want to talk about is
1459920	1460920	indians
1460920	1461920	perceptual tomography
1461920	1464920	both of them
1464920	1465920	He is in the research
1465920	1468920	Irish
1468920	1469920	aboriginal
1469920	1471920	He is looking for some
1471920	1472920	fishing village
1472920	1473920	some
1473920	1474920	small villages
1474920	1476920	That place
1476920	1477920	is Arab
1477920	1478920	them
1478920	1479920	That place is
1479920	1480920	next to the extreme
1480920	1482920	That is their Så
1482920	1483920	Is long in summer
1483920	1484920	Very short in winter
1484920	1485920	Maybe one or two months
1485920	1487920	Can't see the sun
1487920	1488920	That
1488920	1489920	Our team
1489920	1490920	I did not go
1490920	1491920	But we have some
1491920	1492920	Humanists
1492920	1493920	Squatting there
1493920	1494920	They are there
1494920	1495920	Visit these American aborigines
1495920	1497920	Looking at their social network
1497920	1498920	Just ask
1498920	1499920	Who are you familiar with
1499920	1500920	Then who is familiar with who
1500920	1501920	That
1501920	1502920	And some of them
1502920	1503920	Psychological research
1503920	1504920	because
1504920	1505920	We know that
1505920	1507920	People near the extreme
1507920	1509920	Their alcoholism rate is high
1509920	1510920	Then their
1510920	1512920	The suicide rate of adult males is high
1512920	1513920	So we want to see
1513920	1514920	These
1514920	1516920	Some negative features
1516920	1518920	Or healthy behavior
1518920	1519920	He will
1519920	1521920	Will it be affected by his social network
1521920	1522920	Or will he turn around
1522920	1524920	To affect his social network
1524920	1526920	So we are from
1526920	1528920	Humanists squatting to get information
1528920	1529920	To build a social network
1529920	1530920	Then look again
1530920	1531920	It's them
1531920	1532920	The health behavior of these people
1532920	1533920	Or some other behaviors
1533920	1535920	Like these people
1535920	1536920	Is there any resource
1536920	1537920	Willing to help others
1537920	1538920	Or
1538920	1540920	Willing to provide other people with knowledge
1540920	1541920	We look at it from the perspective of social networks
1541920	1542920	Look at the behavior of these people
1542920	1543920	it is good
1543920	1545920	The first thing to do
1545920	1546920	It's us
1546920	1547920	Of course it is
1547920	1548920	Get these people's network
1548920	1549920	We just ask
1549920	1550920	Who are you friends with
1550920	1552920	How familiar are you with him
1552920	1554920	Then this is usually
1554920	1556920	It's the way sociologists do it
1556920	1557920	In fact, social networks
1557920	1559920	From the perspective of sociologists
1559920	1560920	They started doing it very early
1560920	1562920	Started doing it in the 1930s
1562920	1564920	They will draw a social graph
1564920	1565920	They asked a person
1565920	1566920	Who are you familiar with
1566920	1567920	Who is not familiar with
1567920	1568920	That
1568920	1569920	Of course we did this part
1569920	1570920	The other way we did
1570920	1571920	Is we want
1571920	1573920	Look at it by sampling
1573920	1574920	Can I just draw
1574920	1576920	In this village
1576920	1578920	Maybe a part of the hundreds of people
1578920	1579920	Maybe 5%
1579920	1580920	Maybe 10%
1580920	1581920	Or 30%
1581920	1582920	If we only draw a part of the people
1582920	1583920	Then we ask him
1583920	1584920	Hey, you think
1584920	1586920	Who is familiar with whom in this network
1586920	1589920	Can we restore the entire network
1589920	1590920	I don't ask everyone
1590920	1591920	Who is he familiar with
1591920	1593920	And just do sampling
1593920	1594920	If you draw a sample
1594920	1596920	Can you restore the entire network
1596920	1597920	But this may not be the same
1597920	1599920	Because if you draw a sample
1599920	1600920	You may find people
1600920	1601920	He is to guess
1601920	1603920	Other people's networks
1603920	1604920	He is
1604920	1606920	He is a subjective recognition
1606920	1607920	Other people's
1607920	1609920	Exchange status or relationship status
1609920	1610920	Then we want to compare
1610920	1612920	Is the difference between these two networks
1612920	1613920	One is your subjective
1613920	1615920	Your own report
1615920	1617920	For example, I am with A or B
1617920	1618920	I am with these two people
1618920	1619920	Who is a friend
1619920	1620920	Who is not a friend
1620920	1621920	Another angle is
1621920	1623920	The angle we use here is
1623920	1625920	I went to see
1625920	1626920	The first three people
1626920	1628920	Then I went to see if they had a relationship
1628920	1629920	If there is a relationship
1629920	1630920	I report
1630920	1631920	If it doesn't matter
1631920	1633920	I also said they had nothing to do with it
1633920	1634920	So what we rely on is
1634920	1635920	Third party report
1635920	1637920	That third party report
1637920	1638920	He can tell us
1638920	1640920	Okay, these people are related
1640920	1641920	Or these people have nothing to do with it
1641920	1642920	He may be
1642920	1644920	Presence or absence of individual properties
1644920	1646920	And pairwise relationships
1646920	1647920	So he can tell us
1647920	1649920	These people are related or not
1649920	1650920	That
1650920	1652920	According to this third party report
1652920	1655920	We can build a network with direction
1655920	1657920	There are positive and negative networks
1658920	1661920	The positive network is the general social network
1661920	1662920	He is
1662920	1663920	Two have a relationship
1663920	1665920	Give him a positive connection
1665920	1667920	If it is a negative network
1667920	1669920	The two should have nothing to do with it
1669920	1671920	We'll give him a negative connection
1671920	1673920	And this negative connection is that we believe
1673920	1674920	These two people
1674920	1675920	From the perspective of the third party report
1675920	1677920	They should be relatively unrelated
1677920	1678920	So we call it robust
1678920	1680920	They don't have that
1680920	1682920	Connection
1682920	1685920	Okay, so this is how we do it
1685920	1687920	It's actually like I just said
1687920	1688920	We're on a network
1688920	1690920	We want to do sampling
1690920	1692920	Of course, there are many ways to do it
1692920	1693920	I have a few here
1693920	1694920	Like Respondent-Driven Sampling
1694920	1695920	Snowball Sampling
1695920	1696920	Or Convenient Sampling
1696920	1697920	Or Web-based Sampling
1697920	1699920	It's all a way of sampling
1699920	1701920	So our way of sampling is
1701920	1702920	We are
1702920	1704920	Uh, invite people to participate in the study
1704920	1706920	We're a little bit like a convenient sample
1706920	1707920	And then let these people come
1707920	1710920	Provide them with their knowledge
1710920	1711920	Of course
1711920	1713920	Of course there will be some
1713920	1716920	Problems with, uh, we're going to deal with
1716920	1718920	The first one is us
1718920	1720920	Uh, it could be incomplete data
1720920	1721920	It's just that he might
1721920	1723920	Uh, this guy, he's coming to us
1723920	1725920	Say he recognizes the social network
1725920	1727920	Maybe there is
1727920	1728920	There may be insufficient information
1728920	1730920	This person doesn't know
1730920	1732920	Uh, I, we asked him
1732920	1733920	Does D have anything to do with E?
1733920	1735920	He may not be familiar with D and E
1735920	1736920	He may not know
1736920	1738920	Does D have anything to do with E?
1738920	1740920	Or he may report errors
1740920	1741920	Is that maybe
1741920	1743920	D and E have nothing to do with it
1743920	1745920	And then from the third party's point of view
1745920	1746920	He may be related
1746920	1748920	Or he may be tired
1748920	1750920	He may have done too many of these questions
1750920	1751920	Then his quality of information
1751920	1753920	Or the concentration dropped
1753920	1755920	He might give us some wrong information
1755920	1757920	The other one we face
1757920	1759920	The main risk is
1759920	1761920	Everyone's perception may be much worse
1761920	1763920	So this kind of information may be
1763920	1764920	There is a lot of this variability
1764920	1766920	Then we have to deal with these problems
1766920	1768920	Okay, so what we're going to do is
1768920	1770920	Why are we called
1770920	1771920	Perceptual Tomography
1771920	1773920	Tomography is a segmented scan
1773920	1774920	Is that you see a object
1774920	1776920	Then you can go from different angles
1776920	1777920	To do projection on it
1777920	1779920	Then what you see may be different
1779920	1781920	So you see this object in the middle
1781920	1783920	It has four entities
1783920	1786920	Then you cut from the angle of S1 and S2
1786920	1788920	It has two different pictures
1788920	1790920	Then look at it from the angle of P
1790920	1791920	It also has different pictures
1791920	1792920	What we want to say
1792920	1794920	What we want to say is
1794920	1795920	In our hearts
1795920	1797920	Uh, we might be in this system
1797920	1799920	There is a possible
1799920	1801920	Real social network
1801920	1803920	A and B are related
1803920	1804920	B and C are familiar
1804920	1806920	Then A and C do not know
1806920	1808920	This kind of real social network is this
1808920	1809920	We see these four objects
1809920	1811920	It is real
1811920	1812920	but
1812920	1813920	No one knows
1813920	1814920	What does this real network look like
1814920	1816920	It's a bit like blind imaging
1816920	1818920	You just look at it from a certain angle
1818920	1820920	What you see is what you imagine
1820920	1822920	So what we're going to do is
1822920	1824920	Find a lot of people to see this thing
1824920	1825920	See what this social network looks like
1825920	1827920	Look at it from different social positions
1827920	1829920	Or look at it from different angles of the Internet
1829920	1830920	What does this object look like
1830920	1832920	Then look at it
1832920	1834920	Can we finally restore
1834920	1836920	The social network in everyone's mind
1836920	1837920	But this social network
1837920	1838920	It may be with
1838920	1840920	Uh, the real social network is not very similar
1840920	1841920	One is subjective construction
1841920	1843920	One is a collective subjective construction
1843920	1844920	This is our current way
1844920	1846920	He is one
1846920	1848920	Uh, a more subjective objective report
1848920	1850920	Because this is my own subjective
1850920	1852920	Okay, I'm with A
1852920	1854920	With A, with C, with D
1854920	1856920	This kind of subjective objective report
1856920	1858920	Then we want to compare these two ways
1858920	1860920	What's the difference in the network that was built
1860920	1866920	Okay, so we're going to, uh, find these, uh, in Alaska
1866920	1869920	These people in the village come to participate in our research
1869920	1872920	Then, uh, everyone comes to invite us
1872920	1874920	Uh, we were invited by us
1874920	1876920	He will go and see the photos of other people
1876920	1879920	Let's say there are about 400 people in this village
1879920	1882920	Then we will show him about 40 photos
1882920	1884920	Is a person to say
1884920	1885920	Do you know these 40 people
1885920	1887920	Can you call his name
1887920	1890920	Do you know the relationship between these 40 people
1890920	1893920	If you say these people don't know these 40 people
1893920	1895920	He might not judge
1895920	1897920	The social status of these people
1897920	1898920	If you know
1898920	1900920	Let's see how we should go
1900920	1903920	Sort out some of these people's social networks
1903920	1905920	See which people are more, uh, related
1905920	1907920	Some people are more irrelevant
1907920	1910920	Okay, so the way we use it
1910920	1912920	It's the way we use this
1912920	1915920	It's the way we put these people's photos
1915920	1918920	We invite the audience to put them in different baskets
1918920	1921920	What are the conditions in the basket
1921920	1924920	The condition in the basket is that the audience should think
1924920	1926920	These people are in the same group
1926920	1928920	He just put it in the same basket
1928920	1931920	So, uh, let's say we give him five baskets
1931920	1934920	We later, uh, said, okay, so you
1934920	1935920	Of these 40 people
1935920	1937920	You may know 30 of them
1937920	1939920	You put people you think are more familiar
1939920	1941920	Put it in the same basket
1941920	1943920	If you think it's not familiar
1943920	1946920	You have to separate these people into different baskets
1946920	1949920	So this is the main way we use
1949920	1950920	We give different people
1950920	1952920	Is to look at different 40 photos
1952920	1954920	And then ask them to put them in different baskets
1954920	1957920	Okay, so, uh, what are our advantages
1957920	1959920	The advantage is that this method is very fast
1959920	1961920	Is that we show them
1961920	1962920	A small part of the group
1962920	1964920	Maybe 40 photos out of 400 people
1964920	1966920	Then we don't have to let him judge
1966920	1967920	Two out of 400 people
1967920	1968920	Because that judgment doesn't matter
1968920	1972920	The function of the human brain processing capacity
1972920	1974920	Probably not so strong
1974920	1977920	Then we only show him a small part of the paper collection
1977920	1979920	These social relations
1979920	1981920	Then again, uh, he
1981920	1985920	It can be used in some, uh, more large-scale data collection
1985920	1988920	Because we actually don't have too much burden on people
1988920	1990920	If this group is hundreds of people
1990920	1993920	Uh, or, uh, thousands of people
1993920	1995920	Maybe you can do that
1996920	1997920	What are his shortcomings
1997920	2000920	One of his shortcomings is, uh, like I just mentioned
2000920	2002920	Is that everyone's perception may be much worse
2002920	2006920	Or they may have some mistakes in the middle
2006920	2007920	Is that he may know
2007920	2011920	What he knows is different from other people's subjective judgment
2011920	2014920	Like me, I might know, uh, the first one
2014920	2017920	But I don't think there's a link between D and E
2017920	2019920	They know, but they don't know
2019920	2020920	Maybe, but D and E
2020920	2022920	Maybe they actually know each other
2022920	2023920	I might make a mistake
2023920	2025920	That's another one
2025920	2028920	I'm from a lot of different, uh, participants
2028920	2030920	To report the relationship between D and E
2030920	2033920	There may be a lot of, uh, contradictions
2033920	2034920	Or it's inconsistent
2034920	2035920	Inconsistency may be very high
2035920	2038920	We have to find a way to, uh, create a model
2038920	2041920	To deal with these problems
2041920	2044920	Okay, so this is what we, uh, are doing
2044920	2045920	This real-life study
2045920	2048920	We have, uh, human scientists squatting
2048920	2051920	A few small villages in Alaska
2051920	2054920	Their characteristics are, uh, the summer sun is long
2054920	2055920	Winter sun is short
2055920	2057920	And then, uh, there's a lot of pressure
2057920	2059920	And then the alcohol problem is a little serious
2059920	2061920	And then their, uh, income
2061920	2063920	Uh, it's probably not very high
2063920	2065920	That's just the connection between people
2065920	2067920	It's very strong
2067920	2070920	Okay, we, uh, we found a village
2070920	2072920	To do this, uh, real-life study
2072920	2076920	That village is probably, uh, about 400 people
2076920	2079920	And then they're about 95% American
2079920	2081920	That their median income
2081920	2083920	The median annual income is about $30,000
2083920	2085920	So it's just not very rich
2085920	2087920	So what we want to see is
2087920	2090920	Some of their mutual help
2090920	2091920	Who will provide help
2091920	2093920	Who will get help
2093920	2095920	And their suicide prevention
2095920	2096920	It's just over there
2096920	2098920	I just mentioned that his adult male suicide rate
2098920	2099920	Will be higher than other regions
2099920	2101920	Then we want to look at suicide prevention
2101920	2105920	Then we invited, uh, 170 people to join us
2105920	2107920	Our research is actually easy to adopt
2107920	2109920	That they're probably half of the people
2109920	2111920	Maybe 40% of the people to join this study
2111920	2115920	Uh, uh, this data collection process
2115920	2116920	It took about seven days
2116920	2118920	And then every, uh, participant
2118920	2120920	It only takes 10 to 20 minutes
2120920	2122920	To judge some of the relationships between people
2122920	2125920	Then we give him $20 each time
2125920	2127920	Then they have a fee
2127920	2130920	Okay, so this is very similar to what I just introduced
2130920	2133920	Once we show him 40 people
2133920	2134920	Or photos
2134920	2137920	Then he has to do three things, uh, three types
2137920	2139920	The first one is this person
2139920	2141920	Uh, he's a victim or a participant
2141920	2143920	He knows and is familiar
2143920	2146920	The second person is this victim
2146920	2148920	He knows, but not necessarily
2148920	2150920	The third person he doesn't know
2150920	2153920	Then we, because the third person
2153920	2155920	In fact, this person can't judge
2155920	2156920	He doesn't know him at all
2156920	2159920	So now we're looking at the first and the second
2159920	2160920	The first person is familiar
2160920	2162920	The second person is not familiar
2162920	2165920	The first kind of people are usually family members
2165920	2167920	Is your parents or siblings
2167920	2170920	This person, the first class, is much less than the second class
2170920	2173920	Then we think the first class of information is too strong
2173920	2175920	Then we only use the second class of information
2175920	2177920	We ask these participants
2177920	2179920	Only the second class of people you know
2179920	2180920	But not very familiar
2180920	2183920	And then we put these people's photos
2183920	2187920	And then let the participants, the victims, come to the five categories
2187920	2189920	In five boxes or buckets
2189920	2191920	That's what we told him
2191920	2192920	The same bucket of conditions
2192920	2193920	It's these people
2193920	2195920	You think he's in the same social group
2195920	2197920	Or you think these people are familiar
2197920	2199920	Okay, so we've done it
2199920	2200920	Put one and two together
2200920	2201920	Know very familiar
2201920	2202920	He knows and is not familiar
2202920	2203920	I've also done it, just put two
2203920	2206920	These two results are similar
2206920	2208920	Okay, so we're still
2208920	2210920	Uh, to these people
2210920	2212920	He also took some of his characteristics
2212920	2214920	It's like he's not going to do this
2214920	2216920	The community has positive contributions
2216920	2217920	It's A1
2217920	2219920	Will he help young people?
2219920	2220920	It's A2
2220920	2221920	Does he have a drinking problem?
2221920	2223920	Or is he causing trouble?
2223920	2228920	Or is he doing something bad?
2235920	2237920	So what we're looking at now is
2237920	2240920	How do we build this social network?
2240920	2242920	That's the main way we build it
2242920	2244920	It's based on these victims
2245920	2247920	To divide people into five groups
2247920	2249920	This way to build a social network
2249920	2251920	Our starting point is like this
2251920	2254920	If there are a lot of people today
2254920	2257920	He put both of them in the same box
2257920	2260920	We have a high degree of certainty
2260920	2261920	We'll take it
2261920	2263920	I think these two people should be very
2263920	2265920	It should be very likely to know
2265920	2268920	It should be very likely to have this positive relationship
2268920	2270920	So if today
2270920	2272920	A lot of people report that these two people
2272920	2273920	It doesn't matter
2273920	2275920	We divide it into different boxes
2275920	2277920	Then we have a lot of confidence
2277920	2279920	Say these two people should have nothing to do with it
2279920	2280920	If it doesn't matter
2280920	2281920	We'll give him a negative tie
2281920	2282920	Negative tie
2282920	2284920	It's not that they have hostility
2284920	2285920	It's that they are
2285920	2286920	We have a lot of confidence
2286920	2288920	They should have nothing to do with it
2288920	2289920	So we're going to build this
2289920	2291920	The basis of the judgment
2291920	2294920	Okay, so we're going to talk about it
2294920	2297920	We take it as a random comparison
2297920	2299920	If you say two people
2299920	2301920	We'll see
2301920	2303920	People put
2303920	2305920	Uh, two people in the same box
2305920	2306920	What is the probability?
2306920	2307920	It's completely random
2307920	2308920	How much
2308920	2309920	And then we see
2309920	2310920	He
2310920	2312920	Two people are put in the same box
2312920	2314920	How much is it different from random
2314920	2315920	So we're going to have a
2315920	2317920	If there's a no model
2317920	2319920	Let's look at this
2319920	2321920	And then there's some calculation
2321920	2323920	Is that people really put this two people
2323920	2325920	The probability of putting the same box
2325920	2327920	The probability of putting two people in different boxes
2327920	2328920	We can use some
2328920	2330920	The combination of mathematical methods to calculate
2330920	2331920	Calculate his odds
2331920	2333920	And this is a false assumption
2333920	2334920	We want to compare
2334920	2335920	A reference standard
2335920	2336920	So we're looking at
2336920	2338920	How far is he from this standard
2338920	2339920	The farther away
2339920	2340920	That means we're going to
2340920	2341920	This matter
2341920	2342920	These things
2342920	2343920	They should have something to do with it
2343920	2344920	Or it shouldn't have anything to do with it
2344920	2345920	This judgment
2345920	2347920	It's going to be more and more intense
2347920	2349920	Okay, and then it's the same thing
2349920	2350920	That's what we're looking at
2350920	2351920	What's the probability
2351920	2353920	So let's look at this example
2353920	2355920	There are 393 people in this village
2355920	2357920	And we've got 172 people
2357920	2358920	Experimental research
2358920	2359920	That we
2359920	2360920	This B is equal to 50
2360920	2362920	We let him put five boxes
2362920	2363920	That K is equal to 40
2363920	2365920	They look at 40 photos at a time
2365920	2367920	Gamma is equal to 0.76
2367920	2369920	They know 76% of them
2369920	2371920	On average, one person knows
2371920	2372920	Of the 40 people
2372920	2374920	Maybe 76% of the people
2374920	2376920	So we're going to look at one
2376920	2378920	This is from a false assumption
2378920	2380920	A no model
2380920	2382920	That's what he is
2382920	2384920	What we're looking at is
2384920	2386920	5% of the end odds
2387920	2389920	If there are two people, three people, four people
2389920	2393920	Here's a 1.61, 0.1, 0.01 percentage
2393920	2395920	If he falls in
2395920	2397920	Uh, more than two people, more than three people
2397920	2398920	More than four people
2398920	2400920	If you put it in the same box
2400920	2402920	We think
2402920	2406920	These two people have a lot to do with it
2406920	2408920	Because this is from no model
2408920	2409920	Let's compare
2409920	2411920	Let's look at 5% of the end odds
2411920	2412920	A point
2412920	2413920	That this is
2413920	2414920	There are up to 5% of the end odds
2415920	2416920	If it's more than two people
2416920	2418920	If you put them in the same box
2418920	2419920	We think
2419920	2422920	These two people have a positive relationship
2422920	2424920	Okay, the same way
2424920	2426920	We can also make another version
2426920	2427920	No model is
2427920	2428920	How many people are there
2428920	2430920	Put these two people in different boxes
2430920	2431920	We'll say
2431920	2432920	These two people should have nothing to do with it
2432920	2434920	Then we still take 5% as an end point
2434920	2436920	Start counting from the back
2436920	2438920	From six people, five people, four people, three people
2438920	2439920	Stop
2439920	2441920	That's less than 5%
2441920	2443920	So if there are three people
2443920	2445920	Put two people
2445920	2446920	Maybe it's D and E
2446920	2447920	Put it in different boxes
2447920	2448920	We'll think
2448920	2450920	Okay, that's it
2450920	2451920	Uh, these two people
2451920	2452920	D and E should be
2452920	2454920	There is a significant relationship
2454920	2456920	Or a significant lack of knowledge
2456920	2458920	Ah, that's it
2458920	2459920	This is what we just talked about
2459920	2461920	Is that you take 5% as an end point
2461920	2463920	Or 5% as an end point
2463920	2465920	Then use the way of building the network just now
2465920	2468920	You can build two networks
2468920	2470920	The first one is a network with a positive relationship
2470920	2472920	The positive relationship is black
2472920	2474920	The second is a network with a negative relationship
2474920	2476920	We use red to show the negative relationship
2476920	2477920	So these points are the same
2477920	2479920	Then we can build
2479920	2481920	It has two symbol networks
2481920	2482920	One is a positive network
2482920	2484920	A negative network
2484920	2487920	Then we have some data on these networks
2487920	2489920	The data is that it has
2489920	2491920	These two networks actually look very similar
2491920	2493920	That's because there are some points
2493920	2494920	It's not drawn
2494920	2495920	So there are fewer points on the negative network
2495920	2497920	Then its density is very similar
2497920	2499920	Then its average distance is very similar
2499920	2501920	Then its centrality is very similar
2501920	2503920	These two networks actually look very similar
2503920	2505920	Ok, then we can still follow
2505920	2508920	Ah, the positive network and the negative network characteristics just now
2508920	2510920	Sort the network groups
2510920	2512920	Ah, you may have heard of some
2512920	2514920	Is to group the points of the network
2514920	2516920	What does grouping mean
2516920	2517920	Grouping is
2517920	2520920	Ah, if you see a network
2520920	2522920	It has a lot of connections within a group
2522920	2524920	If there are very few connections between groups
2524920	2526920	Then the result of this grouping should be good
2526920	2527920	Just like
2527920	2530920	Ah, you can use their department to group college students
2530920	2532920	Or use their hospital to group
2532920	2535920	The connection between groups should be
2535920	2537920	Much less than the connection between groups
2537920	2539920	Much less
2539920	2541920	So we have this positive network
2541920	2542920	If you have a negative network
2542920	2543920	We think
2543920	2545920	A reasonable classification is a group
2545920	2548920	There should be a lot of positive connections in the middle
2548920	2550920	There should be a lot of negative connections between groups
2550920	2552920	So if we have a positive and a negative network
2552920	2554920	Then we can group
2554920	2556920	Then let's see
2556920	2558920	The final grouping result will be the best
2558920	2559920	Ah, here
2559920	2561920	Ah, it turns out that the result of grouping six groups is the best
2561920	2563920	Its balance score is the lowest
2563920	2565920	The lowest means that its grouping effect is the best
2565920	2567920	Then we divide these networks into six groups
2567920	2569920	Ah, after dividing into six groups
2569920	2571920	It probably looks like this
2571920	2573920	Ah, then we can
2573920	2575920	To these groups
2575920	2577920	Describe some of the characteristics
2577920	2578920	Because we just said
2578920	2579920	We asked these people
2579920	2581920	Ah, what are the characteristics
2581920	2582920	He is willing to help others
2582920	2583920	Then he
2583920	2587920	Ah, will there be some alcoholism or suicidal tendencies
2587920	2589920	Then we will do it to these six groups
2589920	2591920	Ah, like using multinomial
2591920	2593920	To see what characteristics they have
2593920	2594920	We will find one
2594920	2596920	The largest group as the baseline
2596920	2597920	As a benchmark
2597920	2599920	Look at the other five groups and the benchmark
2599920	2601920	What are its characteristics
2601920	2604920	Ah, the third category is the largest
2604920	2605920	The third group is the largest
2605920	2606920	Then we can
2606920	2608920	Give some connections to other groups
2608920	2610920	If there is help, give him some connections
2610920	2612920	The first group of people is him
2612920	2615920	Ah, if he finds his friend
2615920	2617920	Ah, make some trouble
2617920	2619920	The first group of people will help him
2619920	2623920	Ah, here are some of the characteristics of each group
2623920	2624920	Some groups have no characteristics
2624920	2625920	Like the fourth group of people
2625920	2627920	Maybe it's the same as the third group
2627920	2629920	It's not on this
2629920	2632920	Okay, so this, uh, this part
2632920	2634920	We just look at
2634920	2636920	Use a network sampling method
2636920	2637920	Use a third party report
2637920	2640920	To restore a well-known mainstream network
2640920	2642920	Then we look at this network
2643920	2645920	Objective response
2645920	2646920	Say this person is my friend
2646920	2647920	This person is not my friend
2647920	2649920	What is the difference between this network
2649920	2650920	Then we found that this relationship
2650920	2652920	About 50%
2652920	2653920	As for
2653920	2655920	Ah, what are the reasons
2655920	2657920	What are the reasons that make a person more accurate
2657920	2658920	More accurate judgment
2658920	2659920	What are the reasons that make a person more inaccurate judgment
2659920	2661920	This is what we need to study later
2661920	2663920	Then we also put these people
2663920	2665920	Ah, some of his characteristics
2665920	2667920	Ah, find it out
2667920	2669920	Then we also put this subjective network
2669920	2671920	Do some classification
2671920	2673920	Okay, this one
2673920	2675920	Um, the plan can be extended
2675920	2678920	Ah, some of the possibilities that can be extended
2678920	2680920	We can change his
2680920	2681920	Sample size
2681920	2683920	Is to change the proportion of his sample
2683920	2684920	Ah, or the number
2684920	2685920	Then we can change
2685920	2687920	The number of boxes
2687920	2688920	We all have to say
2688920	2689920	These conditions will be
2689920	2692920	Ah, what kind of impact will we have on the final result
2692920	2693920	That
2693920	2695920	We have to compare again
2695920	2697920	Our subjective social network
2697920	2698920	With the general traditional
2698920	2700920	What is the difference between everyone's social network
2700920	2701920	Some people can see it
2701920	2702920	Some people can't see it
2702920	2703920	These are the things that need to be studied later
2703920	2704920	That
2704920	2705920	His way of research
2705920	2707920	He can also be extended to other circumstances
2707920	2709920	He doesn't have to be in a village
2709920	2710920	He can be
2710920	2712920	Ah, some small groups
2712920	2715920	Just like a company or a university
2715920	2717920	About hundreds of people
2717920	2719920	Then you give a part of the people
2719920	2721920	To participate in this
2721920	2722920	Investigation
2722920	2723920	Show him dozens of people's photos
2723920	2725920	Then let him do similar things
2725920	2726920	But
2726920	2727920	He has this extent of restriction
2727920	2728920	He may be in a city
2728920	2729920	There is no way to do this
2729920	2731920	So we are probably a small group
2731920	2733920	We can do similar things
2733920	2735920	Okay, this is the first one I want to talk about
2735920	2737920	That second part is
2737920	2738920	I want to measure
2738920	2739920	In this network
2739920	2741920	We do some intervention measures
2741920	2742920	I want to judge this intervention measure
2742920	2744920	Is there any effect of external spread
2744920	2745920	Or this
2745920	2747920	This intervention measure is actually useless
2747920	2748920	He is
2748920	2750920	Better than we expected
2750920	2752920	Okay, this intervention measure
2752920	2755920	Uh, his feature is that he has a social network behind him
2755920	2757920	That is, we already know that these people
2757920	2758920	What does the social network look like?
2758920	2760920	This social network is different from the social network we just talked about
2760920	2761920	Not everyone
2761920	2763920	The third party judges the subjective social network
2763920	2765920	It is the social network reported by everyone
2765920	2767920	We know these people
2767920	2768920	Under the social network
2768920	2769920	We want to see
2769920	2771920	For these people
2771920	2772920	Willing to come
2772920	2774920	Uh, maybe improve your own health behavior
2774920	2775920	We give him this intervention measure
2775920	2776920	We want to see
2776920	2778920	A few months later
2778920	2780920	How strong is the effect of this intervention measure
2780920	2782920	Can we quantify this strength
2782920	2784920	Okay, so
2784920	2786920	Uh, what we do is still
2786920	2787920	This
2787920	2788920	Uh, in this community
2788920	2790920	We let these people participate in our
2790920	2792920	This health behavior improvement measure
2792920	2794920	What about this health behavior improvement measure?
2794920	2796920	We are going to do some suicide prevention
2796920	2797920	Behavior
2797920	2798920	That's what we want to say
2798920	2801920	Hey, actually your mental state is very important
2801920	2803920	And then you have to take care of others often
2803920	2804920	Or you have to know
2804920	2806920	Your own mental health
2806920	2808920	Is there any risk?
2808920	2809920	Is there any danger?
2809920	2811920	You have to get some support from society
2811920	2813920	it is good
2813920	2815920	What is the way we use
2815920	2817920	The way we use it is
2817920	2820920	Uh, we first need to have a social network map
2820920	2821920	Is that we have to know first
2821920	2822920	Say this
2822920	2823920	The people in this village
2823920	2825920	They, uh, people and people are each other
2825920	2826920	How is it
2826920	2828920	Uh, there is this social relationship
2828920	2830920	Then again, we have to look at
2830920	2832920	Uh, what are we measuring?
2832920	2834920	What we want to measure is this intervention measure
2834920	2835920	Does it work?
2835920	2836920	Then we have to look at
2836920	2838920	Hey, today I'm talking about
2838920	2840920	Suppose I'm going to look at smoking
2840920	2841920	I'll look at smoking
2841920	2843920	Uh, at the first time
2843920	2845920	We look at everyone's smoking
2845920	2846920	Then the second time
2846920	2849920	Or, uh, other health behaviors
2849920	2850920	Then look at the second wave
2850920	2851920	The second time
2851920	2853920	Have these people's health behaviors changed
2853920	2855920	Through our intervention measures
2855920	2857920	Then we have to know
2857920	2859920	We can only do this
2859920	2860920	Some of the points in the network
2860920	2863920	Interference in their behavior
2863920	2865920	We might be with some of them
2865920	2867920	To participate in this, uh,
2867920	2870920	Some education on this bad behavior
2870920	2872920	We hope to change their behavior
2872920	2873920	Then we want to see
2873920	2874920	These interventions
2874920	2876920	Did it spread to their neighbors?
2876920	2878920	Because they're a pretty small group
2878920	2879920	And it's a very tight group
2879920	2881920	We want to see this intervention measure
2881920	2884920	The spread effect on this network
2884920	2886920	Okay, uh, just like I said
2886920	2888920	We're doing this, uh, suicide prevention research
2888920	2890920	Let's see
2890920	2892920	Uh, the main thing is to look at the network
2892920	2894920	The relationship between a pair of diets
2894920	2895920	What is diet diet?
2895920	2897920	Um, if there's a link between A and B
2897920	2898920	He's a diet
2898920	2899920	If there's no link, it's a diet
2899920	2901920	It's a pair of pairs
2901920	2903920	It's a pair of pairs
2903920	2907920	The main thing is to see if there's a relationship like this
2907920	2909920	He's on the Internet
2909920	2911920	His good behavior or bad behavior
2911920	2913920	Is there any significant change?
2913920	2914920	In every wave
2914920	2915920	In two waves
2915920	2917920	Is there any significant change?
2917920	2921920	Okay, uh, we're going to build this model now
2921920	2923920	How to build this model
2923920	2924920	Because, uh, we know
2924920	2927920	We only have this part of the people on the Internet
2927920	2929920	Give them this participatory research
2929920	2931920	So what about the first variable A?
2931920	2934920	The first variable A is, uh, we have a picture first
2934920	2935920	It's on G
2935920	2936920	G is the name of the network
2936920	2940920	The meaning of the network is that he has a point V and a link E
2940920	2942920	That A is a function of V
2942920	2945920	That is, V is every point
2945920	2947920	Did he participate in our intervention measures?
2947920	2950920	Or, uh, the suicide prevention of this behavior
2950920	2951920	This lecture
2951920	2954920	If he's involved, he'll give him E
2954920	2956920	If you're not involved, give him 0
2956920	2958920	Okay, what about the second part of B?
2958920	2960920	B is looking at his behavior
2960920	2962920	Is there any change in his state?
2962920	2964920	So he has two time points
2964920	2965920	He's at the zero point
2965920	2968920	He's not yet, uh, he's not yet involved
2968920	2971920	His behavior before this suicide prevention lecture
2971920	2973920	If he has this behavior
2973920	2974920	Is E
2974920	2976920	Maybe this behavior is a bad behavior
2976920	2977920	It's like smoking
2977920	2978920	Maybe there's a suicide tendency
2978920	2979920	He's E
2979920	2981920	So at the second time point
2981920	2984920	Time point E is that they're already, uh, prevention
2984920	2985920	The behavior has passed
2985920	2986920	Intervention has passed
2986920	2987920	But this person doesn't necessarily participate
2987920	2988920	But he's still in this state
2988920	2989920	Change
2989920	2990920	Zero is not in this state
2990920	2991920	E is in this state
2991920	2994920	So we have six numbers
2994920	2995920	To record the whole process
2995920	2996920	The first one is A
2996920	2998920	A is whether he participated in this intervention
2998920	3002920	B is in under two times
3002920	3004920	Is he showing this behavior?
3004920	3006920	So he has four in B
3006920	3008920	Uh, there are four divisions
3008920	3010920	If A, there are two divisions
3010920	3015920	So let's see
3015920	3017920	He's under two points in time
3017920	3019920	T0 and T1
3019920	3020920	We're going to look at his
3020920	3022920	Uh, all these diets
3022920	3023920	These pairs of
3023920	3025920	His behavior changes
3025920	3028920	So let's make some records
3028920	3029920	Because we're looking at every one of them
3029920	3030920	It's diet
3030920	3033920	It's X and Y
3033920	3034920	Suppose we're looking at
3034920	3036920	Uh, UV, this pair
3036920	3037920	UV, he's on the Internet
3037920	3038920	There are links
3038920	3039920	He is
3039920	3040920	U and V are friends
3040920	3042920	Then they have a link in the middle
3042920	3044920	Then we're going to look at
3044920	3046920	In the way of this record
3046920	3048920	His, uh, participation
3048920	3050920	What is the value of this behavior?
3050920	3052920	So the bottom is
3052920	3054920	We're calculating this XY PQR
3054920	3056920	PQRS
3056920	3057920	What is XY?
3057920	3059920	XY is this point
3059920	3061920	Does he participate in this way?
3061920	3063920	What is the y-axis?
3063920	3064920	What is the y-division?
3064920	3065920	The y-division is point B
3065920	3067920	Did you participate in this way?
3067920	3068920	What about P?
3068920	3070920	P is point U
3070920	3071920	He's in the zero time
3071920	3072920	He has
3072920	3075920	He has this behavior in the zero time
3075920	3077920	That Q is point V
3077920	3079920	Is there this behavior in the zero time?
3079920	3081920	R is point U
3081920	3083920	Is there this behavior in T equals 1?
3083920	3085920	S is point V
3085920	3087920	Is there this behavior in T equals 1?
3087920	3089920	So let's do some
3089920	3090920	The changes in the amount
3090920	3091920	This is all
3091920	3092920	This looks a little complicated
3092920	3093920	But he's just a
3093920	3094920	Bookkeeping
3094920	3095920	He's just recording
3095920	3096920	XY PQRZ
3096920	3098920	The amount of this thing
3098920	3099920	X can be equal to 0
3099920	3100920	It can be equal to 1
3100920	3101920	Y can be equal to 0
3101920	3102920	It can be equal to 1
3102920	3103920	S can be equal to 0
3103920	3104920	It can be equal to 1
3104920	3105920	So we're going to record
3105920	3107920	The number of changes in these things
3107920	3108920	Let's give an example
3108920	3110920	The example is
3110920	3112920	I'm looking at XY PQRS
3112920	3115920	But I might be looking at a T
3115920	3117920	What I'm looking at is a 1 0
3117920	3118920	1 1 0 1
3118920	3119920	What does this mean?
3119920	3120920	This is XY
3120920	3121920	What about this pair?
3121920	3123920	X participates in the defense
3123920	3124920	X is 1
3124920	3125920	Y does not participate in the defense
3125920	3126920	Y is 0
3126920	3128920	X at T time
3128920	3130920	He has this bad behavior
3130920	3131920	Is 1
3131920	3132920	Y at T equals 0 time
3132920	3134920	He also has this behavior
3134920	3135920	Is 1
3135920	3137920	At T equals 1
3137920	3138920	When T1
3138920	3140920	X no longer has this behavior
3140920	3141920	It becomes 0
3141920	3142920	But Y still has this behavior
3142920	3143920	He is 1
3143920	3144920	Then we have to look at this
3144920	3145920	How many pairs are there?
3145920	3146920	So we just saw
3146920	3147920	This has a total of
3147920	3149920	The combination of 2 and 6 squares
3149920	3150920	We have to look at 64 values
3150920	3152920	How many changes does it have?
3152920	3153920	Ok
3153920	3154920	Then we can put
3154920	3155920	Just this thing
3155920	3156920	Make a table
3156920	3157920	This is a map
3157920	3159920	Then we can divide it into
3159920	3161920	X participates
3161920	3162920	Y participates
3162920	3163920	Or X did not participate
3163920	3164920	Y did not participate in this combination
3164920	3165920	Then look again
3165920	3167920	Do they have these bad behaviors?
3167920	3168920	If there is a bad behavior, it is a black dot
3168920	3170920	No bad behavior is a white dot
3170920	3171920	Then we can put
3171920	3174920	The total of 64 numbers
3174920	3175920	Recorded on this
3175920	3176920	Then we have to look at this
3176920	3179920	64 numbers and time changes
3179920	3180920	That
3180920	3181920	Next is the social scientist
3181920	3185920	Some values of concern
3185920	3186920	The first one is
3186920	3187920	We want to see
3187920	3188920	This intervention
3188920	3190920	For the participants themselves
3190920	3191920	Does it have positive results?
3191920	3192920	Is there a positive effect?
3192920	3194920	It is direct treatment success
3194920	3195920	In a social context
3195920	3196920	Is in this social network
3196920	3197920	We give it directly
3197920	3198920	This intervention
3198920	3199920	For this person
3199920	3201920	Does it have a good result?
3201920	3202920	The second is direct prevention
3202920	3204920	In a social context
3204920	3205920	If this person
3205920	3206920	If there is no bad behavior
3206920	3207920	We give him this intervention
3207920	3209920	Can he continue to maintain
3209920	3210920	He did not have this bad behavior
3210920	3212920	The following m3 to m8
3212920	3214920	Is similar to some
3214920	3215920	Some of the values we see
3215920	3216920	I will not go into details here
3216920	3219920	Ok, m1 is what I just said
3219920	3222920	If this person participates in preventive measures
3222920	3223920	Will he
3223920	3225920	At the next time
3225920	3226920	Is to improve
3226920	3229920	He may have this bad behavior
3229920	3230920	There was no bad behavior later
3230920	3231920	This is this person himself
3231920	3233920	Then we have to look
3233920	3235920	Corresponding to within those 64 brackets
3235920	3237920	I have to look at these eight
3237920	3239920	The change in the value
3239920	3241920	The left side is red
3241920	3242920	Deep red
3242920	3243920	The right side is this pink
3243920	3244920	Plus the alignment
3244920	3246920	I have to look at these two time points
3246920	3247920	Within
3247920	3248920	The difference between the two numbers
3248920	3250920	Is there a difference?
3250920	3252920	Is there a difference between this and no model?
3252920	3254920	That this is m1
3254920	3255920	This indicator
3255920	3256920	That m2 indicator is
3256920	3258920	If this person today
3258920	3260920	He was at t equal to 0
3260920	3261920	At the time
3261920	3262920	He has no bad behavior
3262920	3264920	That he is at t equal to 1
3264920	3265920	After a period of time
3265920	3266920	His bad behavior
3266920	3267920	Is it continuous?
3267920	3268920	Did not happen
3268920	3271920	Then we have to look at the other two
3271920	3272920	The difference in value
3272920	3273920	This is the red one here
3273920	3275920	Reduce the alignment here
3275920	3277920	Pink this difference
3277920	3281920	So we can put the eight questions just now
3281920	3284920	All of them are drawn as a comparison between two
3284920	3286920	What is no model?
3286920	3288920	No model is now
3288920	3291920	We call it Poisson binomial distribution
3291920	3293920	It is Poisson binomial
3293920	3294920	Poisson binomial
3294920	3296920	It is a binomial
3296920	3300920	A wide range of binary distributions
3300920	3304920	That it is every point
3304920	3305920	Every trial
3305920	3306920	Every test
3306920	3307920	Its probability may be different
3307920	3309920	So we know that the binary distribution
3309920	3310920	It is every
3310920	3312920	Distribute its test point
3312920	3313920	Its probability is the same
3313920	3314920	But Poisson binomial
3314920	3316920	It may be different
3316920	3318920	Then we take this model as our no model
3318920	3320920	Then we do this bootstrap
3320920	3322920	Bootstrap means that it is repeated
3322920	3323920	We may
3323920	3324920	For this no model
3324920	3327920	We did this experiment a thousand times
3327920	3328920	Then we look again
3328920	3329920	What we really observed
3329920	3331920	The value of M1 to M8 just mentioned
3331920	3334920	It falls in our thousand repetitions
3334920	3336920	Did it fall at the end of 5%?
3336920	3337920	If there is, we will say
3337920	3338920	Okay, this thing is conspicuous
3338920	3339920	If not
3339920	3341920	Just say this thing is not conspicuous
3341920	3343920	If it falls in the middle of 95%
3343920	3344920	Just not conspicuous
3344920	3345920	Falling at 5%
3345920	3346920	Whether it is the front or the back
3346920	3348920	We said it was conspicuous
3348920	3349920	it is good
3349920	3351920	So we are based on another
3351920	3352920	Another village
3352920	3354920	We do this thing
3354920	3357920	In the end, we still have some
3359920	3360920	We have to judge the characteristics
3360920	3362920	It's very similar to the characteristics just now
3362920	3365920	It's usually related to suicide prevention
3365920	3367920	The question is whether he has a suicidal tendency
3367920	3369920	Then will he help others?
3369920	3371920	Will he talk about suicide?
3371920	3372920	Does he have any wine at home?
3372920	3374920	Do you have any weapons at home?
3374920	3378920	Then we will follow the eight judgment methods just now
3379920	3380920	Let's see
3380920	3382920	They are in the 39 questions just now
3382920	3384920	Is it clear that the change is good or bad?
3384920	3386920	The red one is the direction of the change
3386920	3389920	The blue triangle is in the direction of the change
3389920	3392920	So some of the effects are external
3392920	3393920	It's the opposite of the positive
3393920	3395920	Some of the effects are bad
3395920	3396920	It's the opposite of the bad direction
3396920	3399920	So these can be seen from the model just now
3399920	3402920	Okay, let's sum it up
3402920	3405920	This is our second project
3405920	3407920	He wants to look at
3407920	3409920	A social network
3409920	3410920	In the relationship of the group
3410920	3412920	We give him an intervention
3412920	3414920	Then we can measure
3414920	3416920	This is a sociologist or a epidemiologist
3416920	3419920	Or some of the public health scientists
3419920	3421920	The values ​​they care about
3421920	3423920	Is there any positive behavior?
3423920	3424920	Is there any positive behavior?
3424920	3425920	Is there any spread?
3425920	3426920	We can all give a
3426920	3427920	Analyze the amount
3427920	3429920	There is a positive relationship
3429920	3430920	Or no
3430920	3432920	There is no obvious positive relationship
3432920	3434920	Then we can see this
3434920	3435920	Intervention measures
3435920	3437920	Or the external effect of this public policy
3437920	3438920	Or
3438920	3439920	What we care about is
3439920	3441920	Suicide prevention
3441920	3443920	Self-protection
3443920	3446920	The above is my sharing
3446920	3447920	So I just shared
3447920	3448920	Basically three things
3448920	3449920	The first one is
3449920	3452920	What I care about during my PhD
3452920	3453920	Is a complex network
3453920	3454920	A shared network
3454920	3455920	The second is
3455920	3457920	Can we have a third party to take the initiative
3457920	3459920	To build a
3459920	3461920	A collective subjective network
3461920	3462920	The third is
3462920	3464920	If we are on the Internet
3464920	3465920	Do an intervention
3465920	3466920	Can we find a way
3466920	3469920	To measure the effectiveness of this intervention
3469920	3471920	This is what I'm going to share with you today
3471920	3472920	Some topics
3472920	3473920	Thank you all
3476920	3478920	Thank you for today's speech
3478920	3479920	Then I represent everyone
3479920	3481920	Let's give it up
3487920	3488920	That one
3488920	3490920	Okay, I have some here
3490920	3491920	I have collected some
3491920	3492920	When you were talking
3492920	3493920	When you were talking
3493920	3495920	Some questions from the audience
3495920	3496920	Then there are some here
3496920	3497920	Is about the first study
3497920	3499920	Some are about the second study
3499920	3500920	What do you think
3500920	3501920	I'm talking to you now
3501920	3503920	How do you think it should be done
3503920	3506920	Let's start with the first study
3506920	3507920	Or from
3507920	3508920	Just turn it over
3508920	3509920	Start with the second study
3509920	3510920	See what you want
3510920	3511920	All right
3511920	3513920	In fact, we have no preference
3513920	3514920	That's good
3514920	3515920	Once
3515920	3516920	It's just a discussion
3516920	3517920	A study
3517920	3518920	If it's the first study
3518920	3519920	Answer together
3520920	3522920	Which one can start first
3522920	3524920	Okay, let me start with the first study
3524920	3527920	Just in the process
3528920	3530920	I have two questions
3530920	3531920	But wait
3531920	3532920	Before I ask
3532920	3534920	Do you want to ask yourself
3534920	3535920	Because just now
3535920	3537920	In fact, if you want to ask yourself
3537920	3539920	You can also turn on the microphone
3539920	3542920	Is that plus fish?
3542920	3543920	C H I A Y U N
3543920	3545920	And Zhang Yong
3545920	3547920	Two people have mentioned
3547920	3548920	Two people have mentioned
3548920	3550920	About the first study
3550920	3552920	You can open the microphone
3552920	3553920	Ask yourself if you want
3553920	3554920	Or
3554920	3556920	Or I can ask you
3558920	3560920	See what you think
3567920	3568920	So
3568920	3569920	I don't really understand
3569920	3570920	So what do you mean
3570920	3572920	Do you mean to ask me to turn on the microphone now?
3572920	3573920	Yes, just like this
3573920	3575920	You can start asking
3576920	3577920	Ok
3577920	3578920	Ok, then
3580920	3581920	Then I will ask first
3581920	3583920	Although I am actually the second
3583920	3584920	I am also wrong
3584920	3585920	Because that
3585920	3587920	Is it plus fish?
3587920	3588920	Sorry
3588920	3589920	I don't know how to spell your name
3589920	3590920	He should ask first
3590920	3591920	But anyway
3591920	3592920	Then I will ask first
3592920	3593920	Otherwise, I have already opened
3593920	3594920	Just
3594920	3595920	You are doing like this
3595920	3596920	Because basically
3596920	3599920	You can't draw the whole society
3599920	3600920	Then you can only say
3600920	3602920	You draw a part of the people
3602920	3603920	Then go to build
3603920	3604920	This part of the people
3604920	3606920	Give you this network
3606920	3607920	But
3607920	3608920	We know that
3608920	3610920	When doing network analysis
3610920	3611920	In fact
3611920	3614920	Where is the boundary of the entire network
3614920	3616920	Then what is its boundary property
3616920	3618920	Then there is its absolute
3618920	3619920	Is the absolute dimension
3619920	3621920	And the size of the entire network
3621920	3623920	In fact, it will affect
3623920	3625920	Some emergent property
3625920	3626920	Even your
3626920	3628920	Interaction between units
3628920	3629920	All the same
3629920	3630920	Then what do you think about this thing?
3630920	3632920	If you can't draw the whole
3632920	3634920	Everyone in the network
3636920	3637920	Any other questions?
3637920	3638920	Still
3639920	3641920	It's a question, right?
3641920	3642920	Do I answer it once?
3643920	3645920	Then I will ask by the way
3645920	3647920	Plus fish
3647920	3648920	Oh, I'm sorry
3648920	3649920	I really don't know your name
3649920	3650920	The question seems to be
3650920	3651920	Because I think it's a bit related
3651920	3652920	But his question
3652920	3653920	More specific
3653920	3654920	Then I will ask together
3654920	3655920	Then you answer together
3655920	3656920	His question is
3656920	3658920	You set positive and negative
3658920	3659920	Right? I didn't hear wrong
3659920	3660920	When study one
3660920	3661920	The first one
3661920	3662920	Yes
3663920	3664920	The question is
3664920	3665920	Then why don't you use 1 and 0
3665920	3666920	Is there or not
3666920	3668920	Why do you want positive and negative 1
3668920	3670920	So this is actually a
3670920	3671920	I think it's an assumption
3671920	3672920	So with
3672920	3673920	Maybe it's a special case
3673920	3674920	In the question of Zhang Yong
3674920	3675920	Okay, let's answer it together
3675920	3676920	Okay, I'm done
3676920	3677920	it is good
3677920	3679920	Thank you for the two questions
3679920	3681920	I will answer the question of Yan Yong first
3681920	3683920	Is what you just said
3683920	3685920	The question of network boundary
3685920	3686920	Is doing social network
3686920	3689920	A big area
3689920	3690920	Many people are doing
3690920	3691920	Network Boundary Research
3691920	3692920	Because
3692920	3694920	Network Boundary
3694920	3696920	Actually look at your research
3696920	3698920	The group of people who care
3698920	3700920	Then this thing can be
3700920	3702920	Uh, written
3702920	3704920	Some things are not written
3704920	3705920	But like
3705920	3706920	The research we are doing
3706920	3707920	Is written
3707920	3708920	Is in this village
3708920	3709920	Because it is between the village and the village
3709920	3710920	It's just a long distance
3710920	3711920	He won't have any
3711920	3712920	Connections between villages
3712920	3713920	Basically very few
3713920	3715920	Then these people are
3715920	3716920	Because they are all big
3716920	3717920	Ah, these are big
3717920	3719920	Then we are in this village
3719920	3720920	Maybe 400 people
3720920	3722920	Then this boundary is
3722920	3724920	Very certain in comparison
3724920	3725920	Then some research
3725920	3726920	Boundary is very uncertain
3726920	3727920	Just like
3727920	3729920	Suppose my other research is doing
3729920	3731920	New York City's population
3731920	3733920	New York City's population
3733920	3734920	Then this is quite uncertain
3734920	3737920	That is to say, these people are in New York City
3737920	3739920	Uh, have you been to New York City?
3739920	3740920	Or he wants
3740920	3742920	He lives outside New York City
3742920	3743920	We don't know
3743920	3745920	Or this kind of network boundary
3745920	3747920	It's hard to define
3747920	3749920	But like this research
3749920	3750920	The network boundary is also very obvious
3750920	3752920	Is that I live in this village
3752920	3753920	Maybe more than 300 people
3753920	3754920	400 people
3754920	3755920	He is our research range
3755920	3757920	Then we put everyone
3757920	3759920	Get the photo or name
3759920	3761920	And then look at this
3761920	3762920	What should the network look like
3762920	3764920	So you just mentioned the problem
3764920	3765920	It's not going to happen
3765920	3766920	On this research
3766920	3768920	Then some, uh, network boundary
3768920	3770920	It is also a very certain group
3770920	3771920	He is an organization
3771920	3773920	The people inside him may be like
3773920	3774920	A department
3774920	3776920	He may only accept 120 students
3776920	3778920	Then this network boundary is also very close
3778920	3780920	It's very, very, very obvious
3780920	3781920	Just one grade
3781920	3782920	Take 120 students
3782920	3785920	Or, uh, a company
3785920	3787920	He may have 200 employees
3787920	3789920	This is also very certain
3789920	3792920	Then we are in this kind of very certain network boundary
3792920	3794920	To discuss this matter
3794920	3795920	His grace is fixed
3795920	3797920	His grace is his network
3797920	3798920	Is fixed
3798920	3799920	Then we do this model again
3799920	3802920	So there won't be much boundary
3802920	3805920	The second question is
3805920	3807920	Why don't we use 1 and negative 1 to record
3807920	3809920	We don't use 1 and 0 to record
3809920	3810920	because
3810920	3813920	The main problem is that our 0 is also used
3813920	3814920	We 0
3814920	3815920	I didn't make it clear just now
3815920	3816920	Our 0 is that he
3816920	3817920	This relationship is not obvious
3817920	3818920	What does it mean not to be obvious
3818920	3819920	Not obvious is that he
3819920	3821920	There is a connection that is not obvious
3821920	3823920	Or there is no connection that is not obvious
3823920	3824920	He is
3824920	3826920	Uh, it's kind of like we're not sure
3826920	3828920	Is there a relationship
3828920	3829920	But 1 and negative 1
3829920	3831920	1 is that we are sure that we are very
3831920	3833920	We have this relationship
3833920	3836920	That negative 1 is that we are sure that this relationship is not
3836920	3839920	So we actually used 1 0 and negative 1
3839920	3841920	But we just saw in this picture
3842920	3844920	Uh, I'm going back to look for it
3846920	3847920	In this picture
3847920	3851920	In fact, uh, the relationship of 1 is that the relationship of positive is black
3851920	3853920	That red relationship is negative 1
3853920	3855920	He is red
3855920	3858920	As for the others that are not connected
3858920	3859920	Their relationship is 0
3859920	3861920	Because they are us
3861920	3862920	They are us
3862920	3863920	It's not obvious in the statistics
3863920	3864920	He is
3864920	3865920	We don't
3865920	3866920	We are not sure he is positive
3866920	3867920	Or is he
3867920	3869920	He is a negative relationship
3869920	3870920	So 1 0 negative 1
3870920	3871920	We actually all have
3871920	3872920	I just didn't make it clear
3872920	3874920	The positive network I just talked about is the network of 1
3874920	3876920	The negative network I just talked about is the network of negative 1
3876920	3878920	Then these two networks
3880920	3881920	Sorry
3881920	3883920	Did you see my desktop
3883920	3884920	It's empty
3884920	3888920	What I see now is a blue base
3889920	3891920	Hey, what about now
3891920	3893920	I accidentally jumped out
3895920	3898920	Hey, it still looks the same
3898920	3900920	I can't go back a little
3900920	3902920	I don't know why
3902920	3905920	If you turn off the share screen and reopen it
3905920	3907920	How about this
3907920	3908920	Share screen
3908920	3909920	Stop sharing
3909920	3910920	Good
3910920	3913920	Then reopen the share screen
3913920	3914920	Review
3914920	3915920	Oh yes
3915920	3916920	Is there
3917920	3918920	Hey now
3918920	3919920	Uh, wait a minute
3919920	3920920	Oh yes
3920920	3921920	Good
3921920	3922920	Sorry
3922920	3923920	So uh
3923920	3924920	Back to the question just now
3924920	3926920	We actually have 0
3926920	3927920	I just didn't make it clear
3927920	3929920	0 is the relationship between the two
3929920	3930920	We are not sure
3930920	3932920	The statistics are not sure
3932920	3933920	Ok
3933920	3934920	I'll probably answer this
3934920	3936920	If there are any further questions
3936920	3939920	You can also continue to discuss
3940920	3941920	That one
3941920	3942920	Uh
3942920	3944920	YUAN
3944920	3946920	XIE YUAN
3946920	3947920	Hey, Xiao Yuan
3947920	3948920	OK
3948920	3949920	Can you hear me
3949920	3950920	Can you hear me
3950920	3952920	Teacher
3952920	3953920	Hey
3953920	3954920	Hello
3954920	3955920	Hi, long time no see
3955920	3956920	Not long
3956920	3957920	A few months ago
3957920	3958920	A few months ago
3958920	3959920	All right
3959920	3960920	All right
3960920	3962920	Everyone at home
3964920	3965920	Thank you, teacher
3965920	3969920	That was a great presentation
3969920	3970920	I have a question
3970920	3971920	It's about that
3971920	3973920	Co-evolution of networks
3973920	3976920	Using your tomography method
3976920	3977920	Because I was thinking
3977920	3978920	If we want to study
3978920	3980920	The co-evolution of networks
3980920	3983920	It takes several network snapshots
3983920	3986920	If we use this method
3986920	3987920	Because every time
3987920	3989920	Participants may be different
3989920	3990920	Even if we are the same
3990920	3991920	Will also lead to
3991920	3993920	Its node distribution is different
3993920	3994920	Because I think the teacher's method
3994920	3996920	It seems to be from binomial
3996920	3999920	A node distribution evolved
3999920	4001920	That's what you think
4001920	4003920	If I use this method
4003920	4005920	And then in several stages
4005920	4008920	But the number of participants is not the same
4008920	4009920	That way I can
4009920	4011920	Compare several different networks
4011920	4013920	Between
4013920	4014920	Characteristics
4014920	4015920	For example, the second stage
4015920	4016920	Network transitivity
4016920	4017920	With the first stage
4017920	4018920	Network transitivity
4018920	4019920	Can I do this
4019920	4020920	Compare
4020920	4021920	Do some co-evolution analysis
4021920	4022920	Or does the teacher think
4022920	4023920	No, there's no way to compare
4023920	4024920	Yes, yes, yes
4024920	4025920	Thank you
4025920	4026920	OK
4026920	4028920	Thank you, Xiao Yuan
4028920	4029920	Question is
4029920	4031920	Uh, this area is
4031920	4032920	Uh, I know
4032920	4033920	I don't know if you've heard of it
4033920	4035920	Is multi-layer network
4035920	4036920	Multi-layer network is
4036920	4038920	In math or physics
4038920	4039920	Dealing with
4039920	4040920	This question just now
4040920	4041920	Like a few waves
4041920	4042920	Uh, network
4042920	4044920	He gave a few snapshots
4044920	4045920	Then he wants to see
4045920	4047920	His multi-layer can be quite a lot
4047920	4048920	One is
4048920	4050920	Uh, every layer of the network
4050920	4051920	It's all different
4051920	4053920	Look at different variables
4053920	4054920	Like this
4054920	4055920	Uh
4055920	4057920	Maybe it's the same time point
4057920	4059920	One layer may be the mood
4059920	4061920	One layer may be the result
4061920	4063920	One layer may be healthy
4063920	4064920	This
4064920	4065920	Different layers
4065920	4066920	The other one is
4066920	4067920	It evolves over time
4067920	4068920	That is
4068920	4070920	He can be T from 1 to 10
4070920	4072920	You give him a live broadcast
4072920	4073920	Research
4073920	4074920	Then he will
4074920	4075920	T equals 1
4075920	4076920	One layer T equals 2
4076920	4077920	One layer T equals 10
4077920	4078920	That
4078920	4080920	People who study multi-layer network
4080920	4081920	You'll see
4081920	4082920	What's the relationship between cross-layers
4082920	4083920	It's just that
4083920	4084920	Maybe the members are the same
4084920	4085920	Some members are the same
4085920	4086920	But some members
4086920	4087920	Leave or join
4087920	4088920	That
4088920	4090920	In the multi-layer network
4090920	4091920	Under the general design
4091920	4092920	You just mentioned
4092920	4093920	These problems are all
4093920	4094920	Uh, they have
4094920	4096920	There are ways to deal with the domain
4096920	4097920	Is to leave
4097920	4098920	Or a new member
4098920	4099920	That
4099920	4101920	I just talked about this model
4101920	4102920	I didn't deal with this problem
4102920	4104920	Because I actually only have two waves of people
4104920	4106920	Then my model is also very simple
4106920	4108920	It's just that the network won't change
4108920	4109920	And then this person
4109920	4110920	Uh, it's just that the network won't change
4110920	4111920	That means
4111920	4112920	They don't have a new point
4112920	4113920	There is no point to leave
4113920	4114920	Then
4114920	4115920	The structure of the network has not changed
4115920	4116920	So I actually
4116920	4117920	There are only a few months in the middle
4117920	4119920	I just assume that his network has not changed
4119920	4121920	Because we are looking at the relationship network
4121920	4123920	That we
4123920	4125920	The assumption is that the relationship between two people
4125920	4126920	In a few months
4126920	4127920	Will not change
4127920	4128920	That
4128920	4130920	Of course you can do different extensions
4130920	4131920	You can say
4131920	4132920	Suppose you want to do 10 waves
4132920	4133920	That
4133920	4134920	Sometimes someone leaves
4134920	4135920	Someone comes in
4135920	4136920	Then I'm thinking
4136920	4138920	You have to use the multi-layer network
4138920	4139920	Structure
4139920	4140920	In that field
4140920	4142920	Mathematicians and physicists also deal with this
4142920	4143920	The problem you just mentioned
4144920	4145920	They have dealt with
4145920	4146920	That is, someone leaves
4146920	4147920	Someone
4147920	4148920	Someone new
4148920	4149920	This is all
4149920	4150920	Um
4150920	4152920	Some of the scenarios they have dealt with
4152920	4153920	So I don't think there will be too many problems
4153920	4154920	Just look at it
4154920	4156920	What is the study of the multi-layer network
4156920	4157920	How to deal with
4157920	4158920	Sorry
4158920	4159920	Because I
4159920	4160920	This model
4160920	4161920	There is no such treatment
4161920	4162920	But I
4162920	4164920	As far as I know, this can be handled
4164920	4166920	Can I ask a follow-up?
4166920	4167920	No problem
4167920	4168920	Because
4168920	4169920	Multi-layer network
4169920	4170920	Uh, I'm not very familiar with this part
4170920	4171920	But I'm using
4172920	4173920	Sienna's study
4173920	4174920	This kind of joiner and lever
4174920	4176920	Is a very common way
4176920	4177920	That is to say, different waves
4177920	4179920	Its members are different
4179920	4180920	As long as there is an addition
4180920	4181920	There are
4181920	4183920	This is indeed a very common practice
4183920	4184920	Just say
4184920	4185920	I'm thinking about the teacher's method
4185920	4186920	A more special way
4186920	4187920	Because
4187920	4188920	Usually when doing joiner and lever
4188920	4189920	They
4189920	4190920	He went to measure the network
4190920	4191920	That
4191920	4192920	Uh, the existence of the connection
4192920	4193920	Usually use the same method
4193920	4194920	That is to say
4194920	4195920	For example, I name my friend
4195920	4197920	That part is always
4197920	4198920	It's always very fixed
4198920	4199920	But I'm thinking
4199920	4200920	Teacher
4200920	4201920	Teacher, your method is to say
4201920	4202920	You are through
4202920	4205920	Comparison with a node distribution
4205920	4207920	Indirectly to deduce
4207920	4209920	It's these two nodes
4209920	4211920	Does it have a connection?
4211920	4212920	Then I was thinking
4212920	4214920	That's why this is with
4214920	4215920	General
4215920	4216920	Uh, the general joiner and lever
4216920	4217920	The problem is different
4217920	4218920	The reason is
4218920	4219920	It's right here
4219920	4220920	That is to say, it is
4220920	4221920	Through
4221920	4223920	Comparison with a node distribution
4223920	4224920	Then deduced
4224920	4226920	Yeah, but I was thinking
4226920	4227920	This
4227920	4228920	Because it's in
4228920	4230920	When different waves of people are different
4230920	4232920	This node distribution will change
4232920	4233920	Correct
4233920	4234920	So
4234920	4235920	Is that right?
4235920	4236920	Directly above
4236920	4238920	Compare
4238920	4239920	Say different waves
4239920	4240920	To infer
4240920	4241920	Oh, these two people
4241920	4242920	These two people are connected
4242920	4243920	These two people are not connected
4243920	4244920	Mainly want to ask
4244920	4245920	This kind of part
4245920	4246920	Yes
4246920	4247920	Uh, I actually
4247920	4248920	Uh, I'm not sure
4248920	4249920	What you want to ask is
4249920	4250920	My first research is
4250920	4252920	Judging from the third party
4252920	4253920	Is there any connection?
4253920	4254920	Yes yes yes
4254920	4255920	The part of the third party
4255920	4256920	That's right
4256920	4257920	That research
4257920	4258920	It's just one wave
4258920	4259920	That's what I just said
4259920	4260920	My one
4260920	4261920	Uh, participation
4261920	4262920	Research
4262920	4263920	Research time is only one week
4263920	4264920	That is to say
4264920	4265920	He
4265920	4266920	He has only one wave
4266920	4267920	His settings are only one wave
4267920	4268920	That
4268920	4270920	Uh, I think
4270920	4271920	If you really want to do this
4271920	4272920	Multi-layer words
4272920	4273920	Then you have different waves
4273920	4274920	Then come different
4274920	4275920	Time to test
4275920	4276920	Then do this network
4276920	4277920	They
4277920	4279920	The members of each wave may be different
4279920	4281920	But I actually don't know
4281920	4282920	Say cross-group
4282920	4283920	This one
4283920	4284920	How do i change
4284920	4285920	In fact, I just
4286920	4287920	This first study
4287920	4288920	He actually only has one wave
4288920	4290920	So he was originally a
4290920	4291920	Just
4291920	4292920	Under that setting
4292920	4294920	He is a complete architecture
4294920	4296920	But I didn't think about cross-group
4296920	4297920	Comparison
4297920	4299920	Is the problem of cross-time point comparison
4299920	4300920	But
4300920	4302920	Um
4302920	4303920	You said you
4303920	4305920	How will it be done in the relevant research?
4305920	4307920	Or do you have any suggestions or questions?
4307920	4308920	Actually, I'm not sure
4308920	4309920	Because I just
4309920	4310920	I thought you were talking about the second one
4310920	4311920	Because the second one
4311920	4312920	I just talked about the second study
4312920	4313920	Only
4313920	4314920	Only cross
4314920	4315920	Comparison
4315920	4316920	But the first study did not
4316920	4317920	The first study is
4317920	4318920	I find a time
4318920	4319920	A week
4319920	4321920	Then make this network
4321920	4323920	What I want to compare is
4323920	4324920	The third party's subjective recognition
4324920	4325920	With our own
4325920	4326920	Objective report
4326920	4327920	What's the difference
4327920	4330920	Um
4330920	4332920	Yes, so I didn't think about it
4332920	4333920	Do the first study
4333920	4334920	Cross-group
4334920	4335920	Maybe it can be
4335920	4336920	But
4336920	4337920	If that's the case
4337920	4338920	These people
4338920	4339920	He will be
4339920	4340920	There are in and out
4340920	4341920	Then
4341920	4342920	Cross-group
4342920	4343920	How do i cross
4344920	4345920	Cross-time
4345920	4346920	How do I divide
4346920	4347920	Will also be a question
4347920	4348920	Because what I just said
4348920	4349920	Divide
4349920	4351920	Divide at the same time
4351920	4352920	OK
4352920	4353920	Understand
4353920	4354920	Thank you
4354920	4355920	No no
4355920	4356920	That
4356920	4357920	Let me ask a few questions
4357920	4358920	Because there is
4358920	4359920	Just
4359920	4360920	We are now
4360920	4361920	To the second study
4361920	4362920	Right
4362920	4363920	Natural conversion
4363920	4364920	So there were some friends just now
4364920	4365920	There are some questions about the second study
4365920	4366920	Then I
4366920	4367920	Uh
4367920	4368920	I'm here now
4368920	4369920	I'm probably summary now
4369920	4370920	Then ask
4370920	4371920	Then if I ask
4371920	4372920	What do you think
4372920	4373920	I'm the one who asked the question
4373920	4374920	I think I expressed it wrong
4374920	4376920	Then you can turn on the microphone
4376920	4377920	It doesn't matter
4377920	4378920	Um
4378920	4380920	It's about the second study
4380920	4381920	Ah
4381920	4382920	This Liu
4382920	4383920	Asked to say
4383920	4384920	I'll just read it
4384920	4386920	The second case
4386920	4387920	What is it
4387920	4388920	Analyze method
4388920	4389920	Analyze intervention
4389920	4390920	What about the effect
4390920	4391920	This is the first one
4391920	4392920	Then
4392920	4393920	A little bit related to this question
4393920	4394920	Is this one
4394920	4395920	There should be a surname
4395920	4396920	Ning
4396920	4397920	Ning said
4397920	4398920	Is there
4398920	4399920	Control
4399920	4400920	This control group
4400920	4401920	Or
4401920	4402920	The so-called contrast group
4402920	4403920	Because what you are analyzing
4403920	4404920	Is the effect of the experimental group
4404920	4405920	You can
4405920	4406920	You can say that
4406920	4407920	Then this is
4407920	4408920	I think it's the first group
4408920	4409920	problem
4409920	4410920	Ah
4410920	4411920	The second question is
4411920	4412920	Zhang
4412920	4413920	Is
4413920	4414920	There will be a lot of groups
4414920	4415920	Will there be a lot of groups
4415920	4416920	No no no no
4416920	4417920	In fact, only
4417920	4418920	Only the second group
4418920	4419920	The second group
4419920	4420920	There is one more
4420920	4421920	It's my own question
4421920	4422920	But that
4422920	4423920	If you don't have time, forget it
4423920	4424920	Then there is another one
4424920	4425920	Zhang Yong
4425920	4426920	He asked
4426920	4427920	Because your state
4427920	4428920	Your notes
4428920	4429920	The state is 1010
4429920	4430920	He said
4430920	4431920	He said
4431920	4432920	Is there a mix state
4432920	4434920	Then I'm not sure
4434920	4436920	What does he mean
4436920	4437920	Then if
4437920	4438920	When you answer later
4438920	4439920	Or he
4439920	4440920	Uh
4440920	4441920	He wants to clarify
4441920	4442920	You can also say it like this
4442920	4443920	Okay, that's it
4443920	4444920	it is good
4444920	4445920	it is good
4445920	4446920	Ah
4446920	4447920	Thank you for your feedback
4447920	4449920	Then I want to talk first
4449920	4450920	Is
4450920	4451920	I think it's better
4451920	4452920	Ah
4452920	4453920	Good talk
4453920	4454920	Is 0
4454920	4455920	Like the last question
4455920	4456920	Ah
4456920	4457920	Yan Yong asked this
4457920	4458920	Mix state question
4458920	4459920	Because
4459920	4460920	010
4460920	4461920	The simplest thing we do
4461920	4462920	One thing
4462920	4463920	Is binary
4463920	4465920	Always better than multi-state
4465920	4466920	Do a lot
4466920	4467920	So
4467920	4468920	We only test
4468920	4469920	Uh
4469920	4470920	Binary
4470920	4471920	Then
4471920	4472920	Ah
4472920	4473920	Let me pour this
4473920	4474920	Is
4474920	4475920	This is very similar to the first question
4475920	4477920	How do we measure
4477920	4478920	Say
4478920	4479920	Does this intervention measure work
4479920	4480920	So
4480920	4482920	Let's look at the changes in bad behavior
4482920	4483920	Bad behavior is
4483920	4484920	Maybe it's
4484920	4486920	I asked 39 questions later
4486920	4487920	Is
4487920	4488920	Of the 39 questions
4488920	4489920	Some of them
4489920	4490920	If he answers
4490920	4491920	Good
4491920	4492920	Like
4492920	4493920	Uh
4493920	4494920	Do you have the idea of ​​suicide
4494920	4496920	Do you often think of the idea of ​​suicide
4496920	4498920	If he says yes
4498920	4500920	We think it's a bad behavior
4500920	4501920	It's like smoking
4501920	4502920	Is a bad behavior
4502920	4503920	That
4503920	4504920	The way we record this
4504920	4506920	Use 01 to record
4506920	4508920	Of course you can be more complicated
4508920	4509920	You can even make it
4509920	4510920	Is a continuous extent
4510920	4512920	But for us
4512920	4513920	Is 01
4513920	4514920	Is
4514920	4515920	The first step to do
4515920	4516920	If we don't do 01
4516920	4517920	It will be more difficult later
4518920	4519920	So
4519920	4520920	We use 01
4520920	4521920	This kind of binary
4521920	4522920	Binary classification
4522920	4524920	To divide this matter
4524920	4525920	That
4525920	4526920	The way to measure is
4526920	4527920	I just said
4527920	4529920	We have 39 questions later
4529920	4530920	Ah
4530920	4531920	Sorry
4531920	4532920	There are 39 questions here
4532920	4533920	That
4533920	4534920	Every question
4534920	4535920	Ah
4535920	4536920	You can put
4536920	4537920	Uh
4537920	4538920	There is bad behavior called 1
4538920	4539920	Then there is good behavior called 0
4539920	4541920	Then we look at this
4541920	4542920	At this point in time
4542920	4544920	How many changes in 01
4544920	4545920	You were originally 1
4545920	4546920	Later maintained as 1
4546920	4547920	It means that
4547920	4549920	This person may not have improved
4549920	4550920	It's all bad behavior
4550920	4551920	At the time of 0
4551920	4552920	At the first time
4552920	4553920	Still bad behavior
4553920	4554920	That
4554920	4555920	If it changes from 1 to 0
4555920	4557920	We think there is an improvement
4557920	4558920	Under this question
4558920	4559920	He has improved
4559920	4561920	He had bad behavior
4561920	4563920	Then there was no bad behavior
4563920	4564920	Then we also see
4564920	4566920	Suppose a person
4566920	4568920	He participated in this intervention
4568920	4569920	Then his neighbor
4569920	4572920	Is there any way for him to change from 1 to 0
4572920	4573920	There was originally bad behavior
4573920	4574920	Later it became no bad behavior
4574920	4576920	We want to see the effect of his spread
4576920	4578920	So we look at this unit
4578920	4579920	Both
4579920	4581920	Two of this
4581920	4582920	Uh diet
4582920	4583920	That is
4583920	4584920	We
4584920	4586920	Of course, you can continue to look at it
4586920	4587920	That is to say
4587920	4588920	Three layers of diet
4588920	4590920	Triplet or triad
4590920	4591920	Ah
4591920	4592920	Or four layers
4592920	4593920	But we just care
4593920	4594920	We are most concerned about
4594920	4597920	Can he spread to his direct neighbor
4597920	4599920	So we all look at each one
4599920	4601920	He is this kind of two pairs of this
4601920	4602920	Uh
4602920	4603920	Connection
4603920	4604920	Okay
4604920	4605920	Then
4605920	4607920	This question is the control group's question
4607920	4610920	Actually, uh, we didn't do that
4610920	4611920	This is
4611920	4612920	This is of course a
4612920	4613920	It should be a pretty big problem
4613920	4615920	This reviewer is also asking
4615920	4617920	Then we are running directly
4617920	4618920	He is
4618920	4619920	Two networks
4619920	4620920	Then the two networks
4620920	4622920	We do the same thing
4622920	4623920	So uh
4623920	4624920	In fact, we
4624920	4626920	There doesn't seem to be a good way to explain it
4626920	4627920	But if
4627920	4628920	Of course I believe
4628920	4630920	If it's a good study
4630920	4631920	He should be
4631920	4632920	Bring
4632920	4634920	Uh, there are a lot of control variables
4634920	4635920	It's just that I might
4635920	4637920	Uh, two
4637920	4639920	Different villages do the same thing
4639920	4640920	One is the experiment group
4640920	4641920	One is the contrast group
4641920	4642920	but
4642920	4644920	Uh, our model is more like
4644920	4646920	It's a return model
4646920	4647920	It's us
4647920	4648920	My model is bootstrap
4648920	4650920	It's a re-draft
4650920	4651920	And then look at him
4651920	4653920	How much of this deviation from the re-draft
4653920	4654920	If the deviation is very high
4654920	4655920	We think this
4655920	4656920	Uh, the phenomenon is
4656920	4657920	Ah, it's obvious
4657920	4658920	Or it's obvious
4658920	4660920	That
4660920	4661920	It's just that I have this
4661920	4662920	Under the experimental framework
4662920	4663920	He just didn't do it
4663920	4665920	That's when I got the data
4665920	4667920	I got the data first
4667920	4668920	To start modeling
4668920	4669920	I got the information
4669920	4671920	Uh, both villages do the same thing
4671920	4672920	Then I report this
4672920	4673920	One of the villages is
4673920	4675920	His results are better
4675920	4676920	Then I directly take this village
4676920	4677920	The result of the report
4677920	4679920	But when we designed it
4679920	4681920	It's just that there's no control
4681920	4682920	Then we use the model
4682920	4684920	It's not a return model
4684920	4685920	We can put some variables
4685920	4686920	Put it in to control
4686920	4687920	Just the whole
4687920	4689920	The whole structure is not the same
4690920	4691920	I hope
4691920	4692920	If of course agree
4692920	4694920	If there is more control
4694920	4695920	Maybe it's better
4695920	4697920	But I'm not doing it
4697920	4699920	Professional in this area
4699920	4701920	It's just that we have this model
4701920	4703920	No
4703920	4704920	I'm sorry
4704920	4705920	That's about it
4707920	4708920	Okay
4708920	4712920	So do you have any questions for
4712920	4713920	Is there any question?
4713920	4714920	For the first study
4714920	4715920	Second study
4715920	4717920	Or even a front one
4717920	4719920	For your academic history
4719920	4721920	Such a question
4721920	4722920	Hello Wei
4722920	4723920	I would like to ask again
4723920	4725920	Is the second experiment
4725920	4728920	What is the analysis method you use
4728920	4731920	This is a more detailed process
4731920	4732920	Ok
4732920	4733920	Um
4734920	4735920	Ok
4735920	4737920	We are first
4737920	4738920	Uh
4738920	4741920	Then I might have to start from
4741920	4743920	I'm thinking about where to start
4743920	4745920	What we care about is
4745920	4747920	A intervention
4747920	4748920	Its effect
4748920	4751920	Is there any way to extend it to this social network
4751920	4753920	Friends in the middle
4753920	4756920	Is that you give a person this intervention
4756920	4757920	It's this intervention
4757920	4760920	Is there any way to spread to a friend
4760920	4762920	So we measure
4762920	4764920	Is this intervention
4764920	4766920	In different directions
4766920	4767920	Is that we have different directions
4767920	4768920	That's what I just said
4768920	4769920	The 39 questions
4769920	4770920	Is to commit suicide
4770920	4772920	Suicide prevention-related 39 questions
4772920	4773920	That every question
4773920	4774920	We can say
4774920	4776920	It has good results
4776920	4777920	With no good results
4777920	4778920	It's like smoking
4778920	4779920	Smoking may be bad
4779920	4781920	Smoking may be good
4781920	4783920	That has this information
4783920	4784920	This information is
4784920	4786920	Uh, who participated
4786920	4788920	We have these people's web map
4788920	4789920	These people are
4789920	4791920	Uh, we're sure this web map is true
4791920	4794920	Then we know that there are some people
4794920	4796920	Participate in our preventive research
4796920	4797920	These intervention measures
4797920	4798920	Then we also know
4798920	4800920	These people are at two points in time
4800920	4803920	His state in 39 questions
4803920	4806920	Maybe 1 is a bad behavior
4806920	4808920	Then 0 is no bad behavior
4808920	4810920	So I follow this, uh, information
4810920	4812920	I'm going to build a mathematical model
4812920	4814920	The mathematical model is what we just talked about
4814920	4818920	There are six aspects of this, uh, the amount of calculation
4818920	4821920	The first two aspects are in this diet
4821920	4823920	The relationship between x and y
4823920	4825920	Or the relationship between u and v
4825920	4826920	X or u
4826920	4828920	Did he participate in this preventive behavior
4828920	4829920	Did he participate in this preventive behavior
4829920	4830920	This is the first two
4830920	4832920	What about the last four
4832920	4835920	At t equals 0
4835920	4839920	This, uh, x and y
4839920	4841920	Do they have this bad behavior
4841920	4843920	The last two are t equals 1
4843920	4844920	At this time
4844920	4846920	Do u and v have this bad behavior
4846920	4849920	So we're going to do these measurements
4849920	4851920	It's just that we're going to look at this
4851920	4853920	I just talked about this 011101
4853920	4855920	He participated in x, y did not participate in x
4855920	4856920	Bad behavior
4856920	4857920	Bad behavior
4857920	4858920	Bad behavior
4858920	4859920	At t equals 0
4859920	4860920	X has no bad behavior
4860920	4861920	Y has bad behavior
4861920	4862920	At t equals 1
4862920	4863920	Let's see
4863920	4864920	Then compare with random
4864920	4865920	Random how to compare
4865920	4867920	Random is that we put these things
4867920	4869920	After calculating this value
4869920	4872920	And then we look at it as a, uh, here's a
4872920	4876920	It's a binomial distribution
4876920	4878920	It's every experiment
4878920	4881920	Its, uh, the probability of production may be different
4881920	4883920	Then we can create it
4883920	4885920	It's in every grid
4885920	4887920	What is its expected value
4887920	4888920	What is the expected value
4888920	4890920	But we have the actual observed value here
4890920	4892920	Because we are at t equals 0
4892920	4893920	When t equals 1
4893920	4894920	There are different observable values
4894920	4896920	They took this value
4896920	4897920	It's called M2, the real value
4897920	4901920	Compare with a thousand random repeated experiments
4901920	4904920	See if it's more obvious or less obvious
4904920	4906920	If it's too obvious
4906920	4907920	We say, okay, this aspect
4907920	4909920	It has a positive result
4909920	4911920	If it's not obvious
4911920	4913920	We say, okay, no, it doesn't have a negative effect
4913920	4915920	It doesn't, it has an obvious negative result
4915920	4917920	So the final way to present it is
4917920	4919920	39 questions
4919920	4921920	There are eight aspects of our measurement
4921920	4923920	Some of them are good
4923920	4924920	You see the red one
4924920	4926920	The bigger it is, the more obvious it is
4926920	4929920	Some of them are negative
4929920	4931920	The bigger it is, the more obvious it is
4931920	4934920	So that's about the whole process
4934920	4935920	I don't know
4935920	4938920	I think there's no problem with the statistics
4938920	4939920	You explained it very clearly
4939920	4940920	But I want to know
4940920	4942920	By the time of this page
4942920	4944920	How to put these different factors
4944920	4946920	Make a
4946920	4949920	It's clear in terms of understanding
4949920	4951920	Network or something
4951920	4953920	It's a kind of narrative
4953920	4954920	A description
4954920	4956920	Yes, that's good
4956920	4957920	If that's the case
4957920	4959920	We can look at it based on one question
4959920	4960920	Then we'll see
4960920	4961920	I'll just say it here
4961920	4962920	Suppose it's the 24th question
4962920	4963920	We'll see
4963920	4965920	I don't know if you can see my cursor
4965920	4966920	I'll look at the 24th question
4966920	4967920	Q24
4967920	4969920	The first one is
4969920	4970920	Diffusion of Prevention
4970920	4972920	It's a big blue triangle
4972920	4973920	It's negative
4973920	4974920	That is to say
4974920	4976920	If this person participates
4976920	4978920	His M1 is a significant negative
4978920	4979920	What is M1
4979920	4981920	M1 is what I just said
4981920	4984920	There are eight indicators here
4984920	4985920	The M1 indicator
4985920	4987920	We'll look at the definition of the M1 indicator
4987920	4988920	The definition of the M1 indicator is
4988920	4991920	You participate in this intervention
4991920	4993920	Will it cause
4993920	4994920	The change in your direct state
4994920	4996920	Is from good to bad
4996920	4997920	From bad to good
4997920	4999920	This is from 1 to 0
4999920	5002920	That's under this degree
5002920	5003920	This is blue
5003920	5005920	So this is a significant negative
5005920	5006920	That is to say
5006920	5007920	He himself
5007920	5009920	He can't have this
5009920	5011920	From 1 to 0
5011920	5013920	The second problem is red
5013920	5014920	The second face is red
5014920	5015920	M2 is red
5015920	5017920	The third and fourth are not significant
5017920	5018920	The fifth is red
5018920	5019920	The others are
5019920	5020920	Sorry
5020920	5022920	24 is the fifth significant
5022920	5024920	The sixth is the small negative
5024920	5026920	Then the seventh and eighth are not
5026920	5028920	The conclusion of the statistical significance
5028920	5030920	So we are all based on
5030920	5032920	Let's understand the questions one by one
5032920	5035920	Let's look at the eight indicators we just talked about
5035920	5037920	The eight indicators are different
5037920	5039920	Then I am in the article
5039920	5041920	We have defined these eight indicators
5041920	5043920	What are you measuring
5043920	5045920	So the final interpretation is that you see
5045920	5046920	There are 39 questions
5046920	5048920	We measured 39 questions
5048920	5050920	Within two waves
5050920	5052920	Is there any significant improvement
5052920	5054920	Or obvious retreat
5056920	5058920	So I don't know if that's the case
5058920	5059920	I want to ask
5059920	5061920	Because you have 39 indicators
5061920	5062920	Have you considered doing
5062920	5064920	For example, factor analysis
5064920	5068920	Or a multi-scale analysis
5068920	5071920	Let the connectivity between the 39
5071920	5074920	A clearer network context
5074920	5076920	Actually, I think it's good
5076920	5077920	I think we should do it
5077920	5078920	Because 39
5078920	5079920	We didn't do it
5079920	5080920	but
5080920	5081920	I think it's good
5081920	5082920	Because of this 39 question
5082920	5084920	There must be a lot
5084920	5086920	There are many repeated
5086920	5088920	There are many repeated parts
5088920	5089920	That is
5089920	5090920	But we
5090920	5091920	We didn't do it on this issue
5091920	5092920	We put this question
5092920	5094920	These 39 are seen as independent 39
5094920	5096920	In fact, the first question will not affect
5096920	5097920	To the second question
5097920	5098920	Will not affect the third question
5098920	5100920	You can think of it as 39
5100920	5101920	Indicators run together
5101920	5102920	But I agree
5102920	5103920	I totally agree
5103920	5105920	Say you can do factor analysis
5105920	5107920	Or decrease
5107920	5109920	These are all possible
5109920	5111920	But we haven't done that yet
