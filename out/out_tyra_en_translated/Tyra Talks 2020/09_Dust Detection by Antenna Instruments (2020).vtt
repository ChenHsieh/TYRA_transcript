00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
OK, thank you very much for being able to participate in the weekly speech of Taira today, and of course, thank you very much to our speaker today, Shen Mingxue, for sharing with us what she is going to talk about today.

00:17.000 --> 00:31.000
Before we start, let me quickly introduce Ms. Mingxue. Mingxue is a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.

00:32.000 --> 00:41.000
Next, we will continue to read about the details of space science related to the CU Boulder.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
But I think the most interesting thing is that when I look at her introduction, it looks like a Star Trek fan.

00:48.000 --> 00:58.000
This is the technology required for space exploration, as well as the research that needs to be solved, which is very exciting.

00:58.000 --> 01:07.000
Without further ado, let's give the time to Mingxue, and then let me warmly welcome today's speaker, Shen Mingxue.

01:07.000 --> 01:17.000
Shen Mingxue is a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
She has a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.

01:27.000 --> 01:54.000
Today, I would like to introduce the measurement and exploration of cosmic dust.

01:54.000 --> 02:10.000
If you can see my mouse on the right, we are using a lot of spacecraft.

02:10.000 --> 02:30.000
What I do is related to space. When I was in college, I watched a lot of movies, so I wanted to know something about Star Trek.

02:30.000 --> 02:40.000
There is a space engine in Star Trek, so I went to the teacher to ask him what kind of space engine could be used in space.

02:40.000 --> 02:50.000
Later, I found that it was not practical, and when I was in the master's class, I was not good at it. There is an impulse drive on Star Trek, which is the so-called electric power engine.

02:50.000 --> 03:05.000
So I went to the master's thesis and did an impulse drive. After doing it, I found that there were not many people using it in the world.

03:05.000 --> 03:18.000
At that time, the propulsion in space was still a rocket or a coolant. My so-called rocket is only the chemical propulsion and combustion. This part is related to its propulsion or other things.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
Another part is that you need to pay attention to the space environment where you are in the space when you are in space.

03:25.000 --> 03:35.000
The space environment we are in today is very different from the one we are protected by the entire atmosphere. I went to do some research on the electric power layer later.

03:35.000 --> 03:47.000
Now when I come here, we start to do star science and do some aspects related to cosmic dust. I have done some data analysis of Cassini.

03:47.000 --> 03:58.000
What I have been doing recently is the Parker Solar Propeller and the Solar Orbiter. The one above is NASA, and the one below is a project mainly cooperated by ESA and NASA.

03:58.000 --> 04:10.000
Both are orbiting within a solar unit within 1 AU near the sun. Why is it special? I want to mention this distance.

04:10.000 --> 04:25.000
When we talk about cosmic dust later, the space environment is close to the distance of the sun, the position of the solar unit on the earth, and even the outer solar system.

04:25.000 --> 04:38.000
The space environment is different. This will lead to the charging effect of our probe or spacecraft, that is, the charging effect on it or the position it is in is different.

04:38.000 --> 04:48.000
It will have a different interaction with the surrounding background environment, which may lead to different things happening on both sides of cosmic dust.

04:48.000 --> 04:59.000
The first thing we need to talk about is dust. When we go to the beach, there is also sand, or when you wipe the floor, there will be some dust. These are indeed called dust in Chinese.

05:00.000 --> 05:11.000
But scientifically speaking, these dusts still have to start with the Big Bang, which is the large-scale theory we are talking about. After all, it is the source of all matter.

05:11.000 --> 05:27.000
So the Big Bang is the beginning, and then it starts to gather or form some hydrogen or hydrogen, and then it slowly starts to have more and more ions, and then it finally forms more atoms and molecules.

05:27.000 --> 05:39.000
In the end, it forms our galaxy or the entire universe. In the middle of this process, cosmic dust is often a very important role.

05:39.000 --> 05:53.000
You often see some photos in astronomy about the nebula. The nebula is simply a cluster of clouds, which contains a lot of gas or dust.

05:53.000 --> 06:06.000
When they gather together, they become such a nebula. But because there is density inside, so when they get denser and denser, another singular noun is dense molecular cloud.

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
It is also a part of the nebula, but it slowly, because at the beginning of the universe, we said there was a strange point, and it was very hot.

06:15.000 --> 06:26.000
After it began to slowly expand, its temperature began to drop. After a long time, when its temperature became slightly less than high, and then slightly denser and denser, it began to form molecules.

06:26.000 --> 06:35.000
In the process of these formations, it slowly began to evolve and form. When those heavier and heavier substances are formed, they slowly gather.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
Because of some gravity, it will begin to form some possible stars that are going to form a star.

06:42.000 --> 06:53.000
Next, another form will appear, which is the stellar nebula. It is really going to form our star. It will encounter some gravitational collapse and gather it up.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Then, its core will begin to heat up more and more until it begins to form a fusion state.

07:00.000 --> 07:22.000
In the process of these, all of their molecules, atoms, and gatherings will begin to encounter some fine, iron, aluminum processes, plus some high-energy UV or other high-energy ions colliding.

07:22.000 --> 07:40.000
It will produce some basic examples of cosmic dust. At present, it is still in a theoretical state, which means that its theory is not yet complete, and we do not yet know how they are produced.

07:40.000 --> 07:50.000
After all, if we can be clear about this, we may be able to start thinking about how organic matter is produced, or how our life originates.

07:50.000 --> 08:01.000
In the end, this whole situation will begin to form an original nebula. The center of the original nebula is a star, and then it will start to rotate around the orbit.

08:01.000 --> 08:11.000
After the orbit, they will begin to gather into 10 stones, larger asteroids, and even form the eight stars we are in.

08:12.000 --> 08:35.000
In these cases, it forms a so-called stable orbit, which means that when you have a star-shaped orbit like the Earth, we will roughly clear out the dust of these places around the distance of our astronomical unit, either gathered or sucked into the atmosphere.

08:35.000 --> 08:46.000
If there is no gathering, there will be a small nebula between the Earth and Mars that we are familiar with.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
After billions of years, when the sun is no longer the current yellow, it slowly becomes a red giant and slowly reaches the end of its life.

08:54.000 --> 09:03.000
As soon as it explodes, it swallows all of our stars, and then it spits out those substances. It eventually becomes a small stone, becomes dust, and returns to the origin.

09:03.000 --> 09:13.000
That is, in the end, this so-called planetary nebula is directly blown up, and then it becomes a very beautiful, clouded image.

09:13.000 --> 09:32.000
That's why we usually say dust to dust. The reason we say dust to dust is because some of the cosmic dust that was created at the beginning, some small substances, and then slowly gather together to form bigger things, until they can become a solar system, a star system.

09:32.000 --> 09:49.000
In the process, there will be some satellites, some small stars, and then interplanetary dust. In the end, after the whole explosion is blown up, it will all come back again.

09:49.000 --> 09:58.000
In other words, all of us here are a part of the star system, and we are all their main components.

09:58.000 --> 10:12.000
Okay, let's jump back. In the solar system, we have a lot of cosmic dust. In the upper left corner, this is our Cassini, which was on its way to Saturn.

10:12.000 --> 10:28.000
It encountered a satellite in the middle called Enceladus. The interesting thing is that it will spray this kind of water ice dust in its south pole. We call it dust, or we call it a small particle, a small crystal.

10:28.000 --> 10:51.000
Scientists are very interested in whether there will be any life on the surface of the ice. The other one is that it can produce Saturn's E-ring, E-ring, the little crystals that we can see, which are made up of these dust.

10:51.000 --> 11:05.000
Or in the upper right corner, our moon also has a lot of dust, and then it will have some dust because of some magnetic field fluctuations and some external solar wind blowing.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
That is, before the astronauts went up there to step on a footprint and stepped on that footprint, that was the dust.

11:13.000 --> 11:31.000
There are also some very interesting examples, such as the Saturn satellite Io in the lower left corner. The volcano will erupt, and after it erupts, the particles that erupt into dust will start to go into the solar system after the gravity of Saturn's star group is finished.

11:31.000 --> 11:52.000
So there will be a part of the group coming from there near our Earth. Or we used to have people, uh, Rosetta, right, uh, European probe, they went to this, uh, 67P to learn about these dust streams.

11:52.000 --> 12:06.000
Or the Japanese who just came back, they just picked up some dust from the little stars of the Dragon Palace. Or the next new flagship plan is to go to another satellite in Jupiter, Europa, to measure some of the cosmic dust.

12:06.000 --> 12:18.000
Okay, so is there anything closer? First of all, the cosmic dust is probably going to look like this, and it's probably within a few microns. Of course, if it's a little bigger, it's probably up to 100 to 1000 microns.

12:18.000 --> 12:33.000
There is also a kind of classification, the so-called nanodust. The main thing is that if you are on our Earth, uh, I remember it was early in the morning to the east, uh, west to the east, to the west.

12:33.000 --> 12:49.000
When you look to the west, you will see something like yellow light, and yellow light is interplanetary dust, which is the so-called dust in the solar system, which is constantly fixed by the gravity of the sun, and it has its own orbit.

12:50.000 --> 13:07.000
It will scatter some of the sunlight, and what we see is the yellow light, and what we just saw is the bright E ring, which is what we just said, Enceladus, which is caused by the dust of those ice crystals blown out by the South Pole.

13:07.000 --> 13:18.000
No, or when our comet usually passes by, we will see the dust tail, the dust tail, so the dust tail is the dust tail, which is our dust.

13:18.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, since we have a lot of dust in our solar system, how do we measure it? There are a lot of measurements on the right side, including you can see the light, you can see the thermal emission, or someone can use the radar, even like Arecibo, Arecibo Astronomical Observatory, they can measure some, uh, some things about the comet.

13:36.000 --> 13:57.000
Well, the main thing we do in space, if we use a satellite or a spacecraft to measure, it is the so-called impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization.

13:58.000 --> 14:09.000
Well, what about this thing? The impact ionization mechanism is directly related to the volume or weight of your dust.

14:10.000 --> 14:24.000
So what is the mechanism of the impact ionization? If we have a high-speed L, which is generally considered high-speed, which is at least greater than 1 km per second, if our dust hits any surface,

14:24.000 --> 14:37.000
then the first thing that comes out may be some neutral particles or ions or electrons, because we have tied it up, uh, to become impact ionization, which is ionization.

14:37.000 --> 14:48.000
So there will be ions and electrons, and of course some solid pieces will be sprayed out, which is from those, from that spacecraft or anything else.

14:48.000 --> 15:02.000
Then its formula, here you will mainly see that it is related to the weight of your cosmic dust and the speed of its impact, and the speed of this impact is even more powerful.

15:02.000 --> 15:15.000
Okay, so why do we say this is important? The first one is that we can use this mechanism to understand the weight of your impact, and the weight will usually be directly or indirectly related to its volume.

15:15.000 --> 15:32.000
The other one we can know its speed, so when we know its weight and speed, if we can use other methods to know the location or source of its impact, we can roughly simulate its orbit, its position, its size in the entire solar system.

15:32.000 --> 15:48.000
If we go back, we can understand where it may come from, from Jupiter, from Saturn, or where it comes from. If we go back, we may understand, uh, or even know, uh, how long these dusts have lived in the solar system.

15:48.000 --> 16:10.000
Can it tell us some information about life that happened a long time ago or something? What about the electromagnetic cloud generated by the impact plasma cloud? Some related formulas may be related to some temperature, some speed, and some other things.

16:10.000 --> 16:29.000
So how can we measure it? Generally speaking, it is not measured by the antenna we are talking about. It is actually measured by some of these so-called, uh, a lot of electrical networks.

17:00.000 --> 17:17.000
Then we can get some scale maps, and from the scale map, we can know that, uh, the ice or dust that hit it contains some, uh, gas, carbon, CH-related, or some silver, iron, uh, uh, gold, or something else.

17:17.000 --> 17:29.000
Then these can help us understand that the components on it and even whether there are some organic matter. The one in the upper left corner is the Cassini project.

17:29.000 --> 17:44.000
Well, the instrument it carries is something similar in the middle. There is another very interesting thing that, uh, they used to install some so-called PVDF, which is a very thin film.

17:44.000 --> 17:58.000
That thin film is when there is ice or dust hitting it, it will also produce a similar electrical signal. This is just the difference between different instruments, but it is actually the same, uh, mechanism to measure.

17:59.000 --> 18:11.000
Okay, so let's go back to how we use the antenna to measure. How does the antenna do the measurement? It must have a collision at the beginning to measure something.

18:11.000 --> 18:31.000
After the collision, it is 5 to 10 or 12 kilometers per second because of the high speed. This is relative to the speed of our probe, which means that when the probe flies 100 kilometers per second, like Parker Solar Probe, it actually flies faster.

18:31.000 --> 18:48.000
After the collision, it produces the electric field cloud of Impact Plasma Cloud. It will start to expand because it is going to leave. At this time, we will have the effect of charging on the probe or on our antenna.

18:48.000 --> 19:04.000
In the end, it will be our background, because we are actually in the state of electric field in space. The electric field in our space mainly comes from some of the electrons, light, or other direct things brought by the solar wind.

19:04.000 --> 19:22.000
Let's talk about the space environment a little later. So we mainly find that if a main instrument, like the one just now, is very expensive, several kilograms, 7, 8 kilograms, or even more than 10 kilograms, it can only be measured in such a small place.

19:22.000 --> 19:40.000
But what about our antenna instrument? Our antenna instrument has a form called monopole. The difference in its measurement location is on the antenna and our probe. That is to say, anything can hit the antenna.

19:40.000 --> 20:04.000
It can also hit any part of the body of the entire probe. In other words, the entire probe is the surface area that we can measure. Compared to this small, special one, we will tell people that, of course, what we can measure is definitely not as complicated as the design just now.

20:04.000 --> 20:25.000
It may be more complicated to measure, and it may even be flat. But we can tell them more supplementary information and some basic features of Impact Plasma Cloud. So we will say that it is very sensitive because it has a very large measuring surface area.

20:26.000 --> 20:40.000
When we do research, the predecessor must have done something. What the predecessors have done is probably to say that they found that they provided some theory that after the impact, they felt that all signals were only related to the antenna.

20:40.000 --> 21:04.000
They did not consider the fact that they hit the probe, and they said that they felt that because the antenna was measuring something, it was just a probe, so it was only related to the antenna. The second person said that after the object hit it, I think it may be related to the antenna, but mainly because it hit the body, so its formula is only related to the spacecraft itself.

21:04.000 --> 21:22.000
The third person said that I think what you said before is wrong. Since our formula is called the difference between the signal on the antenna and the signal on the probe, the two may be able to measure something.

21:22.000 --> 21:45.000
So he used a correct idea to do it, but he did not know how to understand how this signal was, so he assumed some mathematical formulas and then did fitting, and then he found that the fitting was not very good, so he kept introducing new variables, and then after the introduction, he gave some experimental parameters, and finally found that it was OK.

21:45.000 --> 21:59.000
So we will sum up the above, we will find that in fact, we may not know how the signal is produced, but we know that there is a signal, and there is no good qualitative model at present, which is what we want to do.

22:00.000 --> 22:18.000
Fortunately, what the people in front of them do is to analyze two things in space. At Colorado University, we can not only do those analyzes, but we also have a so-called accelerator, we can simulate the impact of dust.

22:18.000 --> 22:30.000
What kind of device is this? It is a peletron, which you can imagine as a static accelerator, which is what I call an electron cannon.

22:30.000 --> 22:44.000
It will pass through some of our middle Particle Selection Units, which is the speed at which we can control the impact above. We can set our model to the lower left corner, which is a space probe model.

22:44.000 --> 22:59.000
We can set its floating position on the body, which is about how much. We can know that different antenna configurations are actually different, and the impact position will be related later.

22:59.000 --> 23:13.000
There is another one, because after we collide, we produce electrons and ions. If some of the students of the Institute of Engineering or the Institute of Physics know that electrons and ions, it will start to work with the battery factory, and it may rotate.

23:14.000 --> 23:28.000
In this case, if we encounter a magnetic field, or some external magnetic field, the impact plasma that actually erupts will have a different shape.

23:28.000 --> 23:48.000
Another one is that we find that the dust particles of different materials may have different reactions after they collide. This has a lot to do with the atomic mass contained in it, or some of its other substances on the surface of the probe surface.

23:48.000 --> 24:10.000
Later, we will talk about this thing, which is more mathematical or physical. We will talk about Induced Charging and Direct Charging. In other words, if you imagine this yellow ball as a charge, you put a dot outside.

24:10.000 --> 24:29.000
Finally, after we go through the so-called image charge method, we will sum it up. In other words, on this whole ball, in fact, this ball is the subsequent probe. What you measure will include the entire charge on this ball, your probe.

24:29.000 --> 24:46.000
In addition, when the external charge is further away, it will have a 1 over r decay, which is a lot of electric field, or electric position, or something else.

24:46.000 --> 25:04.000
When you are close to your parents, you have a greater limit, and when you are far away, the limit you are subject to is relatively small, and the impact you are subject to is relatively small. So what's on top of this is fixed, but what's far away from the dot will be reduced with the distance.

25:05.000 --> 25:16.000
So what about our antenna signal? You will find that this is very similar to the thing I just drew, the Cassini number.

25:16.000 --> 25:31.000
After we hit it, didn't we just say that there was a cloud, and then it went out? At this time, in general, the electrons will expand faster, and then the ions will expand slower.

25:31.000 --> 25:45.000
In this case, it will produce a signal similar to the one in the lower left corner. The main source of this situation is because your spacecraft may be positive or negative.

25:45.000 --> 25:57.000
If your probe is positive, you will absorb some negative electrons on the surface with positive electricity, and you may be negative.

25:57.000 --> 26:12.000
Then all the ions will leave, and then these leave, which is what we just talked about. In the process of leaving, it will produce different positions on your probe correspondingly.

26:12.000 --> 26:32.000
In general, you can imagine a situation, and then the electrons start to go out, so the electrons go out correspondingly to the ions that remain on your probe, so you are positive.

26:32.000 --> 26:48.000
But in this case, because we are on both sides, we usually cut off the antenna signal and the probe signal. In this case, we generally think that when the antenna is far away, we simplify it as the oscillation of the position of the probe alone.

26:48.000 --> 27:01.000
So we just said that the electrons ran away first, and the rest of the main positive on the probe, because of the negative number just mentioned, so it gets a feature of downward.

27:01.000 --> 27:14.000
Then your ions are gone, and your probe is not so positive, so it is relatively negative. Negative plus a negative number, it becomes a positive, and then it comes down.

27:15.000 --> 27:25.000
So in general, as long as you see a similar signal, in general, any beam probe in space, the signal of general dust is all like this.

27:26.000 --> 27:41.000
This is a very complicated formula, mainly to tell us that when you have something hit your probe at the beginning, the thing that hits it will produce a charge because of the oil or electricity.

27:41.000 --> 27:49.000
It is directly related to the quality and speed of the dust that hits it.

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
Next, because of the position of the probe, it may be positive or negative.

27:58.000 --> 28:08.000
In contrast, your ions or electrons will be divided into those who have enough energy to escape, or those who are trapped on the surface.

28:09.000 --> 28:17.000
Then we can get these different quantities and tell them that they are collected and stuck on it, or they can escape.

28:17.000 --> 28:26.000
The charging equation will finally tell us which ones are on top, which ones are gone, and it is related to 1 over r decay.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
There is also the so-called discharging, which is a very fun thing.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
Discharging comes from the solar wind in the space environment, for example, when light hits, it produces a light-emitting effect and kicks out an electron.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
Then your spacecraft will become positive, or the electron hits and is absorbed, and your spacecraft becomes negative.

28:44.000 --> 28:51.000
So we will have a floating potential floating position in space, which is the meaning of this so-called discharging.

28:52.000 --> 29:00.000
Finally, according to q is equal to cv conversion equation, we can get the floating picture of the position just now.

29:01.000 --> 29:13.000
What we just talked about is the equation we came up with, and we found that the equation is the so-called red thing and the green experiment thing.

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
The so-called discharging feels pretty good, and it can provide us with some numbers or some information.

29:21.000 --> 29:34.000
It tells us that after these impacts are collected, what are some of the characteristics of the electricity generation temperature, electron temperature and ion temperature?

29:35.000 --> 29:43.000
Or after it produces the electron, how can it leave its speed or its background?

29:44.000 --> 29:51.000
Because when we were experimenting, we knew the so-called position floating and we knew the speed of impact and mass.

29:52.000 --> 30:01.000
So we can understand the following things, but on the other hand, in space, we actually don't know much about the above information.

30:01.000 --> 30:09.000
So we are mainly from the following things, after you have finished, we can guess the position of the floating above.

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
Then according to our orbital mechanics calculation, we can guess that the speed of impact is about how much.

30:18.000 --> 30:27.000
Then from the following data to rebut tell us that how much is the value of our dust?

30:28.000 --> 30:38.000
So it is the so-called, we are generally talking about the measurement of the antenna instrument, it is similar to the supplementation or the measurement of a specific dedicated measurement.

30:39.000 --> 30:49.000
Then we will think that we want to make a standard model, then you will find that this kind of thing looks like Sputnik, or it is very similar to the Pike solar propeller.

30:49.000 --> 30:58.000
Because we want to know if it is hit in any place, its signal is the same, but we find that it is not the case.

30:59.000 --> 31:10.000
So this is a top view, you will find that after the impact, if it corresponds to 45 degrees away from any antenna, you will find that it actually looks very similar.

31:11.000 --> 31:20.000
That is, its signal may be almost the same, which is mainly what we said before, most of the reaction is on the probe, so it is caused by the probe charging.

31:21.000 --> 31:33.000
But when we look to the right, we will find that if your impact is very close to a certain antenna, it will have a very special peak.

31:34.000 --> 31:43.000
Then we think this is related to induced charging, because we have added this conductor antenna here, so we think it will affect this.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Then we think this is a very important reason, because the first thing you have to do is to make a box.

31:49.000 --> 31:57.000
If this kind of thing just affects your box, in fact, the number of boxes here is not the real thing, it may actually be some fake things.

31:57.000 --> 32:09.000
So we have to understand the location of the impact first, and then we can restore the real box process to get the real data hidden in it.

32:10.000 --> 32:17.000
So the paper we are writing now is to tell you that we think we can simulate this situation.

32:18.000 --> 32:32.000
That is to say, if you simplify what you just saw into a probe and an antenna, you will find that some of the boxes will be collected after the impact, and some will leave, as we just said.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
Because they are not particles at all, they are electrons, so they are charged.

32:37.000 --> 32:47.000
The charge will produce an electric field line, for example, at the beginning, when it is very close to the probe, it is all connected, slowly approaching the antenna.

32:48.000 --> 32:55.000
It is actually closer to the antenna, which means it affects the antenna more, and then it slowly ends when it reaches infinity.

32:55.000 --> 33:09.000
So when we simulate some of our problems, we can simulate some of this shape and tell people that, hey, actually, look, if this is an x-axis, it is a distance, and the y-axis is your location.

33:10.000 --> 33:18.000
You will find that compared to this round probe, in fact, as long as your charge is away from it, it is a 1 over r decay.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
That is, the further away you are from it, the less you feel its impact.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
But the antenna is very strange, it comes out of this peak in the middle.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
That's because at the beginning, the main thing that affects the charge particles is your probe.

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
But in the middle, your antenna is here, and it is more affected.

33:41.000 --> 33:51.000
So you are in these two, because we measured the antenna, subtracted the spacecraft probe, you will get this particularly high peak in the middle.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
That is to tell us that this is the reason, this is why we can get this peak.

33:59.000 --> 34:06.000
So when we can simulate this situation, after the calculation of static electricity, we can go back and get those simulations.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
So when we get those collision locations, we can start playing with all the probes in space.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
For example, Cassini, or Stereo, this is for measuring the sun.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
Or it's already far away from our ball shock, not ball shock, terminal shock.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
It's already close to leaving our solar circle, the Voyager.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
Or recently near the sun, the Parker Solar Probe, or the solar orbiter.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
There was Wind and MMS earlier.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
Then you will find that there seems to be something different.

34:44.000 --> 34:52.000
If you cut it off here, we find that the reason why we are doing experiments is that these antennas are stuck on the side.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
It's stuck with three of these antennas.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The signal it measures will be different.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
That's a lot of trouble because it has something to do with some of the configurations on our circuit.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
It's related to the C conductor between Q and CV.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
That's what we're doing right now.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
So you can imagine that when we have this method or technique,

35:17.000 --> 35:28.000
We can measure from the inner solar system near the sun to 1AU, the so-called Stereo or Wind orbit around the Earth, or even MMS within the Earth's magnetic field.

35:29.000 --> 35:37.000
Then all the way along, including Europa Clipper in Jupiter, Cassini in Saturn, or Voyager has left our solar circle all the way.

35:38.000 --> 35:50.000
So after we have this method, we can analyze all the way from the inner solar system to the outer star Gaia, all the way to the outer solar system.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
The distribution of our cosmic dust, or their orbit, or their source.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
So to sum up, we're all sources of cosmic dust.

36:03.000 --> 36:11.000
Of course, we know that we've heard of some space stuff, but we don't want to measure those ashes in outer space in the future.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
But basically, these things are all dust.

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
The second thing is that the simulation we're doing right now and the model functions we're providing.

36:21.000 --> 36:29.000
We found that it's actually a good way to analyze a signal of cosmic dust hitting your probe or antenna.

36:29.000 --> 36:37.000
So with these things we provide, we can understand some of the hidden impact plasmas in the middle.

36:38.000 --> 36:44.000
The inner characteristics of the impact probe to understand some of the temperature inside, its speed, its distribution.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
And then after the application, we can get some impact locations.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
And after we get these impact locations, we can find out where these dust comes from.

36:54.000 --> 37:02.000
And then we can understand the characteristics of the location of that planet or the original dust, or its space environment.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
And even some of the things that are measured on top may be organic.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
So can they tell us some information about where our origin comes from?

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Are we the only species in the universe?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
So that's what we're doing right now.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
Okay, I guess 40 minutes.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
So, let's start the Q&A.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
Is my microphone on? Okay, it's on.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
The timing is just right.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
Before we start the Q&A, let me give a warm round of applause to thank Mingxue for sharing with us today.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
I personally think that the first part of the presentation was very precise.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
The other part was very rich in content.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I tried my best to speak in Chinese.

37:56.000 --> 38:02.000
All kinds of demonstrations and illustrations were very impressive.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Very clear.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Very good at explaining.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Very good at explaining.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Do you have any questions?

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
If you have any questions at this time, you can turn on the microphone and speak.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
Before you speak, please tell us your name and affiliation so that we can get to know you better.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Hello, I'm Chengxin Da.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Can you hear me?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Hi, I'm Mingxue.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I'm a postdoc at UPenn Chemistry.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
My name is Chengxin Da.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I have one last question.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
You mentioned that you can analyze impact of a project.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Can you tell us where it comes from?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Yes.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That's a bit too...

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
That's a bit too...

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
That's a bit too far.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
From the analysis of its composition,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
I know you can know its mass and see if there's anything organic in it.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
But how do you know where it comes from?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Okay, good.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
First of all,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
you can start by imagining if...

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
Let's say we launch a space shuttle from the Earth.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
If you fly to the moon,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
because first of all, any probe in any place,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
we can basically calculate its orbit and speed.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
After you know the orbit and speed,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
if we can know the impact location,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
we can probably know its origin and speed.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Right?

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
The first one is the origin and speed.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
After the origin and speed,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
we have a method to calculate the speed of escape.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
So you can know the speed of escape.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
You can know who might tie it up.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
For example, is it tied up by the Earth?

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Is it tied up by the Moon?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Or is it tied up by the Sun?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
I think you can know...

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
For example,

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
your probe is between the Earth and the Moon,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
so you can know where it comes from.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
For example, if I fly to the Earth and the Moon,

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
I measure 8 km per second.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
8 km per second is probably the escape speed of the Earth.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
But it can't escape 30 km per second from the Sun.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
At this time, we would say

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
it should be in the middle.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
If you measure 5 km per second when you return to the Moon,

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
it won't be outside,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
but the speed on the surface of the Earth.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
It's about 2 km to 5 km.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
So we can guess from here.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
There's another one, like the Parker Solar Probe.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
I can't show it,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
but I can tell you that

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
when we measure,

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
we know that the closer we get to the Sun,

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
there will be a block,

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
that is, your impact will be higher and higher.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
But when they...

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
In addition to the impact,

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
they found another unknown peak.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
It's still being studied at the moment,

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
but they think that

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
in the measurement or non-passing process,

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
just at that time,

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
there was a comet passing by.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
So they think it's related to the comet.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
The comet is a dirty snowball.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
There's water in it, and there's organic matter in it.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
So we're always happy to say

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
that as long as the measurement is related to the comet,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
will there be life in the universe?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
So if we're talking about chemistry,

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
the latest thing we're going to do

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
is the Europa Clipper.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
It's going to go to Jupiter.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
If it used to be Cassini,

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
I'll zoom in for you.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
If it used to be Cassini,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
if it used to be Cassini,

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
oh, this is not zoom,

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
I can't draw this.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Wait a minute.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
If it used to be Cassini,

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
its resolution would look like this.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
OK.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Its resolution is really bad.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
You probably know what it looks like.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
But you don't know what's in the middle.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
For example,

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
its isomers can't be seen.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Yeah.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
But the latest one,

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
its resolution can be higher.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
So we want to look at the middle,

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
especially some of the carbon dioxide compounds

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
to understand

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
if there's any life in it.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
OK.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Does that answer your question?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Yes.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Very interesting.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
OK.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Does anyone else have a question?

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Or you can go ahead and ask.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Hello, I have a question.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
OK.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Hi, I'm Zheng Yunting.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I'm a Ph.D. student at Caltech.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
I do astronomy,

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
as well as cosmology.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
I think your talk is quite interesting.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
You see,

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
these things are

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
foreground for us.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
We don't want them.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
I have two questions.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
The first one is

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
I want to know

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
how much

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
the rate of

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
cosmic dust

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
is in

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Cassini.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Is it like

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
tens of thousands per second

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
or a few seconds per second?

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
We can say a few tens of minutes.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Sorry?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
We usually say

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
a few tens of minutes.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
A few tens of minutes?

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Yeah.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
If you want to get close to the sun,

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
at the nearest point,

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
at 340 solar radii,

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
that's 20 minutes per second.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
As far as I know,

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
the New Horizons

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
is

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
I don't know if there's one per week.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
That's the current rate.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
But if you're talking about

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Cassini

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
in Enceladus,

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
where it flies through the ice,

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
it's saturated.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
It's like

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
a hundred or a thousand per minute.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
So,

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
it's like

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
a hundred or a thousand per minute.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
In this kind of place,

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
it's hard to measure

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
because the whole instrument is overloaded.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
OK.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
What if it's

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
outside of Mars?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
What's that called?

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
The small star belt?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
The small star belt is usually

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
If this is a small

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Oh, the small star belt rate.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
I'm not sure about this.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
But

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
if you can get close to

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
these sources,

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
it should be pretty high.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
But other than that,

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
if it's in a general empty space,

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
it's a few dozen minutes.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
OK, OK.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Got it.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
And my other question is

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
if you have

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
if you have

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
If your detector

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
is hit by Cosmic Ray,

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
will it affect it?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
OK.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Good question.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
If it's an antenna device,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
it won't.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
But if it's this kind of PVDF,

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
it will.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Because this kind of thing

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
for high-capacity ions

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
or even for temperature control,

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
it's going to give you a wrong signal.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
But for a PVDF detector,

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
it will.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
In this case,

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
if it's what we just talked about,

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
these two on the left,

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
this kind of dedicated dust analyzer,

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
UV will also be affected.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
So it can't measure directly in front of UV.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
It's usually sublim.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
It's about 30 degrees to 45 degrees.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
You can start measuring

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
to all the back sides can be measured.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
But you can't go to the sun.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
There's a problem with the sun.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
Because it's got MCP

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Yeah, that's a good question.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
As for the antenna measurement we just talked about,

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
because this kind of thing

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
is something that can be hit.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
There's no difference in UV.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
OK, OK.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
What if you look at the stars

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
and then reflect the light of the sun?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Will the UV be too strong?

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Stars reflect UV?

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Generally, it won't.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Because in general,

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
albedo,

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
what we usually hear is no.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
It's not that exaggerated.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
OK, OK.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
OK, thank you.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
You're welcome.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
I know you guys,

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
there's a picture that looks like

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
something like that,

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
that size,

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
and then it goes down like this.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
And then the lower part is the bigger star

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
or that kind of star.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
And then in the middle is a small star.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
And then the upper left corner is dust.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Is this albedo?

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
No, no, no.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
In astronomy, when you measure,

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
you usually measure the bigger the better.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
We measure where we don't want

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
the smaller the better.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Oh.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Yeah.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Because our experiment,

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Zodiacal Light

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
is our biggest experiment.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Because we measure

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
near-infrared wavelengths.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
And our main wavelengths

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
are actually

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
the reflections

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
of small stars nearby.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Yeah.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Got it.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
OK.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Can I ask a question?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Sure, go ahead.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I don't know if this question

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
sounds unprofessional.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
But when you were drawing

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
the rotation angle,

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
what did you say?

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
If the two antennae are in the middle

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
at 45 degrees,

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
it will look like this.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
But if you put it on the antenna

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
from time to time,

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
it will look like this, right?

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Yes.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
OK.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
That's the picture, right?

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
OK.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
I was thinking

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
about the frequency problem.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
It doesn't sound good

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
for two weeks.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
But if today

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
it's a stable beam,

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
it's not one thing,

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
it's a beam,

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
and we assume it's a stable frequency.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
At this time,

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
because we know

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
the rotation of the detector,

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
because the rotation

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
is on our machine,

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
we can record it.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Of course, there is an assumption

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
that the direction of the beam

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
is fixed.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
In this case,

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
for example,

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
the first one looks like this on the left,

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
and the second one

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
has a different angle,

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
and it looks more and more

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
like the picture on the right.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
When it hits the antenna,

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
it becomes the picture on the right,

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
and when it leaves the antenna,

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
it becomes the picture on the left.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
There is an oscillation

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
that can be solved.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
In other words,

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
it can be solved

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
what kind of frequency

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
it is now.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
The first thing to know

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
is the frequency.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
But the frequency knows

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
because it knows the frequency

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
every time it pauses.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
So you can take this parameter

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
and use it.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
But this is something

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
that needs a stable flow.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Can you do this?

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
I think I deleted something

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
and missed to tell you.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
When we were doing the experiment,

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
we measured where the collision was.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
There are 10 degrees, 30 degrees,

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
45 degrees, 60 degrees,

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
and then we went around like this.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
So we measured a lot of things.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
Of course,

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
for example, this is 10 degrees,

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
and 30 degrees may be in the middle.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Yes, yes, yes.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Yes.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
What you just said is right.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
When we do measurements,

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
generally speaking,

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
the main probe in space

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
is actually not fixed.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
It's best to let it choose.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
There is a frequency to choose.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Our attitude control system

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
will know its angle of rotation.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
If you say today,

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
for example,

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
let's say we encounter

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
an Enceladus.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
This is the one that keeps spraying ice.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
It has a fixed

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
time rate.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
OK,

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
what you want to talk about is this, right?

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Yes, yes, yes.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
You really know how to explain things.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
After going around like this,

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
you will find that

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
if the original signal

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
is red,

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
you will see the blue signal

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
going up and down.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
This is what you want to talk about, right?

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Yes, yes, yes.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Yes, yes.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
In this case,

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
we generally believe

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
our attitude control system.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
In this case, it's really interesting.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
We must believe

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
our attitude control system is correct.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
So if our attitude control system is correct,

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
we can know that

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
suppose I want to change a color today.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Then I set it as the

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
pointing direction.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
I might have known at the beginning

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
that my pointing is like this.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
I think my first antenna points there.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
The second antenna points there.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
You will rotate like this, right?

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Yes.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
In this case,

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
we can solve the location of the collision.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
But I have to say

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
there is a drawback in this case.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
The first drawback is

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
our probe

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
will never be as beautiful

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
as this sphere.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
This is the first one.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
The second one,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
even if this sphere

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
I draw a big probe now.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
The middle one is called

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
your antenna.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
I will face it directly at the top.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
There is a drawback in this case.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
You know its angle.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
It's the distance

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
between you and it.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
But the distance is

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
similar to the distance of a copper core.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Right?

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
You don't know

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
the distance.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
If the distance is so close

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
and it's a perfectly fixed sphere,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
the signal here

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
and here

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
look like this.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
The distance is there.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
You don't know if it's here

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
or here or there.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
So we need to

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
develop a new model

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
or think about how to explain it.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
It needs to be improved.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
OK.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
I just thought of another one.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Can't we just

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
hit the earth

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
and build the model first?

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
That's right.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
So now we have a model

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
like the Pyke Solar Probe.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Cassini made a model.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
This is a 20 to 1 model.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
It's exactly the same.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
So we later said

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
we have this model.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
We have this physical model.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
This doesn't seem right.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
I mean

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
there is a formula for the physical model.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
After we have this,

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
we take a physical model

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
which is also called physical model in English.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Laboratory model

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
to do this kind of simulation

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
of hitting the earth.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Then put the two together.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
We just want to tell people

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
who wants to launch a thing with an antenna.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
We can make a model

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
and then do this kind of simulation.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
After knowing all the parameters,

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
when you get to the sky,

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
you are facing these databases

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
to correspond.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Then it's accurate.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Yes.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
Got it.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
Good question.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Any other questions?

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
You can ask anything.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
If you don't want to ask about the universe dust,

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
you can ask about the electromagnetic dust.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Or you can ask about the particle promoter.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Since you mentioned it,

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
let me ask.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Why did you decide to

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
make an antenna?

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Because the particle promoter

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
is a bit far away.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
But it doesn't seem impossible.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
It can't be done.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
First,

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
in the US,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
you can't make a promoter.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Second,

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
everyone knows

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
who gives you money,

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
just do it.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
You said you can't make a promoter in the US?

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
What do you mean by that?

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
I don't know.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
What does it mean?

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
As long as you come across

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
defense or military industry,

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
you can't do it.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Even if you are a foreigner in Taiwan,

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
you can't do it.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
You can't do it as a foreigner.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
Let's be official and scientific.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
After I made the particle engine,

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
the particle engine

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
is related to the space environment.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
In the space environment,

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
in addition to electromagnetic waves,

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
matter will collide.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
So we need to make some cosmic things.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
You can also understand the origin of your life,

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
right?

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
That makes sense.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Do you have any questions?

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Let me see.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
We are waiting

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
for one minute.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
If you don't have any questions,

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
I'll end the recording.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Someone wants to ask a question

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
but doesn't want to be recorded.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
You can ask after we're done.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
I mean we'll end the recording

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
after one minute.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
No problem.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Okay.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
One minute is up.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
On behalf of everyone,

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
let's give Mingxue

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
a big round of applause

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
before we end the recording.
