00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tire Talk. I'm your host, Yen-Yong Zhang.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're very honored to have Timothy here today. He's a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Chengda University.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today's topic is Recent Progress in Surface Plasmon Polariton Nanolasers.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Before we start, let me introduce Tim.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
First of all, I want to say that Tim's introduction is so cool and short.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But I want to say that he only wrote a few words. He wrote,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Proud Kaohsiunger 666.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This was sent to me a few days before the election.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I have to go to his personal website to see his self-introduction.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, I have it now. You can take a look.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, I have the website.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let me introduce him.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Tim's background is physics.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He majored in physics at Chengda University.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He got his Ph.D. at Chengda University.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In addition to physics, he is also passionate about investment, hiking, philosophy, and social movements.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I know you got your Ph.D. at Chengda University.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, I got my Ph.D. at NCT.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, NCT. I misread it. Sorry.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, you got your Ph.D. at Chengda University.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Did you go to Michigan and Tel Aviv to do a postdoc program for a period of time before returning to Taiwan?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No, I went to Michigan with a visa from the Ministry of Science and Technology.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
My boss, Denghui, recommended me to go to the University of Israel.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I went to the University of Israel and did a postdoc program for about a year.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And then you went back to Chengda University.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, that's right.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, so this is the bio of Yuxun from the proud Kaohsiunger666.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, let's get started.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, today, considering that everyone has different backgrounds,

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to talk a little bit about what we do in the light study department.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Roughly speaking, it can be shown as shown in the picture.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We will create light.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Then we will find a way to transmit light, detect light, and control light.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is what we do in the light study department.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Our department covers all aspects of basic physics, including ray optics, wave optics, electronics, and quantum mechanics.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
In the light study department, as you can see, we have a very wide range of applications.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
For example, you can see the screen on your phone or the LED light for lighting.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There is also a solar panel that is currently out of energy,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
as well as the light you need to use when you go online.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Some parts of your iPhone are cut off with high-power laser.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A more advanced application is the part of the collective light path.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So light basically covers a lot of subjects and applications.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
These are the parts that are usually easier to see.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I would like to emphasize a little further here.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The part of the light study field basically contributed 30% of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the past half century.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This data was obtained from the OSA, the light study department.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
In other words, the part related to light won the 30% physics award.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can see that light technology is a very important subject.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It is a very worthwhile project for everyone to invest in.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Personally, I focus my research on how to create light.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you want to create light, you must know that energy and matter are basically inseparable.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The creation of energy must involve matter, and the stability of matter must also involve energy.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Here, I mainly focus on the interaction between light and matter, especially the polariton part.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Polariton is basically a mixture of light and exciton.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Based on such a large structure, my current research topic is microcavity polariton laser,

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and surface plasmon polariton laser.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In order to produce these components, I did some basic research on some novel materials.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Back to the laser part, as I mentioned earlier, my research focuses on the interaction between light and matter.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I hope to be able to produce light, because light is the most basic part of light science.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you can't produce light, you won't be able to control light, guide light, or detect light.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Here, I want to talk about what a laser is.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The abbreviation for laser is LASER.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Its full name is Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation.

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The concept of light amplification radiation was first proposed by Einstein around 1918.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
At that time, he proposed the interaction between light and matter, which can be roughly divided into three categories.

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Laser absorption, laser emission, and self-emission.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Now, let me talk about what laser emission is.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You will often see some animation characters on TV.

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They will start to emit gas, and then release gas, or release some big waves.

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
A more famous example is the gas bomb in Dragon Ball.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Or like the famous character in the movie, Huo Ying Ren Zhe.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The concept is similar to the concept of gathering Chakra.

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you are watching a movie or anime, you can understand.

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Laser is a bit similar to this concept.

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Its principle is basically to amplify your signal, your energy.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The process is like this.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
First, you will have a passive electron.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It is in the high-energy state.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then, it is affected by a photon.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So that it goes from high-energy to low-energy.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
As it goes from high-energy state to low-energy state, it will emit the same light.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The same light as the input signal, including its position and wavelength.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Through this process, one chakra pushes two chakras.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Two chakras pushes four chakras.

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
In this way, it can achieve the amplification of energy.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If we can effectively use this passive radiation,

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
we can create the so-called laser component.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The laser component is very similar to what you have experienced.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Those who have played laser pen or laser know that

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the more famous properties of laser are

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
it is monochromatic, it has directivity, and it has very good tonality.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you use these features,

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the laser can be used as a detector,

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
it can be used as a scanner,

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
it can be used as a DVD player,

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
it can be used for surgery.

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
OK.

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Here, you may think,

99
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
why do I put a picture of Einstein?

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
First of all, when it comes to laser,

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
for people my age,

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
the first thing that comes to mind is the Death Star in Star Wars.

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The Death Star is a very iconic thing.

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In Star Wars, it only took 17 seconds to destroy an entire planet.

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then you will see that it starts to gather laser light,

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
then it gathers a little more, and then it destroys a planet.

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So when it comes to Star Wars,

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have to mention Einstein.

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You may think, why?

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
First of all, in a recent interview,

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a reporter asked George Lucas,

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
where did the image of Master Yoda come from?

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Lucas said, it actually came from Einstein.

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because he needed someone who looked crazy,

115
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but also very powerful, to be the prototype of his image.

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So Einstein is basically the prototype of Master Yoda.

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Einstein also inspired the development of laser.

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He was the first to propose laser beam magnification.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
After 40 years of hard work,

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Tons and Shallow, these two excellent scientists,

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
in the 1950s or so,

122
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
proposed a truly feasible model of laser components.

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Of course, at that time, they didn't really make laser beam.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This concept was learned by someone in the lab next door.

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Then in the 1960s,

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
they made the first laser.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So from the 1960s to 2020,

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
it happened to be the 60th anniversary of laser.

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In the past 60 years,

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
at least 7 Nobel Prizes were awarded to laser technology.

131
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why do I say directly?

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Broadly speaking,

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Nobel Prizes related to laser technology are actually countless.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
For example,

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
last year's Nobel Prize for Gravity Wave Experiment

136
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
was awarded to gravity wave detection.

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Gravity wave detection also relies on laser technology.

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Of course, it's not a Nobel Prize directly related to laser technology.

139
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
However, gravity wave detection must rely on laser.

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Last year's Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to astronomy.

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Astronomy also requires high-precision measurements using laser.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So it can be seen that

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
laser has a significant impact on the development of human science.

144
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The last Nobel Prize for Laser Technology was awarded in 2018.

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It was awarded to three very important scientists.

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yashijin, Mooroo, and Shukla.

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They have made very original breakthroughs

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
in the application of small and large-power lasers.

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yashijin in particular,

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
has invented light-transmission technology.

151
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mooroo and Shukla

152
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
have used the method of bombardment

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to compress the pulse of the laser to a very high energy density.

154
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Today, we have all kinds of large-power lasers

155
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that can be used in science and technology.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
When it comes to large-power laser applications,

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
we think of destruction.

158
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Not only can lasers be used to destroy,

159
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
but they can also be used for precise destruction.

160
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is an example I just gave.

161
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
In the metal phone case you are using now,

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
or some precision components,

163
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
we use laser to cut metal surfaces,

164
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
to cut surfaces of different materials,

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
to create micro-level, fine structures.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
However, in addition to destruction,

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
lasers can also be used for creation.

168
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If you look up at the sun in the sky,

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
although it should be night in North America,

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
but here we are in the morning,

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and it's almost noon,

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
so if you look up at the sky,

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you will see a bright red sun.

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's actually a fusion phenomenon.

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We can use hundreds of lasers

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
to focus on the same small point

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to create a fusion reaction.

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So lasers can not only be used for destruction,

179
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
but they can also be used for creation.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
On the other hand, when it comes to small-power lasers,

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
they are more peaceful.

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They are mainly used for detection,

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
measurement, and transmission.

184
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
According to the self-driving technology

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
that you often see on TV,

186
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
there are about three or four detection technologies,

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
including ultrasonic, visual recognition,

188
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
light sensing, and...

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let me think about it.

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's about these three.

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Among them, the so-called light sensor,

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
which is called LIDAR in English,

193
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
is mainly used by lasers

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
to accurately measure the surrounding environment.

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Because lasers are very high-precision,

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
they have very good synchronization.

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So when the laser beam hits the object,

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
it can very accurately detect

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the distance between the object and the sensor

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
to avoid your self-driving car

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
hitting the objects around it.

202
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you are not familiar with self-driving cars

203
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
or if you are not familiar with LIDAR technology,

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
you can see the iPhone.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you have an iPhone 10

206
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
or if you have an iPhone 10 or above,

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you can see that there is a sensor bar on it.

208
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
In this sensor bar,

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
there is a part of it

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
that is filled with laser sensors.

211
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Apple engineers have filled hundreds of vertical laser sensors

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
with LIDAR technology.

213
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
These lasers can project more than 30,000 light spots

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
every second

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to detect the surface of your face

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
to identify whether you are a legitimate user of this phone.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So you might think that

218
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
we can already fill hundreds of lasers

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
in the size of a miliband.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Is it necessary to continue to reduce the number of lasers?

221
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
In fact, it is necessary.

222
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let me give you a brief description of our needs.

223
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You can see the image in the upper right corner.

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It is from Intel's Tech News Room.

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay.

226
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
In the past few decades,

227
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
you must have heard in the news

228
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
that TSMC has broken through the 14-nm technology.

229
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
They built a 7-nm factory.

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Next, a 5-nm factory.

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Next, a 3-nm factory in the U.S.

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Next, a 5-nm factory in the U.S.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Next, a 3-nm factory in the U.S.

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The number of nanometers

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
refers to the width of the device.

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The number of nanometers

237
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
refers to the width of the device.

238
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You will find that the number

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
ranges from large to small.

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We have been making these devices smaller.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When we make these devices smaller,

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
there is a serious problem.

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
First, let me jump off the topic of the speech

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and talk to you about it.

245
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can imagine

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
if you have 100 lines

247
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
from Taipei to Kaohsiung.

248
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
In this case,

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I can assure you that

250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
there will be almost no traffic.

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But when you reduce 100 lines

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
to 50 lines,

253
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
25 lines,

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
10 lines,

255
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
5 lines,

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
3 lines,

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
or even 1 line,

258
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the same traffic will cause

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a very serious problem.

260
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Your car may collide with each other.

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You may fall off the highway.

262
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The traffic may never be resolved.

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is the problem we face

264
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
when using electronic components.

265
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Electronic components rely on electronic transmission.

266
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The interaction between electronic and electronic

267
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
has the effect of the torque.

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This torque

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
is multiplied by the square of the distance.

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
In other words,

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
when your line width is getting narrower,

272
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the interference between electronic and electronic

273
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
will become very strong.

274
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This interference

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
will cause

276
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
80% of the signal

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
in the electronic component

278
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
to be lost

279
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in interconnection.

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This value is

281
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
about 2 picojoules

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
per bit per centimeter.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You may think that

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
picojoules are about 10 to the power of 12.

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And it's per centimeter.

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It feels okay.

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But don't forget

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that in our daily lives,

289
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
all kinds of applications

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and all kinds of

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
online activities

292
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
are connected

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to several megabytes at any time.

294
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Even if you

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
want to watch

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
4K videos,

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you may be connected

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to terabytes of

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
information.

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So,

301
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
under these conditions,

302
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the world is

303
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
actually

304
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
wasting a lot of

305
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
energy on

306
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
electrical interconnection.

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you don't have much

308
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
knowledge about information flow,

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you can think in another way.

310
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The mobile chip

311
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and computer chip

312
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
we are using now

313
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
have billions of components.

314
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay?

315
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Each component consumes 2 picojoules

316
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
per second.

317
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
In the long run,

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
it's a huge energy loss.

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So, under these

320
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
background conditions,

321
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
people start to think about

322
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
using light transmission

323
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
instead of electronic transmission.

324
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay?

325
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Light will not

326
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
interfere with each other.

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And you can put different

328
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
wavelengths of light

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
in the same optical channel.

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So, if you use light

331
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to transmit a signal,

332
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it's about 10 picojoules

333
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
per centimeter.

334
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you use electricity

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
to transmit a signal,

336
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
it's about 1 to 2 orders

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
less,

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
which is about 100 times less.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay?

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If we want to use light

341
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to transmit a signal,

342
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
there must be a wavelength.

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And this wavelength

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
must be the same

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
as the current

346
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
electronic component technology.

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The so-called matching

348
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
is that its volume

349
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
should be about the same.

350
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay?

351
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
If you want to use

352
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
a table-shaped laser

353
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
to replace our electronic

354
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
component transmission,

355
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
it's actually unrealistic

356
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
because it's a little bit of ink.

357
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We ultimately hope

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that we can make a component

359
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
that is completely different from

360
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the electronic component

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and can be perfectly integrated

362
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
into the existing technology.

363
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay?

364
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So you might want to

365
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
reduce the volume of the laser.

366
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But there's a problem here.

367
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And this problem

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
has been a problem

369
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
for engineers and scientists

370
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
for a while.

371
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
This problem is

372
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
the optical wavelength limit.

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The optical wavelength limit

374
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
tells us that

375
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
if you want to limit a light,

376
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
the size of your component,

377
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
the dimension of your component

378
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
must be greater than

379
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
or equal to the wavelength of the light wave.

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Actually, it's easy to imagine.

381
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If you want to put an elephant

382
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
in your refrigerator today,

383
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
it's impossible because

384
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
your refrigerator is smaller

385
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
than the size of the elephant.

386
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So you can't effectively

387
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
put an elephant in your refrigerator.

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
In the same way,

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
in the field of optics,

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
the wavelength limit is

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
a basic obstacle.

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You can't

393
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
limit the light

394
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
to something

395
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
smaller than it.

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So,

397
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
in order to overcome this obstacle,

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
scientists

399
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
began to think

400
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
about other ways

401
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
to make

402
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
laser.

403
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
They thought about other ways

404
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to make nanoparticles.

405
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
OK.

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
First of all,

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
back to what I said at the beginning,

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I mentioned that

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
laser is like

410
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
a machine.

411
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
If we look at some

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
elite novels or

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
elite movies,

414
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
those masters,

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
they sometimes need to

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
concentrate their energy

417
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and then

418
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
send out their

419
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
air force.

420
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
OK.

421
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So,

422
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
when you can't

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
effectively execute

424
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
your work,

425
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
you can accumulate

426
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
energy in another way.

427
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What does it mean?

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's like you change from

429
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
a computer system or a

430
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
magic system to a chakra system.

431
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
In my opinion,

432
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
they are all energy systems.

433
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Each energy system

434
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
has its own characteristics.

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
In our field,

436
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
we transform

437
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
the process of

438
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
magnification of

439
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
laser into another form,

440
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
which is called

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
surface electromagnetic field.

442
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Today,

443
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't want to practice

444
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Chinese martial arts anymore.

445
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I want to practice western magic.

446
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can also let

447
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
magic operate in my body.

448
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And because magic

449
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
has a relatively small energy volume,

450
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can more effectively

451
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
accumulate energy in my body

452
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
to have a better output.

453
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So, the concept is similar.

454
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Engineers

455
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and scientists

456
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
want to

457
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
replace a

458
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
smaller object

459
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
with a

460
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
smaller object,

461
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
which is called

462
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
surface electromagnetic field.

463
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Surface electromagnetic field

464
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
is the electromagnetization

465
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
of the collective vibration

466
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
on the metal surface.

467
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
If it can

468
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
coalesce with light,

469
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
it can produce a new thing

470
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
called surface plasma polarity.

471
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Surface plasma polarity

472
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
has some features,

473
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
such as its wavelength

474
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
is smaller than the wavelength

475
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
of light waves,

476
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and it has a very fast

477
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
reaction speed.

478
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It can also be controlled

479
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
by electromagnetic field.

480
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So, when I go into

481
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
the more detailed part,

482
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I will first mention

483
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
the magical part of

484
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
surface plasma.

485
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If you have read this book,

486
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
it is called

487
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ligricus Cup.

488
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It is a cup

489
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
of a king

490
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
in the 4th century

491
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
in Rome.

492
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This cup has a

493
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
very special feature.

494
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
When you hit the light

495
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
from the inside of the cup

496
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
to the outside,

497
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
you will see red light.

498
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
When you hit the light

499
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
from the inside of the cup

500
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
to the outside,

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
you will see green light.

502
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Scientists have been

503
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
confused about this problem

504
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
since the 1980s.

505
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
They do not know

506
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
what the principle of operation

507
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
of this thing is.

508
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Later, they did

509
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
elemental analysis

510
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and found that

511
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
most of this cup

512
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is made of silicon oxide,

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
so that they can

514
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
react with the light

515
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and produce surface plasma.

516
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
They can effectively

517
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
concentrate the energy

518
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
in a very small area

519
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
to absorb, diffuse

520
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
or magnify.

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's go back to the Ligricus Cup.

522
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Why does it have

523
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
this special feature?

524
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The outside of the cup

525
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
is red,

526
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
but the inside is green.

527
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This is because

528
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the gold nanoparticles

529
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
will be absorbed

530
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
by the green light

531
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
of 520 nanometers.

532
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The surface plasma will

533
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
absorb the energy.

534
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
When you hit the light

535
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
from the inside to the outside,

536
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
the green light is absorbed

537
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and only the red light

538
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
is reflected.

539
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Why is the outside

540
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
of the cup green?

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
When you hit the light from the inside

542
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
to the outside,

543
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
the green light

544
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
of 520 nanometers

545
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
will be absorbed

546
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
by the gold nanoparticles

547
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
in the cup.

548
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The green light

549
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
will be absorbed

550
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
by the gold nanoparticles

551
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
in the cup.

552
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The green light

553
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
will be absorbed

554
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
by the gold nanoparticles

555
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
in the cup.

556
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
This is because

557
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the surface plasma

558
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
is very close to the gold nanoparticles.

559
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
When we see red,

560
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
we think it is ruby,

561
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and green means

562
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
it is emerald.

563
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But these two cups

564
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
neither have gold nanoparticles

565
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
nor sapphire nanoparticles.

566
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
They are just

567
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
metal particles

568
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
mixed with silicon oxide.

569
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Let's talk about

570
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the basic properties of metal.

571
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Metal

572
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
due to its low electromagnetic

573
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
coating,

574
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
can not fill

575
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
the chamber effectively.

576
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So, in a metal block,

577
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the electrons can move freely

578
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
without any interference.

579
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It will be in an inverted state.

580
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So, for this type of block,

581
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
its capacitance

582
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
can be described

583
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
by a model called

584
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Joule model.

585
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This model

586
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
uses background capacitance

587
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
to subtract the surface plasma

588
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
resonance frequency

589
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
minus the resonance frequency

590
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
plus a damping term.

591
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Surface plasma frequency

592
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
refers to

593
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
what kind of frequency

594
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
it will resonate with.

595
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
In the future,

596
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
when we play in the park,

597
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
we will often

598
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
swing a swing.

599
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
A swing has

600
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
a swing frequency.

601
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
When you sit on it,

602
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
you will find that

603
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
if you can swing

604
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
along the swing frequency,

605
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
you can swing

606
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
the swing high and far

607
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
very quickly.

608
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
In the same way,

609
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
every object

610
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
has its own resonance frequency.

611
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The resonance frequency of metal

612
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
we call it

613
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Joule frequency.

614
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
This Joule frequency

615
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
refers to

616
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
when a beam of light

617
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
comes in,

618
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the electrons in the metal

619
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
will resonate

620
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
with the light.

621
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
When the resonance frequency

622
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
is consistent with the resonance frequency of metal,

623
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it will have the greatest absorption.

624
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
In this case,

625
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
we call

626
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
this resonance frequency

627
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
as

628
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Joule frequency.

629
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Joule frequency is

630
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
proportional to the

631
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
root of the electron number.

632
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This N is the electron number.

633
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Q is the electron number.

634
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Me is the electron quality.

635
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Epsilon zero is the background

636
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
charge.

637
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Normally,

638
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
the electron density

639
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
of metal is

640
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
10 to the power of 25 to the power of 26

641
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
cubic meters.

642
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
This is the electron density of metal.

643
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
In the physics of quantum mechanics,

644
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
we know that

645
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
light

646
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
is composed of frequency

647
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and wavelength.

648
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Light is composed of frequency

649
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and wavelength.

650
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Once you know the resonance frequency,

651
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
you can push

652
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
the wavelength

653
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
in the opposite direction.

654
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Once again,

655
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Omega P is the

656
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
resonance frequency of electron.

657
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Once you know the resonance frequency of electron,

658
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
you will know the wavelength of electron.

659
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
This wavelength

660
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
is about

661
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
10 to 100 nanometer.

662
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It is smaller than

663
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the wavelength of visible light.

664
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
When we add a piece of metal

665
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and connect it

666
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
to an electrolytic layer,

667
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
it will form

668
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
a surface electrode.

669
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The electrode

670
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
we just talked about

671
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
is a three-dimensional electrode.

672
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Now, we reduce

673
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
its dimension

674
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
to two dimensions.

675
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
These surface electrodes

676
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
can only be compensated

677
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
on the surface of metal and electrolyte.

678
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
This compensation

679
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
will produce

680
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
a smaller

681
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
resonance frequency,

682
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
which is called surface electrode frequency.

683
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Surface electrode frequency

684
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
is the electrode frequency

685
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
divided by the root of

686
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
E plus Epsilon D.

687
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Epsilon D is the

688
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
capacitance of the electrolyte.

689
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So,

690
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
the surface electrode

691
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
will have a dispersion curve

692
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
like this.

693
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
From this

694
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
dispersion curve,

695
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
we can see that

696
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
the surface electrode

697
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
has a dispersion curve

698
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
with a very large

699
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
momentum,

700
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
which is close to

701
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the water level.

702
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If it is close to the water level,

703
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
it means that

704
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
its wavelength is zero.

705
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We know that

706
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
in basic light theory,

707
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
the dispersion curve

708
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
of light

709
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
is divided by

710
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
its speed,

711
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
which is the speed of light

712
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
in the ring.

713
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Similarly,

714
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the surface electrode dispersion curve

715
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
is divided by

716
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
the speed of light

717
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
in the ring.

718
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And,

719
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
the wavelength is zero,

720
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
which means that

721
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
its speed of light

722
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
in the ring

723
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
is very slow.

724
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Its speed of light

725
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
in the ring

726
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
is very slow,

727
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
which means that

728
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
it will exist for a very long time.

729
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And,

730
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
it will have a very strong interaction

731
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
between light and matter.

732
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Let's imagine that

733
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
there is a smoke truck

734
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
in front of you

735
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and you inhale the exhaust gas.

736
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
If the speed of the truck is very slow,

737
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
you will inhale a lot of exhaust gas.

738
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
If the speed of the truck is very fast,

739
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
you will pass through the snow

740
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and you will not inhale the gas.

741
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So,

742
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
in our research,

743
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
the slower the speed of

744
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
the surface electrode movement,

745
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the better.

746
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
This means that

747
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
it can have a very strong interaction

748
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
with the ring.

749
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
OK.

750
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Now,

751
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
let's take a look at

752
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
how to do it.

753
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's actually very simple.

754
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That is to say,

755
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
as soon as you see it,

756
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
you will think,

757
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
how can there be such a simple structure?

758
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
In order to achieve the goal

759
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
of limiting energy

760
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
by using the surface electrode,

761
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
we adopted the SIN structure.

762
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
This structure

763
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
was proposed by

764
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Prof. Chang and his team

765
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
in 2009.

766
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It is mainly made up of

767
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
a semiconductor nanocircuit,

768
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
a metal layer,

769
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and an insulator

770
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in the middle

771
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
to form the SIN structure.

772
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The metal layer

773
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
is responsible for producing

774
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
the surface electrode.

775
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The nanocircuit

776
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
is responsible for providing

777
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the insulator.

778
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The insulator

779
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
is responsible for

780
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
reducing the energy loss

781
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and protecting

782
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
the metal layer.

783
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So,

784
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
we can quickly understand

785
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
the whole process

786
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
through this animation.

787
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
To make such a laser,

788
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
we first have to

789
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
put a metal layer

790
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
on top of it

791
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and then

792
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
put a nanocircuit on top of it.

793
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The nanocircuit will provide

794
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
a light-dissipation.

795
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The light-dissipation will

796
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
convert the energy

797
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
to the Surface Plasma Mode.

798
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The Surface Plasma Mode

799
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
can reach the collector

800
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
along the

801
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
natural laser rectifier

802
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and finally

803
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
release the energy

804
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
at the end of the laser.

805
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The Surface Plasma Mode

806
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
has a wavelength

807
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
of tens of nanometers.

808
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
In other words,

809
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
we can break

810
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
the light-dissipation limit

811
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and reduce the size

812
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
of such elements

813
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
to less than

814
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
the wavelength of the light wave.

815
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Excuse me,

816
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
can I ask some questions?

817
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Sorry, my name is Ted.

818
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Can we go back

819
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
to the previous video?

820
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The one before the animation.

821
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The one before the animation.

822
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
This is the one before the animation.

823
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
What does SPP mean?

824
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Sorry,

825
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
this is one of the questions.

826
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
SPP is...

827
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Surface Plasma Polariton.

828
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It is a mixture of

829
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
surface electrons and light-dissipation.

830
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I see.

831
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I remember that

832
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
laser requires

833
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
inversion population.

834
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Can you describe

835
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
what is the

836
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
inversion population

837
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
in the

838
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
SPP?

839
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
First of all,

840
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
this is our

841
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
model.

842
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The traditional

843
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
laser uses

844
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
optical rectifier

845
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to

846
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
rectify the light

847
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
in the rectifier.

848
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
In other words,

849
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
the light will eat

850
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
many optical gates.

851
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
This type of

852
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
laser

853
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
has the same concept.

854
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It just changes

855
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the light,

856
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
which is replaced by

857
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
surface electrons.

858
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It uses SPP

859
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
to rectify the light

860
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
in the rectifier.

861
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You can look at

862
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
this picture.

863
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
At first,

864
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
we will

865
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
shoot a laser beam

866
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
to activate the

867
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
semiconductor material.

868
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
During the activation,

869
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
it will form

870
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
a crystal.

871
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This crystal

872
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
will contribute

873
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
energy to

874
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the plasma.

875
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Just like the traditional

876
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
optical laser,

877
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
the light will

878
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
rectify the light

879
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
in the rectifier.

880
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This is

881
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
what I want to answer.

882
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Did I answer

883
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
your question?

884
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
No.

885
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I think you

886
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
just mentioned it.

887
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's okay.

888
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You can look at

889
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
the length of the nanowire

890
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and some basic

891
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
information.

892
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The animation

893
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
looks like

894
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
you don't know much about it.

895
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Let me talk about

896
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
its history.

897
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
When it was first

898
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
proposed by

899
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
the team at

900
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Berkeley,

901
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
they used

902
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
cadmium sulfide,

903
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
or CDS nanowire.

904
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The length of the nanowire

905
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
is several microns

906
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
along the

907
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
growth direction

908
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
of the nanowire.

909
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
However,

910
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
its cross-section

911
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
is more than

912
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
one micrometer.

913
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
When it was first

914
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
developed,

915
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
we were excited

916
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
because we could

917
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
effectively limit

918
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the energy

919
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
in at least

920
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
two dimensions.

921
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
However,

922
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
although the nanowire

923
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
effectively limits

924
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
the energy

925
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
in at least

926
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
two dimensions,

927
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
its cross-section

928
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
is more than

929
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
one micrometer.

930
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
If I'm not wrong,

931
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
it's several micrometers.

932
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
However,

933
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
as a pioneer

934
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
of paper,

935
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
the result is

936
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
quite exciting.

937
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
At that time,

938
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Tsinghua University

939
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
wanted to

940
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
further reduce the size

941
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
of the nanowire

942
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
in three dimensions

943
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
to the limit of

944
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
light and snow.

945
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Therefore,

946
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
they adopted

947
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
a core-shell structure

948
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
called

949
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
InGaN-AtGaN.

950
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The core-shell structure

951
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
is composed of

952
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
GaN,

953
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and InGaN.

954
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
In this way,

955
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
they successfully

956
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
reduced the size

957
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
of the nanowire

958
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
in three dimensions

959
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
to the limit of

960
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
light and snow.

961
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
In 2012,

962
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
the first nanowire

963
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
in three dimensions

964
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
was reduced to the limit of

965
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
light and snow.

966
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
However,

967
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Tsinghua University

968
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
could not effectively

969
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
increase the operating temperature

970
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
to room temperature.

971
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
After all,

972
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
it is a more applicable research.

973
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
In other words,

974
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
we still hope that

975
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it can play a role

976
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
in future projects

977
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
or future technology applications.

978
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Therefore,

979
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
if this type of component

980
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
cannot be effectively

981
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
reduced to the limit of

982
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
light and snow,

983
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
we still hope that

984
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
it can play a role

985
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
in future projects.

986
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
In 2014,

987
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Tsinghua University

988
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
adopted

989
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
a core-shell structure

990
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
called InGaN-AtGaN.

991
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The difference between

992
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
InGaN-AtGaN and

993
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
InGaN-AtGaN

994
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
is that

995
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
InGaN-AtGaN can reduce

996
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
the loss of laser.

997
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Reducing the loss of laser

998
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
is equivalent to

999
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
decreasing the pre-value.

1000
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
If the pre-value is reduced,

1001
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
there is no need to

1002
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
consider too many thermal accumulation problems.

1003
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
In 2014,

1004
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
we started to do

1005
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
laser operation at room temperature.

1006
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
My team,

1007
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
which is the team of

1008
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Mr. Lu Ting-Chang,

1009
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
started to do laser operation

1010
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
at room temperature.

1011
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Excuse me,

1012
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I have a question.

1013
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
My name is Zan Xiang-Yu.

1014
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I am a friend of Lanying.

1015
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I want to ask

1016
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
since

1017
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
you are using nanowire,

1018
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
you said that

1019
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
the length of nanowire

1020
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
may be limited.

1021
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Has anyone done

1022
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
nanodots?

1023
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
In fact,

1024
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
in 2009,

1025
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
there was

1026
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
a team

1027
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
that used

1028
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
nanogold

1029
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
to

1030
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
attach

1031
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
a

1032
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
thin silicon

1033
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
with many holes

1034
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
to the wire.

1035
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The thin silicon

1036
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
with many holes

1037
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
will absorb

1038
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
the organic material.

1039
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The organic material

1040
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
is the GAPE material.

1041
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The thin silicon with many holes

1042
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
is the GAPE material.

1043
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
The gold particle

1044
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
is the surfactant.

1045
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It is the zero-dimension

1046
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
surface plasmon.

1047
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The zero-dimension surface plasmon

1048
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
is called localized surface plasmon.

1049
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So,

1050
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
in 2009,

1051
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
someone did

1052
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
publish a study

1053
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
on Nature.

1054
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
However,

1055
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
this study

1056
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
never

1057
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
stimulated

1058
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
a single

1059
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
particle.

1060
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
As I mentioned,

1061
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
it uses gold nanoparticle.

1062
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
The nanoparticle

1063
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
is about 10 nanometers.

1064
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
However,

1065
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
it never

1066
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
stimulated

1067
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
a single particle.

1068
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It never stimulated

1069
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
a single particle.

1070
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So,

1071
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
it never

1072
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
stimulated a single particle.

1073
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So,

1074
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
it never

1075
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
stimulated

1076
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
a single particle.

1077
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The optical gain of

1078
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
organic materials is very low.

1079
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So,

1080
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
someone did this kind of study.

1081
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
However,

1082
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
the results are not that solid.

1083
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
However,

1084
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
the results are not that solid.

1085
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The results are not that solid.

1086
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The results are not that solid.

1087
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The results are not that solid.

1088
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The recent development

1089
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
shows

1090
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
that

1091
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
the nanoparticle

1092
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
is smaller than

1093
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
the size of

1094
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
quantum dot.

1095
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
In general,

1096
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the size of quantum dot

1097
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
is about 10 nanometers.

1098
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
is about 10 nanometers.

1099
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
However,

1100
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
the recent study

1101
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
shows that

1102
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
the nanoparticle

1103
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
is smaller than

1104
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
the size of

1105
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
quantum dot.

1106
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So,

1107
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
this is my understanding.

1108
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I may not have any updates recently,

1109
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
so if I missed anything,

1110
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I can talk about it again.

1111
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Sorry,

1112
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
can I continue the question?

1113
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
No problem.

1114
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You just mentioned

1115
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
localized surface plasma.

1116
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You just mentioned

1117
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
nanoparticle.

1118
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
As far as I know,

1119
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
the research on nanoparticle

1120
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
changes the shape of

1121
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
the surface plasma per rhythm

1122
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
frequency.

1123
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Does this actually

1124
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
affect the design

1125
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
of your software?

1126
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
For example,

1127
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
do you use nanocube,

1128
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
nanosphere,

1129
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
or other nanoparticles

1130
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
to change the frequency of the laser?

1131
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yes, it does.

1132
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The surface shape changes

1133
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
depending on

1134
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
the per-cell effect.

1135
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The per-cell effect

1136
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
affects the

1137
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
environment

1138
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
around the

1139
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
surface.

1140
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So,

1141
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
the shape of the

1142
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
per-cell effect

1143
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
affects the

1144
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
distribution of

1145
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
light and matter

1146
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
around the

1147
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
surface.

1148
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The shape of the

1149
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
per-cell effect

1150
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000

2499
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Thank you for your

2500
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
wonderful presentation.

2501
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I think it's very good.

2502
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Well,

2503
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
the next part is

2504
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Q&A. Before you ask

2505
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
questions, because some

2506
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
friends have already

2507
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
asked questions during

2508
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
the conversation.

2509
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I will ask them first,

2510
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
and others can

2511
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
think about

2512
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
the questions.

2513
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Thank you.

2514
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Got it. Thank you.

2515
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Okay.

2516
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Next question.

2517
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I think the next question is quite interesting.

2518
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Because I don't think it's a straightforward question.

2519
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Someone asked

2520
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
He's a little confused.

2521
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
He thinks your excitation

2522
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Your surface plasmon excitation

2523
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Is it from the incident photon?

2524
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Or is it from the light excitation from the nanowire?

2525
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Okay.

2526
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
This part is a little...

2527
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Because there's a cavity, right?

2528
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
So I'm not sure how to answer.

2529
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
You tell me. Sorry.

2530
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Let me get into the more detailed part.

2531
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
First of all,

2532
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
How does this process occur?

2533
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Let's start with a light.

2534
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I don't know why the animation is stuck.

2535
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Then I'll just use this.

2536
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
And then we come to the light.

2537
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
This light is in the nanowire.

2538
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
It's going to trigger the excitation.

2539
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
And the excitation

2540
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Because he's in

2541
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
When it's a lot of power.

2542
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
His dispersion is still very

2543
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
The situation is very fluid.

2544
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
So he can effectively take his energy.

2545
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Coupled to the surface plasmon mode.

2546
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Okay, this is actually quite important.

2547
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I didn't mention anything special just now.

2548
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
You can see this picture.

2549
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
We'll find that the surface plasmon

2550
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Dark mode.

2551
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
What does dark mode mean?

2552
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
You can't effectively see the light.

2553
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
He can only be invisible.

2554
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
On the surface.

2555
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Because he's under the light line.

2556
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
All the dispersion is under the light line.

2557
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
You can't use the optical mode.

2558
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
The way to see him.

2559
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So,

2560
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
This is how we trigger the process.

2561
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Through light first

2562
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Exciton in the nanowire.

2563
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Exciton in the nanowire.

2564
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And the exciton dispersion.

2565
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
In a very large range of motion.

2566
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
It's all very flat.

2567
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And he can happen to be with

2568
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Surface plasmon mode.

2569
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
When he couples,

2570
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
He's going to produce a polariton.

2571
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And this polariton.

2572
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
He's going to become.

2573
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Okay, when he produces a polariton.

2574
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
After that, it's us.

2575
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Hey.

2576
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
That is.

2577
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Uh, wait a minute.

2578
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
The animation can suddenly be used.

2579
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Then I'll just say it.

2580
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
First of all, use the light to trigger that.

2581
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Semiconductor nanowire.

2582
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And then the exciton in the semiconductor nanowire.

2583
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
After it comes out, it will give the energy.

2584
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Couple to surface plasmon mode.

2585
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Polariton.

2586
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
That's what we see here.

2587
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
This thing that's fair.

2588
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
And then how did he release the energy?

2589
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It's through the interface.

2590
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
The discontinuity that causes the dispersion.

2591
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I'm going to disperse this dark mode.

2592
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
So if you're going to go a little bit further.

2593
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
How about this kind of laser efficiency?

2594
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
To be honest, it's actually pretty bad.

2595
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
The first one is his mirror.

2596
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
It's based on.

2597
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
The interface formed by the change in the refractive index.

2598
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
His reflection rate is about.

2599
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Only about 20 to 40 percent.

2600
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
The limit is about 40.

2601
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
In fact, we're going to go through the software.

2602
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It's about 20 percent.

2603
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
The other one is.

2604
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
He's going to go out of the way.

2605
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
He's going to go through the interface.

2606
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Continuous dispersion.

2607
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It's not enough.

2608
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The part that's not enough.

2609
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
To be able to couple to light mode.

2610
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Otherwise, it's the same.

2611
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Dark mode.

2612
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So this is the part that I'm not going to talk about.

2613
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
In order to overcome this issue in the future.

2614
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
We have to be at his.

2615
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
The two ends of the point.

2616
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
To design.

2617
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Or design.

2618
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Such a structure.

2619
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
To be able to put these dark mode.

2620
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Energy in the highest efficiency way.

2621
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Come out.

2622
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
What about the current stage of research?

2623
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Almost no.

2624
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
He's on the edge of the place.

2625
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
To do any.

2626
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Reflective structure.

2627
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It's not about the edge.

2628
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
To do any.

2629
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
The structure design.

2630
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So the raw material.

2631
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
His energy conversion efficiency.

2632
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
It's actually very bad.

2633
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And his orientation.

2634
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
It's not as good as our traditional laser.

2635
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
So good.

2636
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Because it's through the dispersion.

2637
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
To make up for the insufficient momentum.

2638
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Let him be able to.

2639
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Couple to light mode.

2640
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Let him be able to.

2641
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Couple to light mode.

2642
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
This is what I want to say.

2643
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
This is what I want to say.

2644
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I didn't particularly talk about these details.

2645
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Because I want to say that everyone's.

2646
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
The background is south and north.

2647
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
If you have a more detailed part.

2648
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
If you want to ask.

2649
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
You are welcome to ask.

2650
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Okay.

2651
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Actually, I still have a problem.

2652
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
But I think we are today.

2653
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
It's a bit long.

2654
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I've been talking for too long.

2655
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I didn't eat anything.

2656
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I didn't pay much attention.

2657
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Most people are here.

2658
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
So it's very exciting.

2659
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Please open the microphone again.

2660
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Let's give it up again.

2661
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Thank you for the wonderful speech.

2662
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Thank you for the wonderful speech.

2663
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Thank you for the wonderful speech.

2664
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I'm going to put this here.

2665
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
The event is over here.

2666
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
But I'm just.
