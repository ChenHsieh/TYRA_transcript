0	7000	Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's presentation by Project Tara.
7000	9000	I'm your host, Suyi An.
9000	14000	First of all, I'd like to thank our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,
14000	17000	for being our speaker today.
17000	20000	I'm also very happy to have people from all cities
20000	25000	and towns join us in this online academic presentation.
25000	32000	I'm going to spend a minute or two to introduce our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,
32000	37000	and then I'm going to talk a little bit about today's event.
37000	43000	I'm really happy that Gaoxue can be our speaker today.
43000	49000	Gaoxue and I met in NTU.
49000	52000	Gaoxue's background is very, very special.
52000	55000	Gaoxue graduated from NTU's Department of Chemistry,
55000	58000	so she didn't major in psychology.
58000	62000	Later, she studied at NTU's Psychological Institute,
62000	65000	which is a laboratory in the field of development.
65000	69000	She had a very special experience.
69000	72000	After Gaoxue studied at the Psychological Institute,
72000	75000	she didn't give up her original chemistry major.
75000	79000	Instead, she studied at NTU's Counseling Center.
79000	84000	After graduation, she even became a full-time high school chemistry teacher.
84000	90000	Gaoxue is currently studying in the Ph.D. class of the Catholic University of Belize.
90000	94000	As far as I know, she also studies in the field of psychological development.
94000	98000	When I was preparing for this presentation, I was actually quite nervous.
98000	102000	Because Gaoxue herself sent me a very rich CV.
102000	105000	At first glance, I thought she was a god.
106000	109000	Gaoxue, if I say something wrong, you can correct me at any time.
109000	112000	I was thinking about what to prepare.
112000	115000	The information is too rich.
115000	118000	Gaoxue has won many research-related awards,
118000	121000	including the Best Dictionary and Dictionary Award
121000	124000	at the Taiwan Psychological Institute,
124000	127000	as well as the Young Scholar Award
127000	130000	at the Taiwan Women's Studies Institute, etc.
130000	133000	I can't wait to be awarded.
134000	137000	Today, Gaoxue will mainly share with us
137000	140000	her speech on the topic of gender equality.
140000	143000	After all, I'm not an expert,
143000	146000	so I'll leave it to Gaoxue to explain it to us later.
146000	149000	But I think this topic, especially recently,
149000	152000	is particularly in line with the current situation.
152000	156000	During COVID-19, Taiwan may not be very obvious,
156000	159000	but abroad, there are indeed quite a lot of people
159000	162000	who are concerned about gender equality.
162000	165000	Many parents and children
165000	168000	may be stuck at home all day long
168000	171000	due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
171000	174000	So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.
174000	177000	So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.
177000	180000	This is Gaoxue's brief introduction.
180000	183000	Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.
183000	186000	Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.
186000	189000	The topic of our session today is
189000	192000	about Gaoxue's speech after her presentation.
192000	195000	about Gaoxue's speech after her presentation.
195000	198000	There will be Q&A at the end.
198000	201000	But the Project Hera's mode is quite casual.
201000	204000	So if you have any questions,
204000	207000	you can just turn on your microphone and ask.
207000	210000	Or if you feel a little embarrassed,
210000	213000	you can leave a comment in the chat.
213000	216000	Or you can also leave a comment
216000	219000	at the end of the Q&A.
219000	222000	That's all for my introduction.
222000	225000	Gaoxue, it's your turn.
225000	228000	Gaoxue, it's your turn.
228000	231000	Thank you for your kind introduction.
231000	234000	I'm Lin Gaoxue.
234000	237000	I'm Lin Gaoxue.
237000	240000	I'm Lin Gaoxue.
240000	243000	Lin Gaoxue.
243000	246000	I'm Lin Gaoxue.
246000	249000	My name is Lin Gaoxue.
249000	252000	I'm a Ph.D. student in the research lab of Parenthoven Research Lab.
252000	255000	Let me introduce our school first.
255000	258000	Our school's name in Chinese is the Parenthoven Research Lab.
258000	261000	Fifty years ago, there was a political dispute over the unification of Taiwan.
261000	264000	In Belgium, this political dispute was led by the mother tongue.
264000	267000	In Belgium, this political dispute was led by the mother tongue.
267000	270000	Fifty years ago, our Parenthoven Research Lab
270000	273000	was divided into two groups,
273000	276000	which were the parents and native speakers.
276000	279000	The first one was the first Parenthoben,
279000	282000	which was more Spanish-speaking,
282000	285000	while the other group was the second Parenthoven.
285000	288000	We call it the Anthropology and Japanese Studies University.
288000	291000	We are only different in terms of the knowledge,
291000	294000	but our training is the Hangul and French.
294000	297000	but our training is the Hangul and French.
297000	300000	We are only different in terms of the knowledge,
300000	303000	but our training is the Hangul and French.
303000	306000	After introducing our school,
306000	309000	let me introduce myself.
309000	312000	Thank you for the introduction.
312000	315000	I have been at the University of Taiwan
315000	318000	for 8 years.
318000	321000	My major is Chemistry,
321000	324000	and my minor is Psychology.
324000	327000	My major is Psychology.
327000	330000	In 2019,
330000	333000	I joined the University of Taiwan
333000	336000	to study for my Ph.D.
336000	339000	My major is Psychology,
339000	342000	and I joined the two subfields,
342000	345000	Culture and Health Psychology.
345000	348000	I used to be a full-time
348000	351000	Chemistry teacher in Songshan High School,
351000	354000	and now I am a full-time research assistant
354000	357000	in the Laboratory of Professor Cao Zheng-cao
357000	360000	at the Department of Communication and Technology
360000	363000	of the Department of Communication and Technology.
363000	366000	I am interested in the emotional experience
366000	369000	in my family,
369000	372000	especially the influence of parents
372000	375000	in the social culture.
375000	378000	The keywords of my research theme
378000	381000	include parenting stress, parental burnout,
381000	384000	and emotional regulation
384000	387000	of how parents deal with their emotions related to stress.
387000	390000	I will use a physiological indicator
390000	393000	to measure the stress of a person.
393000	396000	I will use cultural perspective
396000	399000	or the network analysis commonly used in communication psychology
399000	402000	to care about the relationship between people
402000	405000	or the different phenomena in people's minds.
406000	409000	At the beginning of the report,
409000	412000	I will introduce my field,
412000	415000	the field of developmental psychology.
415000	418000	I refer to the introduction
418000	421000	made by my master's class teacher,
421000	424000	Prof. Lei Ganlin, in the online course of Coursera.
424000	427000	From his point of view,
427000	430000	before we get to know the development of psychology,
430000	433000	we may need to understand what psychology is.
433000	436000	Psychology cares about the knowledge of people and minds.
436000	439000	It also includes the field of experimental psychology.
439000	442000	In this field,
442000	445000	we may want to care about a person's cognitive,
445000	448000	emotions, language,
448000	451000	and even our intuition.
451000	454000	We also include social and personality psychology.
454000	457000	In this field, we care about a person's personality.
457000	460000	We care about social psychology
460000	463000	and the special cultural phenomenon
463000	466000	in a cultural community.
466000	469000	We also care about the similarities and differences
469000	472000	between different cultures.
472000	475000	Of course, applied psychology is also a major field in psychology.
475000	478000	For example, criminal psychology,
478000	481000	which I mentioned before.
481000	484000	It also includes the issues of clinical psychology
484000	487000	in the interaction between clinical psychologists and patients.
487000	490000	In the field of education or organization,
490000	493000	there are also many issues discussed in psychology.
493000	496000	Regardless of the field,
496000	499000	we must accept the training provided by the following three sets of knowledge.
502000	505000	The first is physiological psychology.
505000	508000	Regardless of which field we are,
508000	511000	we must understand that there is a set of physiological mechanisms
511000	514000	behind everyone's behavior and cognition.
514000	517000	In addition to this,
517000	520000	when we measure the abstract phenomenon in psychology,
520000	523000	we must be sure that the phenomenon we measure
523000	526000	is what we think in our mind.
526000	529000	This approach is usually a psychometric method.
529000	532000	The last is developmental psychology.
532000	535000	Developmental psychology provides us
535000	538000	with a holistic approach
538000	541000	that allows us to understand that each of us is developing over time.
541000	544000	The current time will affect my current behavior,
544000	547000	and the current time will affect my future time.
547000	550000	So we are all evolving and developing
550000	553000	over a period of time.
553000	556000	In this case, everyone will interact with their society,
556000	559000	so they will play different roles.
559000	562000	For example, you may play a student,
562000	565000	you may play a partner, you may play a friend,
565000	568000	or even a parent.
568000	571000	The development of cognition,
571000	574000	the development of language, the development of character,
574000	577000	the development of emotion, and even the development of action
577000	580000	will be discussed in different topics.
580000	583000	My research focuses on the relevant issues
583000	586000	when a person is a parent.
586000	589000	Parenting psychology
589000	592000	is a very popular research topic
592000	595000	in developmental psychology in the past.
595000	598000	Some researchers even believe that
598000	601000	the relevant life experience of parenting
601000	604000	is a very central aspect of our modern life.
604000	607000	The reason why this experience
607000	610000	is so important is that
610000	613000	when we are middle-aged and become parents,
613000	616000	we do a lot of things
616000	619000	that are driven by parenting.
619000	622000	Some researchers even believe
623000	626000	that parenting is a fundamental human need
626000	629000	or human motive.
629000	632000	Since parenting is such an important life experience,
632000	635000	it is very complicated.
635000	638000	If there are teachers or students
638000	641000	who are now parents,
641000	644000	they will be very familiar with the following sentence.
644000	647000	Parenting is a very good experience.
647000	650000	Because of being parents, we have experienced a lot of things
650000	653000	and gained a sense of meaning.
653000	656000	But at the same time,
656000	659000	we also feel a lot of pressure because we are parents.
659000	662000	In my master's class,
662000	665000	I especially focused on the general situation.
665000	668000	When parents are taking care of their children,
668000	671000	they feel the daily pressure to discuss.
671000	674000	After I completed a theory model
674000	677000	for a master's thesis,
677000	680000	like what I wrote on Facebook,
680000	683000	maybe because I am a chemistry intern
683000	686000	who graduated from NTU,
686000	689000	many parents came to me to discuss
689000	692000	the psychological development of their children.
692000	695000	In fact,
695000	698000	rather than discussing the development of their children with me,
698000	701000	I feel that these parents need an ear
701000	704000	to listen to their pain
704000	707000	in the past few years.
707000	710000	For example,
710000	713000	what they often say to me is,
713000	716000	Teacher, I really don't know what to do.
716000	719000	Can you help me? We are really helpless as parents.
719000	722000	We are really tired.
722000	725000	This is what a group of teenagers' parents told me.
725000	728000	When they talk about this,
728000	731000	they usually play along with their tears.
731000	734000	In the course of the internship,
734000	737000	I often think about
737000	740000	whether my simple model
740000	743000	of daily stress relief
743000	746000	is suitable to explain
746000	749000	the intense depression
749000	752000	these parents feel.
752000	755000	At this time,
755000	758000	in 2019, I met my two bosses.
758000	761000	They are recruiting PhD students
761000	764000	to discuss the extreme phenomenon
764000	767000	of parenting stress,
767000	770000	so I went from NTU Psychology
770000	773000	to the University of Paris.
773000	776000	In particular, I will further discuss
776000	779000	the topic of Parental Burnout in my PhD paper.
779000	782000	This brings me to the main focus of my report today,
782000	785000	Parental Burnout.
786000	789000	I will talk about this concept from a historical background.
789000	792000	I will also talk about how we define
792000	795000	Parental Burnout from the perspective of psychology.
795000	798000	I will also ask a question,
798000	801000	why is Parental Burnout so important?
801000	804000	It must be because we consider its consequences.
804000	807000	Finally, we want to provide a method
807000	810000	to deal with Parental Burnout.
810000	813000	Before dealing with it,
814000	817000	let's start with the concept of Parental Burnout.
817000	820000	If you are a parent,
820000	823000	you may have experienced the following experiences.
823000	826000	If you are a psychologist,
826000	829000	you may have heard of these experiences from your parents.
829000	832000	These experiences are what we visit
832000	835000	those parents who have obviously been
835000	838000	traumatized by Parental Burnout.
838000	841000	We ask them,
842000	845000	what is Parental Burnout?
845000	848000	They will tell you,
848000	851000	this is a giant fatigue.
851000	854000	They live every day,
854000	857000	just trying to get by.
857000	860000	They live like a robot,
860000	863000	dealing with Parental Burnout every day.
863000	866000	Parental Burnout is like a mess.
866000	869000	Parental Burnout is like a mess.
869000	872000	Just trying to take care of their kids.
872000	875000	But they found out that
875000	878000	it is hard to control their kids.
878000	881000	They could not bear their kids.
881000	884000	The most horrible thing is,
884000	887000	they told us,
887000	890000	if they could not imagine
890000	893000	that they could become a parent like that.
893000	896000	These are what we visit
896000	899000	parents of parental burnout.
899000	902000	When we asked them about their experience,
902000	905000	they told us.
905000	908000	This phenomenon was discovered by
908000	911000	a Russian researcher, Enika.
911000	914000	She found out that
914000	917000	parents of children with brain hemorrhage
917000	920000	seem to have some asthmatic phenomenon.
920000	923000	Not only that,
923000	926000	parents of children with chronic illness
926000	929000	also have this phenomenon.
929000	932000	For example,
932000	935000	parents of children with diabetes
935000	938000	also have this phenomenon.
938000	941000	We found out that
941000	944000	parents of children with special needs
944000	947000	also have this phenomenon.
947000	950000	My two instructors,
950000	953000	we asked them further.
953000	956000	Is it possible that
956000	959000	this asthmatic phenomenon
959000	962000	not only occurs in families with special needs?
962000	965000	Is it possible that
965000	968000	this phenomenon also occurs in ordinary families?
968000	971000	Why did they ask this question?
971000	974000	Mainly because they observed
974000	977000	a large-scale change in modern culture.
977000	980000	Whether it's official or
980000	983000	books in our rooms,
983000	986000	we promoted a kind of
986000	989000	noble guide on education,
989000	992000	namely positive parenting.
992000	995000	We asked our parents to
995000	998000	adopt non-violent,
998000	1001000	loving, supportive, and sensitive
1001000	1004000	education to face our children.
1004000	1007000	If you see this kind of
1007000	1010000	propaganda,
1010000	1013000	you can see that
1013000	1016000	there is even a positive parenting tip
1016000	1019000	on CDD's website in the US.
1019000	1022000	A book was also published in the EU
1022000	1025000	to talk about how parents can
1025000	1028000	teach their children.
1028000	1031000	One of the ideas is positive parenting.
1031000	1034000	In Taiwan,
1034000	1037000	CDD has been promoting
1037000	1040000	positive parenting.
1040000	1043000	Another thing is that
1043000	1046000	parents' custody
1046000	1049000	is also under the control of the government.
1049000	1052000	For example,
1052000	1055000	if our parents take a strict education,
1055000	1058000	such as scolding or beating our children,
1058000	1061000	our government may not be able to
1061000	1064000	teach our children well.
1064000	1067000	In this case,
1067000	1070000	our parents' rights are constantly being adjusted.
1070000	1073000	Children's rights are constantly increasing.
1073000	1076000	The concept of positive parenting is that
1076000	1079000	we need to respect our children.
1079000	1082000	In fact, our children
1082000	1085000	are increasingly disrespecting our parents.
1085000	1088000	We also see that
1088000	1091000	our husbands are still maintaining their jobs.
1091000	1094000	Many women are
1094000	1097000	starting to work.
1097000	1100000	A family becomes a double-minded family.
1100000	1103000	However, there are still many problems with children.
1103000	1106000	The time that parents can allocate to their children
1106000	1109000	is relatively compressed.
1109000	1112000	When parents' resources are compressed,
1112000	1115000	it is easier for them to feel
1115000	1118000	the pressure of raising their children.
1118000	1121000	Of course,
1121000	1124000	women should not return to the family environment.
1124000	1127000	The change in the economic environment
1127000	1130000	makes the time for the husband and wife
1130000	1133000	to take care of their children less and less.
1133000	1136000	Because of this environment,
1136000	1139000	two teachers asked
1139000	1142000	if it is possible to see
1142000	1145000	parental burnout in ordinary families.
1145000	1148000	In recent cross-cultural research,
1148000	1151000	it is estimated that
1151000	1154000	at least 5% of parents in the United States,
1154000	1157000	more than 3.5 million parents,
1157000	1160000	are suffering from parental burnout.
1160000	1163000	Parental burnout is a new prevailing psychological syndrome.
1163000	1166000	In fact,
1166000	1169000	in a well-known psychological science website,
1169000	1172000	there are experts who are specifically introducing
1172000	1175000	what parental burnout is.
1175000	1178000	In the New York Times and CNN Opinion,
1178000	1181000	many reporters and food workers
1181000	1184000	are constantly advocating parental burnout
1184000	1187000	during the quarantine period.
1187000	1190000	We should provide the first-hand help
1190000	1193000	to such a phenomenon.
1193000	1196000	In 2017,
1196000	1199000	researchers from more than 100 countries
1199000	1202000	around the world
1202000	1205000	organized an international consulting
1205000	1208000	to focus on
1208000	1211000	what parental burnout is.
1211000	1214000	We pay special attention to whether parental burnout
1214000	1217000	appears not only in the United States and Europe,
1217000	1220000	but also in various cultures around the world.
1220000	1223000	Basically, every year,
1223000	1226000	we hold a seminar to share
1226000	1229000	the recent research results of parental burnout.
1229000	1232000	Last year, we held the first seminar
1232000	1235000	to discuss the epidemic in Belgium.
1235000	1238000	This year, we will hold the second conference
1238000	1241000	on parental burnout in Poland.
1241000	1244000	However, due to the epidemic,
1244000	1247000	we will postpone it until next year, 2021.
1247000	1250000	Welcome to our seminar.
1250000	1253000	Let's join us
1253000	1256000	to discuss the topic of parental burnout.
1256000	1259000	Let's go back to science.
1259000	1262000	To discuss parental burnout,
1262000	1265000	the first thing we need to do is to tell you
1265000	1268000	that the phenomenon we measure really exists.
1268000	1271000	We use two ways to define parental burnout.
1271000	1274000	In the past,
1274000	1277000	there was a very well-developed concept,
1277000	1280000	job burnout,
1280000	1283000	which was discussed.
1283000	1286000	We changed it into a way
1286000	1289000	suitable for parenting context
1289000	1292000	through a top-down approach
1292000	1295000	to define parental burnout.
1295000	1298000	The second way is to interview
1298000	1301000	parents who are already
1301000	1304000	in the job market.
1304000	1307000	This is a bottom-up approach
1307000	1310000	to define parental burnout.
1310000	1313000	After two years of research and definition,
1313000	1316000	we finally defined it as a psychological syndrome
1316000	1319000	with four major symptoms.
1319000	1322000	The first symptom is that
1322000	1325000	you feel exhausted by your role as a parent.
1325000	1328000	For example,
1328000	1331000	I am completely run down by my role as a parent.
1331000	1334000	The second symptom is that
1334000	1337000	you feel the distance between you and your child.
1337000	1340000	For example,
1340000	1343000	I do what I am supposed to do for my children,
1343000	1346000	but nothing more.
1346000	1349000	I can't stand my role as a father
1349000	1352000	and mother anymore.
1352000	1355000	The last symptom is
1355000	1358000	contrast with previous parental self.
1358000	1361000	For example,
1361000	1364000	I don't think I am a good father and mother
1364000	1367000	like I used to be to my children.
1367000	1370000	After defining the four major symptoms
1370000	1373000	of parental burnout
1373000	1376000	through psychological syndrome,
1376000	1379000	the next question is
1379000	1382000	whether the concept of parental burnout
1382000	1385000	is a specific concept.
1385000	1388000	In our recent research,
1388000	1391000	we asked parents about their work burnout
1391000	1394000	and their parental burnout.
1394000	1397000	We took their answers
1397000	1400000	and did a factor analysis.
1400000	1403000	We found that
1403000	1406000	when we separate the two factors,
1406000	1409000	parental burnout and work burnout,
1409000	1412000	it is more suitable than
1412000	1415000	when we combine the two concepts
1415000	1418000	into one.
1418000	1421000	From this result,
1421000	1424000	we can see that
1424000	1427000	parental burnout has a variable effect.
1427000	1430000	I hope that
1430000	1433000	the above introduction can convince you that
1433000	1436000	parental burnout really exists.
1436000	1439000	It is a psychological concept
1439000	1442000	that can be measured
1442000	1445000	and has a professional definition.
1445000	1448000	The next question is
1448000	1451000	if it really exists,
1451000	1454000	is it really important?
1454000	1457000	If we want to consider whether it is important or not,
1457000	1460000	we must consider its consequences.
1460000	1463000	In the following session,
1463000	1466000	in our early research,
1466000	1469000	we found that parental burnout
1469000	1472000	can predict the idea of parents
1472000	1475000	avoiding and committing suicide
1475000	1478000	at the same time.
1478000	1481000	We can imagine that
1481000	1484000	a parent who is under pressure
1484000	1487000	has two most common reactions.
1487000	1490000	One is to avoid.
1490000	1493000	However,
1493000	1496000	parenting is completely different
1496000	1499000	from the work environment.
1499000	1502000	If we feel tired at work,
1502000	1505000	we can ask for sick leave,
1505000	1508000	we can even resign.
1508000	1511000	However, as parents,
1511000	1514000	we can't ask for leave or resign.
1514000	1517000	We are always the parents of the child.
1517000	1520000	We can see that
1520000	1523000	parents have suicidal thoughts.
1523000	1526000	In addition,
1526000	1529000	we can see that parents have drug addiction.
1529000	1532000	If they have parental burnout,
1532000	1535000	we can imagine that
1535000	1538000	a person who wants to avoid these related things
1538000	1541000	may take drugs to avoid
1541000	1544000	and continue to think about these related issues.
1544000	1547000	We can also see that
1547000	1550000	parents who are under parental burnout
1550000	1553000	can predict that
1553000	1556000	they will be violent to their children.
1556000	1559000	We can also imagine that
1559000	1562000	when we are under pressure,
1562000	1565000	in addition to avoiding,
1565000	1568000	another way is to attack.
1568000	1571000	We can see that
1571000	1574000	parents who are under parental burnout
1574000	1577000	are more likely to abuse their children.
1577000	1580000	We can also see that
1580000	1583000	parents who are under parental burnout may ignore their children.
1583000	1586000	Finally, we can see that
1586000	1589000	parents who are under parental burnout
1589000	1592000	will be deeply affected
1592000	1595000	by the relationship between their husband and wife
1595000	1598000	when they are in a marital relationship.
1598000	1601000	We can further discuss these consequences
1601000	1604000	for such issues.
1604000	1607000	We need to make sure that
1607000	1610000	the consequences of parental burnout
1610000	1613000	occur after parental burnout.
1613000	1616000	We need to make sure that
1616000	1619000	the consequences of parental burnout
1619000	1622000	occur after parental burnout.
1622000	1625000	We use a research analysis method
1625000	1628000	to collect data for three times
1628000	1631000	at different time points across 5.5 months.
1631000	1634000	to collect data for three times across 5.5 months across 5.5 months
1634000	1637000	to analyze whether our parental burnout
1637000	1640000	can predict the result of the next time point.
1640000	1643000	For example,
1643000	1646000	we can see that
1646000	1649000	ESCAPE IDIATION and PARENTAL NECKLACE
1649000	1652000	can be controlled
1653000	1656000	for the results of the next time point.
1656000	1659000	for the results of the next time point.
1659000	1662000	You can see that
1662000	1665000	ESCAPE IDIATION and PARENTAL NECKLACE

3624000	3627000	Okay.
3627000	3630000	Thank you for your presentation.
3630000	3633000	I have a question.
3633000	3636000	You mentioned that
3636000	3639000	PARENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
3639000	3642000	is a very important factor.
3642000	3645000	Do you find that
3645000	3648000	it has something to do with genetics?
3648000	3651000	Is it related to genes?
3651000	3654000	Or,
3654000	3657000	in the future
3657000	3660000	when parents
3660000	3663000	get birthed in,
3663000	3666000	there is also the risk of parental burnout?
3666000	3669000	Thank you.
3669000	3672000	First of all,
3672000	3675000	as far as I know,
3675000	3678000	there are no proofs for THIS.
3678000	3681000	I have to admit that
3681000	3684000	the topic of parental burnout
3684000	3687000	is a new topic
3687000	3690000	in the last 5 years.
3690000	3693000	So, I think,
3693000	3696000	at least as far as my knowledge,
3696000	3699000	I haven't seen any discussion on the related genes.
3699000	3702000	But I can see,
3702000	3705000	for example, depression,
3705000	3708000	I can guess that
3708000	3711000	in the topic of parental burnout,
3711000	3714000	or even in the topic of job burnout,
3714000	3717000	I am not familiar with the topic of job burnout.
3717000	3720000	But I think there are many genes
3720000	3723000	that play an important role.
3723000	3726000	This is the first question.
3726000	3729000	The second question is,
3729000	3732000	can you repeat the second question?
3732000	3735000	The first question is,
3735000	3738000	can parents
3738000	3741000	get birthed in,
3741000	3744000	there is also the risk of parental burnout?
3744000	3747000	Is there any similar phenomenon?
3747000	3750000	OK.
3750000	3753000	We are still in the process of research,
3753000	3756000	so we don't know how the next generation
3756000	3759000	will raise their children.
3759000	3762000	From the past research,
3762000	3765000	we can see that
3765000	3768000	if the previous generation
3768000	3771000	took violent
3771000	3774000	or negative behavior,
3774000	3777000	the next generation
3777000	3780000	will also take negative behavior.
3780000	3783000	This is a vicious cycle.
3783000	3786000	This is a very good question.
3786000	3789000	Maybe the parents
3789000	3792000	who are in parental burnout,
3792000	3795000	their children
3795000	3798000	may continue to be in parental burnout.
3798000	3801000	But because our children have not grown up yet,
3801000	3804000	we are not sure
3804000	3807000	if this phenomenon is possible.
3807000	3810000	But it is possible.
3810000	3813000	Thank you.
3814000	3817000	Let's see if there are any questions
3817000	3820000	from the audience.
3820000	3823000	Hello.
3823000	3826000	I have a question
3826000	3829000	about this paper.
3829000	3832000	First of all, thank you for this presentation.
3832000	3835000	My research is related to the role of parents.
3835000	3838000	My group focuses on
3838000	3841000	the experience of parenting
3841000	3844000	, so there are many things to connect with.
3844000	3847000	I would like to ask about this paper.
3847000	3850000	The author is Gao Xian.
3850000	3853000	When he wrote this paper,
3853000	3856000	he mentioned that
3856000	3859000	part of the parental psychological characteristics
3859000	3862000	is their own EQ.
3862000	3865000	The other part is that they want to be a perfect parent.
3865000	3868000	This idea may also cause
3868000	3871000	parental burnout.
3871000	3874000	I would like to know
3874000	3877000	if this is a trend
3877000	3880000	or a goal standard
3880000	3883000	for parents.
3883000	3886000	I would like to know
3886000	3889000	if this is a trend
3889000	3892000	or a goal standard
3892000	3895000	for parents.
3895000	3898000	I would like to know
3898000	3901000	if this is a trend
3901000	3904000	or a goal standard
3904000	3907000	for parents.
3907000	3910000	I would like to know
3910000	3913000	if this is a trend
3913000	3916000	or a goal standard
3916000	3919000	for parents.
3919000	3922000	I would like to know
3922000	3925000	if this is a trend
3925000	3928000	or a goal standard
3928000	3931000	for parents.
3931000	3934000	I would like to know
3934000	3937000	if this is a trend

5555000	5558000	I am a researcher
5558000	5561000	and I immigrated to the US.
5561000	5564000	I was originally from Taiwan,
5564000	5567000	Hong Kong, and the US.
5567000	5570000	I decided to move to the US
5570000	5573000	because I have a child with a mental disability.
5573000	5576000	I decided to move to the US
5576000	5579000	because I have a child with a mental disability.
5579000	5582000	I decided to move to the US
5582000	5585000	because my assumption was that
5585000	5588000	parents were expecting their children
5588000	5591000	to be a good parent.
5591000	5594000	to be a good parent.
5594000	5597000	It was hard for them
5597000	5600000	to agree on their goals
5600000	5603000	when they were raised in a Chinese society.
5603000	5606000	It was hard for them to agree on their goals
5606000	5609000	when they were raised in a Chinese society.
5609000	5612000	I assumed that
5612000	5615000	they would feel more pressure
5615000	5618000	to adjust their education
5618000	5621000	to fit the mainstream American culture.
5621000	5624000	I asked them similar questions.
5624000	5627000	I asked them similar questions.
5627000	5630000	What do you think is a good parent
5630000	5633000	in your original culture?
5633000	5636000	What do you think is a good parent
5636000	5639000	in your original culture?
5639000	5642000	What do you think is a good parent
5642000	5645000	in your original culture?
5645000	5648000	I am a family member with a mental disability.
5648000	5651000	I am a family member with a mental disability.
5651000	5654000	In my culture,
5654000	5657000	the acceptance of parents
5657000	5660000	in this country is much higher.
5660000	5663000	In my culture,
5663000	5666000	parents respect their children
5666000	5669000	and how they raise their children.
5669000	5672000	Even if a child has an emotional breakdown,
5672000	5675000	the society has a high tolerance for such a situation.
5675000	5678000	The society has a high tolerance for such a situation.
5678000	5681000	The pressure of raising a child with a mental disability
5681000	5684000	is much lower than in their original country.
5684000	5687000	This cross-culture does not cause too much pressure on them.
5687000	5690000	However, my research is a culture change.
5690000	5693000	The current research is a culture change.
5693000	5696000	It is not the same as the research that you are doing in your country.
5696000	5699000	It is not the same as the research that you are doing in your country.
5699000	5702000	This research is very interesting.
5702000	5705000	I want to share it with you.
5705000	5708000	Have you read a 2014 article by Charlie Sum Chu
5708000	5711000	Have you read a 2014 article by Charlie Sum Chu
5711000	5714000	about Thai parenting?
5714000	5717000	He is specializing in Chinese families
5718000	5721000	In the United States.
5721000	5722000	He mentioned that
5722000	5725000	Chinese parents
5725000	5728000	are proud of their children
5731000	5734000	but also make sure their children
5734000	5737000	are educated like the world requires.
5737000	5740000	In addition to this,
5740000	5743000	they also want their children
5743000	5746000	to stay in the family
5746000	5749000	and feel their values in China.
5749000	5751000	They might even be strengthened.
5751000	5754000	I remember...
5754000	5756000	Is it Kangyi?
5756000	5758000	I'm afraid I said it wrong.
5758000	5760000	I think it's Kangyi.
5760000	5762000	They might strengthen
5762000	5764000	their original culture
5764000	5768000	in the immigrant family.
5768000	5770000	That's what I remember.
5770000	5772000	I wouldn't be surprised
5772000	5773000	if that's the case.
5773000	5774000	Indeed,
5774000	5777000	my research focuses on
5777000	5779000	disability.
5779000	5780000	I can only look at
5780000	5782000	the intersectionality
5782000	5785000	between disability, culture, and parenting.
5785000	5787000	It's very different
5787000	5790000	from just looking at the family.
5790000	5792000	I can only say that
5792000	5794000	having a family
5794000	5796000	with different characteristics
5796000	5798000	from other families
5798000	5801000	does affect the whole relationship.
5801000	5802000	I think
5802000	5805000	I can do more research on this
5805000	5807000	in the future.
5807000	5809000	I don't know how to
5809000	5812000	take this into consideration.
5812000	5814000	It's just my opinion.
5814000	5816000	You mentioned the education culture
5816000	5818000	of special families.
5818000	5820000	I think it's very interesting.
5820000	5822000	You mentioned
5822000	5824000	the intersectionality
5824000	5826000	between special families
5826000	5827000	and education culture.
5827000	5829000	It's very interesting.
5833000	5834000	Thank you.
5839000	5841000	I'm looking forward to your paper.
5841000	5843000	Or any...
5845000	5847000	Any publication.
5851000	5853000	I'm looking forward to your paper.
5853000	5855000	My first paper
5855000	5857000	is on meta-synthesis.
5857000	5859000	It's like a meta-analysis
5859000	5860000	of a qualitative model.
5860000	5861000	This paper has been published.
5862000	5864000	I'll link it to you later.
5864000	5866000	It's more of a literature review.
5866000	5868000	It talks about the intersectionality
5868000	5870000	between parents.
5870000	5872000	We generally talk about the role of parents.
5872000	5874000	But there are many aspects
5874000	5876000	under the role of parents.
5876000	5878000	They may just provide
5878000	5880000	the care of everyday life.
5880000	5882000	Or they may play
5882000	5884000	the role of
5884000	5886000	family financial support.
5886000	5888000	At the same time,
5888000	5890000	there are many other aspects
5890000	5892000	under the umbrella term
5892000	5894000	of parents.
5894000	5896000	So my first paper
5896000	5898000	is about this.
5898000	5900000	My second paper
5900000	5902000	is purely on qualitative research.
5902000	5904000	It hasn't been published yet.
5904000	5906000	I hope I can finish it this year.
5906000	5908000	I see.
5908000	5910000	I hope you can finish it soon.
5910000	5912000	I can't wait to see your paper.
5914000	5916000	I'm looking forward to
5916000	5918000	your comment.
5918000	5920000	Your first paper.
5922000	5924000	Okay.
5924000	5926000	I'll look for it.
5926000	5928000	Yiting is posting
5928000	5930000	her paper link
5930000	5932000	in the chat.
5932000	5934000	I'm quite happy
5934000	5936000	that today's discussion
5936000	5938000	is very heated.
5938000	5940000	I think it's as exciting
5940000	5942000	as the speech itself.
5944000	5946000	Due to time constraints,
5946000	5948000	I'd like to ask
5948000	5950000	whether you have
5950000	5952000	any last words
5952000	5954000	or take home message
5954000	5956000	for the audience
5956000	5958000	or future audience
5958000	5960000	who can listen to
5960000	5962000	the speech
5962000	5964000	on Project Taira.
5968000	5970000	Parental balance is a very important issue.
5970000	5972000	We think it's a very important issue.
5972000	5974000	There are many social cultures
5974000	5976000	and personal factors
5976000	5978000	that play an important role.
5978000	5980000	As I said in the final remark,
5980000	5982000	we hope to rebalance
5982000	5984000	the entire research.
5984000	5986000	In the past,
5986000	5988000	we only cared about the child's
5988000	5990000	positive development.
5990000	5992000	We also hope that
5992000	5994000	we can care more about
5994000	5996000	the health of parents themselves
5996000	5998000	in the future research.
5998000	6000000	We hope that
6000000	6002000	we can contribute
6002000	6004000	more to the research.
6004000	6006000	That's all.
6006000	6008000	Thank you, Annie.
6008000	6010000	Thank you, Kaohsiung.
6010000	6012000	I think Kaohsiung's speech
