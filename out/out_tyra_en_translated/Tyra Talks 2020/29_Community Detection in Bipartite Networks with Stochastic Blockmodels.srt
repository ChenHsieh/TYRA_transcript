1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let me share the video.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
While Ziqi is preparing for the video, let me introduce Ziqi.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello everyone, I am your host today, Zhang Yanping.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Our speaker today is Yan Ziqi.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yan Ziqi is a neuroscientist based in Colorado.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You will hear more about her in her presentation later.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
She specializes in community detection.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You will hear more about her in her presentation later.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's talk about Ziqi's background.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When Ziqi was in college, she studied biology, chemistry, and biochemistry.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This reminds me of some of my online friends.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Online friends seem to do a lot of other things at the same time.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
She was a network scientist who was delayed by chemistry,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and then she still had to be a network scientist.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
After graduating from college,

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ziqi did a lot of work as a research assistant or a software engineer.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So she slowly turned to information technology.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
From the perspective of information technology, she became a network scientist.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All the information is very helpful to the host.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
She has a very complete personal website.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you are interested, you can find it on the website.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Including her recent activities.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She has done a lot of public service or network science promotion activities.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There will be a schedule for her recent activities.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can follow her schedule.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can also read her articles.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Without further ado,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
let me give a round of applause to welcome our speaker today, Ziqi.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you all for listening to my speech.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I prepared about 50 slides today.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The goal is to finish in an hour.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The topic of this speech is

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to do community analysis on a network called bipartite network.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A bipartite network is the one you see on the screen now.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It consists of blue and red.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A bipartite network is the one you see on the screen now.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A bipartite network is the one you see on the screen now.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Daniel Laramore and I

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
developed a statistical model

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
called Stochastic Block Model

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to fit the network

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and find the community in the network.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The most important thing is

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't know the structure of the network yet.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
On the left side of the picture,

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
you only know it's bipartite.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We want to know

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
whether each type of bipartite network

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
can be subdivided into smaller networks.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If it's possible,

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
we want to know how big the statistical model is.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then I'll know how to divide it.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can see the PDF slides and related tweets.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My goal today is to talk about

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
why we need to look at the large-scale network structure

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and how to find these structures

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and the related references.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
In 1718,

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
when I was still an engineer,

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mr. Li Zhengde from the Department of Statistics

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
asked me to share with the students

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
in the Department of Statistics

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
what they did

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
in software engineering.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I designed a course

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to let them use Python

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
to analyze their own network.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I had six hours to talk about it.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I designed a questionnaire.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I asked them to fill in their name,

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
school number,

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and their friends in the class.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They could also

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
include their own attributes,

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
such as gender, age,

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
age,

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and other things.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Sorry,

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
which page are we at now?

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We're looking at the editor's screen.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's the first page.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Or are you...

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm already on the second page.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sorry.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You might want to switch...

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Are you playing it?

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm playing it on my Keynote.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But it doesn't look like it.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let me see.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can you play it first

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and then share?

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And then share.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Play it first and then share.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, play it first and then share.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You have to press...

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sorry, let me see.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I have a question.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
After I pressed play,

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I entered the full screen

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and I couldn't see

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
BlueJeans anymore.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, so the host has to check

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
if anyone is talking to you.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't worry about BlueJeans.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, then I...

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let me try it this way.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll share my full screen.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This should be all of it.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes, this is all of it.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, I'll press play now

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and see if anyone jumps in.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is my first page

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and I just got to the second page.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Did anyone jump in?

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, this is what I just said.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Everyone still has it, right?

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, if you have any questions,

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you can tell me

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and you can interrupt me.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, I just said

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that I'll send out a questionnaire

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and let them...

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can I?

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let the students

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
fill out the questionnaire

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and list their names.

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The point is

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
who they think is their friend

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
in the class.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Including some of their own information.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And then...

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Because I'm going to teach them

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
to do some network analysis with Python.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So,

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
after I let them fill out the questionnaire,

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
there's that Google Form when they come in

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and then I'll sort it out

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
into a CSV form like this.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
CSV form.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And then...

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In fact,

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
for example, ID is the person

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
who fills out the questionnaire.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And then ID of Acquaintances

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
is who is their friend.

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So, for example,

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
in the first line,

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you can connect a line

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
from node 1 to node 58.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And so on.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And then there's some

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
metadata about that node.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then I can turn it into

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
a network on that class.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And the funny thing is

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
this class is a statistics class,

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
so most of it is statistics.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And then there are some students

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
from other classes.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And then the students from other classes

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
seem to make friends

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
with the students from other classes.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then even the students from the statistics class

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
have a lot of statistics students.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And then the funny thing is

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
if you say a person is a friend,

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
he doesn't necessarily say you're a friend.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So this direction is pretty cruel.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And then...

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What we see here

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
is a simple example of a network.

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a simple one.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a connection between two points.

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's just a line.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And it's a directional network.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And this network also has metadata.

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That is, nodes or edges

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
can have some other data

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
added to it.

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Or we can go to the US Congress.

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And then we can see

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
that every Congress

185
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
has a speech.

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And then there's the speaker

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and the text of the speech.

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And then this is...

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He can see

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that as this member takes office

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and then as the years go by,

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and then everyone

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
in this member

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
on the word

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is there any change?

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Or is it that

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
everyone is slowly forming a consensus?

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So this is an example.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's a bipartite example.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That is, there are members

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and then there's his speech and text.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's just speech, text, and members.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And it's dynamic

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
because this network will change.

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And then we can also

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
see examples from, for example, brain science.

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And then, for example,

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
this is a study of human connectome.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And then he...

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He stimulated the brain in different places.

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Stimulate the brain.

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then he can see

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
the reaction of the brain in different places.

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And then, for example,

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
in the upper left corner of this picture,

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
he first marked

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
every place in the brain.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
After that,

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
let's see that

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
every place and every place

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
in some...

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
some tasks

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
will have a common reaction.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And then if there is, it will be brighter.

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If not, it will be darker.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And then after that,

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
he can put those

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It looks like a

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
kind of structural thing.

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And then he can

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
do community detection for him.

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And then we can see if

233
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
we can know

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
which different brain areas

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
have similar reactions.

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's it.

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
In this work,

238
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
what we see is a...

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Because it's that...

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The reaction of two brain areas.

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So it's probably

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
0 to 1.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a weighted network.

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And every brain area

245
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
has a spatial distribution.

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So it's also a spatial network.

247
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And he...

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Or you could say

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it's a correlation matrix.

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But in this,

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
we want to understand its structure.

252
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
At this time,

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
if...

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The tool we use at this time.

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Is there any statistical value?

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's very important.

257
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because we don't really know

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
what's behind it.

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What's the structure of his ground truth?

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay.

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So I'm going to define

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
what a network is.

263
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And then we're going to ask

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
some questions about it.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So the network is

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
a lot of nodes

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
entity.

268
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And then

269
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
what about these nodes?

270
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I have to choose

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
two nodes to connect a line.

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And then call it edge.

273
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And then such a collection.

274
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I call it a network.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So we're going to ask some questions up there.

276
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
For example, there are a lot of

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
computer science questions.

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
For example, how to find

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
uh...

280
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The smallest...

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What is it called?

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The smallest node collection

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Uh...

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Every node that's not that collection

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There's at least one side

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
connected to the one you chose.

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And so on.

288
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
A lot of these questions are

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
NP-hard.

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's because of the network.

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This combination

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There are many kinds of relationships.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So it becomes very difficult.

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Or you can also be up there.

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
For example, you want to make a statistical

296
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
A new distribution.

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And then this distribution may be related to some

298
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Uh...

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The nature of some of the systems you've observed.

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So you can say, uh...

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This distribution can be

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's a good way to...

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Um...

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Generate these properties.

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's also a statistical job.

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And then, uh...

307
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There may be some on this network.

308
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
For example,

309
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
For example, we now have

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Now there's a infectious disease.

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So we're going to have an infectious disease between people.

312
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Spread on the Internet.

313
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But the contact between people

314
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
There may also be changes.

315
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So...

316
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So I say it's dynamics.

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
On or off networks.

318
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then there are a lot of interesting questions on this.

319
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Or, uh...

320
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We can look at its structure.

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
For example, we...

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Uh...

323
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What we're looking at now is...

324
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Uh...

325
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
For example, we can predict...

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Um...

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Uh...

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
For example, if this network changes.

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Then we might be able to predict that.

330
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Uh...

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Two nodes are in some time.

332
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's easy to have...

333
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Uh...

334
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
A new generation.

335
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's what it's called.

336
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Uh...

337
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Link prediction.

338
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's it.

339
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's related to the work of that machine learning.

340
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then, um...

341
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What I'm doing right now is talking about.

342
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Uh...

343
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Um...

344
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Large scale...

345
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Uh...

346
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Community structure.

347
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Um...

348
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
My large scale is to say...

349
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
For example, my network is very large.

350
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
For example, there are 100 points.

351
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And then my large scale is at least...

352
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's definitely bigger than that log 100.

353
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's it.

354
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Maybe it's his, uh...

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Uh...

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
10%.

357
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This...

358
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is called a large scale network.

359
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That, um...

360
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I just said...

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
To connect...

362
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
When I connect.

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I can only connect two or two points.

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But if you have some...

365
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The structure of the system is...

366
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Need...

367
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Three or more things.

368
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There's an interaction.

369
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Then I can connect a line.

370
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's connected to three points.

371
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They're called Hyper Edge.

372
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, I can have a higher order structure in it.

373
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's a lot of, uh...

374
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Related work.

375
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And then I recommend...

376
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
These...

377
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
These references, like this.

378
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And then, um...

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What about these studies?

380
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Um...

381
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
A long time ago, in...

382
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Mathematical Graph Theory.

383
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Um...

384
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There's a lot of work, but...

385
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Um...

386
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
For the past 20 years, because...

387
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Everyone uses the Internet, and then there's more data.

388
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And then there's a lot of...

389
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
From the data, the way to ask questions.

390
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And then to develop new methods.

391
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And then maybe...

392
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Um...

393
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
In this large scale structure, the earliest...

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Uh, a pretty early article might be this.

395
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Um...

396
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This work is 2002.

397
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
About 20 years ago.

398
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There are a lot of citations now.

399
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay, and then...

400
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What is a large scale structure?

401
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's, uh...

402
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I said, for example, if you have 100 points.

403
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If it's a network, then this network might be...

404
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You might want to divide it into many groups.

405
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You might want to divide it into 5 groups, 6 groups, 10 groups.

406
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And then...

407
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
For example, if you divide it into 5 groups, it's 100 divided by 5, which is 20.

408
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So it's a number that's comparable to 20 and 100.

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is a large scale.

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And then there are a lot of structures in there.

411
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
For example, the one in the upper left corner is called Assortative.

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's more like the circle of friends we're familiar with.

413
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's, uh...

414
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Friends live together.

415
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And then a group of friends.

416
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So the connection between that group is more dense.

417
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's denser than the group and the group.

418
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But it can also be, for example.

419
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's actually not that dense when you define it as a group.

420
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But when you define it as a group, it's very dense with other groups.

421
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's like the Bipartite Network we're talking about.

422
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's an Assortative Structure.

423
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Or something like that.

424
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So, um...

425
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
How do we quantify these things?

426
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's a central theme of today's talk.

427
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay.

428
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So, um...

429
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In the past, it was in 2002.

430
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Uh...

431
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
After it started.

432
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
In the past, you had to look at the structure of a static network.

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Um...

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We use a, uh...

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's called Quality Function.

436
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Or if it's physics, it's called Observable.

437
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's called Modularity.

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Um...

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's look at it.

440
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That is to say, uh...

441
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This Modularity is the Q of B and A in the upper right corner.

442
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This B is, uh...

443
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
B is, uh...

444
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Which community does each point belong to?

445
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
For example, I have this network now.

446
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It divides it into a red and a blue community.

447
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That is, 0 and 1.

448
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And then let's say this network has a point of N.

449
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Then I am...

450
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Then my B is a...

451
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
A column at the end of N.

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And then the value of each column.

453
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Either 0 or 1.

454
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like this.

455
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So this is an expression.

456
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Uh...

457
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Now this system.

458
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Which group does each node belong to?

459
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's called B.

460
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And then that A is called...

461
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's called...

462
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Correlation.

463
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It means, uh...

464
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Um...

465
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If you draw...

466
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If you have a point of N.

467
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then this A is a correction of N times 1.

468
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then...

469
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Every point has a label.

470
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Uh...

471
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Every point has its vertex ID.

472
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And then two points.

473
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If there is...

474
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Um...

475
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If there is a connection.

476
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You write it as 1.

477
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If there is no connection, it is 0.

478
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So this A is a 0 and 1 correction.

479
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And then, um...

480
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If my system is confirmed.

481
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Then this A is a static thing.

482
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So, uh...

483
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This Modularity.

484
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's the A and B I just said.

485
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Uh...

486
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The function of B.

487
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's it.

488
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And then, uh...

489
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If A is static.

490
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
My job is to...

491
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm going to try to change.

492
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Every node's 0 and 1.

493
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And then...

494
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Uh...

495
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
After the change.

496
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I want to see if my Q has gotten bigger.

497
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's it.

498
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And then I hope I can change it many times.

499
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And then...

500
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Find the biggest Q.

501
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And then...

502
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
After finding it.

503
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Uh...

504
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll say I found a community.

505
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's it.

506
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because Q has actually been said.

507
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That is...

508
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I...

509
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Q...

510
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Uh...

511
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If a lot of...

512
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Uh...

513
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
People in the same group are grouped together.

514
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And then they have a lot of...

515
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Connections between groups.

516
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Then that Q will be big.

517
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And then...

518
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Connections between groups.

519
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If...

520
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A little earlier.

521
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Then that Q will be...

522
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Uh...

523
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Uh...

524
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That Q will be big.

525
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why is it so big?

526
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's because there's a lot in the group.

527
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's dense.

528
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Or it's very scarce between groups.

529
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And it's big.

530
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So you can find one like this.

531
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
A good result of a community.

532
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay, and then...

533
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Uh...

534
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But this...

535
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Uh...

536
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Later, some problems were found.

537
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That is...

538
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If you...

539
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Uh...

540
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Give this method to a random network.

541
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That is, you know you are randomly generated.

542
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That...

543
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You can actually find one.

544
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Pretty good modularity.

545
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But that structure is fake.

546
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So what am I going to do at this time?

547
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Look at my structure.

548
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And it's a very important question in terms of statistics.

549
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
In addition...

550
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Uh...

551
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There are a lot of...

552
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Probably...

553
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Five to ten...

554
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Uh...

555
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Five to fifteen years ago.

556
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
During this period.

557
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There are a lot of...

558
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Uh...

559
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Related heuristic methods.

560
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There are common problems.

561
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
For example...

562
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Uh...

563
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It will have a thing called Resolution Limit.

564
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That is, if you have a very large network.

565
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That...

566
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
After you fit it.

567
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You may not be able to find some...

568
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The small structure in this network.

569
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It will be...

570
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Washed away.

571
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Then a more interesting question is...

572
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Uh...

573
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If...

574
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Uh...

575
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I give a network.

576
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Then I just...

577
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Use the modularity just now.

578
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
To fit it.

579
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then I want to find...

580
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The good partition in this network.

581
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Good...

582
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Good partition, like this.

583
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That...

584
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I will find that...

585
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
There are a lot of good partitions.

586
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is an interesting job.

587
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He...

588
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Said...

589
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Uh...

590
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
There are actually a lot of good partitions.

591
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And it's a bit degenerate.

592
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Every...

593
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Good, good, almost like this.

594
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Then...

595
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So every time you run...

596
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This...

597
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
For this system...

598
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Run that...

599
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Modularity.

600
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
In fact, you don't know what you see.

601
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What is the structure?

602
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So...

603
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Usually everyone just runs a lot of times.

604
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Then say...

605
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Uh...

606
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
See if there is consensus.

607
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Then say...

608
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Uh...

609
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
After running so many times.

610
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Maybe most of them are...

611
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Find what kind of community.

612
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then I said...

613
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll take this as my community.

614
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That...

615
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This is also a problem.

616
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And what I just said is...

617
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The same method you use on this network.

618
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If you have different methods.

619
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If you use the same network.

620
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You may see the community in different ways.

621
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Not quite the same.

622
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And...

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Uh...

624
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If this system has some...

625
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Uh...

626
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
For example, I know that...

627
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Uh...

628
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The class you just said.

629
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Every class has...

630
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He has...

631
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He has...

632
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Separate...

633
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Two different classes.

634
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Then I want to know...

635
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Uh...

636
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The structure of this network.

637
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is it...

638
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
There is a correlation with the class.

639
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Then I will fix it.

640
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Then I'll see...

641
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
How much correlation does that result have with that class?

642
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And then...

643
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Uh...

644
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
In many...

645
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Uh...

646
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There may be this kind of...

647
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
There really is this kind of correlation system.

648
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Actually...

649
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Get some oil.

650
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Also found that...

651
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He has no way to follow his...

652
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Uh...

653
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Those annotations of nodes.

654
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Uh...

655
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Just...

656
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
There is a correlation.

657
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So...

658
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So we don't know what the true model is.

659
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So...

660
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
In this work...

661
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Uh...

662
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I would say that...

663
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
To use statistics...

664
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
To do the right thing.

665
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And...

666
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
There may be no...

667
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
True model.

668
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Good.

669
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Then...

670
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Our...

671
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Our work...

672
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The content will be concentrated in a...

673
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Uh...

674
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Uh...

675
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Uh...

676
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Probability generation model.

677
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Called...

678
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Random block model.

679
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And then...

680
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Uh...

681
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Uh...

682
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Because of this random block model...

683
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Parameters...

684
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Uh...

685
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Uh...

686
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There is a probability nature.

687
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So I can do some inside...

688
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Uh...

689
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Statistical statements.

690
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So I can...

691
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Uh...

692
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Have...

693
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Uh...

694
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The result can have statistical significance.

695
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And then...

696
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Uh...

697
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The most important thing is that I want to use it as a...

698
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No model.

699
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
To see if my system has a structure.

700
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So...

701
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Repeat it again.

702
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Is...

703
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
My job...

704
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Is to hope...

705
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
There is a...

706
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Bipartite network on the left.

707
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I hope to know...

708
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How many groups should it be?

709
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Good.

710
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And then...

711
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Uh...

712
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The kind of...

713
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
We have now introduced SBM.

714
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And then...

715
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Uh...

716
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
In the kind of network structure that I just said...

717
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
In fact...

718
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Uh...

719
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In SBM...

720
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Can have...

721
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Can have a corresponding...

722
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
For example...

723
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Uh...

724
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Uh...

725
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
For example...

726
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Uh...

727
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
In that SBM...

728
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There is a...

729
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There is a...

730
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Parameter called...

731
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Is...

732
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
How do you connect...

733
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Group to group...

734
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Or group to group...

735
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Own...

736
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The...

737
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The probability.

738
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And then...

739
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
This is a...

740
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Uh...

741
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And then...

742
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
This is a...

743
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If you divide it into...

744
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
For example...

745
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The picture on the far left...

746
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If you divide it into five groups...

747
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It is a...

748
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
5x5 matrix.

749
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And then...

750
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Uh...

751
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
5x5 matrix...

752
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Uh...

753
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Its diagonal part...

754
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That is to say...

755
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
My first group and the first group...

756
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What is the probability...

757
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Between 0 and 1...

758
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
To...

759
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
To connect.

760
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And then...

761
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
For example...

762
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I want Assaultitative now...

763
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So I might...

764
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It might be closer to 1.

765
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
For example, 0.9.

766
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And then connect.

767
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And then...

768
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And off-diagonal...

769
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It might be...

770
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
A little smaller.

771
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So I can do this...

772
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Connect a...

773
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
A network like this...

774
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Assaultitative.

775
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So just now...

776
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The kind of...

777
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Um...

778
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
How to connect between groups...

779
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This kind of matrix...

780
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It is...

781
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Uh...

782
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Formalized...

783
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What we just said...

784
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This kind of...

785
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Large-scale structure...

786
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The...

787
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The...

788
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Concept...

789
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And then...

790
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Uh...

791
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
For this work...

792
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Uh...

793
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Now in...

794
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Physical Review 1...

795
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Is a...

796
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Uh...

797
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Physics...

798
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And then...

799
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Uh...

800
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I think...

801
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Our...

802
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
More important contribution is...

803
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We have a...

804
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Uh...

805
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I...

806
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I...

807
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Highlight these things now...

808
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And then...

809
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Uh...

810
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This is also the focus I will emphasize today.

811
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And then...

812
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Uh...

813
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The first one is we...

814
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We have...

815
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
After having said SBM just now...

816
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We want to have...

817
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Have a...

818
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Bayesian...

819
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The...

820
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Uh...

821
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Formulation...

822
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So...

823
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And then...

824
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Uh...

825
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So I will talk about...

826
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
How to...

827
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Estimate...

828
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The so-called SBM Ensemble.

829
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And then...

830
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We will have...

831
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We will still...

832
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Fit this...

833
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Model...

834
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And then...

835
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But the way we fit...

836
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We will use...

837
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
MCMC...

838
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And then...

839
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Dynamic Programming...

840
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And finally...

841
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Uh...

842
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We would like to see...

843
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The model we proposed...

844
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
In the end...

845
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Is it really better in statistics?

846
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So...

847
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I will say some examples...

848
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
In terms of...

849
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It is more sensitive...

850
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Or...

851
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
More sensitive...

852
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That is to say...

853
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It...

854
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Is more likely to...

855
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Really...

856
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
More likely to detect...

857
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Smaller...

858
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Uh...

859
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Network structure...

860
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Uh...

861
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
With...

862
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Um...

863
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
If it is with...

864
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Um...

865
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Not us...

866
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Um...

867
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If it is with...

868
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Um...

869
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Before my work...

870
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The...

871
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
More general...

872
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Method...

873
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
When...

874
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It...

875
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Usually has a higher...

876
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Um...

877
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Posterior probability...

878
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Post-check probability...

879
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So...

880
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It is actually a...

881
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
More...

882
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Um...

883
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Accurate model...

884
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Okay...

885
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And then...

886
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Um...

887
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This work...

888
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Was done...

889
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Four years...

890
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Probably since 2016...

891
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And then...

892
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
At that time...

893
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I was still in Beijing...

894
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And then...

895
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I...

896
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Um...

897
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Participated in a project...

898
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Called...

899
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
aminer.org

900
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It is a...

901
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
A bit like...

902
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
For...

903
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Researchers...

904
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Facebook...

905
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And then...

906
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Um...

907
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I...

908
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Was assigned the task...

909
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
To draw...

910
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
A...

911
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Um...

912
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Network...

913
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Using...

914
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Um...

915
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The following paper method...

916
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And then...

917
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Um...

918
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
This network is to say...

919
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Um...

920
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Which researcher...

921
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He often goes to...

922
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Which meetings...

923
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So...

924
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I now have a researcher meeting...

925
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
A...

926
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
A...

927
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
A matrix...

928
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And then...

929
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I want to say...

930
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I...

931
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I...

932
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I...

933
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
How do I distribute...

934
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
For example...

935
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I choose a meeting now...

936
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I can know...

937
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Hey...

938
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The researchers who often come to this meeting...

939
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Those people...

940
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Maybe...

941
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Do something more similar...

942
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But...

943
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The data is often sparse...

944
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So every time...

945
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Factorize...

946
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It seems to encounter some...

947
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Um...

948
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Divided by zero...

949
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This kind of problem...

950
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Then...

951
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Can't do it...

952
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Then...

953
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Or I don't know...

954
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I want to divide it into several groups...

955
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Then...

956
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Then...

957
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I saw a...

958
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Um...

959
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Work related to SBM...

960
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Then...

961
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Um...

962
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
There is a...

963
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There is a Python library...

964
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Called GraphTool...

965
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He...

966
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Directly implement this SBM...

967
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Then it feels very useful...

968
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Then...

969
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And then...

970
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Um...

971
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Right...

972
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This map...

973
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Um...

974
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The work on the right side of this map...

975
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
In 2014...

976
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He is...

977
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Um...

978
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Um...

979
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Um...

980
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Use...

981
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Bipartite SBM to...

982
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Um...

983
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
He proposed a...

984
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
A...

985
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
A kind of...

986
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
SBM called Bipartite SBM...

987
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Then he said...

988
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Um...

989
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
This kind of Bipartite SBM...

990
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Can...

991
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Strictly stipulate...

992
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You can't find...

993
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
A network solution...

994
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And this solution...

995
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He is...

996
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Not Bipartite...

997
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Because it will violate...

998
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Your assumption of data...

999
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Like this...

1000
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So...

1001
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
For example...

1002
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Um...

1003
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Um...

1004
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Um...

1005
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
If I...

1006
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Want my system...

1007
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Um...

1008
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now see this network...

1009
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If I want my system...

1010
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
To fit...

1011
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
A k equals 5...

1012
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Numbers...

1013
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Numbers of community...

1014
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Then...

1015
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
If it is...

1016
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
The original SBM...

1017
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He may find a result...

1018
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yes...

1019
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes...

1020
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Now see like this...

1021
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But...

1022
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Um...

1023
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
His...

1024
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
He put that...

1025
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Um...

1026
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Different types...

1027
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Between...

1028
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Um...

1029
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Different types are linked together...

1030
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
He is not a Bipartite system...

1031
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Then...

1032
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Whereas...

1033
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
If...

1034
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We have one...

1035
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Can really distinguish different types...

1036
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Then you can find a solution...

1037
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He is Bipartite...

1038
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And he actually has...

1039
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Um...

1040
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Better...

1041
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Likelihood...

1042
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So this is the system...

1043
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The work of that paper...

1044
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Then I thought at that time...

1045
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Um...

1046
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I...

1047
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
This paper does not seem to tell me...

1048
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
How to choose...

1049
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That k...

1050
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That is...

1051
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
In the end...

1052
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
How to go...

1053
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yes...

1054
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Then...

1055
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And at that time I want to apply...

1056
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Um...

1057
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Doctorate...

1058
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So I...

1059
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Um...

1060
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Write a...

1061
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Write an email to this article...

1062
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The first author is...

1063
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Laramore...

1064
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Now also become...

1065
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
One of my boss...

1066
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Then...

1067
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Say...

1068
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I want to do this work with him...

1069
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Then I want to ask him...

1070
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Say...

1071
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
In the end...

1072
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Um...

1073
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
This work...

1074
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Um...

1075
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
This work does not seem to tell us...

1076
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
How to choose k...

1077
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That...

1078
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If...

1079
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Say...

1080
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Can we use...

1081
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Um...

1082
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
This method...

1083
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
To...

1084
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
To choose k...

1085
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
In this case...

1086
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We are equal to...

1087
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Um...

1088
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Extended his...

1089
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Past work...

1090
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This way...

1091
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Then later he...

1092
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Um...

1093
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Promised me...

1094
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Then we...

1095
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Connected...

1096
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Then we started...

1097
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
A series of work...

1098
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Then...

1099
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Um...

1100
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Although this work is published in the physics journal...

1101
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But he...

1102
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Some features with...

1103
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Statistics with...

1104
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
With...

1105
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Machine learning...

1106
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Related...

1107
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
This way...

1108
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Then I...

1109
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
On Twitter...

1110
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
See...

1111
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This way...

1112
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yes...

1113
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Then...

1114
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Um...

1115
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
By the way...

1116
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I just talked to Yen-Ping...

1117
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Um...

1118
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The difference between pure numbers and hard numbers...

1119
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Then there is an interesting...

1120
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That tweet...

1121
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Um...

1122
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Can...

1123
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Connected...

1124
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
This way...

1125
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Then...

1126
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
My work...

1127
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
This...

1128
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This...

1129
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
This...

1130
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Parameter...

1131
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Theoretical...

1132
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Our work is...

1133
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Then...

1134
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Prediction...

1135
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Um...

1136
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It can be predicted...

1137
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But...

1138
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Prediction will encounter a problem...

1139
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That is...

1140
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Is it consistent?

1141
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Is it...

1142
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Because...

1143
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Because I never know...

1144
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
My data is...

1145
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Um...

1146
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Unless a specific system...

1147
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But I may be hard to know...

1148
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
My data is...

1149
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
How is it really generated?

1150
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So...

1151
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
How suitable is this model?

1152
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
This data is...

1153
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It is not certain...

1154
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Then...

1155
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
At that time...

1156
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Maybe prediction...

1157
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It will not be good...

1158
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Then...

1159
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We did not do anything...

1160
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Decision making...

1161
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Then...

1162
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The model can be explained...

1163
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Because it is a statistical model...

1164
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Then...

1165
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Um...

1166
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Decision...

1167
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It seems...

1168
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Not very sure...

1169
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Then...

1170
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But we do have...

1171
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Um...

1172
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Model...

1173
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Regularization...

1174
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Regularization is...

1175
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
To standardize the model...

1176
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I don't want my model to be too complicated...

1177
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So I want to...

1178
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Know that...

1179
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I want to choose...

1180
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
How much K...

1181
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So I have to...

1182
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Um...

1183
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Convince it...

1184
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Like this...

1185
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
There is a theory...

1186
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Then...

1187
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Cosality...

1188
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It seems not...

1189
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Then...

1190
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
We do provide code...

1191
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Then...

1192
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Scalability...

1193
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It seems also...

1194
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Ordinary...

1195
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Like this...

1196
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Because there is no special...

1197
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Then...

1198
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Not sure...

1199
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
How to make it...

1200
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Become an online...

1201
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
An...

1202
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
An...

1203
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Algorithm...

1204
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Then...

1205
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
In short...

1206
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
This is our job...

1207
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Then...

1208
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My outline...

1209
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Um...

1210
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I will...

1211
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Introduce what is SBM...

1212
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Then...

1213
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Do Bayesian inference on it...

1214
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Then...

1215
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Um...

1216
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Contribution...

1217
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It is...

1218
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We have a model...

1219
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
This model considers...

1220
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
With...

1221
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Original model...

1222
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The difference is...

1223
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We have a...

1224
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Um...

1225
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The prior...

1226
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It is bipartite...

1227
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Then...

1228
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Um...

1229
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Um...

1230
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Um...

1231
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Then...

1232
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
There is a search method...

1233
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It is...

1234
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
With...

1235
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Dynamic programming...

1236
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
With...

1237
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
MCMC...

1238
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Multicolor...

1239
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Algorithm...

1240
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Related...

1241
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Then...

1242
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Um...

1243
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Um...

1244
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The previous work did not...

1245
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Say...

1246
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Use dynamic programming to...

1247
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Fit this...

1248
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Model...

1249
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Then...

1250
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Um...

1251
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Will talk about some...

1252
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Results in statistics...

1253
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Then...

1254
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Then...

1255
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Finally...

1256
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Some...

1257
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Outlook...

1258
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Okay...

1259
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So far...

1260
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Do you have any questions?

1261
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Um...

1262
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Um...

1263
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Ahem...

1264
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Sorry...

1265
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay...

1266
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It is...

1267
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Um...

1268
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I look at the dialogue window...

1269
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
No...

1270
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Problem...

1271
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But there is a...

1272
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Comment...

1273
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He said...

1274
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
SBM looks like...

1275
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Random model...

1276
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
ERGM...

1277
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Similar...

1278
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Uh...

1279
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Do you want to comment?

1280
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I...

1281
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Always...

1282
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Not familiar...

1283
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
ERGM...

1284
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That piece...

1285
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Correct...

1286
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I think it is similar...

1287
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I think he...

1288
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
In...

1289
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Um...

1290
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Now...

1291
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I will talk about this slide...

1292
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Say...

1293
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Um...

1294
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Uh...

1295
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
My...

1296
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
How is BN generated?

1297
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But I think...

1298
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
He...

1299
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
If I...

1300
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If my impression is correct...

1301
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I think he is...

1302
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Um...

1303
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
For BN...

1304
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
How to generate...

1305
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Statistics assumption...

1306
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Not the same...

1307
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And...

1308
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
There seems to be no...

1309
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The concept of community inside...

1310
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But...

1311
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Just...

1312
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The...

1313
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Um...

1314
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Um...

1315
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I have not...

1316
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I have not studied that aspect...

1317
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
ERGM...

1318
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay...

1319
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Then I...

1320
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh...

1321
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That...

1322
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Sorry...

1323
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
There is another...

1324
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Now there is a person...

1325
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Asked a question...

1326
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Speaking of this...

1327
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Um...

1328
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That...

1329
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Let me finish the question first...

1330
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That...

1331
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That...

1332
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Jeffrey Wong is...

1333
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Originally asked the ERGM...

1334
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
He said...

1335
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay, thank you...

1336
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Then he will continue to listen...

1337
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Then...

1338
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Win...

1339
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Win said...

1340
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Uh...

1341
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes...

1342
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
ERGM...

1343
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It does not look like a community...

1344
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But that Peter...

1345
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Asked a question...

1346
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
That is...

1347
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh...

1348
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
By the way...

1349
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Before asking this question...

1350
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Um...

1351
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
If you have any questions...

1352
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Of course...

1353
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I can also read it...

1354
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh...

1355
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Peter asked the question...

1356
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Please ask...

1357
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Uh...

1358
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
If there is no...

1359
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Ground truth...

1360
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
How to...

1361
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Validate the generated model...

1362
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Um...

1363
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
If you want to answer Peter's question...

1364
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I will say...

1365
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Um...

1366
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We must...

1367
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Um...

1368
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
When comparing models...

1369
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Those models have the same...

1370
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Assumption...

1371
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Then...

1372
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
At this time...

1373
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Um...

1374
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
If it is Bayesian framework...

1375
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I can actually look directly...

1376
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
One thing called...

1377
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Uh...

1378
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Posterior probability...

1379
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Posterior probability...

1380
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Posterior probability...

1381
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Um...

1382
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Then...

1383
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Um...

1384
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
If it is high...

1385
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I will say...

1386
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Um...

1387
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
This model is more like...

1388
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The model used to generate this data...

1389
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Um...

1390
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This way...

1391
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Um...

1392
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Um...

1393
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Um...

1394
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Um...

1395
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So it is a...

1396
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
From...

1397
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Model as the center...

1398
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
To start...

1399
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
To understand the data...

1400
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
This way...

1401
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Um...

1402
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Ok...

1403
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He said...

1404
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Ok, thank you...

1405
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Ok, do you have any questions?

1406
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
If...

1407
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Uh...

1408
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I have a question...

1409
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That is...

1410
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Please say...

1411
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Uh...

1412
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I still don't understand...

1413
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Why must...

1414
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Be related to bipartite...

1415
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Because it looks like...

1416
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Is...

1417
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Is in classification...

1418
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Similar to...

1419
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Is to divide community...

1420
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Then why...

1421
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Must be a bipartite...

1422
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Network...

1423
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Um...

1424
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Um...

1425
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Um...

1426
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The context is that...

1427
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Um...

1428
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Um...

1429
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
At...

1430
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Um...

1431
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Before our work...

1432
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Before work method...

1433
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
This is the original SBN...

1434
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
In fact, it can...

1435
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Take it to...

1436
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Feed...

1437
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Bipartite network...

1438
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
This way...

1439
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And then...

1440
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Um...

1441
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But, in the original SBN...

1442
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Um...

1443
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It is also at the base end...

1444
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But, because there is...

1445
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The assumption of priority...

1446
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It allows...

1447
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Uh...

1448
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Do not bipartite...

1449
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
This thing happens...

1450
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So, um...

1451
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So, um...

1452
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It can...

1453
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It can be predicted, but...

1454
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Because...

1455
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The system is bipartite...

1456
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It will not appear...

1457
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That kind...

1458
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You...

1459
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Think it should have...

1460
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Priority...

1461
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Those spaces...

1462
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So, at this time...

1463
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It will have...

1464
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Some...

1465
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Waste...

1466
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
For example, it may not be able to...

1467
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Have a better...

1468
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Uh...

1469
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Resolution...

1470
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Then...

1471
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Mainly this part...

1472
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh...

1473
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
OK...

1474
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Thank you...

1475
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So...

1476
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Um...

1477
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Next, I will talk about...

1478
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
We...

1479
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Um...

1480
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
How to modify the original...

1481
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Uh...

1482
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
The original SBN work...

1483
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Then...

1484
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Which places...

1485
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Actually...

1486
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We...

1487
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
This kind of prior...

1488
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It is more frugal...

1489
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Or this kind of prior...

1490
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Is more...

1491
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
More...

1492
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
More...

1493
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
More...

1494
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Sensitive...

1495
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So...

1496
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Thank you...

1497
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Um...

1498
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
OK...

1499
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
OK...

1500
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Then we will continue...

1501
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Thank you...

1502
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Um...

1503
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Continue...

1504
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Then...

1505
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
OK...

1506
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So, what I want to talk about now is...

1507
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Uh...

1508
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
A certain version of SBN...

1509
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Then...

1510
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Um...

1511
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
First, SBN is a...

1512
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Generated model...

1513
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That is...

1514
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You tell it some...

1515
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Um...

1516
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
After the parameters...

1517
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You can say...

1518
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I want to...

1519
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Like a dice...

1520
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Make a...

1521
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
The dice is to make a point...

1522
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But...

1523
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
SBN is to generate a network...

1524
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That's it...

1525
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And this network will have...

1526
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What you just said...

1527
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The odds you want...

1528
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Then...

1529
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Um...

1530
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Um...

1531
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So...

1532
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So...

1533
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Um...

1534
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What are the parameters in it?

1535
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It has...

1536
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Um...

1537
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The upper right corner...

1538
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That...

1539
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Those parameters...

1540
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The upper right corner...

1541
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It is a...

1542
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Um...

1543
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
P...

1544
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Is to say...

1545
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You...

1546
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Given N...

1547
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Given K...

1548
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Given N...

1549
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Or given...

1550
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Omega...

1551
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
After...

1552
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Um...

1553
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You want to generate a...

1554
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Specific A...

1555
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What is the probability?

1556
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's it...

1557
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Okay...

1558
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So...

1559
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
What does it mean?

1560
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It is to say...

1561
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
For example...

1562
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Um...

1563
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Now...

1564
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I draw a picture...

1565
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Assuming this is...

1566
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I want...

1567
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Just now...

1568
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I said...

1569
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
These parameters are generated...

1570
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Then...

1571
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
My first step is to choose first...

1572
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
How many points do I want?

1573
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
After choosing...

1574
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
For example, I have 25 points here...

1575
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I choose 25 points...

1576
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Then I say...

1577
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I deliberately want to divide into two groups...

1578
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
K equals 2...

1579
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay...

1580
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Next...

1581
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I want to tell my system...

1582
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
K equals 2...

1583
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Then...

1584
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I want to know...

1585
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
How many percent...

1586
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
K equals 1...

1587
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
How many percent...

1588
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
K equals 2...

1589
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
K equals 1...

1590
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So...

1591
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I can know...

1592
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Who is in which group...

1593
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The third...

1594
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Is the proof I just said...

1595
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Because now...

1596
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I only choose two groups...

1597
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So it is a 2x2 proof...

1598
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Then...

1599
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Um...

1600
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The number in this proof...

1601
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Is also 0 to 1...

1602
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Then...

1603
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Um...

1604
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Every time...

1605
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Um...

1606
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
When generating...

1607
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I still look at...

1608
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Two points...

1609
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Do you want to generate an edge?

1610
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Then...

1611
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So...

1612
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Um...

1613
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
If I choose this type of...

1614
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Omega...

1615
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Because Diagonal is bigger...

1616
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So it...

1617
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Maybe it...

1618
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Um...

1619
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Um...

1620
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
1 and 1 are connected...

1621
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It will be more dense...

1622
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
2 and 2 are more dense...

1623
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay...

1624
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So I can...

1625
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
After selecting...

1626
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I can...

1627
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Generate a network...

1628
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I decided N...

1629
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Then...

1630
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I...

1631
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I...

1632
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Didn't do much...

1633
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Image processing work...

1634
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So...

1635
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Um...

1636
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
There is already an edge...

1637
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Decided by me...

1638
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But...

1639
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You can know many times...

1640
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Then every time the edge...

1641
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Will be different...

1642
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Then...

1643
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Um...

1644
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Um...

1645
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
In the past...

1646
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The work is...

1647
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Um...

1648
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
You still have to know...

1649
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Say...

1650
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
How many K's does this system have?

1651
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Then...

1652
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
After I know...

1653
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I...

1654
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
To...

1655
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Use...

1656
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
A method called...

1657
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Maximum...

1658
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Maximum Likelihood...

1659
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Then...

1660
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
To know...

1661
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Given my data...

1662
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And after I choose K...

1663
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Um...

1664
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Um...

1665
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Um...

1666
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I...

1667
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Um...

1668
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Um...

1669
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Um...

1670
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I want to infer...

1671
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Um...

1672
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
This N here...

1673
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
With this Omega...

1674
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Then...

1675
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Um...

1676
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Because I want to know...

1677
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Its...

1678
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Structure...

1679
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
The connection structure...

1680
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Then...

1681
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Um...

1682
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The work in the past...

1683
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Is to use this method...

1684
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
To understand...

1685
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
The large-scale structure of that data...

1686
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That is the Omega...

1687
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But...

1688
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Um...

1689
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Because there is a problem here...

1690
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't know how to choose K...

1691
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Then...

1692
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Um...

1693
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
There is a point...

1694
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I won't use it now...

1695
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But I will use it later...

1696
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That is...

1697
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Um...

1698
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Um...

1699
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Every time...

1700
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Um...

1701
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
After generating this network...

1702
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
This network actually has some...

1703
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Um...

1704
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It is a certain network...

1705
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It is over there...

1706
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Generated by you...

1707
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Then...

1708
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
On that certain network...

1709
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
There are some...

1710
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Parameters that I can use to describe it...

1711
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Called...

1712
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I will explain later...

1713
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Called B...

1714
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Called E...

1715
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Called K...

1716
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's a bit like...

1717
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Um...

1718
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Um...

1719
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Now...

1720
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The one in the upper right corner...

1721
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Um...

1722
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Generative model...

1723
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Correspondence...

1724
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Then...

1725
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I will explain later...

1726
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Then...

1727
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Then...

1728
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
We will call it...

1729
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
A micro canonical model...

1730
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Because it's called canonical now...

1731
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It is...

1732
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Um...

1733
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The parameters in the upper right corner...

1734
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
If it is reasonable...

1735
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's because you have to generate many...

1736
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
After you generate an ensemble...

1737
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It will be reasonable...

1738
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But...

1739
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
In the micro canonical...

1740
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You don't have to...

1741
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
After you say it...

1742
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You generate those...

1743
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Um...

1744
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Ok...

1745
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Then...

1746
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Um...

1747
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Why...

1748
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I don't know how to choose...

1749
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
There are a few groups...

1750
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's a problem...

1751
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's because...

1752
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Um...

1753
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You will overfitting...

1754
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Um...

1755
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Now here...

1756
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
This...

1757
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
P of G...

1758
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
G is the one just now...

1759
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
A is the graph...

1760
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Then...

1761
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
B...

1762
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
E...

1763
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
K...

1764
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's the parameters I just said...

1765
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Um...

1766
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Except that K...

1767
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But...

1768
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's basically the same thing...

1769
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Then...

1770
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Um...

1771
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Let's take a look now...

1772
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
We want...

1773
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Um...

1774
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Find...

1775
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Um...

1776
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
After we decide K...

1777
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
We have to find...

1778
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That...

1779
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Correspondence...

1780
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Correspondence...

1781
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
E...

1782
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And K...

1783
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That value...

1784
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Then...

1785
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
We...

1786
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Want...

1787
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Because we have to understand the network structure...

1788
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So I decided K...

1789
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Then I look at the network structure...

1790
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
How is it?

1791
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Then...

1792
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Is it good?

1793
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Let's take a look...

1794
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
My...

1795
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Maximum likelihood of fitting...

1796
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
How big is that P?

1797
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Like this...

1798
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Then...

1799
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Um...

1800
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
If the P is bigger...

1801
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I took the log now...

1802
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Add addition...

1803
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It will be smaller...

1804
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Then...

1805
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
There is a parameter called S...

1806
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Um...

1807
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
In short...

1808
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That's my goal...

1809
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
My goal is...

1810
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I want to fit it...

1811
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Then look at the largest P...

1812
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Or the smallest S...

1813
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
The place...

1814
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Then...

1815
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
We can take a network to fit it...

1816
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Then I said...

1817
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Today I think this network is B equals 2...

1818
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Then I fit it...

1819
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Then I got a likelihood...

1820
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Then...

1821
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Eh...

1822
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It has a relative S...

1823
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So much...

1824
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Then...

1825
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Eh...

1826
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Then I look at the fit...

1827
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
How about B equals 3?

1828
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Then I fit it again...

1829
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Then...

1830
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Because...

1831
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Because B equals 3...

1832
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It...

1833
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Um...

1834
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
There are more groups in it...

1835
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So at this time...

1836
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Um...

1837
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The kind of Omega parameter I just said...

1838
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It becomes...

1839
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
From 2 times 2...

1840
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Becomes 3 times 3...

1841
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So...

1842
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The one you can adjust...

1843
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
There are more...

1844
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
As a result...

1845
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You will find that you...

1846
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The fit is better...

1847
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So...

1848
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
P is getting bigger...

1849
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Then S becomes smaller...

1850
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Then...

1851
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
You do it like this...

1852
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You find...

1853
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
When you make B bigger and bigger...

1854
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Its...

1855
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
S is getting smaller...

1856
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Its...

1857
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Um...

1858
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Likelihood is getting higher...

1859
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Until...

1860
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That...

1861
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The number you want it to group...

1862
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Equals...

1863
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Every...

1864
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Um...

1865
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Equals this system...

1866
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Um...

1867
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Equals the number of nodes in this system...

1868
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Then...

1869
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You get a...

1870
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Omega matrix...

1871
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This matrix is n times n...

1872
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And that n times n...

1873
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Just like your...

1874
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Adjacency matrix...

1875
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Either 0 or 1...

1876
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You...

1877
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Predicted super well...

1878
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But...

1879
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You...

1880
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Overfitting...

1881
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So...

1882
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Um...

1883
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
This is a...

1884
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Um...

1885
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
If you don't regularize...

1886
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Your model...

1887
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The parameter...

1888
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Um...

1889
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Will encounter a problem...

1890
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay...

1891
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So...

1892
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Um...

1893
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
We need to introduce...

1894
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Bayesian method...

1895
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
What we saw just now is a...

1896
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Um...

1897
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
P of G...

1898
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's a likelihood...

1899
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And then...

1900
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Um...

1901
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We need to use...

1902
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Bayesian method to...

1903
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Um...

1904
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Regularize...

1905
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Um...

1906
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Some parameters in this likelihood...

1907
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
For example...

1908
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
This...

1909
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
This thing...

1910
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Um...

1911
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
In the usual...

1912
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
In the usual...

1913
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Historical statistics...

1914
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Will...

1915
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Will be used...

1916
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
For example...

1917
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You have a lot of points...

1918
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And then...

1919
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You say...

1920
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm going to choose...

1921
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
A few...

1922
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
A few bins to divide...

1923
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And then you choose so many bins...

1924
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And then you choose a little more...

1925
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You seem to see more structures...

1926
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But...

1927
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But you don't really know...

1928
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
In the end...

1929
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
How many bins do you want to choose...

1930
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Is...

1931
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Um...

1932
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Really see the structure you want...

1933
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This way...

1934
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So...

1935
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Choosing a bin is a...

1936
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It's also a problem...

1937
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This way...

1938
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And then...

1939
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Um...

1940
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So...

1941
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I want to know...

1942
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The data I see...

1943
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
What are the odds...

1944
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Will appear...

1945
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And then...

1946
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I use a model...

1947
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
To look at it...

1948
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
That is to say...

1949
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
After I set the odds...

1950
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Um...

1951
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
How well does this model fit...

1952
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We call it posterior...

1953
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And then...

1954
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
There is a...

1955
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Uh...

1956
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Bayesian theorem...

1957
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It can expand the posterior...

1958
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
To become...

1959
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The following...

1960
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And then...

1961
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Uh...

1962
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
We have a...

1963
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It's called...

1964
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Join likelihood...

1965
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And the following...

1966
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
P of X...

1967
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It's called...

1968
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
The odds of data appearing...

1969
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And then...

1970
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The problem is usually...

1971
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It's a certain data...

1972
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So it usually...

1973
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Will...

1974
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Disappear...

1975
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And then...

1976
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Um...

1977
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
This join likelihood...

1978
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It can be expanded by two...

1979
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
One is...

1980
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
The likelihood we just talked about...

1981
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That one...

1982
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The glasses are...

1983
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We just saw...

1984
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
A lot of parameters...

1985
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That thing...

1986
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And then...

1987
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Because the parameters are moving...

1988
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
We're not sure...

1989
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Will we move to some...

1990
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
In fact, there is no need for parameters...

1991
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So...

1992
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I want to put that...

1993
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The space for the parameter to move...

1994
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Consider it...

1995
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
At this time...

1996
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
There is that...

1997
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Prior...

1998
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
When we look at...

1999
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
When we look at this system...

2000
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This...

2001
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Um...

2002
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
This system...

2003
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The odds of being seen by my eyes...

2004
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
How is it?

2005
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The same thing...

2006
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's the same on the Internet...

2007
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Because...

2008
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
My X becomes my A...

2009
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Addresses in matrix...

2010
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And then...

2011
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Select different groups...

2012
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
There are different...

2013
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Um...

2014
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Structures in it...

2015
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And then...

2016
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Um...

2017
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
SBM is...

2018
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Um...

2019
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
There are some parameters in it...

2020
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And then...

2021
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
We're going to put what we just said...

2022
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
That kind of...

2023
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Um...

2024
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Likelihood...

2025
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's the green one...

2026
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
The green thing below...

2027
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I put it...

2028
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Again...

2029
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Specify it...

2030
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Add that...

2031
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
One...

2032
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Um...

2033
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Prior...

2034
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And then...

2035
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The last thing I want to see...

2036
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The biggest thing I want to see...

2037
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's...

2038
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
The one in front...

2039
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Um...

2040
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
In front...

2041
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
This P in the front...

2042
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And then...

2043
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It's that posterior...

2044
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And then I...

2045
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
My goal becomes...

2046
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
From just now...

2047
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I want to go...

2048
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Um...

2049
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Adjust my glasses...

2050
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Look at my...

2051
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Likelihood...

2052
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
The biggest value...

2053
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It becomes...

2054
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Not only adjust the glasses...

2055
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And adjust my...

2056
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I want to adjust my prior...

2057
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And then look at the last...

2058
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The biggest value of the posterior...

2059
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And then at this time...

2060
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Um...

2061
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Usually there will be better...

2062
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Um...

2063
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Um...

2064
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Um...

2065
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
The result of the statistics...

2066
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Like this...

2067
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Okay...

2068
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And then...

2069
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Okay...

2070
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So...

2071
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Um...

2072
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I just said...

2073
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
There's one...

2074
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I haven't explained yet...

2075
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
P of...

2076
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
K, E, and B...

2077
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Like this...

2078
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And then...

2079
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
This is a...

2080
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Um...

2081
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
One...

2082
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
With these three...

2083
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
A function related to variables...

2084
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And then...

2085
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Um...

2086
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
We're not sure how to...

2087
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
To...

2088
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
To calculate its value...

2089
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And then...

2090
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Um...

2091
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But...

2092
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Um...

2093
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
In the lower right corner of this...

2094
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Um...

2095
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
The article of PyChato...

2096
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It says...

2097
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Um...

2098
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You can use this...

2099
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Factorization method...

2100
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
To...

2101
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Um...

2102
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Factorize it...

2103
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And then you can ask for three different items...

2104
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And then at this time...

2105
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Um...

2106
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Three different items...

2107
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
There are some...

2108
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
E...

2109
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Can be calculated by you...

2110
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
For example...

2111
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Um...

2112
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
The first item is called B...

2113
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That is...

2114
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You can observe that...

2115
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It is a specific partition...

2116
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
That is...

2117
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
The one I just said...

2118
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
The length is N...

2119
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And then if there are two groups...

2120
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's like the sum between 0 and 1...

2121
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
This kind of thing...

2122
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Um...

2123
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You want to know...

2124
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Your specific partition...

2125
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
What is the probability of it appearing?

2126
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Node partition...

2127
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And then...

2128
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Um...

2129
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
After you know the node partition...

2130
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Because every point...

2131
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It has already determined...

2132
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Which group it is in...

2133
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And then...

2134
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You have to connect again...

2135
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And then...

2136
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Um...

2137
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
After the connection...

2138
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
There will be a matrix called E...

2139
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
This E...

2140
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It is a matrix...

2141
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It...

2142
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It...

2143
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It is a bit like...

2144
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The omega...

2145
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Um...

2146
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Micro-canonical extension...

2147
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And then at this time...

2148
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You say...

2149
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Um...

2150
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
In E...

2151
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Um...

2152
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Which group and which group...

2153
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
How many lines are connected in the end?

2154
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Not probability...

2155
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
How many lines are connected?

2156
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And then at this time...

2157
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You say...

2158
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It is its edge count...

2159
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Matrix...

2160
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And then you can also say...

2161
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Hey...

2162
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I...

2163
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I stipulate that I want to have...

2164
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Um...

2165
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Two groups...

2166
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And then...

2167
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
How many...

2168
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Edge...

2169
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
In this case...

2170
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
My 2x2 matrix...

2171
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It...

2172
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Um...

2173
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
What is its distribution?

2174
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
This can be calculated...

2175
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Because...

2176
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
These things are all discrete things...

2177
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And then...

2178
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
After having these two just now...

2179
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I can...

2180
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Go again...

2181
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Um...

2182
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Um...

2183
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Go again...

2184
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
To its...

2185
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Um...

2186
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Degree distribution...

2187
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Do the modeling...

2188
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I haven't explained what a degree is yet...

2189
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Degree...

2190
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It means a point...

2191
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
How many edges did it connect?

2192
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
This number is its degree...

2193
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And then...

2194
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Um...

2195
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Um...

2196
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And then...

2197
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Some context...

2198
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I didn't say...

2199
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Um...

2200
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Um...

2201
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Um...

2202
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Degrees are usually...

2203
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Things that everyone will put into this model...

2204
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Because degrees are often...

2205
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
With a lot of...

2206
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
On the Internet...

2207
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
There is a dynamic phenomenon...

2208
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Connected...

2209
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Like this...

2210
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So...

2211
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
They also hope to be able to...

2212
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Capture the degree...

2213
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Like this...

2214
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So...

2215
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Um...

2216
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
After deciding the B and E that I just said...

2217
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
In fact, I can also put...

2218
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The degree distribution...

2219
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Write it out...

2220
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Finally...

2221
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It is...

2222
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
This network...

2223
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
The...

2224
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
The...

2225
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Likelihood...

2226
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
That is...

2227
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I just explained...

2228
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
The canonical version of the SVM...

2229
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Likelihood...

2230
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
How does this thing become A?

2231
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Like this...

2232
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And then...

2233
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So we have a model summary...

2234
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Write it down first...

2235
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
But it looks terrible...

2236
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It...

2237
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Each item can correspond to each other...

2238
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
For example, this is the likelihood...

2239
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
For example, this is...

2240
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Um...

2241
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The prior of the degree distribution...

2242
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And then...

2243
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
This is the...

2244
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That...

2245
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Um...

2246
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
The prior of the edge count matrix...

2247
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The prior...

2248
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And then...

2249
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
This is...

2250
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Partition prior...

2251
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And then...

2252
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Although this thing looks so complicated...

2253
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And then we have K...

2254
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
There are E and B...

2255
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
A is...

2256
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I already knew...

2257
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Because it is my input data...

2258
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Um...

2259
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
But there is an interesting point...

2260
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That is...

2261
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Oh...

2262
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I...

2263
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I want to talk about the words in the upper right corner...

2264
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That is...

2265
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The interesting point is...

2266
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Um...

2267
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
K and E are actually a...

2268
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It's actually a B function...

2269
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Because if you think about it...

2270
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
If you change B...

2271
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
That...

2272
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Corresponding to that...

2273
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
The one I just said...

2274
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Between the group and the group...

2275
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
How many lines are there...

2276
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That...

2277
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Matrix E...

2278
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Will also change...

2279
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
With K...

2280
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So...

2281
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
K and E...

2282
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Can be written as...

2283
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
B functions...

2284
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So...

2285
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Um...

2286
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Although I wrote this matrix so long...

2287
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
But the whole bunch of things...

2288
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Actually...

2289
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It's still the same as just now...

2290
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Calculating modularity...

2291
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Just change that B...

2292
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That's it...

2293
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Just change every point...

2294
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Its...

2295
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Community...

2296
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That's it...

2297
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And then...

2298
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Um...

2299
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
This work...

2300
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
One of the contributions...

2301
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Is that we...

2302
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Put...

2303
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Um...

2304
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
What I wrote now...

2305
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
These...

2306
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Priors...

2307
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Put...

2308
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Put...

2309
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Not...

2310
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Bipartite...

2311
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Deduct the contribution...

2312
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That's it...

2313
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So...

2314
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Um...

2315
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Because after I deduct it...

2316
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Um...

2317
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
The model is more concise...

2318
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So at this time...

2319
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
My priors will be more...

2320
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
The number will be bigger...

2321
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Will be more sensitive...

2322
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That's about it...

2323
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Okay...

2324
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Then...

2325
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Um...

2326
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Just...

2327
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You can look at the color...

2328
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Is...

2329
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Relative...

2330
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Partition...

2331
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Then...

2332
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Counts...

2333
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Degrees...

2334
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And then finally...

2335
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This is the network likelihood...

2336
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
That's it...

2337
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And then there's a lot of work in here...

2338
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Because...

2339
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Um...

2340
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I need to know...

2341
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I gave the ones I just said...

2342
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Um...

2343
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Discrete parameters...

2344
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
For example, B...

2345
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
For example, E...

2346
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
For example, K...

2347
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And then how do I know...

2348
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
After giving these...

2349
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
He in the end...

2350
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Um...

2351
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
There are also these...

2352
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Parameters...

2353
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So many networks...

2354
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
How many are there?

2355
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
That's it...

2356
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
One by one...

2357
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Is to know how many...

2358
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Then...

2359
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Um...

2360
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
This...

2361
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Calculate...

2362
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
How many...

2363
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
This method...

2364
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Is...

2365
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Um...

2366
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Okay...

2367
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Um...

2368
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Why...

2369
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Calculate how many...

2370
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Is important?

2371
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Because we hope...

2372
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
We can...

2373
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Um...

2374
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Just use...

2375
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Just being Bayesian...

2376
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
That is, we can...

2377
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
No...

2378
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Um...

2379
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
For a specific state...

2380
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
We don't have...

2381
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Special preferences...

2382
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
We hope...

2383
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
He...

2384
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Every state...

2385
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The probability is the same...

2386
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That's it...

2387
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So any network...

2388
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
That's what I just calculated...

2389
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
How many...

2390
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
One...

2391
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
That's it...

2392
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
If I finally...

2393
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Calculate how many...

2394
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It's actually very small...

2395
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Actually, I found a good model...

2396
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Because...

2397
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I'm from that Ensembl...

2398
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Just pick it up...

2399
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's like me...

2400
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
To...

2401
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Um...

2402
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Observe that network...

2403
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That's it...

2404
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Okay...

2405
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Is there a problem so far?

2406
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Okay, then...

2407
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Just...

2408
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I think this is a very useful...

2409
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That library...

2410
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
He really put...

2411
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
SBM...

2412
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Put it in...

2413
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Then...

2414
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
The bottom layer is C++...

2415
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That's it...

2416
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
What I just said...

2417
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Um...

2418
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Um...

2419
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Ensembl counting work...

2420
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
The author...

2421
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Paishoto...

2422
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Um...

2423
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
His work...

2424
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Okay...

2425
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Then we...

2426
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
We have to recap now...

2427
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
What the hell did we do?

2428
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
That is...

2429
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Uh...

2430
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Our job is to...

2431
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
We want to maximize a posterior...

2432
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
That is...

2433
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
The upper left corner...

2434
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Um...

2435
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
The blue thing...

2436
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Then we can...

2437
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Um...

2438
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Put it...

2439
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Um...

2440
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Use that...

2441
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Uh...

2442
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Bayes Theorem...

2443
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Write it like this...

2444
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Then...

2445
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
We have a...

2446
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Uh...

2447
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Fixed box...

2448
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Because my data is fixed...

2449
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
That's it...

2450
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Then...

2451
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So the important thing is...

2452
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
With that...

2453
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Um...

2454
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
The so-called total likelihood...

2455
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Put B and A...

2456
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Put it in...

2457
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
This probability is related...

2458
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Then...

2459
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Uh...

2460
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
What the hell is it?

2461
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
He put it...

2462
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Um...

2463
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
In the past...

2464
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Under the framework of Bayesian...

2465
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
He put you...

2466
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Um...

2467
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
There will be...

2468
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Those B and A...

2469
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Those...

2470
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Um...

2471
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Usually you have to estimate this...

2472
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Posterior likelihood...

2473
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You...

2474
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You have to calculate such points...

2475
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That's it...

2476
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Then...

2477
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Um...

2478
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
This thing is on SBN...

2479
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's...

2480
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It's hard to do...

2481
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The reason is because...

2482
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Um...

2483
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's not easy to find...

2484
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Uh...

2485
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
In the past, doing this point...

2486
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Usually in...

2487
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Likelihood...

2488
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
To find some mathematical functions...

2489
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Then...

2490
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Go...

2491
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Then use the corresponding...

2492
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Um...

2493
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Conjugate prior...

2494
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Then...

2495
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You can get a point like this...

2496
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
A...

2497
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
A...

2498
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
A...

2499
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Um...

2500
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
On SBN...

2501
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
This thing is very difficult...

2502
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Because...

2503
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Um...

2504
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Even if there is that prior...

2505
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
May be distributed with data...

2506
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Also far away...

2507
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
This way...

2508
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Then...

2509
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Um...

2510
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This is what I just said...

2511
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
That is...

2512
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Um...

2513
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So...

2514
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Uh...

2515
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
We just want to say...

2516
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Can we...

2517
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Because it is discrete...

2518
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Then I...

2519
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Um...

2520
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
All right...

2521
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
All the states...

2522
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The number is calculated...

2523
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Then...

2524
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I will minimize that number...

2525
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
That's it...

2526
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Then...

2527
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
At this time...

2528
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
In fact, it is also with...

2529
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Um...

2530
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Um...

2531
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
With the whole Bayesian framework...

2532
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Is consistent...

2533
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
This way...

2534
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Then...

2535
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Um...

2536
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Petroto said yes...

2537
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Because...

2538
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Um...

2539
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You can take...

2540
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
This is a recap...

2541
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That is, you can take the one I just said...

2542
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Um...

2543
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Join likely...

2544
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I divided it into two...

2545
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Then these two...

2546
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You can calculate it discretely...

2547
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So at this time...

2548
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I don't need to do points...

2549
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I just...

2550
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But I can still...

2551
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I still need to...

2552
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Have some assumptions about its prior...

2553
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Okay...

2554
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Then we will start...

2555
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Calculate likely...

2556
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Um...

2557
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I won't go through the details...

2558
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
But I will talk about the concept...

2559
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Because of time...

2560
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Then...

2561
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Um...

2562
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Likely would...

2563
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
That is...

2564
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I want to know...

2565
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I want...

2566
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
After fixing these parameters...

2567
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Encounter a network...

2568
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
How big is my parameter...

2569
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
The chance of generating this network...

2570
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
That's it...

2571
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So...

2572
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It's actually a...

2573
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Um...

2574
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
The space that these parameters open...

2575
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
The...

2576
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
One of the...

2577
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Because I hope...

2578
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Every instance in the space it opens...

2579
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
All...

2580
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
The same probability appears...

2581
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
That's it...

2582
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So it's actually a...

2583
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Um...

2584
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
A...

2585
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Um...

2586
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Ensemble...

2587
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Called...

2588
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Um...

2589
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Omega...

2590
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Big Omega...

2591
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
One-third...

2592
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
That's it...

2593
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Then it can be completely from...

2594
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Um...

2595
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Those degree distributions...

2596
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Or...

2597
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That...

2598
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
The edge count...

2599
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Matrix...

2600
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Calculate with the adjacency matrix...

2601
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Then...

2602
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Um...

2603
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
When you are calculating...

2604
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Um...

2605
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
You still hope to know...

2606
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
That...

2607
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
This Omega...

2608
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Um...

2609
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
How to be the smallest...

2610
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That's it...

2611
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
But...

2612
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Usually because Omega...

2613
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It will follow your...

2614
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Um...

2615
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You change every node...

2616
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It...

2617
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Which group is it related to...

2618
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So...

2619
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You will encounter...

2620
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You have a lot of space to search...

2621
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
That's it...

2622
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Then...

2623
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So...

2624
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Usually everyone will use...

2625
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Um...

2626
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
MCMC to sample this space...

2627
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
That's it...

2628
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Then...

2629
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Um...

2630
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Here I have to say some...

2631
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Introduce a new term...

2632
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That is...

2633
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Um...

2634
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
They will put...

2635
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Um...

2636
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
We will put...

2637
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
This...

2638
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Ensemble size...

2639
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Take a log...

2640
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Called Entropy...

2641
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That's it...

2642
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So...

2643
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Um...

2644
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Although what we see here is just...

2645
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Likelihood...

2646
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
But the same thing...

2647
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Will also...

2648
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
In...

2649
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Prior...

2650
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Um...

2651
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Happened once...

2652
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
That is to say...

2653
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Um...

2654
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I will say...

2655
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Um...

2656
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
The one I want to maximize in the end...

2657
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Posterior probability...

2658
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Probability...

2659
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
In fact, it corresponds to...

2660
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
A certain area...

2661
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Parameter space...

2662
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Then...

2663
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
When I want to maximize...

2664
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That one...

2665
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Posterior probability...

2666
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
This thing...

2667
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
In fact, it is equivalent to...

2668
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I want to minimize...

2669
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
The parameter space I opened...

2670
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Then...

2671
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
The number of parameters I opened...

2672
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Take a log...

2673
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I call it Entropy...

2674
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
That's it...

2675
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Or some people call it...

2676
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Um...

2677
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Description length...

2678
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Description length...

2679
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Okay...

2680
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So...

2681
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Just now...

2682
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
These two things are...

2683
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Um...

2684
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
One body, two sides...

2685
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
That's it...

2686
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So...

2687
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Um...

2688
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Um...

2689
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Maximize...

2690
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Place in posterior...

2691
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
At the time...

2692
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It seems to be in a...

2693
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Um...

2694
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
The so-called minimum...

2695
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Minimum...

2696
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Description length...

2697
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Under the principle of work...

2698
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Find the simplest model...

2699
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Okay...

2700
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Then...

2701
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Um...

2702
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We have...

2703
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Just now...

2704
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Calculate the...

2705
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Likelihood...

2706
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
That is...

2707
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Decide...

2708
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
After determining the parameters...

2709
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The space it opens...

2710
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
How big...

2711
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But...

2712
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
We can also take a look at this...

2713
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Prior...

2714
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Have...

2715
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Have...

2716
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Um...

2717
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We can also look at this...

2718
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Prior...

2719
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
How to calculate...

2720
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Then this Prior...

2721
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
That is to say...

2722
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Um...

2723
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
How many reasonable...

2724
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Um...

2725
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Parameters...

2726
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Parameters can change...

2727
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Then this time...

2728
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Calculate the space...

2729
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
How big...

2730
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Okay...

2731
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
For example...

2732
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Um...

2733
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
We can have a...

2734
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Prior for Node Partition...

2735
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
That is...

2736
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Um...

2737
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
For example, now it is a...

2738
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Um...

2739
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
There is a network of four groups...

2740
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Like this...

2741
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It is not yet a network...

2742
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But a thing of four groups...

2743
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Then I have to allocate...

2744
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
One, two, three, four...

2745
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Four numbers on...

2746
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
N points...

2747
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Then my question is...

2748
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Um...

2749
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Assuming...

2750
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Uh...

2751
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
One, two, three, four...

2752
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
These four numbers...

2753
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Divide to N points...

2754
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I...

2755
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Whatever...

2756
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Then...

2757
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
After each division...

2758
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I will get a...

2759
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Partition...

2760
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Like this...

2761
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Then...

2762
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
How do I describe this...

2763
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
All of this...

2764
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
When I decide...

2765
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
How much N...

2766
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
When I decide...

2767
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
B is equal to four...

2768
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
How big is this partition...

2769
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Like this...

2770
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Um...

2771
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
This thing is...

2772
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I...

2773
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
In the specification...

2774
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I...

2775
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Um...

2776
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Allow parameters to...

2777
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Um...

2778
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Change space...

2779
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Then...

2780
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So...

2781
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Um...

2782
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Um...

2783
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Um...

2784
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
The above general prior...

2785
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Is...

2786
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Um...

2787
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
The previous work is...

2788
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Um...

2789
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
For example...

2790
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
We...

2791
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
We can put...

2792
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
After deciding B...

2793
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
After deciding B...

2794
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Um...

2795
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay...

2796
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Then...

2797
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I...

2798
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I have some...

2799
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
That...

2800
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Um...

2801
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
That is...

2802
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I didn't do a good job in the video...

2803
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I explain now...

2804
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
That is...

2805
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Everyone sees B and sees K...

2806
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
They are the same thing...

2807
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Then...

2808
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Um...

2809
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
B is a group...

2810
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Then K is also a group...

2811
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
But usually...

2812
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
When I first do this work...

2813
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I will put...

2814
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I will use K as B...

2815
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Then K will be divided into KA or KB...

2816
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
They represent it in...

2817
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Um...

2818
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Different types...

2819
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Different types in bipartite...

2820
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Numbers like this...

2821
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Okay...

2822
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Then...

2823
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Um...

2824
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
In general prior...

2825
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I can put...

2826
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Um...

2827
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
This partition...

2828
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Just separate it like this...

2829
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Then...

2830
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
At this time...

2831
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I have a...

2832
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
For example, I see a P of...

2833
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
No mouse...

2834
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
A little inconvenient...

2835
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That is...

2836
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
P of B...

2837
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Given...

2838
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
P of B...

2839
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Given N...

2840
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
This kind of thing...

2841
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Like this...

2842
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It is...

2843
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Um...

2844
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
This N is...

2845
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
This N is not capital N...

2846
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It is small n...

2847
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Small n means...

2848
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Um...

2849
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
How many points are there in each group...

2850
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Like this...

2851
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Not how many points in total...

2852
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
How many points are there in each group...

2853
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
That is...

2854
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Um...

2855
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Um...

2856
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
P of B...

2857
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Given N...

2858
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It means...

2859
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Um...

2860
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
When I determined...

2861
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
In each group...

2862
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Um...

2863
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
In my...

2864
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Um...

2865
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
When I determined...

2866
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
How many points are there in each group...

2867
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Um...

2868
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
How many...

2869
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Um...

2870
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
P of B...

2871
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Like this...

2872
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So it is actually...

2873
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Um...

2874
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Um...

2875
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
N class...

2876
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Then...

2877
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
In each group...

2878
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I can travel...

2879
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It is equivalent...

2880
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
So it is...

2881
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
N class...

2882
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Given...

2883
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
A...

2884
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Um...

2885
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Product of...

2886
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
A lot of...

2887
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
N class...

2888
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
This whole thing...

2889
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
This whole thing...

2890
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
This whole thing is a size...

2891
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It is a relatively large number...

2892
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Then I count it...

2893
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
It becomes a probability...

2894
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Like this...

2895
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So...

2896
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Um...

2897
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
This probability is...

2898
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It counts like this...

2899
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Then...

2900
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Then, for example, the second...

2901
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
P of N...

2902
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Given...

2903
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
B...

2904
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Big B is...

2905
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
The number of groups...

2906
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It is...

2907
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Um...

2908
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I have...

2909
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
After the number of groups...

2910
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
How many possibilities do I have...

2911
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Can allow...

2912
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I have every...

2913
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
How many points...

2914
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Put in each group...

2915
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Like this...

2916
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Then there are some...

2917
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Subtract 1...

2918
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It means...

2919
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It means...

2920
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Um...

2921
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It means...

2922
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I can't allow...

2923
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
There is that...

2924
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Empty group...

2925
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So I at least put...

2926
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
A point...

2927
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Put in a group...

2928
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Then...

2929
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
By the way, the K over there is also B...

2930
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So...

2931
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
When I put at least one point...

2932
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
When I put at least one point...

2933
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
When I put at least one point...

2934
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
In a group...

2935
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Um...

2936
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
How many...

2937
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
The point is put in each group...

2938
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The point is put in each group...

2939
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
This thing is a...

2940
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Um...

2941
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
How many...

2942
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
How many subtraction problems...

2943
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
For example, it is...

2944
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
N minus 1...

2945
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Because I put one in it...

2946
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
N minus 1 subtract...

2947
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Uh...

2948
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
K minus 1...

2949
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So many numbers...

2950
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Then because I want to subtract...

2951
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So many numbers...

2952
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Then because I want to subtract...

2953
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So I subtract it...

2954
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Then P has B...

2955
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Then it means...

2956
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I...

2957
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Um...

2958
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
The same B is also the K...

2959
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
That is...

2960
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Um...

2961
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I...

2962
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Assuming that each of my B...

2963
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The probability of appearance is the same...

2964
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So it's 1 per B...

2965
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
That's it...

2966
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So at this time...

2967
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I have a general prior...

2968
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
But...

2969
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Um...

2970
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
In fact...

2971
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Um...

2972
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
In fact, there is...

2973
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Count less...

2974
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Um...

2975
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
In fact, there are some things...

2976
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
For...

2977
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Uh...

2978
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
For bipartite networks...

2979
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
It's a waste...

2980
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
For example...

2981
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Um...

2982
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
For bipartite networks...

2983
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Because...

2984
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Uh...

2985
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Different networks...

2986
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
It has to reside...

2987
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
In their own type...

2988
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Inside...

2989
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So...

2990
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Um...

2991
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm counting...

2992
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Um...

2993
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
When there is no empty group...

2994
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
When there is no empty group...

2995
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I'll...

2996
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I'll count twice...

2997
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I can't have an empty group in...

2998
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I can't have an empty group in...

2999
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Type A...

3000
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I can't have an empty group in Type B...

3001
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I can't have an empty group in Type A...

3002
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So...

3003
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Um...

3004
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Um...

3005
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
There's something in the middle...

3006
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I can...

3007
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Um...

3008
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The second one I just talked about...

3009
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
That...

3010
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Prior...

3011
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Can...

3012
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Um...

3013
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Write a little more accurately...

3014
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
This...

3015
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And then...

3016
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Um...

3017
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Last P of B...

3018
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Now P of two...

3019
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Two B's...

3020
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
B is K...

3021
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So...

3022
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And...

3023
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
It's not the same...

3024
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So...

3025
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Ok, but we...

3026
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
The point is we put...

3027
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
This thing is more accurate...

3028
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
After that, actually...

3029
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
The posterior I got in the end...

3030
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It will be...

3031
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Larger than general...

3032
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Bigger...

3033
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Ok...

3034
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And then...

3035
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Um...

3036
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
this one...

3037
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm going to skip over...

3038
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
To be honest...

3039
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
In general prior...

3040
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Because what I have to consider is...

3041
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
That P of E...

3042
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
That is...

3043
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
How to connect between groups...

3044
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Things like this...

3045
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
But in general prior...

3046
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It has considered...

3047
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Um...

3048
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
The connection of the group in the same type...

3049
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It also counts it in...

3050
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Um...

3051
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
The ensemble I just said...

3052
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But it's actually a waste...

3053
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Like this...

3054
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Um...

3055
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Then we have to put it...

3056
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
The waste part is deducted...

3057
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Like this...

3058
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So we have a...

3059
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
A more frugal model...

3060
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So...

3061
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
When we do this...

3062
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I can still get one...

3063
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Um...

3064
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Bigger...

3065
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Bigger...

3066
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Prior...

3067
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Then...

3068
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Um...

3069
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
The degree is the same...

3070
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
But the degree is quite involved...

3071
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I'll skip over...

3072
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Then...

3073
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
But the degree is basically...

3074
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Um...

3075
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It has nothing to do with the group...

3076
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So...

3077
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
We use the old method...

3078
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Like this...

3079
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So in the end...

3080
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Um...

3081
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Our prior is...

3082
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Um...

3083
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
We...

3084
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Contribute...

3085
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Um...

3086
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
One of the contributions to work is...

3087
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
This prior...

3088
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It has a bigger...

3089
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
value...

3090
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
In various parameters...

3091
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Like this...

3092
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Ok...

3093
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Then...

3094
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Um...

3095
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We are now...

3096
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Already talked about...

3097
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
The red part above...

3098
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
It's Lightning...

3099
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
With the yellow part on the right...

3100
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Prior...

3101
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
So...

3102
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Together...

3103
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Although there are many parameters...

3104
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But in fact, it's all with...

3105
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Um...

3106
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
The so-called B...

3107
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That is...

3108
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Every point is related to which group...

3109
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Then we...

3110
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
We want to know...

3111
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Um...

3112
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
How to change B...

3113
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Find the maximum...

3114
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
That...

3115
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
P...

3116
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Like this...

3117
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Then...

3118
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Um...

3119
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
When I was doing that job...

3120
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Um...

3121
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
About three...

3122
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Two or three years ago...

3123
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Um...

3124
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
At that time...

3125
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Um...

3126
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
The...

3127
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I didn't do too much...

3128
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
For MCMC...

3129
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Method of...

3130
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Innovation...

3131
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Then...

3132
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
At that time, MCMC...

3133
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Is...

3134
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You have to...

3135
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Decide...

3136
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
After you have analyzed the group...

3137
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Then...

3138
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Um...

3139
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Every node...

3140
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
To change its group...

3141
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Then...

3142
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Look again...

3143
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
You want to maximize P...

3144
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
How to maximize...

3145
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Then...

3146
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Um...

3147
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Starting this year...

3148
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Um...

3149
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
You can...

3150
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
There is MCMC...

3151
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
He can...

3152
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Open it...

3153
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Or merge the group...

3154
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Then...

3155
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
At this time...

3156
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Um...

3157
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Um...

3158
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
MCMC...

3159
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Will be more efficient...

3160
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Then...

3161
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Um...

3162
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I specifically listed here...

3163
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Say...

3164
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
A search algorithm...

3165
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I want...

3166
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Um...

3167
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I already have MCMC...

3168
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
But MCMC is...

3169
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Temporarily in...

3170
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Specific...

3171
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
B...

3172
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Then...

3173
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
How do I...

3174
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
In the space of B...

3175
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Move...

3176
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
That part...

3177
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
We call it a search algorithm...

3178
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Okay...

3179
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Then...

3180
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I haven't talked about MCMC...

3181
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Um...

3182
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
What is it...

3183
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Then...

3184
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Here is a...

3185
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I think it's interesting...

3186
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
That is...

3187
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
How do we MCMC...

3188
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Then...

3189
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Why MCMC...

3190
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
In SVM Inference...

3191
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It is useful...

3192
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
But it is also quite difficult...

3193
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Then...

3194
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Um...

3195
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Usually...

3196
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Um...

3197
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
When doing MCMC...

3198
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Is...

3199
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I want...

3200
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Um...

3201
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Seek a...

3202
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
There are many parameters...

3203
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Function...

3204
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Then...

3205
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
This...

3206
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
This function...

3207
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It is a...

3208
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I know those parameters...

3209
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I know how to calculate...

3210
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The function...

3211
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
But...

3212
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I may not know how to...

3213
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Write it...

3214
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Detailed...

3215
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Write it down...

3216
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So I can't use...

3217
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
The method of microgram...

3218
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
To...

3219
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
To find the value...

3220
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So at this time...

3221
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I can only...

3222
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Um...

3223
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
But...

3224
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
This is a very useful method...

3225
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
That is...

3226
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I can only...

3227
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Randomly change...

3228
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Those parameters of this function...

3229
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Then...

3230
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
After each change...

3231
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
For example, I want to maximize...

3232
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
The value of that parameter...

3233
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Then...

3234
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
After each change...

3235
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
This...

3236
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
The value may become larger or smaller...

3237
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Then...

3238
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Um...

3239
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I will say...

3240
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Ah...

3241
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
If...

3242
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Um...

3243
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
If I change it later...

3244
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
This value becomes larger...

3245
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I will accept this change...

3246
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Uh...

3247
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
If...

3248
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
My change...

3249
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
My random change...

3250
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
If I make this value smaller...

3251
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I will...

3252
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Accept that change...

3253
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
With conditions...

3254
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So...

3255
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Then...

3256
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That so-called condition...

3257
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Is a...

3258
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Called...

3259
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm...

3260
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Uh...

3261
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Very useful...

3262
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Is...

3263
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
When you choose that kind of specific...

3264
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Rejected some...

3265
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
After some proposal conditions...

3266
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You finally came out with this...

3267
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You want to use...

3268
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
But you don't know how to use...

3269
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That network...

3270
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Uh...

3271
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That...

3272
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That function...

3273
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
The distribution...

3274
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Will be very close to the real distribution...

3275
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Then you can do it on top...

3276
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Um...

3277
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Maximum operation...

3278
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Like this...

3279
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So MCMC is very useful for me...

3280
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Because I...

3281
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I just need to change...

3282
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Every group...

3283
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
It...

3284
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Uh...

3285
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Every node...

3286
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Its group...

3287
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Then after the change...

3288
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Let me see...

3289
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Uh...

3290
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
My likelihood...

3291
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
In fact, it is a posterior likelihood...

3292
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
How to change...

3293
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I will decide if I want to accept it...

3294
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Like this...

3295
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
But...

3296
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But there are many problems...

3297
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I'm not sure at the beginning...

3298
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
For example, B3...

3299
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'm not sure at the beginning...

3300
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
What kind of partition do I want...

3301
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Then...

3302
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Uh...

3303
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Uh...

3304
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
This is actually an example...

3305
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You are from...

3306
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Uh...

3307
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Number of sweeps...

3308
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Is your proposal every time...

3309
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Every sweep...

3310
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Is every time you...

3311
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
There are N points...

3312
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Just start from 0...

3313
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Change once...

3314
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Change once...

3315
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Change once...

3316
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
After N times...

3317
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
This is one less time...

3318
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It's called a sweep...

3319
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Like this...

3320
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Then...

3321
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Number of sweeps...

3322
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
You are many times less...

3323
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Like this...

3324
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You expect...

3325
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Because I want...

3326
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
From random...

3327
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Uh...

3328
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Random system...

3329
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Down...

3330
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Then...

3331
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
But...

3332
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Usually...

3333
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
There are some systems...

3334
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It may be in...

3335
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
This kind of...

3336
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Uh...

3337
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It's stuck in a certain...

3338
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Metastable state...

3339
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Then you...

3340
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You want to look at the entropy...

3341
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You are not sure...

3342
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Uh...

3343
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
This...

3344
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Markov chain...

3345
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Converge...

3346
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Like this...

3347
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Then...

3348
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You are not sure how long you have to wait...

3349
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Then...

3350
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So this is unknown mixing time...

3351
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Then...

3352
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And...

3353
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Finally...

3354
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Uh...

3355
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
After a while...

3356
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
You have to...

3357
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Um...

3358
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Because I still want to know...

3359
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
My...

3360
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
What is the maximum P?

3361
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Then...

3362
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Um...

3363
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
At this time...

3364
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
You have to regulate the chain...

3365
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Let it...

3366
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Don't move so fast...

3367
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So there are some...

3368
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Unlinking schemes...

3369
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Then I'm not sure what to do...

3370
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Um...

3371
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
There is an unlinking scheme...

3372
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Like this...

3373
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Then...

3374
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Unlinking schemes...

3375
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
There will be a problem...

3376
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Then...

3377
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
In short...

3378
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Um...

3379
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
There is a lot of room here...

3380
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Then...

3381
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Um...

3382
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It's the paper in the lower right corner...

3383
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Also...

3384
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
A lot of things...

3385
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Like this...

3386
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Okay...

3387
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Then...

3388
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Um...

3389
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Okay...

3390
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So far...

3391
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I just talked about...

3392
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Um...

3393
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
How...

3394
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Um...

3395
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
After determining B...

3396
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
After determining the group...

3397
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
How do I change those...

3398
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
The one at each node...

3399
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Then look at...

3400
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
The value of P...

3401
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But I haven't...

3402
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Said...

3403
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
How do I...

3404
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Move in the space of the group...

3405
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Like this...

3406
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Then...

3407
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Um...

3408
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
We proposed a search algorithm...

3409
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
This search algorithm...

3410
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There is a concept called...

3411
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Dynamic Programming...

3412
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Then...

3413
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
The idea at that time was like this...

3414
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Just...

3415
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I was thinking...

3416
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
At that time...

3417
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I was developing this...

3418
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
This...

3419
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Search algorithm...

3420
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I was thinking...

3421
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Um...

3422
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Uh...

3423
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
If we start from random...

3424
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It's like putting a messy room...

3425
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Tidy up...

3426
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Then...

3427
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Um...

3428
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Um...

3429
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Um...

3430
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
When tidying up...

3431
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I can...

3432
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I...

3433
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I can have a way...

3434
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Um...

3435
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I just...

3436
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Take a good one...

3437
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Take a piece of paper...

3438
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Write it down...

3439
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Say...

3440
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Um...

3441
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
What should be put where...

3442
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
What should be put where...

3443
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Then...

3444
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Finished...

3445
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Then I said...

3446
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I wrote a hundred things...

3447
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Because there are not a hundred things in the room...

3448
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Then I said...

3449
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Ah...

3450
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The room looks neat...

3451
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Yes...

3452
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But...

3453
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Um...

3454
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
But you will find that...

3455
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
When you do this...

3456
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Found...

3457
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Hey...

3458
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It seems that there are some things...

3459
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
For example...

3460
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Um...

3461
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Books and pens may need...

3462
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Put it closer...

3463
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So you want to say...

3464
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I may not need to be so detailed...

3465
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Book and pen...

3466
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
The...

3467
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
The position...

3468
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So I can...

3469
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I can...

3470
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Um...

3471
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I said...

3472
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Um...

3473
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
The position of the book and the pen...

3474
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
If I did it at the beginning...

3475
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Very complicated...

3476
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
After the search...

3477
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Um...

3478
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Next time...

3479
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I want to do...

3480
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Not so complicated...

3481
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
That is...

3482
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I...

3483
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I...

3484
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
The first time I want to divide it into 100 groups...

3485
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
But the second time I may...

3486
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That 99 groups...

3487
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I can not say...

3488
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I want to divide 99 groups...

3489
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But from that 100 groups...

3490
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Then...

3491
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Say...

3492
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Who is closer to whom...

3493
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I will divide it together...

3494
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
This way...

3495
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Then...

3496
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I want to see if doing this...

3497
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Um...

3498
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Will make me...

3499
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Much better...

3500
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Then...

3501
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Um...

3502
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The conclusion is...

3503
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It will be much worse...

3504
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But...

3505
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Um...

3506
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
You can...

3507
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Standardize it...

3508
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You say...

3509
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
If you are lazy...

3510
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I do not want to be serious...

3511
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Use what I just said...

3512
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
That very complicated MCMC to divide...

3513
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But I...

3514
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Lazy to say...

3515
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Ah...

3516
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
What is close to what...

3517
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I will write it together...

3518
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
This thing...

3519
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Sorry...

3520
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I want to skip the video...

3521
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
That is...

3522
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
In the lower right corner...

3523
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
This...

3524
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Matrix...

3525
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Merge...

3526
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
That is...

3527
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
This is a...

3528
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
That makes me much worse...

3529
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Then...

3530
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Um...

3531
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Um...

3532
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
If this way...

3533
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
You can...

3534
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Then I can...

3535
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
That...

3536
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
The whole algorithm...

3537
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Become faster...

3538
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Say...

3539
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Then...

3540
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Um...

3541
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
The answer is...

3542
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
This is OK...

3543
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Then...

3544
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Um...

3545
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
We do it this way...

3546
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And after we do it...

3547
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Ah...

3548
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Also using...

3549
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Um...

3550
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Um...

3551
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
The way of design algorithm...

3552
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
The way of algorithm is...

3553
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Dynamic programming...

3554
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
That is...

3555
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I want in that...

3556
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Um...

3557
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Um...

3558
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
This kind of...

3559
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Um...

3560
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Two K or two B...

3561
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Move in space...

3562
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
But I don't want to...

3563
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Calculate all the values...

3564
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Now this is...

3565
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I deliberately calculated all the values...

3566
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I want to be inside...

3567
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Effective movement...

3568
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Then...

3569
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Um...

3570
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Um...

3571
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Because I know...

3572
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I often repeat...

3573
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Calculate something...

3574
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Then...

3575
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
So this is...

3576
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
My upper right corner...

3577
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Um...

3578
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
The second point is...

3579
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Overlapping subproblems...

3580
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Then...

3581
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
With...

3582
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Um...

3583
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
With one thing is...

3584
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Um...

3585
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I know this system...

3586
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
There is a system called...

3587
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Optimal substructure...

3588
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
That is...

3589
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I want to find...

3590
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I just saw this...

3591
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Very complicated landscape...

3592
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Minimum value...

3593
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Then...

3594
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Um...

3595
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I can't find it all...

3596
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Because it is very expensive...

3597
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
So I can only find...

3598
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
This pink...

3599
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
This little block...

3600
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Then...

3601
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Um...

3602
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
If this system has...

3603
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Optimal substructure...

3604
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
That is...

3605
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Say...

3606
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I found a lot of little blocks...

3607
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Then...

3608
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Um...

3609
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Um...

3610
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
This little block...

3611
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
A lot of little blocks...

3612
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Minimum value...

3613
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Um...

3614
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Really can represent...

3615
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Um...

3616
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
If I...

3617
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Seriously find the minimum value...

3618
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Then...

3619
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
That is...

3620
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Your substructure...

3621
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
That is...

3622
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
With optimal value...

3623
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
You can use it...

3624
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Then...

3625
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So usually...

3626
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
If there is this kind of value...

3627
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Problem...

3628
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
We can design a...

3629
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Dynamic programming...

3630
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
To...

3631
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
To solve it...

3632
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Then...

3633
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
We will...

3634
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Um...

3635
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Put MCMC and...

3636
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
In...

3637
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
B space...

3638
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Search these two...

3639
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Decouple...

3640
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Then...

3641
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
We propose a algorithm...

3642
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Then...

3643
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Um...

3644
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
The time is...

3645
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Not enough...

3646
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
But...

3647
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Um...

3648
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
When we compare...

3649
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
We compare...

3650
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Um...

3651
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Another...

3652
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
One...

3653
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
On...

3654
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
SVM...

3655
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
The model above...

3656
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It...

3657
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
For...

3658
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
The edge count we just said...

3659
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
With...

3660
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Um...

3661
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Partition...

3662
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
These two prior...

3663
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Um...

3664
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Do extension...

3665
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Then...

3666
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Um...

3667
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Turn it into a...

3668
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Layered model...

3669
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Then...

3670
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
This layered model...

3671
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Not like...

3672
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
All...

3673
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
All...

3674
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Has the same probability...

3675
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
But...

3676
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It assumes...

3677
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Each state has a specific probability...

3678
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And this specific probability is...

3679
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
A slightly upper...

3680
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Network...

3681
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Then...

3682
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Also generated by SVM...

3683
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Then...

3684
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
This network...

3685
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It has a higher-level network...

3686
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Generated...

3687
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Then...

3688
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Until...

3689
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
The top...

3690
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Layer...

3691
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It is a...

3692
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Um...

3693
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Not like I said...

3694
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Um...

3695
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Intentionally assume...

3696
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Um...

3697
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Who is who...

3698
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Is a...

3699
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Um...

3700
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Um...

3701
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Parameter distribution...

3702
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Then...

3703
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Um...

3704
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
There was a work that said...

3705
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Ah...

3706
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
If you do this...

3707
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Then use a layered network...

3708
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
To feed it...

3709
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
You will get...

3710
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Um...

3711
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
A better...

3712
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Posterior...

3713
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Then we did compare with it...

3714
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Like this...

3715
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Then there is an interlude...

3716
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Just the one I just said...

3717
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
This...

3718
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Hiacusvm...

3719
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
In fact...

3720
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Can also be used in topic modeling...

3721
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Then...

3722
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It is...

3723
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Better than LDA...

3724
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
On math...

3725
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Better...

3726
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's pretty interesting...

3727
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Then...

3728
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Um...

3729
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
We...

3730
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Have to our system...

3731
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Resolution limit...

3732
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Is that we...

3733
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Intentionally use a lot of this...

3734
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Bipartite clique...

3735
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It...

3736
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Every small network is bipartite...

3737
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
But it has a lot of quantity...

3738
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Then we want to see...

3739
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Um...

3740
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
For example...

3741
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
If the number is small...

3742
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
It should be able to...

3743
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Divide to the number I want...

3744
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
But the number is getting more and more...

3745
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Is it...

3746
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Will...

3747
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
More to a certain extent...

3748
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I can't see...

3749
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Such a small bipartite clique...

3750
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Then we have it...

3751
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
With...

3752
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Um...

3753
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Um...

3754
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
General model...

3755
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Comparison...

3756
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Then...

3757
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
We know that...

3758
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Where is the boundary...

3759
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Then...

3760
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
We also...

3761
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Um...

3762
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
To see it...

3763
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Because our...

3764
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Um...

3765
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Contribution has...

3766
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
The prior...

3767
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
With the search...

3768
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Then we...

3769
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Compare some models...

3770
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Then...

3771
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Change the parameters...

3772
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Then we...

3773
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Um...

3774
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Generate...

3775
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
The EC test on the left...

3776
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
With...

3777
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
The hard test on the right...

3778
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Um...

3779
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
As...

3780
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Um...

3781
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Model network...

3782
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Then we look at it...

3783
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Um...

3784
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Finally...

3785
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Um...

3786
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
The hard test network...

3787
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I...

3788
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I...

3789
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Planned it...

3790
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I...

3791
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I built it by hand...

3792
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Then I know that...

3793
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Is my method good or not...

3794
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Then we do...

3795
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Related comparison...

3796
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Then on the real network...

3797
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
We...

3798
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Have...

3799
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Compare with...

3800
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
The methods I just said...

3801
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Then we...

3802
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Have some results...

3803
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Um...

3804
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
If the network is smaller...

3805
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
By spam...

3806
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
There will be better...

3807
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
That...

3808
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Posterior...

3809
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Um...

3810
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Here to compare...

3811
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Is...

3812
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The smaller the better...

3813
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Because...

3814
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Um...

3815
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Is the...

3816
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Entropy...

3817
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Then...

3818
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
If it's a larger network...

3819
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And...

3820
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Um...

3821
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
The bipartite SPM is better...

3822
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Then this network is usually better...

3823
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Technical...

3824
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
We get...

3825
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
This result...

3826
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Then...

3827
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You can look at paper...

3828
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Then...

3829
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Um...

3830
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Here I...

3831
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Did very little...

3832
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Um...

3833
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Um...

3834
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
The so-called predicted...

3835
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
What kind of group is the node...

3836
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Thing...

3837
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
C...

3838
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Then...

3839
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
We have a...

3840
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Um...

3841
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
There is a view...

3842
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Is...

3843
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Um...

3844
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
David Walpert...

3845
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Walpert...

3846
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Um...

3847
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Proved a theorem...

3848
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Called...

3849
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
There is no stupid lunch theorem...

3850
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
He...

3851
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Say...

3852
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Um...

3853
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Um...

3854
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
He made a pretty strong statement...

3855
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Then...

3856
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Say...

3857
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Um...

3858
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Uh...

3859
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
We have...

3860
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Different...

3861
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Machine learning models...

3862
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Then...

3863
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Um...

3864
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
All machine learning models...

3865
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
If you put it...

3866
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Um...

3867
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
His...

3868
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Um...

3869
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
His performance...

3870
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
To...

3871
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
His input data...

3872
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
If you do the average...

3873
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Then...

3874
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
All...

3875
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Um...

3876
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Machine learning models...

3877
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Their...

3878
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Um...

3879
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Performance is the same...

3880
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
On average...

3881
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
For all data...

3882
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
On average, it's the same...

3883
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So...

3884
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Uh...

3885
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
In other words...

3886
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Uh...

3887
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Our point of view on this issue is...

3888
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Compare the model itself...

3889
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Uh...

3890
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Uh...

3891
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
No special...

3892
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Say...

3893
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Is it in which data...

3894
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
He...

3895
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
To perform better...

3896
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Um...

3897
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
So...

3898
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Um...

3899
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Um...

3900
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
For example, there is a machine learning model...

3901
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
He may be...

3902
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
He predicted some type of data well...

3903
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
But he may be...

3904
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
To...

3905
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Other...

3906
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
The type of data is not well predicted...

3907
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
So...

3908
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Um...

3909
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
So...

3910
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
What everyone sells...

3911
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It's better to say what he sells...

3912
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Um...

3913
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Okay...

3914
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Then...

3915
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Almost...

3916
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It's over...

3917
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Uh...

3918
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
What did we learn?

3919
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Uh...

3920
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
If we have a good constraint...

3921
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Then we have a more economical model...

3922
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Then...

3923
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Um...

3924
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Our design...

3925
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Our design method...

3926
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Is...

3927
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Um...

3928
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
There is nothing to predict...

3929
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It's a soft model...

3930
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Then he can...

3931
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Can...

3932
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Uh...

3933
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Look at the distribution...

3934
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Can look at...

3935
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Can look at...

3936
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Um...

3937
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
The probability of parameters...

3938
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Then...

3939
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And then...

3940
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Uh...

3941
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Um...

3942
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
There are many possibilities of new methods...

3943
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Then...

3944
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Then...

3945
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
What can we do?

3946
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
We can have...

3947
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
What...

3948
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Core proof structure...

3949
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
It's a type of structure...

3950
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Then...

3951
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Uh...

3952
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
We can also look at...

3953
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
The assumption of SBM at the beginning...

3954
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Then...

3955
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
There is some work...

3956
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Then...

3957
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Uh...

3958
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
What I just said...

3959
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
The landscape of B and B...

3960
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Uh...

3961
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
We can also look at...

3962
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
His landscape...

3963
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Then...

3964
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Some recent work...

3965
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Then...

3966
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Um...

3967
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Finally...

3968
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Um...

3969
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Just...

3970
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Um...

3971
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Recently there is...

3972
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
There is that MCMC algorithm...

3973
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
He can...

3974
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Separate the group directly...

3975
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Or merge the group...

3976
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Then...

3977
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Usually the efficiency is very high...

3978
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But the interesting thing is...

3979
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Um...

3980
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Although he...

3981
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Um...

3982
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Um...

3983
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Um...

3984
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Although he...

3985
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Um...

3986
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Can guarantee...

3987
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Just mathematically guarantee...

3988
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
He has a better mixing time...

3989
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
That is...

3990
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
He...

3991
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
MCMC is more quickly trained...

3992
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
In some specific networks...

3993
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
He...

3994
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Um...

3995
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Uh...

3996
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Uh...

3997
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
After the training...

3998
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
But...

3999
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Um...

4000
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
The result of the training...

4001
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Just...

4002
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Think about it...

4003
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Um...

4004
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Just...

4005
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
He...

4006
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
He...

4007
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
We have...

4008
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
We have...

4009
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Um...

4010
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Um...

4011
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Just...

4012
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
This work has said...

4013
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Just...

4014
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Um...

4015
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Some type of data...

4016
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Although you...

4017
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Uh...

4018
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Have a better MCMC algorithm...

4019
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
You can...

4020
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Fit it...

4021
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
However...

4022
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Um...

4023
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Often...

4024
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
It still needs a long training time...

4025
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
So in other words...

4026
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Um...

4027
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Maybe some data is...

4028
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Not suitable...

4029
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
SBM to fit...

4030
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Although SBMs...

4031
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It looks like too...

4032
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Too...

4033
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Too...

4034
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Too simple like this...

4035
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
So there is the model consistency problem...

4036
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Okay...

4037
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Then...

4038
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Um...

4039
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Um...

4040
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
You can also ask...

4041
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
If there is a change in the network...

4042
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Then...

4043
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Uh...

4044
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
At the time of change...

4045
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
The distribution of the node is...

4046
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
What kind of...

4047
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Uh...

4048
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Maybe...

4049
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Is there any...

4050
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Physical...

4051
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Low...

4052
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
In the high-end...

4053
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Like this...

4054
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So this is...

4055
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
If you get two snapshots of the network...

4056
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Then the middle will change...

4057
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
You can...

4058
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Say you want...

4059
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Interpolation...

4060
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Like this...

4061
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Find a model...

4062
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
To fit the middle...

4063
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Change...

4064
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Okay...

4065
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Okay...

4066
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Then...

4067
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Because our work...

4068
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Is related to different data...

4069
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
So...

4070
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I think a takeaway...

4071
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Is to be curious about...

4072
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
New experiments and...

4073
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Applications...

4074
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Okay...

4075
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Then...

4076
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I have one last slide...

4077
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Is that I want to thank...

4078
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Um...

4079
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
These people are...

4080
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Um...

4081
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Um...

4082
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Um...

4083
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
From not applying for a PhD...

4084
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
To...

4085
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Later...

4086
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
The people I met in the PhD class...

4087
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Then...

4088
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000

4097
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Um...

4098
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000

Um...

4103
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000

01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Is...

4109
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
To show everyone...

4110
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
This community...

4111
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Then...

4112
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Um...

4113
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000

4114
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Um...

4115
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Participated in a project...

4116
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Called...

4117
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Taiwan Internet Science Education...

4118
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
It is currently a website...

4119
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
But I hope to put...

4120
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
A lot of...

4121
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Internet data related to Taiwan...

4122
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Because...

4123
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Um...

4124
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
To develop a model...

4125
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
You need to...

4126
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Look at it with data...

4127
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Then...

4128
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Um...

4129
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I hope everyone can give me...

4130
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Suggestions...

4131
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
About this...

4132
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Website...

4133
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
How to go...

4134
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Will...

4135
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Affect more people...

4136
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Then...

4137
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
We translated...

4138
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Two small books...

4139
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Called...

4140
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Complex systems...

4141
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Yes, you don't know...

4142
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
And...

4143
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Network adoption...

4144
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I specifically separate the network and the network...

4145
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Because I think the network is the Internet...

4146
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But the network is...

4147
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Um...

4148
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Complex networks...

4149
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Although...

4150
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It is not a commonly used word in Taiwan...

4151
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
A word...

4152
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Yes...

4153
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Then...

4154
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
This...

4155
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Is...

4156
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Um...

4157
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Is a...

4158
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Um...

4159
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
A website that collects various Internet data...

4160
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Yes...

4161
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000

4162
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Um...

4163
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
There is also a seminar similar to Taiwan...

4164
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Um...

4165
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Seminar...

4166
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
That is...

4167
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Women in Network Science Seminar...

4168
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Then...

4169
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Um...

4170
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Usually it is a weekly speech...

4171
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Everyone can...

4172
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000

Yes...

4176
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000

Um...

4178
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
In the lower right corner...

4179
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
This...

4180
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Um...

4181
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Very special...

4182
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
With many CS conferences...

4183
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
A very different place is...

4184
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Um...

4185
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000

Um...

4191
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
That job may not be a completed job...

4192
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Then...

4193
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
He...

4194
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Um...

4195
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
The community is quite active...

4196
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Everyone...

4197
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
More willing...

4198
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Vote for a...

4199
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Um...

4200
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I haven't finished my work yet...

4201
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
But go there to exchange opinions with everyone...

4202
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Yes...

4203
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Then...

4204
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
That...

4205
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
NETSCI conference...

4206
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It has some symposiums...

4207
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Then...

4208
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I think with...

4209
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
The two are related to networking science...

4210
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yes...

4211
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Such as...

4212
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Um...

4213
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
This Network Science in Education...

4214
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
This one...

4215
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Um...

4216
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It may be mentioned a lot...

4217
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Um...

4218
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
The actual desktop of teaching Internet Science...

4219
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Even have...

4220
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Um...

4221
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Education in the high school this period...

4222
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Then diversify NETSCI...

4223
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Yes...

4224
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Then...

4225
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
As for the upper right corner...

4226
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
This is a that...

4227
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Um...

4228
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Society of Young Network Scientists...

4229
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
He...

4230
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
As long as he considers...

4231
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
That you are young...

4232
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
You can...

4233
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000

Um...

4237
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Now most of them are...

4238
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Early career...

4239
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Professor...

4240
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Then postdoc...

4241
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
With PhD students...

4242
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Then...

4243
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
We have a Slack...

4244
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000

My report will end here...

4249
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Sorry...

4250
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
More than an hour...

Um...

4252
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Hi...

4253
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It doesn't matter...

4254
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
That...

4255
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
That...

4256
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Before opening the question...

4257
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Let me first represent everyone...

4258
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000

Um...

4269
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Are there any questions?

4270
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I think...

4271
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I think the content is very rich...

4272
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And you...

4273
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Hold on...

Let everyone think about it...

4275
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Have a question...

4276
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Then let me ask one...

4277
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
This is more relevant to the content...

4278
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Excuse me...

4279
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000

You wrote it in one piece...

4282
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000

Um...

4284
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I don't know if it's...

4285
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
The relationship I talked about...

4286
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
It has changed a lot...

4287
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
But...

4288
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
He was in one piece...

4289
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Then...

4290
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
That piece...

4291
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Has 17 pages...

4292
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Including references...

4293
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Oh...

4294
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
But I think it's a lot...

4295
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Because...

4296
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Because in fact, every link...

4297
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Of course, it's all linked together...

4298
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
That's right...

4299
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
But every link is interesting...

4300
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Then...

4301
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Every link is basically...

4302
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
The contribution of the main force...

4303
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Of course, they help each other...

4304
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
There is nothing wrong...

4305
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Anyway...

4306
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Anyway, I just think it's very good...

4307
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Um...

4308
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
OK...

4309
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Do you have any questions?

4310
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Um...

4311
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Um...

4312
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Um...

4313
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Um...

4314
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Um...

4315
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Um...

4316
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Um...

4317
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Um...

4318
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Um...

4319
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Um...

4320
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Um...

4321
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Um...

4322
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I want to ask a question...

4323
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Um...

4324
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
You just say it directly...

4325
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Can you hear me?

4326
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yes...

4327
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Um...

4328
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Thank you very much...

4329
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Thank you for the sharing...

4330
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Then...

4331
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I think...

4332
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Very...

4333
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Useful...

4334
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And...

4335
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
The meaning of this education is great...

4336
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
That is...

4337
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
You are not just...

4338
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
What are you doing from this article?

4339
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
That is...

4340
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
From the beginning...

4341
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
The whole context...

4342
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It's a complete narrative...

4343
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I think it's great...

4344
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Then...

4345
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
There are two questions I want to ask...

4346
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
The first one is...

4347
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Um...

4348
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Because I haven't read this article...

4349
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
That is...

4350
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I want to ask...

4351
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Are you testing...

4352
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
There is...

4353
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Synthetic...

4354
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Or...

4355
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Simulated network...

4356
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
That is...

4357
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
You make it yourself...

4358
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Some...

4359
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Um...

4360
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
You have already controlled it...

4361
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
This parameter...

4362
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
This network...

4363
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Just like...

4364
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
You are not from the real world...

4365
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
To search for information...

4366
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You are...

4367
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Synthetic...

4368
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Come...

4369
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Then you go to test...

4370
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Under what circumstances...

4371
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Your algorithm performance is better...

4372
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Under what circumstances...

4373
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Your performance is not so good...

4374
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Because...

4375
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
You say...

4376
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I...

4377
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I...

4378
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
That...

4379
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Or signed...

4380
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
That is to say...

4381
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It has positive signs...

4382
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Or even...

4383
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Temporal...

4384
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
That...

4385
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
This model...

4386
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Can you extend it?

4387
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Because I have one here...

4388
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Contents of Congress...

4389
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
It is...

4390
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
The legislative and proposals of the proposal...

4391
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Then...

4392
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
It is a...

4393
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Weighted...

4394
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Then there is also a sign...

4395
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Because it has...

4396
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Different parties...

4397
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I don't know if...

4398
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Directly apply you...

4399
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Framework of research...

4400
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Or...

4401
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Packaging...

4402
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Can use...

4403
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Good...

4404
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
These two questions...

4405
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Um...

4406
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
The first question is easier to answer...

4407
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Um...

4408
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Is in my work...

4409
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Use...

4410
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Synthetic network...

4411
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Then I thought of it most directly...

4412
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Uh...

4413
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I'm talking about a faster projection...

4414
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I hope to know it...

4415
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
In the end...

4416
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Um...

4417
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
How much support...

4418
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
So...

4419
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
This horizontal is...

4420
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Uh...

4421
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
My...

4422
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Uh...

4423
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Synthetic network noise...

4424
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
That...

4425
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Then...

4426
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
That...

4427
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
That...

4428
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Adjacency matrix is...

4429
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Its structure...

4430
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
It looks like that...

4431
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But...

4432
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
You see a lot of...

4433
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Noise...

4434
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Noise points...

4435
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
That is...

4436
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I deliberately let that noise point...

4437
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
From small to large...

4438
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Then I want to see...

4439
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
To what extent...

4440
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Can't...

4441
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
So...

4442
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
This is what I think of...

4443
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Uh...

4444
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Useful synthetic network...

4445
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Then...

4446
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Um...

4447
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
As for...

4448
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Um...

4449
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
The second question...

4450
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Um...

4451
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Um...

4452
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Um...

4453
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
As far as I know...

4454
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Not yet...

4455
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Um...

4456
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
At the same time there is...

4457
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Bipartite...

4458
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
That is...

4459
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
What I said now...

4460
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Uh...

4461
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
My paper...

4462
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
These priors...

4463
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Plus...

4464
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Uh...

4465
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Weighted...

4466
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
The edge...

4467
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Or signed edge...

4468
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
The SBM...

4469
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Um...

4470
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
But now there is...

4471
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Very good...

4472
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Weighted SBM...

4473
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Um...

4474
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And there is...

4475
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Not too bad...

4476
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Prior...

4477
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Come...

4478
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Come...

4479
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Can be used immediately...

4480
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Just in that graph tool...

4481
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Inside...

4482
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
The work of the architecture...

4483
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Then...

4484
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
But there is no...

4485
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Let me think...

4486
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Uh...

4487
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Oh, no...

4488
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
That is...

4489
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Inside...

4490
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
For that edge...

4491
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
It is a weighted edge...

4492
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Then it can be...

4493
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Weighted...

4494
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
It can also be...

4495
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Categorical...

4496
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
So...

4497
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Um...

4498
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Um...

4499
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
The framework is the same...

4500
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
But...

4501
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Um...

4502
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Because it is weighted or...

4503
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Categorical...

4504
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
It is the same...

4505
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Um...

4506
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Corresponding...

4507
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Uh...

4508
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Prior...

4509
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Inside...

4510
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Then it can be used directly...

4511
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So...

4512
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I...

4513
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I don't know...

4514
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I think...

4515
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Um...

4516
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I don't know if...

4517
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Deliberately put...

4518
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
That kind of...

4519
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Already have...

4520
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Weighted SBM...

4521
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Inside...

4522
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Bipartite place...

4523
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Adjust again...

4524
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Adjust to...

4525
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Say...

4526
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I really want to use a...

4527
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Weighted Bipartite Structure...

4528
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Will have...

4529
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
How much improvement...

4530
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Otherwise...

4531
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I...

4532
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I think this is a job...

4533
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Not wrong...

4534
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
But I think...

4535
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Um...

4536
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Direct off the shell...

4537
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
In that graph tool...

4538
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I think...

4539
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Should be very good...

4540
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I don't know...

4541
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So ask again...

4542
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
The one you said is...

4543
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Off the shell is...

4544
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It already has...

4545
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Weighted...

4546
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
But there is no bipartite...

4547
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Or...

4548
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
There is weighted...

4549
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Then there is bipartite...

4550
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Um...

4551
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Weighted...

4552
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
No bipartite...

4553
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
But...

4554
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Weighted...

4555
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And there is hierarchical...

4556
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Um...

4557
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Um...

4558
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
If you take it directly...

4559
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Hierarchical...

4560
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Directly...

4561
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Um...

4562
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Directly hierarchical...

4563
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
With...

4564
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Bipartite...

4565
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Together on...

4566
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Bipartite...

4567
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
If you compare...

4568
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Um...

4569
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Um...

4570
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Except for some...

4571
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I think...

4572
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Not yet understood by everyone...

4573
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Example...

4574
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Except...

4575
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I think...

4576
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Hierarchical will be better...

4577
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Um...

4578
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Correct...

4579
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Understand...

4580
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Then my last sentence is...

4581
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
We have real evidence here...

4582
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Is...

4583
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Taiwan Congress...

4584
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Legislation...

4585
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Proposal...

4586
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Joint data...

4587
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Extend to...

4588
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Weighted...

4589
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Bipartite...

4590
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Welcome you to do...

4591
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Then our data can let you do...

4592
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Realistic research...

4593
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Is...

4594
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Because I want to say...

4595
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
You should be...

4596
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Just a few steps away...

4597
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Can be promoted to...

4598
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Weighted...

4599
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Or even...

4600
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Sign...

4601
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
If you are interested...

4602
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Extended...

4603
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Is that we can...

4604
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Cooperate in this area...

4605
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Thank you...

4606
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Sorry for taking up too much time...

4607
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Need to rub a hand...

4608
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Does everyone have any questions?

4609
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Does everyone have any questions?

4610
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Can you hear me talking like this?

4611
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Can...

4612
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
OK...

4613
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Because of time...

4614
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
If you have any questions...

4615
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
This...

4616
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Just like I said at the beginning...

4617
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Welcome everyone...

4618
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Go to...

4619
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Ziqi's website...

4620
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Then I believe that Ziqi will...

4621
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Very happy to contact you...

4622
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Then this video...

4623
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Will also be placed on...

4624
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Hera's website...

4625
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
This...

4626
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
This video...

4627
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Will also be placed on...

4628
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Hera's website...

4629
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
So...

4630
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Everyone can still go and see...

4631
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Last round of applause...

4632
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Thank you Ziqi...

4633
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
For sharing today...

4634
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Thank you...

4635
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Thank you...

4636
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Thank you...

4637
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Thank you...
