0	5000	Ok, let's start.
5000	15000	Ok, first I need to introduce myself.
15000	18000	Please introduce yourself, thank you.
18000	22000	Ok, I have prepared a few videos.
22000	26000	I will use them to introduce myself.
26000	32000	Today, I will talk about the simple introduction of metal solvents.
32000	41000	My name is Zeyu Lin, and I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.
41000	44000	First, I will give a brief self-introduction.
44000	52000	As I mentioned, I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.
52000	58000	My department is the National Research and Development Department of the Institute of Materials and Materials Research.
58000	61000	My main job here is...
61000	63000	Sorry, let me use the laser pointer.
63000	72000	My main job here is to connect the material's microstructure with its mechanical properties,
72000	80000	as well as its related performance characteristics.
80000	90000	At present, I am working on the development of high-strength and high-durability ferrous alloys,
90000	98000	as well as the microstructure of permanent magnets,
98000	103000	as well as the development of some raw materials.
103000	110000	Today, I would like to introduce my post-doctoral research...
110000	114000	No, I mean my work accumulated during my post-doctoral studies,
114000	118000	and my post-doctoral research in February this year,
118000	121000	which is about four years of work.
121000	125000	The field of research is mainly the solid-state integration of copper,
125000	128000	which is similar in nature, as well as liquid metal.
128000	132000	The integration technology used is a technology called ultrasonic integration.
132000	141000	Its principle is to use high-pressure and high frequency vibration to achieve the deformation of the material to form the node.
141000	149000	It can be used in steel, high-strength steel, or aluminum alloy, etc.
149000	150000	It can be used in...
150000	154000	The main scene that can be considered is that the composite structure of multi-materials,
154000	156000	such as the structure of the car body,
156000	161000	can achieve the goal characteristics of lightweighting and high strength.
166000	168000	Sorry, I just made a mistake.
168000	172000	I graduated from Tokyo University of Japan in 2019,
172000	174000	and majored in material engineering.
174000	181000	My other major is the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China,
181000	185000	and the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China.
185000	188000	That's all for the main self-introduction.
188000	195000	Next, I'm going to start introducing today's main speech topic,
195000	202000	which is mainly about the integration of solid-state and liquid metal materials that are similar in nature,
202000	207000	and then use ultrasonic integration to observe the strength of its interface.
208000	214000	First, I will give a simple background introduction.
214000	220000	In the engineering background,
220000	226000	listeners may be more familiar with the fact that
226000	232000	steel is a very solid base.
232000	235000	It is one of the basic and indispensable materials.
235000	239000	The picture on the left shows that
239000	248000	there are about 15% to 20% of steel in the world every year.
248000	250000	Because there are a lot of steel applications,
250000	254000	including architecture, general people, military facilities, transportation, etc.
254000	258000	It accounts for about 15% to 20% of transportation.
258000	264000	It is mainly applied to the construction of car parts and the structure of the car body.
264000	267000	There are a lot of types of steel used,
267000	275000	including soft steel, medium-strength, high-strength, and ultra-high-strength steel.
275000	278000	At present, the development field of materials is mainly focused on
278000	286000	how to improve its extensibility and high-strength, etc.
286000	292000	The picture on the lower left is called DynamoCurve,
292000	295000	which is a curve distribution like a banana.
295000	297000	Why is there such a distribution?
297000	300000	It is mainly derived from the fact that the strength of the material increases,
300000	302000	but the extensibility does not decrease.
302000	307000	Based on the background of traditional physics,
307000	311000	such strength and extensibility are indispensable.
311000	316000	However, many scientists are using various methods
316000	319000	to try to get out of this field.
320000	326000	The current research situation is to try to achieve the high strength and high extensibility of both, etc.
326000	330000	Why do we need such a high-strength steel development?
330000	334000	It is mainly used when the car body is hit by a heavy object.
334000	338000	High-strength steel can often provide stronger support
338000	343000	to avoid fatal damage to passengers.
343000	345000	In order to improve safety,
345000	350000	the current material development is mainly focused on high-strength and high extensibility, etc.
354000	358000	What kind of steel is used?
358000	361000	Different strengths of steel are used in different areas of the car body structure.
361000	364000	This is a simple introduction.
364000	366000	You can clearly see that
366000	369000	if the car is hit by a heavy object,
369000	375000	the stress and gravity come from the front and back, etc.
375000	379000	At this time, you need a high-strength structural material
379000	383000	to support the entire car body.
383000	389000	The current high-strength steel developed by traditional physics
389000	392000	has reached 780, 980, 1180, etc.
392000	394000	This represents the strength of steel,
394000	397000	which is about 550 MPa.
397000	400000	The current mainstream high-strength steel is
400000	403000	concentrated in the front and back of 1000 MPa.
403000	406000	This is the current situation in which the structural material is used.
406000	408000	On the other hand,
408000	411000	if we don't use steel,
411000	414000	and we use a high-strength material,
414000	419000	it will not be able to support the entire car body.
419000	421000	On the other hand,
421000	424000	if we don't use steel,
424000	430000	and we use a high-strength material,
430000	436000	such as aluminum, copper, and carbon fiber, etc.
436000	439000	If we use this material,
439000	441000	it can be made very lightweight
441000	445000	and has sufficient safety.
446000	449000	However, the price is also very high.
449000	452000	As you can see here,
452000	456000	for a good car like Audi R8,
456000	460000	the recommended price in 2020 is about $70,000.
460000	462000	This price is hard to meet for ordinary people.
462000	467000	So we mainly use traditional steel
467000	471000	and aluminum and carbon fiber.
471000	473000	In this respect,
473000	476000	you have to make a choice
476000	482000	in terms of cost and mechanical quality.
487000	493000	The name of the car body structure we often use in our industry
493000	496000	is a multi-material structure.
496000	498000	Multi-Material Structure
499000	502000	As you can see here,
502000	504000	in addition to steel,
504000	507000	it also has a lot of external body parts,
507000	510000	such as the door, engine cover, etc.
510000	512000	In order to make it lightweight,
512000	514000	we usually use aluminum alloy.
514000	516000	The main maintenance material is aluminum alloy.
518000	520000	In this respect,
520000	525000	when the car body is assembled,
525000	527000	we mainly use
527000	531000	high-strength steel
531000	533000	and aluminum alloy.
533000	535000	In this respect,
535000	537000	they need to be fixed and processed
537000	539000	to form a complete structure.
539000	542000	It is conceivable that
542000	545000	some processes need to be processed
545000	547000	to combine them together.
547000	549000	In recent years,
549000	553000	in addition to the emission of environmental regulations,
553000	557000	the demand for lightweighting is increasing.
557000	559000	On the right side of the slide,
559000	561000	there is a picture of
561000	564000	the materials used in the field of cars
564000	567000	in 2030,
567000	572000	including aluminum and high-strength steel.
572000	577000	HSF stands for High Strength Steel.
577000	579000	The ratio of these two materials
579000	582000	will increase from 29% to 57%.
582000	585000	In the near future,
585000	590000	in order to establish high strength
590000	592000	and lightweighting,
592000	594000	we will use more aluminum
594000	596000	and more high-strength steel.
596000	598000	Therefore, how to combine
598000	600000	iron and lightweighting alloy
600000	602000	in the manufacturing process
602000	606000	is quite important.
608000	610000	Now we will introduce
610000	612000	the traditional way
612000	614000	of combining materials
614000	616000	and manufacturing technology,
616000	618000	i.e. welding.
618000	620000	Traditionally,
620000	622000	we define welding
622000	624000	as a process
624000	626000	in which two separate materials
626000	628000	are heated
628000	630000	to a high temperature
630000	632000	and then combined
632000	634000	to produce
634000	636000	sufficient quality
636000	638000	welding.
638000	640000	In this process,
640000	642000	the defects
642000	644000	will gradually disappear.
644000	646000	At such a high temperature,
646000	648000	along with the change
648000	650000	in the structure
650000	652000	of the fibers
652000	654000	and the growth
654000	656000	of the center,
656000	658000	heat is also affected,
658000	660000	and so on.
660000	662000	In this regard,
662000	664000	the material itself
664000	666000	is mechanically affected
666000	668000	by the change
668000	670000	in the structure
670000	672000	of the fibers.
672000	674000	After the welding point
674000	676000	is formed,
676000	678000	all the fibers
678000	680000	around it
680000	682000	will undergo
682000	684000	huge changes.
684000	686000	Such changes
686000	688000	are sometimes not
688000	690000	completely positive.
690000	692000	How to prevent
692000	694000	low-performance
694000	696000	welding?
696000	698000	In general,
698000	700000	if we use
700000	702000	a high temperature
702000	704000	to melt steel
704000	706000	and aluminum,
706000	708000	we will encounter several problems.
708000	710000	The first is that
710000	712000	aluminum and steel
712000	714000	have very different melting points.
714000	716000	The melting point of aluminum
716000	718000	is about 600 degrees,
718000	720000	while steel is about
720000	722000	1400 to 1500 degrees.
722000	724000	Therefore,
724000	726000	at such a high temperature,
726000	728000	it will produce
728000	730000	a huge
730000	732000	expansion.
732000	734000	The expansion
734000	736000	will form
736000	738000	many compounds
738000	740000	between
740000	742000	steel and aluminum.
742000	744000	This compound
744000	746000	is not
746000	748000	conducive to
748000	750000	mechanical performance.
750000	752000	Why?
752000	754000	The problem is that
754000	756000	it is very brittle
756000	758000	and unbearable to impact.
758000	760000	After a little impact,
760000	762000	it will crack
762000	764000	like ceramics
764000	766000	or glass.
766000	768000	At the same time,
768000	770000	it will also
770000	772000	produce cracks
772000	774000	in the joint
774000	776000	between the
776000	778000	welding points.
778000	780000	This is
780000	782000	quite disadvantageous to
782000	784000	mechanical manufacturing.
784000	786000	That is to say,
786000	788000	it is quite disadvantageous
788000	790000	to use general
790000	792000	combination technology
792000	794000	to combine steel and aluminum
794000	796000	at high temperature.
796000	798000	In other words,
798000	800000	what we may
800000	802000	consider next
802000	804000	is how to reduce
804000	806000	the temperature of the
806000	808000	welding point
808000	810000	to a certain degree.
810000	812000	In other words,
812000	814000	we will focus on
814000	816000	how to combine
816000	818000	steel and aluminum.
818000	820000	We need to combine at
820000	822000	the melting point of
822000	824000	aluminum, which is about
824000	826000	660 degrees.
826000	828000	At this temperature,
828000	830000	it is called solidification.
832000	834000	Next,
834000	836000	I will briefly introduce
836000	838000	solidification.
838000	840000	As I mentioned earlier,
840000	842000	it can combine
842000	844000	two components
844000	846000	and
846000	848000	it will not
848000	850000	melt during the process.
850000	852000	Its heating is also
852000	854000	lower than the melting point of any material.
854000	856000	We need to introduce
856000	858000	more concepts
858000	860000	such as sufficient deformation
860000	862000	at the material interface.
862000	864000	At sufficient temperature,
864000	866000	the interface will expand.
866000	868000	After the expansion,
868000	870000	the defect will gradually disappear
870000	872000	to achieve
872000	874000	the effect of combination.
874000	876000	Here is our main
876000	878000	design concept.
878000	880000	The main concept of solidification
880000	882000	is how to make
882000	884000	the defect on the interface disappear,
884000	886000	including holes and
886000	888000	cavities, etc.
888000	890000	At the same time,
890000	892000	most materials
892000	894000	usually have a layer of
894000	896000	pollutants on the surface,
896000	898000	such as carbon
898000	900000	and oxygen,
900000	902000	and other compounds.
902000	904000	At the same time,
904000	906000	there will be a certain
906000	908000	degree of oxidation film
908000	910000	on the surface.
910000	912000	You may have heard
912000	914000	that aluminum
914000	916000	is very easy to oxidize.
916000	918000	It forms a layer
918000	920000	of oxidizing film
920000	922000	on the surface.
922000	924000	This oxidizing film
924000	926000	has a sufficient quality
926000	928000	to protect the material
928000	930000	from further oxidation.
930000	932000	This kind of oxidizing film
932000	934000	is quite beneficial
934000	936000	in combination.
936000	938000	Traditionally, we still
938000	940000	have to achieve the contact
940000	942000	between the atomic and
942000	944000	pure atoms
944000	946000	to form an aqueous bond.
946000	948000	In other words,
948000	950000	the bond between the
950000	952000	atom and the atom
952000	954000	or the metal bond,
954000	956000	etc.
956000	958000	On the other hand,
958000	960000	we can say that
960000	962000	we have introduced
962000	964000	enough deformation
964000	966000	at high temperature
966000	968000	to make it like clay
968000	970000	to stir and form a
970000	972000	interlocking interface structure.
972000	974000	OK.
974000	976000	Here,
976000	978000	we will
978000	980000	make a brief introduction
980000	982000	about solid-state integration.
982000	984000	Traditionally,
984000	986000	the first way of integration
986000	988000	is called expansion integration.
988000	990000	The main principle is to use
990000	992000	high pressure and high temperature
992000	994000	to apply on two objects
994000	996000	that need to be integrated.
996000	998000	With such high temperature and high pressure,
998000	1000000	sufficient time can form
1000000	1002000	a bond.
1002000	1004000	This way of integration
1004000	1006000	can be applied on
1006000	1008000	metal or ceramic
1008000	1010000	or metal or even
1010000	1012000	carbon fiber.
1012000	1014000	But the problem is that
1014000	1016000	the integration time is quite long
1016000	1018000	and requires a higher temperature.
1018000	1020000	At the same time,
1020000	1022000	if the interface passes
1022000	1024000	a high temperature and a long time,
1024000	1026000	it will form an
1026000	1028000	overly complex structure,
1028000	1030000	including metal-based objects,
1030000	1032000	which we mentioned earlier,
1032000	1034000	forming a layer
1034000	1036000	like ceramic,
1036000	1038000	a non-extensible middle layer.
1038000	1040000	This middle layer
1040000	1042000	has a very weak mechanical nature
1042000	1044000	and is not conducive to the overall integration strength.
1044000	1046000	On the other hand,
1046000	1048000	the other
1048000	1050000	is friction-mixing integration.
1050000	1052000	The principle is
1052000	1054000	to use a high-speed
1054000	1056000	rotation
1056000	1058000	weld head
1058000	1060000	directly on the surface
1060000	1062000	to form a high temperature.
1062000	1064000	After the high temperature,
1064000	1066000	the material will gradually soften,
1066000	1068000	but it is not yet at the melting point.
1068000	1070000	So it will be like
1070000	1072000	clay.
1072000	1074000	After it softens,
1074000	1076000	this weld head can be pressed down
1076000	1078000	and then start to move.
1078000	1080000	Then move along
1080000	1082000	the seam between the two.
1082000	1084000	Let the defect of the interface
1084000	1086000	gradually pass through
1086000	1088000	and move and soften.
1088000	1090000	But on the other hand,
1090000	1092000	this material
1092000	1094000	can be used in all kinds of
1094000	1096000	aluminum alloy, aluminum-ferrous alloy,
1096000	1098000	etc. Its application range is quite wide.
1098000	1100000	For example,
1100000	1102000	let's take the
1102000	1104000	Japanese alloy as an example.
1104000	1106000	It mainly uses
1106000	1108000	this type of
1108000	1110000	alloying technology
1110000	1112000	for the
1112000	1114000	combination of
1114000	1116000	interfaces.
1116000	1118000	On the other hand,
1118000	1120000	its shortcomings are
1120000	1122000	that it takes a long time to
1122000	1124000	combine.
1124000	1126000	At the same time,
1126000	1128000	on the other hand,
1128000	1130000	the time it takes to combine
1130000	1132000	also takes a long time to
1132000	1134000	combine.
1134000	1136000	This may be due to the
1136000	1138000	shortcomings of the interface
1138000	1140000	and the shape of the
1140000	1142000	intermetallic alloy.
1142000	1144000	So
1144000	1146000	based on this
1146000	1148000	background,
1148000	1150000	based on this research background,
1150000	1152000	we use another type of
1152000	1154000	alloying technology.
1154000	1156000	This is called ultrasonic welding.
1156000	1158000	The principle of ultrasonic welding
1158000	1160000	may be mentioned earlier.
1160000	1162000	It is a certain degree of pressure
1162000	1164000	on the two overlapping
1164000	1166000	bows.
1166000	1168000	It is about
1168000	1170000	15,000 to 24,000
1170000	1172000	degrees of vibration.
1172000	1174000	Then the interface is friction-heated.
1174000	1176000	In this state,
1176000	1178000	the interface will
1178000	1180000	deform unilaterally.
1180000	1182000	After deformation,
1182000	1184000	it will form a fiber structure
1184000	1186000	that forms a ring.
1186000	1188000	This causes the surface
1188000	1190000	interface to disappear
1190000	1192000	and the welding point to form.
1192000	1194000	In this respect,
1194000	1196000	we believe that
1196000	1198000	it can be used in
1198000	1200000	the future.
1200000	1202000	Because it does not
1202000	1204000	follow the fusion,
1204000	1206000	it will not produce a large amount of
1206000	1208000	intermetallic alloys that are
1208000	1210000	not conducive to mechanical strength.
1210000	1212000	Therefore, it is expected to be
1212000	1214000	used in the future.
1214000	1216000	It can be used in
1216000	1218000	car lightweighting
1218000	1220000	and high-strength composite
1220000	1222000	structure materials manufacturing,
1222000	1224000	etc.
1224000	1226000	Its advantages include
1226000	1228000	lower
1228000	1230000	fusion temperature
1230000	1232000	compared to
1232000	1234000	normal welding.
1234000	1236000	At the same time,
1236000	1238000	its interface friction
1238000	1240000	heat is formed in a
1240000	1242000	relatively small area.
1242000	1244000	The friction heat
1244000	1246000	formed in the small area
1246000	1248000	is relatively small
1248000	1250000	for the overall
1250000	1252000	fiber structure change.
1252000	1254000	In this way,
1254000	1256000	under the strength
1256000	1258000	of the material itself
1258000	1260000	and the machine itself,
1260000	1262000	it can be fully combined
1262000	1264000	to produce a relatively small
1264000	1266000	fiber structure change.
1266000	1268000	This is quite beneficial
1268000	1270000	to the overall manufacturing.
1270000	1272000	On the other hand,
1272000	1274000	the picture on the
1274000	1276000	bottom right is the
1276000	1278000	application of the current
1278000	1280000	superfine wave fusion
1280000	1282000	on the machine-made
1282000	1284000	rolling wheel.
1284000	1286000	In the rolling wheel,
1286000	1288000	it is the high-speed vibration
1288000	1290000	of the water and the
1290000	1292000	friction heat of the interface
1292000	1294000	is formed and the
1294000	1296000	water is transformed
1296000	1298000	into a fusion
1298000	1300000	to carry out
1300000	1302000	the machine-made
1302000	1304000	process.
1304000	1306000	The superfine wave
1306000	1308000	fusion itself is not
1308000	1310000	a relatively new technology.
1310000	1312000	It was first used in the
1312000	1314000	1960s.
1314000	1316000	At first, the main application
1316000	1318000	scene was the
1318000	1320000	printing circuit board
1320000	1322000	and the wiring of
1322000	1324000	various chips.
1324000	1326000	It is a technology
1326000	1328000	often used in
1328000	1330000	circuit board manufacturing.
1330000	1332000	It also uses
1332000	1334000	pressure and vibration
1334000	1336000	to complete the
1336000	1338000	fusion on the machine board.
1338000	1340000	It is a process
1340000	1342000	of pressure and vibration.
1344000	1346000	Combining the main principles,
1346000	1348000	we can make a
1348000	1350000	more detailed introduction.
1350000	1352000	Traditionally,
1352000	1354000	there may be hundreds to thousands
1354000	1356000	of newtons of pressure.
1356000	1358000	After pressing,
1358000	1360000	the two bows
1360000	1362000	will be welded
1362000	1364000	and the base will be fixed.
1364000	1366000	High-speed vibration will begin
1366000	1368000	to form.
1368000	1370000	The vibration is usually
1370000	1372000	about 20 to 60 micrometers
1372000	1374000	per second,
1374000	1376000	which is about
1376000	1378000	15,000 to 24,000
1378000	1380000	per second.
1380000	1382000	In such a short and
1382000	1384000	dense vibration,
1384000	1386000	the interface will
1386000	1388000	generate a lot of deformation
1388000	1390000	and a lot of friction heat
1390000	1392000	will appear.
1392000	1394000	Friction heat and deformation
1394000	1396000	combine to form the interface.
1398000	1400000	In this process,
1400000	1402000	the interface
1402000	1404000	will undergo high-speed
1404000	1406000	deformation.
1406000	1408000	After the deformation,
1408000	1410000	different phenomena such as
1410000	1412000	heat and expansion
1412000	1414000	will appear.
1414000	1416000	Therefore, in so many
1416000	1418000	interfaces,
1418000	1420000	the interface formation mechanism
1420000	1422000	is quite difficult to
1422000	1424000	understand,
1424000	1426000	especially in the case of
1426000	1428000	soft metal materials.
1428000	1430000	In the case of harder materials,
1430000	1432000	such as steel and
1432000	1434000	carbon,
1434000	1436000	it is quite rare
1436000	1438000	to study the formation
1438000	1440000	of the interface mechanism
1440000	1442000	in the scene.
1442000	1444000	Therefore,
1444000	1446000	our main research
1446000	1448000	is on the hard materials.
1448000	1450000	Assuming that
1450000	1452000	we are now
1452000	1454000	progressing to how to
1454000	1456000	use superfine fiber
1456000	1458000	in the application of hard materials,
1458000	1460000	mainly in some
1460000	1462000	advanced research,
1462000	1464000	most of the superfine fiber
1464000	1466000	is used in aluminum alloy
1466000	1468000	or plastic alloy,
1468000	1470000	which is a soft material.
1470000	1472000	The interface will form
1472000	1474000	a different degree of friction flow,
1474000	1476000	that is, after it reaches a high temperature,
1476000	1478000	it will constantly
1478000	1480000	deform and squeeze.
1480000	1482000	The deformation and squeezing process
1482000	1484000	causes a lot of changes
1484000	1486000	in the fiber structure of the interface.
1486000	1488000	However,
1488000	1490000	such a situation will not
1490000	1492000	appear in the human position
1492000	1494000	on the hard material.
1494000	1496000	If you want to combine
1496000	1498000	superfine fiber
1498000	1500000	on a steel
1500000	1502000	with a higher strength,
1502000	1504000	steel, iron, and
1504000	1506000	aluminum alloy,
1506000	1508000	this part needs to be further explored.
1508000	1510000	On the other hand,
1510000	1512000	if it is used in hard materials,
1512000	1514000	the combination of steel and aluminum
1514000	1516000	has been done
1516000	1518000	a lot of advanced research
1518000	1520000	in the superfine fiber combination.
1520000	1522000	They are mainly concentrated
1522000	1524000	in a short time,
1524000	1526000	within a few seconds,
1526000	1528000	they can form
1528000	1530000	about 30 minutes
1530000	1532000	in the expansion combination
1532000	1534000	of superfine fiber
1534000	1536000	and intermetallics.
1536000	1538000	Such a combination
1538000	1540000	is not conducive
1540000	1542000	to the mechanical properties
1542000	1544000	mentioned earlier.
1544000	1546000	Most of the research
1546000	1548000	focuses on this later stage
1548000	1550000	of superfine fiber
1550000	1552000	formation.
1552000	1554000	On the other hand,
1554000	1556000	in the early days,
1556000	1558000	the material was friction
1558000	1560000	and deformed after friction.
1560000	1562000	How will the formation
1562000	1564000	of intermetallics
1564000	1566000	evolve?
1566000	1568000	This mechanism
1568000	1570000	is relatively rare.
1570000	1572000	However, this part is also true.
1572000	1574000	The application of superfine fiber
1574000	1576000	in the combination of steel
1576000	1578000	and aluminum has a significant
1578000	1580000	impact.
1582000	1584000	We mainly
1584000	1586000	understand
1586000	1588000	how to use superfine fiber
1588000	1590000	in the superfine fiber
1590000	1592000	combination
1592000	1594000	situation.
1594000	1596000	This is divided into two parts.
1596000	1598000	The first one
1598000	1600000	will be divided into
1600000	1602000	the phenomenon of
1602000	1604000	no interface reaction
1604000	1606000	when combined.
1606000	1608000	On the other hand,
1608000	1610000	we will use another type of
1610000	1612000	metal combination
1612000	1614000	to discuss
1614000	1616000	how to combine
1616000	1618000	superfine fiber
1618000	1620000	in the superfine fiber
1620000	1622000	combination situation.
1622000	1624000	The first part
1624000	1626000	is to understand
1626000	1628000	how to combine
1628000	1630000	superfine fiber
1630000	1632000	in the superfine fiber
1632000	1634000	combination situation.
1634000	1636000	We will use steel and aluminum.
1636000	1638000	Why do we use steel and aluminum?
1638000	1640000	The main purpose is that
1640000	1642000	there is no interface reaction
1642000	1644000	between the two,
1644000	1646000	so it is difficult
1646000	1648000	to analyze the interface.
1648000	1650000	As a comparison,
1650000	1652000	we use steel and aluminum to combine.
1652000	1654000	On the other hand,
1654000	1656000	from the previous principle introduction,
1656000	1658000	it can be known that
1658000	1660000	only high-speed friction
1660000	1662000	will cause interface contact.
1662000	1664000	The depth of the contact point
1664000	1666000	and the roughness of the material surface
1666000	1668000	have a significant impact.
1668000	1670000	This research
1670000	1672000	is not enough.
1672000	1674000	On the other hand,
1674000	1676000	one part of the research
1676000	1678000	also focuses on the roughness of the surface
1678000	1680000	and the impact on the strength of the combination.
1680000	1682000	On the other hand,
1682000	1684000	because we have to use steel
1684000	1686000	and other materials to combine,
1686000	1688000	the mechanical performance of steel
1688000	1690000	such as hardness and strength
1690000	1692000	and other changes
1692000	1694000	will also affect the nature of the combination.
1694000	1696000	Therefore, the hardness of the iron itself
1696000	1698000	and the different microstructures
1698000	1700000	will also have an impact
1700000	1702000	.
1702000	1704000	On the other hand,
1704000	1706000	this part is the combination of hard materials
1706000	1708000	such as steel and aluminum, steel and titanium, etc.
1708000	1710000	Why choose these two combinations?
1710000	1712000	Mainly because the two
1712000	1714000	aluminum and titanium have different
1714000	1716000	deformation capabilities at high temperatures.
1716000	1718000	Therefore, when we plan to explore
1718000	1720000	the origin of the combination,
1720000	1722000	what impact
1722000	1724000	these two different materials
1724000	1726000	and their deformation capabilities
1726000	1728000	have on the combination of the two?
1728000	1730000	Because of time,
1730000	1732000	we will directly enter the
1732000	1734000	experimental step.
1734000	1736000	First of all, it is the combination of steel and aluminum
1736000	1738000	to form the interface.
1738000	1740000	The material we use
1740000	1742000	is a non-metallic atomic steel,
1742000	1744000	which is a relatively soft
1744000	1746000	medium-strength steel
1746000	1748000	and a pure aluminum plate
1748000	1750000	as a research subject.
1750000	1752000	On the surface,
1752000	1754000	we will use
1754000	1756000	a mirror-surfacer
1756000	1758000	to measure the roughness
1758000	1760000	of the surface.
1760000	1762000	Next,
1762000	1764000	we use a superfine grain
1764000	1766000	to make a superfine grain
1766000	1768000	combination.
1768000	1770000	The main combination condition
1770000	1772000	is that we use a pressure
1772000	1774000	of about 2000 newtons,
1774000	1776000	which is applied to
1776000	1778000	about 10 times the
1778000	1780000	power of the steel head,
1780000	1782000	which is accompanied by
1782000	1784000	about 20,000 times of vibration
1784000	1786000	. The combination time
1786000	1788000	is about 0.01 seconds
1788000	1790000	to 2.0 seconds.
1790000	1792000	After completing the
1792000	1794000	superfine grain combination,
1794000	1796000	the next step is to
1796000	1798000	stretch the time to judge the
1798000	1800000	strength of the combination.
1800000	1802000	After the stretching is broken,
1802000	1804000	suppose that it is broken on the interface,
1804000	1806000	we will observe the electronic
1806000	1808000	microscope and
1808000	1810000	analyze the microstructure.
1810000	1812000	On the other hand,
1812000	1814000	if it is not suitable for
1814000	1816000	stretching time, we will prepare
1816000	1818000	another batch of samples that have not yet been stretched.
1818000	1820000	After the
1820000	1822000	two halves are cut in half,
1822000	1824000	the surface is exposed
1824000	1826000	and the
1826000	1828000	electronic microscope
1828000	1830000	and the back image electronic
1830000	1832000	3D EBSD are observed
1832000	1834000	to observe the image
1834000	1836000	and the
1836000	1838000	deformation of the interface.
1838000	1840000	First of
1840000	1842000	all, suppose the
1844000	1846000	steel head is used,
1846000	1848000	made of steel and iron,
1848000	1850000	and the iron plate using
1850000	1852000	superfine media
1852000	1854000	on the interface can
1854000	1856000	be seen for the
1856000	1858000	angle of integration,
1858000	1860000	the combination time
1860000	1862000	against the middle is
1862000	1864000	stressed.
1864000	1866000	Its crystal here
1866000	1868000	is about
1868000	1870000	2,000 newtons,
1870000	1872000	which is enough
1872000	1874000	to break the
1874000	1876000	IF steel,
1876000	1878000	that is, the
1878000	1880000	infinite-sphere atomic steel itself.
1880000	1882000	It is greater than the strength of the steel itself.
1882000	1884000	On the other hand,
1884000	1886000	if we compare it with other
1886000	1888000	integrations,
1888000	1890000	such as the expansion integration
1890000	1892000	using iron and iron,
1892000	1894000	it requires a relatively long
1894000	1896000	time, which is about 50 seconds,
1896000	1898000	and requires a certain degree of
1898000	1900000	high temperature.
1900000	1902000	In this case,
1902000	1904000	if we compare it with the
1904000	1906000	microstructure of the interface,
1906000	1908000	its interface deformation
1908000	1910000	is quite concentrated,
1910000	1912000	about only 10 micrometers
1912000	1914000	before and after.
1914000	1916000	On the other hand,
1916000	1918000	if we compare it with the
1918000	1920000	friction-mixing-combination FSW,
1920000	1922000	its deformation is greater,
1922000	1924000	about 15 to 20
1924000	1926000	micrometers.
1926000	1928000	At the same time, it is accompanied by a very severe deformation.
1928000	1930000	Such severe deformation
1930000	1932000	is reliable to the welding point itself.
1932000	1934000	That is to say,
1934000	1936000	its durability is
1936000	1938000	also a subject to
1938000	1940000	consider.
1940000	1942000	Therefore,
1942000	1944000	the superfine-mixing-combination
1944000	1946000	can be done in a short time
1946000	1948000	without a lot of deformation
1948000	1950000	to complete the
1950000	1952000	superfine-mixing-combination.
1952000	1954000	On the other hand,
1954000	1956000	if it is used on
1956000	1958000	the interface of iron and iron
1958000	1960000	and iron and nickel,
1962000	1964000	this part
1964000	1966000	is that we did
1966000	1968000	electronic microscope
1968000	1970000	and EBSD analysis
1970000	1972000	and found that the
1972000	1974000	formation of the interface
1974000	1976000	will form such a
1976000	1978000	small friction particle.
1978000	1980000	This friction particle will gradually increase
1980000	1982000	and at the same time be accompanied by friction
1982000	1984000	to friction the upper and lower
1984000	1986000	nickel and iron body.
1986000	1988000	After enough time
1988000	1990000	and temperature, it will
1990000	1992000	gradually be compressed.
1992000	1994000	After the compression,
1994000	1996000	it will produce severe deformation
1996000	1998000	and spread to the entire
1998000	2000000	interface to complete
2000000	2002000	the formation of the interface.
2002000	2004000	At the same time,
2004000	2006000	it is accompanied by
2006000	2008000	this
2008000	2010000	seam,
2010000	2012000	the seam and
2014000	2016000	the segment.
2016000	2018000	If
2018000	2020000	there is enough time,
2020000	2022000	it is
2022000	2024000	superfine-mixing-combination
2024000	2026000	can form enough
2026000	2028000	partial and
2028000	2030000	severe shrinkage deformation.
2030000	2032000	It can be completed in a short time.
2032000	2034000	On the other hand,
2034000	2036000	superfine-mixing-combination
2036000	2038000	is the surface.
2038000	2040000	On the other hand,
2040000	2042000	if we use a thicker
2042000	2044000	seam, the time of
2044000	2046000	combining will be shorter.
2046000	2048000	The time of shrinkage will be longer.
2048000	2050000	Why does it get longer?
2050000	2052000	If it is a thick seam,
2052000	2054000	it will form a thicker
2054000	2056000	and larger
2058000	2060000	seam, such as
2060000	2062000	seam seam and seam seam.
2062000	2064000	In this way,
2064000	2066000	how do I compress
2066000	2068000	these three peaks and three valleys?
2068000	2070000	It takes a longer time and
2070000	2072000	pressure to compress it
2072000	2074000	to form the interface and
2074000	2076000	form the friction force
2076000	2078000	to form more combining time.
2078000	2080000	Therefore,
2080000	2082000	a slightly smoother
2082000	2084000	combination interface
2084000	2086000	does not have any
2086000	2088000	pollutants or oxidants
2088000	2090000	at the same time.
2090000	2092000	What about the type of steel itself?
2092000	2094000	Assuming that it is replaced,
2094000	2096000	because what we mentioned earlier
2096000	2098000	is that it uses
2098000	2100000	relatively
2100000	2102000	average fiber structure
2102000	2104000	ferrite
2104000	2106000	IF steel.
2106000	2108000	Next, we will use
2108000	2110000	polyester
2110000	2112000	and ferrite
2112000	2114000	neutral carbon steel
2114000	2116000	and 14% nickel steel.
2116000	2118000	There is also 0.08%
2118000	2120000	low carbon steel.
2120000	2122000	Their hardness and
2122000	2124000	microstructure, we will make a
2124000	2126000	more detailed
2126000	2128000	comparison.
2132000	2134000	This part is the
2134000	2136000	ferrite itself.
2136000	2138000	In addition to the
2138000	2140000	IF steel used at the beginning,
2140000	2142000	we also prepared different types of steel.
2142000	2144000	Here,
2144000	2146000	ferrite, porcelain steel, and
2146000	2148000	martensite steel have different hardness.
2148000	2150000	As the hardness increases,
2150000	2152000	the combination strength
2152000	2154000	is getting lower and lower.
2154000	2156000	Compared to the beginning,
2156000	2158000	nickel and IF steel only need
2158000	2160000	2 seconds to combine.
2160000	2162000	On the other hand,
2162000	2164000	neutral carbon steel, including
2164000	2166000	ferrite and ferrite,
2166000	2168000	takes about 5 seconds to
2168000	2170000	combine.
2170000	2172000	On the other hand,
2172000	2174000	once the hardness is higher,
2174000	2176000	about 200 to 300 hardness
2176000	2178000	martensite steel,
2178000	2180000	it takes longer to combine.
2180000	2182000	Why do we have
2182000	2184000	different situations?
2184000	2186000	We analyzed the interface
2186000	2188000	and found that
2188000	2190000	for the same steel photo,
2190000	2192000	the bottom is
2192000	2194000	porcelain steel, the bottom left is
2194000	2196000	porcelain steel, and the bottom right is ferrite.
2196000	2198000	Ferrite and nickel will form
2198000	2200000	more friction resistance.
2200000	2202000	This friction resistance has a larger
2202000	2204000	coefficient of friction resistance.
2204000	2206000	On the other hand,
2206000	2208000	ferrite and nickel
2208000	2210000	have relatively low deformation.
2210000	2212000	At the same time,
2212000	2214000	there are still
2214000	2216000	interface defects.
2216000	2218000	That is to say,
2218000	2220000	in a harder steel,
2220000	2222000	it takes a long time to
2222000	2224000	complete the combination.
2224000	2226000	At the same time,
2226000	2228000	we can get
2228000	2230000	a conclusion that
2230000	2232000	ferrite and nickel have
2232000	2234000	relatively similar hardness.
2234000	2236000	On the other hand,
2236000	2238000	ferrite and nickel have
2238000	2240000	relatively similar hardness.
2240000	2242000	It can provide more
2242000	2244000	deformation.
2244000	2246000	Such large-scale deformation
2246000	2248000	is conducive to the rise of
2248000	2250000	the combination strength.
2250000	2252000	This part is
2252000	2254000	the friction
2254000	2256000	generated by the
2256000	2258000	combination.
2258000	2260000	There are different mechanisms.
2260000	2262000	The main difference is
2262000	2264000	the friction between
2264000	2266000	ferrite and nickel.
2266000	2268000	The main difference between the two
2268000	2270000	is that the interface
2270000	2272000	on the ferrite and nickel
2272000	2274000	will form
2274000	2276000	something like a friction resistance.
2276000	2278000	On the other hand,
2278000	2280000	if it is nickel,
2280000	2282000	in the case of nickel,
2282000	2284000	the harder material
2284000	2286000	will be
2286000	2288000	deformed
2288000	2290000	in the ferrite material
2290000	2292000	and form a friction resistance.
2292000	2294000	In other words,
2294000	2296000	such a situation
2296000	2298000	occurs when the hardness
2298000	2300000	gap is relatively large,
2300000	2302000	such as ferrite and nickel.
2302000	2304000	In other words,
2304000	2306000	the first part of our
2306000	2308000	conclusion can be concentrated
2308000	2310000	in the appearance of
2310000	2312000	friction resistance particles
2312000	2314000	with a relatively large
2314000	2316000	friction resistance.
2316000	2318000	On the other hand,
2318000	2320000	if it is ferrite and nickel,
2320000	2322000	the friction loss
2322000	2324000	in the ferrite itself
2324000	2326000	will take longer
2326000	2328000	to eliminate
2328000	2330000	such interface defects
2330000	2332000	to complete the
2332000	2334000	combined formation.
2334000	2336000	The second part
2336000	2338000	is the
2338000	2340000	combination strength.
2340000	2342000	In other words,
2342000	2344000	in the case of a reaction,
2344000	2346000	the combined interface
2346000	2348000	is formed.
2348000	2350000	As mentioned earlier,
2350000	2352000	we skip this part.
2352000	2354000	In other words,
2354000	2356000	at the initial stage,
2356000	2358000	before the bonding structure
2358000	2360000	is formed,
2360000	2362000	how does the combined interface
2362000	2364000	develop?
2364000	2366000	This is the part
2366000	2368000	to be discussed.
2368000	2370000	First of all,
2370000	2372000	in the case of ferrite and nickel,
2372000	2374000	we use the
2374000	2376000	traditionally mentioned
2376000	2378000	IF steel and 5000-gram aluminum alloy.
2378000	2380000	Then we
2380000	2382000	do superimposed bonding.
2382000	2384000	In the process of bonding,
2384000	2386000	we will stick a thermocouple
2386000	2388000	on the interface to measure
2388000	2390000	the temperature of the bonding structure.
2390000	2392000	The picture on the right shows
2392000	2394000	the change in strength and time.
2394000	2396000	It can be clearly seen that
2396000	2398000	before 0.5 seconds,
2398000	2400000	the combined strength was very weak
2400000	2402000	and could not be measured.
2402000	2404000	After 1 second,
2404000	2406000	the combined strength rose rapidly
2406000	2408000	to 2.5 seconds,
2408000	2410000	and the bonding was completed.
2410000	2412000	At the same time,
2412000	2414000	it gradually decreased
2414000	2416000	due to the serious deformation
2416000	2418000	of the aluminum itself,
2418000	2420000	resulting in the fracture
2420000	2422000	in the aluminum.
2424000	2426000	Why is there such a change?
2426000	2428000	We can see that
2428000	2430000	if we
2430000	2432000	combine the temperature changes
2432000	2434000	here,
2434000	2436000	it rises very rapidly
2436000	2438000	at the initial temperature,
2438000	2440000	and it can reach
2440000	2442000	about 400 degrees in about 1 second.
2442000	2444000	Here, we have
2444000	2446000	compared it with the previous study,
2446000	2448000	and found that the temperature obtained
2448000	2450000	in 1 second is about 400 degrees.
2450000	2452000	Once it exceeds 400 degrees,
2452000	2454000	the aluminum itself
2454000	2456000	will shrink
2456000	2458000	and its deformable ability
2458000	2460000	will increase rapidly,
2460000	2462000	which is enough to
2462000	2464000	remove the defect of the interface
2464000	2466000	and combine it.
2466000	2468000	On the other hand,
2468000	2470000	we used the electronic microscope
2470000	2472000	to observe its interface
2472000	2474000	and found that as time went by,
2474000	2476000	it was indeed about 1.1 seconds
2476000	2478000	that the interface became sticky
2478000	2480000	and the defect was concentrated in the aluminum.
2480000	2482000	As time went by,
2482000	2484000	the interface was gradually completed,
2484000	2486000	and the defect on this side of the aluminum
2486000	2488000	gradually disappeared,
2488000	2490000	and it took 2.5 seconds
2490000	2492000	to complete a fully integrated interface.
2492000	2494000	As time went by,
2494000	2496000	the interface became
2496000	2498000	more and more sticky.
2498000	2500000	Therefore,
2500000	2502000	we can categorize
2502000	2504000	the whole phenomenon here.
2504000	2506000	At the beginning of the integration,
2506000	2508000	the factor of
2508000	2510000	the strength being too low
2510000	2512000	caused the aluminum to be friction,
2512000	2514000	and it will break off from the aluminum
2514000	2516000	and attach to the iron side
2516000	2518000	and the IF steel side.
2518000	2520000	As time goes by,
2520000	2522000	the aluminum itself
2522000	2524000	has enough deformable ability at high temperature,
2524000	2526000	it will gradually be compressed
2526000	2528000	and the defect can
2528000	2530000	gradually disappear to complete the integration.
2530000	2532000	OK.
2532000	2534000	The other part
2534000	2536000	is the combination of iron and titanium.
2536000	2538000	The reason why we
2538000	2540000	use titanium
2540000	2542000	is that the deformation ability of
2542000	2544000	titanium itself at high temperature
2544000	2546000	is not as obvious as aluminum.
2546000	2548000	On the other hand,
2548000	2550000	some basic
2550000	2552000	physics concepts
2552000	2554000	may know that titanium is a hexagon.
2554000	2556000	If the hexagon is deformed
2556000	2558000	and subjected to friction,
2558000	2560000	it will have a lot of defects,
2560000	2562000	so it is a metal
2562000	2564000	that has relatively little extension ability.
2564000	2566000	In this way,
2566000	2568000	the superhexagon
2568000	2570000	can be found
2570000	2572000	under the similar conditions
2572000	2574000	mentioned earlier.
2574000	2576000	Before 2 seconds,
2576000	2578000	the strength of the integration
2578000	2580000	gradually reaches a platform,
2580000	2582000	which is a stable state.
2582000	2584000	But after 2 seconds,
2584000	2586000	the strength of the integration
2586000	2588000	has increased dramatically
2588000	2590000	during 2 seconds to 2.5 seconds.
2590000	2592000	Why does this happen?
2592000	2594000	At first,
2594000	2596000	we think that
2596000	2598000	after 2 seconds,
2598000	2600000	we will find that
2600000	2602000	once it exceeds 600 degrees,
2602000	2604000	it may produce
2604000	2606000	the hexagon of iron and titanium
2606000	2608000	on the left.
2608000	2610000	On the hexagon,
2610000	2612000	you can see that
2612000	2614000	there is a lower point of contact here.
2614000	2616000	At this point of contact,
2616000	2618000	it will be found that
2618000	2620000	once the iron has a certain degree of
2620000	2622000	about 15 to 20%
2622000	2624000	, it will produce the hexagon.
2624000	2626000	That is to say,
2626000	2628000	from the original HCP type
2628000	2630000	to the BCC type,
2630000	2632000	BCC's beta type.
2632000	2634000	BCC's deformation ability
2634000	2636000	is that
2636000	2638000	the deformation ability of the
2638000	2640000	BCC is better than
2640000	2642000	the HCP of the hexagon
2642000	2644000	and the most dense hexagon.
2644000	2646000	In the next step,
2646000	2648000	in order to verify
2648000	2650000	our assumption,
2650000	2652000	we observed the interface
2652000	2654000	and found that
2654000	2656000	at about 2.0 seconds,
2656000	2658000	the interface will
2658000	2660000	break off
2660000	2662000	on the side of the
2662000	2664000	machine itself and stick
2664000	2666000	to the side of the iron.
2666000	2668000	After 2 seconds,
2668000	2670000	up to 2.5 seconds,
2670000	2672000	the interface's
2672000	2674000	original gap
2674000	2676000	will disappear
2676000	2678000	and become
2678000	2680000	a hole.
2680000	2682000	As time goes by,
2682000	2684000	these holes will gradually disappear.
2684000	2686000	So,
2686000	2688000	up to 3 seconds
2688000	2690000	can complete the interface.
2690000	2692000	Compared to the expansion
2692000	2694000	interface mentioned earlier,
2694000	2696000	it usually takes
2696000	2698000	about 1 to 2 hours
2698000	2700000	to complete the interface
2700000	2702000	of iron and iron type.
2702000	2704000	On the other hand,
2704000	2706000	if you use a transverse interface,
2706000	2708000	you will find that
2708000	2710000	after about 2.0 seconds,
2710000	2712000	it will appear again and again.
2712000	2714000	Why does this happen?
2714000	2716000	As mentioned earlier,
2716000	2718000	the initial interface
2718000	2720000	is still an alpha type
2720000	2722000	of the hexagon machine at 2.0 seconds.
2722000	2724000	On the other hand,
2724000	2726000	as time increases to 2.5 seconds,
2726000	2728000	it will form
2728000	2730000	such a BCC
2730000	2732000	structure beta type
2732000	2734000	when the temperature
2734000	2736000	is high enough
2736000	2738000	to make the gap
2738000	2740000	disappear.
2740000	2742000	Therefore,
2742000	2744000	we can conclude that
2744000	2746000	BCC type has the
2746000	2748000	power to
2748000	2750000	combine the interface.
2750000	2752000	Therefore,
2752000	2754000	the summary of the second part
2754000	2756000	of the interface
2756000	2758000	is mainly here.
2758000	2760000	Here you can see that
2760000	2762000	it only takes about 450 degrees
2762000	2764000	On the other hand,
2764000	2766000	if you use iron and type,
2766000	2768000	type takes longer.
2768000	2770000	Why? Because it needs
2770000	2772000	a temperature of more than 600 degrees
2772000	2774000	with the expansion of iron
2774000	2776000	to complete the interface.
2776000	2778000	The method of completing the interface
2778000	2780000	is to convert type from the
2780000	2782000	original alpha to beta type.
2782000	2784000	Therefore, the last part
2784000	2786000	is the summary of this speech.
2788000	2790000	Here we mainly
2790000	2792000	talk about the first part.
2792000	2794000	In the similar hard material
2794000	2796000	combination, we will find
2796000	2798000	such a BCC.
2798000	2800000	BCC can provide greater
2800000	2802000	partial deformation,
2802000	2804000	and at the same time,
2804000	2806000	the combination can be completed
2806000	2808000	in about 2 seconds.
2808000	2810000	On the other hand,
2810000	2812000	if you use a harder material
2812000	2814000	such as porcelain, iron,
2814000	2816000	or martensite,
2816000	2818000	it will damage the internal structure
2818000	2820000	and cause such a defect to disappear.
2820000	2822000	On the other hand,
2822000	2824000	a smoother combination is
2824000	2826000	conducive to integration.
2826000	2828000	At the same time,
2828000	2830000	if you use a more
2830000	2832000	similar hard material,
2832000	2834000	it is also conducive to
2834000	2836000	the increase in the intensity of the integration.
2836000	2838000	On the other hand,
2838000	2840000	if it is a hard material,
2840000	2842000	we must consider
2842000	2844000	the enough deformation ability
2844000	2846000	to introduce deformation.
2846000	2848000	These are the interesting points
2848000	2850000	that have been discovered
2850000	2852000	so far.
2856000	2858000	In this speech,
2858000	2860000	we have mentioned
2860000	2862000	that in the combination,
2862000	2864000	we will produce rapid and large-scale deformations,
2864000	2866000	and there will also be
2866000	2868000	contact friction damage,
2868000	2870000	or metal decomposition,
2870000	2872000	and image transformation, etc.
2872000	2874000	What we have learned
2874000	2876000	is that in the future,
2876000	2878000	we expect to apply
2878000	2880000	the multi-component composite material
2880000	2882000	to structure manufacturing
2882000	2884000	or further 3D metal decomposition.
2884000	2886000	OK
2886000	2888000	That's the main part of
2888000	2890000	today's speech.
2890000	2892000	Thank you.
2892000	2894000	Thank you.
2898000	2900000	It's a very interesting speech.
2900000	2902000	Now it's Q&A time.
2904000	2906000	We can ask
2906000	2908000	because there are
2908000	2910000	two questions
2910000	2912000	in the chat box.
2912000	2914000	We can ask Kunyan
2914000	2916000	to use
2916000	2918000	your microphone
2918000	2920000	to ask your questions.
2920000	2922000	OK
2922000	2924000	The first question is
2924000	2926000	how do you measure the temperature and heat
2926000	2928000	of your composite?
2928000	2930000	Traditionally, I use
2930000	2932000	thermal electric heating.
2932000	2934000	If you can see me,
2934000	2936000	I'm welding at the edge of the material.
2936000	2938000	Wait a minute.
2942000	2944000	I use this method
2944000	2946000	to weld at the edge of the material itself.
2946000	2948000	At the edge,
2948000	2950000	it is subjected to direct pressure
2950000	2952000	from the welding head.
2952000	2954000	Under the pressure,
2954000	2956000	it can be guaranteed that
2956000	2958000	although the combined temperature
2958000	2960000	is the middle one,
2960000	2962000	the heat of the metal interface
2962000	2964000	will disappear immediately
2964000	2966000	after the welding is over?
2966000	2968000	Will it disappear immediately?
2968000	2970000	Or will it remain the same?
2970000	2972000	Under its condition,
2972000	2974000	the thermal profile
2974000	2976000	can be seen.
2976000	2978000	That is,
2978000	2980000	after the combined time
2980000	2982000	is over,
2982000	2984000	it will be about 1000 degrees
2984000	2986000	per second.
2986000	2988000	Why is it so fast?
2988000	2990000	Because once the welding is over,
2990000	2992000	it is touched
2992000	2994000	by the welding head
2994000	2996000	and the base.
2996000	2998000	This kind of contact will make
2998000	3000000	the heat dissipation very fast.
3000000	3002000	Yes, I understand.
3002000	3004000	One more question.
3004000	3006000	You just mentioned
3006000	3008000	that
3008000	3010000	the combination of
3010000	3012000	alpha and theta
3012000	3014000	changes to beta and theta.
3014000	3016000	But if your cooling speed
3016000	3018000	is so fast,
3018000	3020000	is your interface
3020000	3022000	pure beta titanium
3022000	3024000	or will it produce martensite?
3026000	3028000	In fact,
3028000	3030000	this picture at 3.0 seconds
3030000	3032000	actually forms
3032000	3034000	a martensite structure.
3034000	3036000	It is a Weissmannian structure.
3036000	3038000	It is formed by alpha and beta
3038000	3040000	passing through.
3040000	3042000	Under extreme cold conditions,
3042000	3044000	it forms a martensite structure
3044000	3046000	like this.
3046000	3048000	On the other hand,
3048000	3050000	why doesn't it
3050000	3052000	form such a transition structure?
3052000	3054000	Mainly because iron
3054000	3056000	also expands at high temperatures.
3056000	3058000	After expanding to the side of theta,
3058000	3060000	we actually analyzed it.
3060000	3062000	We found that there is about
3062000	3064000	5-10% iron in it.
3064000	3066000	This iron
3066000	3068000	is a beta-theta stabilizer.
3068000	3070000	This was also mentioned
3070000	3072000	in the preliminary study.
3072000	3074000	OK.
3076000	3078000	Thank you.
3078000	3080000	Can we ask
3080000	3082000	Y.H. Guo
3082000	3084000	to explain your question?
3084000	3086000	OK.
3086000	3088000	I'm more of an application person.
3088000	3090000	Can you hear me?
3090000	3092000	I can hear you.
3092000	3094000	I'm more of an application person.
3094000	3096000	But there are also people in my lab
3096000	3098000	working on materials.
3098000	3100000	So I understand
3100000	3102000	that it may be a practical
3102000	3104000	application issue.
3104000	3106000	First of all,
3106000	3108000	I mentioned the AM part.
3108000	3110000	I'm more curious about
3110000	3112000	the AM part.
3112000	3114000	Is it locked in any application?
3116000	3118000	For the AM application,
3118000	3120000	we are working on
3120000	3122000	lightweight...
3122000	3124000	Traditionally...
3124000	3126000	In the preliminary study,
3126000	3128000	they didn't mention
3128000	3130000	the AM part in detail.
3130000	3132000	But the possibility
3132000	3134000	is that
3134000	3136000	the AM application
3136000	3138000	is made
3138000	3140000	from super-thin-waves
3140000	3142000	combined with
3142000	3144000	aluminum alloy
3144000	3146000	and copper.
3146000	3148000	After forming
3148000	3150000	such a composite structure,
3150000	3152000	it will be cut.
3152000	3154000	In this way,
3154000	3156000	the super-thin-waves
3156000	3158000	will be cut.
3158000	3160000	It's like
3160000	3162000	creating a composite structure.
3162000	3164000	Yes.
3164000	3166000	In the end,
3166000	3168000	it will be cut.
3168000	3170000	But in this way,
3170000	3172000	the material consumption
3172000	3174000	will not be as much as
3174000	3176000	traditional CNC cutting.
3176000	3178000	OK.
3178000	3180000	And...
3180000	3182000	In your conclusion,
3182000	3184000	you mentioned
3184000	3186000	the super-thin-waves.
3186000	3188000	I'm more curious about
3188000	3190000	how thin it should be
3190000	3192000	to be good enough.
3192000	3194000	Because it will affect
3194000	3196000	the smoothness of the
3196000	3198000	manufacturing process.
3198000	3200000	Yes.
3200000	3202000	For the super-thin-waves,
3202000	3204000	we want to provide
3204000	3206000	a very flat surface.
3206000	3208000	Because it's flat,
3208000	3210000	once two blades
3210000	3212000	are pressed together,
3212000	3214000	the contact point of the interface
3214000	3216000	is not enough.
3216000	3218000	Here, I use
3218000	3220000	a relatively flat surface.
3220000	3222000	The RASA is about
3222000	3224000	0.1 microns.
3224000	3226000	OK.
3226000	3228000	0.1 microns.
3228000	3230000	Yes.
3230000	3232000	But this is the result of
3232000	3234000	oxidized aluminum powder.
3234000	3236000	We didn't do it for a long time.
3236000	3238000	About 10 to 20 seconds.
3238000	3240000	The surface is really smooth.
3240000	3242000	OK.
3242000	3244000	And...
3244000	3246000	You mentioned that
3246000	3248000	aluminum and iron
3248000	3250000	don't mix.
3250000	3252000	Is that right?
3252000	3254000	Yes.
3254000	3256000	I understand.
3256000	3258000	Yes.
3258000	3260000	Aluminum and iron
3260000	3262000	don't mix.
3262000	3264000	Aluminum and iron
3264000	3266000	don't mix.
3266000	3268000	Aluminum and iron
3268000	3270000	are oxidized.
3270000	3272000	Aluminum and iron
3274000	3276000	meet.
3276000	3278000	Aluminum and iron
3278000	3280000	are oxidized.
3280000	3282000	Aluminum and iron
3284000	3286000	are oxidized.
3286000	3288000	Aluminum and iron
3288000	3290000	are oxidized.
3348000	3350000	Aluminum and iron
3350000	3352000	are oxidized.
3352000	3354000	Aluminum and iron
3356000	3358000	are oxidized.
3358000	3360000	Aluminum and iron
3364000	3366000	are oxidized.
3368000	3370000	Aluminum and iron
3372000	3374000	are oxidized.
3374000	3376000	Aluminum and iron
3378000	3380000	are oxidized.
3382000	3384000	Aluminum and iron
3388000	3390000	are oxidized.
3392000	3394000	Aluminum and iron
3394000	3396000	are oxidized.
3398000	3400000	Aluminum and iron
3402000	3404000	are oxidized.
3404000	3406000	Ningnew
3408000	3410000	are oxidized.
3412000	3414000	Sorry,
3414000	3416000	I have a question.
3416000	3418000	I made a video
3418000	3420000	with
3420000	3422000	Laser Metal 3D
3422000	3424000	Laser Metal 3D
3424000	3426000	When they were scanning
3426000	3428000	the metal powder,
3428000	3430000	it was a bit like melting.
3430000	3432000	They used a welding machine.
3432000	3434000	I'm curious.
3434000	3436000	When I made that video,
3436000	3438000	you mentioned that
3438000	3440000	there are oxidization problems.
3442000	3444000	Will aluminum oxidize
3444000	3446000	in your research?
3446000	3448000	Will aluminum oxidize
3448000	3450000	in your research?
3450000	3452000	In fact,
3452000	3454000	in most cases,
3454000	3456000	aluminum oxidizes
3456000	3458000	after grinding.
3458000	3460000	We will measure the thickness of the oxidizing film.
3460000	3462000	The thickness of the oxidizing film
3462000	3464000	may be less than 100 nanometers.
3464000	3466000	It doesn't affect
3466000	3468000	our research.
3468000	3470000	You can see that
3470000	3472000	we focus on
3472000	3474000	SEM.
3474000	3476000	SEM is a few microns ahead and behind.
3476000	3478000	In this case, we didn't see
3478000	3480000	any obvious oxidization.
3480000	3482000	About oxidization research,
3482000	3484000	there are a lot of advanced research.
3484000	3486000	They use a small-density analysis method.
3488000	3490000	So this method
3490000	3492000	doesn't need to be done in a non-oxidized environment.
3492000	3494000	In fact, it doesn't need to be done in a non-oxidized environment.
3494000	3496000	Why?
3496000	3498000	Because after high-temperature bonding,
3498000	3500000	it doesn't affect
3500000	3502000	the atmosphere
3502000	3504000	in the middle of the bonding point.
3504000	3506000	Therefore,
3506000	3508000	when we cut it in half
3508000	3510000	and look at the interface analysis,
3510000	3512000	we found that there was no obvious oxidization.
3512000	3514000	OK.
3514000	3516000	If there is, it's all micro-density.
3516000	3518000	It has to go to PPM,
3518000	3520000	such as using atomic carbon
3520000	3522000	OK.
3522000	3524000	Got it.
3524000	3526000	Thank you.
3526000	3528000	Thank you.
3528000	3530000	Can we ask Matt Sly
3530000	3532000	to ask you a question?
3532000	3534000	Hello.
3534000	3536000	Thank you for
3536000	3538000	your wonderful speech.
3538000	3540000	I have three questions.
3540000	3542000	First, you said that
3542000	3544000	IMC has an impact on strength.
3544000	3546000	I want to know
3546000	3548000	how to define
3548000	3550000	its impact on strength.
3550000	3552000	Since IMC can form bonding,
3552000	3554000	its strength should be stronger.
3554000	3556000	Why is its strength
3556000	3558000	not good?
3558000	3560000	Yes.
3560000	3562000	Regarding the strength of IMC,
3562000	3564000	we have established it
3564000	3566000	in a more basic concept.
3566000	3568000	Traditionally,
3568000	3570000	thick IMCs
3570000	3572000	usually form a large amount of IMCs
3572000	3574000	at high temperatures.
3574000	3576000	A large amount of IMCs
3576000	3578000	has a negative effect.
3578000	3580000	On the other hand,
3580000	3582000	if we
3582000	3584000	control the bonding conditions
3584000	3586000	precisely,
3586000	3588000	it can form
3588000	3590000	a more detailed IMC image.
3590000	3592000	On the other hand,
3592000	3594000	it has a better impact
3594000	3596000	on the bonding strength.
3596000	3598000	This diagram
3598000	3600000	shows that
3600000	3602000	IMC thickness
3602000	3604000	has an impact on bonding strength.
3604000	3606000	However,
3606000	3608000	if it is too thick,
3608000	3610000	its bonding strength will decrease.
3612000	3614000	I see.
3614000	3616000	The second question is
3616000	3618000	you just mentioned
3618000	3620000	the roughness.
3620000	3622000	Basically,
3622000	3624000	the whole technology
3624000	3626000	requires some roughness
3626000	3628000	on the surface.
3628000	3630000	When you have high temperatures,
3630000	3632000	it can melt the surface
3632000	3634000	at the same time.
3634000	3636000	You also mentioned
3636000	3638000	the better the surface,
3638000	3640000	the better the bonding strength.
3640000	3642000	Is there a
3642000	3644000	roughness limit?
3646000	3648000	The roughness limit
3648000	3650000	is based on
3650000	3652000	the smoothness
3652000	3654000	of the surface.
3654000	3656000	For example,
3656000	3658000	if we use 1 micrometer
3658000	3660000	of oxidized aluminum
3660000	3662000	to measure the surface,
3662000	3664000	we can see that
3664000	3666000	the surface is smooth
3666000	3668000	and the surface surface is smooth.
3668000	3670000	However,
3670000	3672000	if we use a
3672000	3674000	thicker surface
3674000	3676000	to measure the surface,
3676000	3678000	the contact point
3678000	3680000	will be reduced.
3680000	3682000	The less contact points,
3682000	3684000	the less bonding strength.
3684000	3686000	The more contact points,
3686000	3688000	the better bonding strength.
3688000	3690000	On the other hand,
3690000	3692000	as you mentioned before,
3692000	3694000	there should be contact points.
3694000	3696000	If the surface is smooth
3696000	3698000	and there are no contact points,
3698000	3700000	there will be no friction.
3700000	3702000	Theoretically,
3702000	3704000	it is possible.
3704000	3706000	However,
3706000	3708000	in terms of
3708000	3710000	our current technology,
3710000	3712000	it is OK
3712000	3714000	if the surface is smooth to a certain extent.
3714000	3716000	However,
3716000	3718000	this is what we can imagine.
3720000	3722000	Thank you.
3722000	3724000	My last question is
3724000	3726000	that you said that
3726000	3728000	it should be applied
3728000	3730000	to the frame of the car.
3730000	3732000	Basically,
3732000	3734000	the frame of the car
3734000	3736000	is three-dimensional,
3736000	3738000	and the experiment
3738000	3740000	you do here is
3740000	3742000	two-dimensional.
3742000	3744000	In the future,
3744000	3746000	will it be possible
3746000	3748000	to make a car frame
3748000	3750000	that is three-dimensional
3750000	3752000	with three-dimensional
3752000	3754000	car frame?
3754000	3756000	Because in the future,
3756000	3758000	there will be no
3758000	3760000	three-dimensional car frame.
3760000	3762000	We don't know
3762000	3764000	whether the car can be
3764000	3766000	made in three-dimensional.
3766000	3768000	We don't know
3768000	3770000	if it can be
3770000	3772000	made in three-dimensional.
3772000	3774000	In other words,
3774000	3776000	it can be applied
3776000	3778000	to some points
3778000	3780000	in the three-dimensional
3780000	3782000	structure of the car body.
3782000	3784000	It is mainly
3784000	3786000	the connection between
3786000	3788000	the engine cover,
3788000	3790000	and the structure of
3790000	3792000	the car body.
3792000	3794000	It is relatively difficult
3794000	3796000	to combine large areas of
3796000	3798000	supercardioid combination
3798000	3800000	as of now.
3800000	3802000	Can we ask Mr. Huang
3802000	3804000	to ask you a question?
3804000	3806000	Yes.
3806000	3808000	Can I ask a question?
3808000	3810000	Sure.
3810000	3812000	I have two or three questions.
3812000	3814000	The first one is
3814000	3816000	that what you are doing now
3816000	3818000	is basically based on
3818000	3820000	a balanced project.
3820000	3822000	I have a curious question.
3822000	3824000	How do you control
3824000	3826000	whether it produces IMC
3826000	3828000	or solid solution?
3828000	3830000	It mainly depends on
3830000	3832000	the combination of
3832000	3834000	the two materials.
3834000	3836000	In the beginning,
3836000	3838000	our judgment was based on
3838000	3840000	a two-dimensional picture.
3840000	3842000	In addition,
3842000	3844000	let's take this picture as an example.
3844000	3846000	It is enough for us to increase
3846000	3848000	to about 5,600 degrees.
3848000	3850000	With some expansion,
3850000	3852000	we can get
3852000	3854000	such a BCC structure.
3854000	3856000	On the other hand,
3856000	3858000	if the BCC is too high,
3858000	3860000	but the expansion also increases,
3860000	3862000	the amount of expansion also increases,
3862000	3864000	it may form another aspect,
3864000	3866000	such as IMC, solid solution,
3866000	3868000	or solid-solid solution, etc.
3868000	3870000	In other words,
3870000	3872000	the control of the
3872000	3874000	product itself
3874000	3876000	mainly depends on
3876000	3878000	the conditions of interface reaction,
3878000	3880000	such as temperature, time, etc.
3880000	3882000	It's hard to judge.
3882000	3884000	The second question is
3884000	3886000	because both are
3886000	3888000	single elements,
3888000	3890000	if the other side is
3890000	3892000	BCC,
3892000	3894000	or some special
3894000	3896000	metal-solid solution,
3896000	3898000	is it possible that
3898000	3900000	it will produce some
3900000	3902000	unequal attacks during the manufacturing process?
3902000	3904000	In this case, will it affect
3904000	3906000	the interface?
3906000	3908000	Or will it not affect the interface
3908000	3910000	during the process?
3910000	3912000	The temperature of the BCC
3912000	3914000	may be higher than the temperature of the BCC.
3914000	3916000	Yes,
3916000	3918000	if it's a low-temperature material,
3918000	3920000	it's true that it can be
3920000	3922000	liquefied.
3922000	3924000	For example,
3924000	3926000	the new solution
3926000	3928000	is only 400 degrees Celsius.
3928000	3930000	If it's more than 400 degrees Celsius,
3930000	3932000	the temperature of the BCC
3932000	3934000	will exceed the temperature of the solution.
3934000	3936000	In this case,
3936000	3938000	you have to consider
3938000	3940000	whether the strength of the BCC
3940000	3942000	has a positive effect on the interface.
3942000	3944000	If it's a negative effect,
3944000	3946000	you may choose to skip
3946000	3948000	the application of this material.
3948000	3950000	The previous question
3950000	3952000	is about multi-elements,
3952000	3954000	such as BCC
3954000	3956000	or metal-solid solution.
3956000	3958000	Is it possible
3958000	3960000	that it will produce some unequal attacks?
3960000	3962000	It's possible.
3962000	3964000	Because it's a short-term solution,
3964000	3966000	it will produce some
3966000	3968000	unequal attacks.
3968000	3970000	It's possible that
3970000	3972000	the overall analysis will be difficult.
3972000	3974000	Generally speaking,
3974000	3976000	if there is an interface issue,
3976000	3978000	it may not be a good thing for bonding.
3978000	3980000	Yes,
3980000	3982000	why is it not necessarily a good thing?
3982000	3984000	Because once the interface
3984000	3986000	has an issue,
3986000	3988000	it will slowly go back to the temperature.
3988000	3990000	The cooling effect
3990000	3992000	will change the volume.
3992000	3994000	Most of the time,
3994000	3996000	you will see that
3996000	3998000	there are many unequal holes
3998000	4000000	under the temperature.
4000000	4002000	These holes are usually not conducive
4002000	4004000	to the strength of the interface.
4004000	4006000	I see.
4006000	4008000	The last question is about the interface.
4008000	4010000	You will produce this IMC.
4010000	4012000	So, in your opinion,
4012000	4014000	this IMC is the main cause
4014000	4016000	of the linear deformation.
4016000	4018000	Is that right?
4020000	4022000	Linear motion.
4022000	4024000	Is your IMC
4024000	4026000	generated later or linear motion?
4026000	4028000	It still supports linear motion.
4028000	4030000	Because it's harder,
4030000	4032000	it will lead to linear deformation.
4032000	4034000	Generally speaking,
4034000	4036000	it is generated
4036000	4038000	after the surrounding
4038000	4040000	linear deformation ability
4040000	4042000	is better.
4042000	4044000	Then, it may be formed
4044000	4046000	by the interface as the integration point.
4046000	4048000	Sometimes,
4048000	4050000	you will find that
4050000	4052000	the IMC will be erased.
4052000	4054000	It is brittle.
4054000	4056000	It can't improve the ability
4056000	4058000	of linear deformation
4058000	4060000	on the whole.
4062000	4064000	So, it has no auxiliary function.
4064000	4066000	Yes.
4066000	4068000	So, it is quite hard.
4068000	4070000	It is generated
4070000	4072000	from the expansion layer
4072000	4074000	and the manufacturing process.
4074000	4076000	It's like this.
4076000	4078000	It's possible.
4078000	4080000	Let's take this picture as an example.
4080000	4082000	Let's say it reaches 500°C.
4082000	4084000	At the end of the friction,
4084000	4086000	the temperature may drop.
4086000	4088000	Although it's a short time,
4088000	4090000	it may be generated
4090000	4092000	in this situation.
4092000	4094000	But we don't have the so-called
4094000	4096000	zero tower observation.
4096000	4098000	So, it's hard to be sure
4098000	4100000	whether the IMC is generated
4100000	4102000	here or at the end.
4102000	4104000	Is there any specificity of the IMC
4104000	4106000	or is it random?
4106000	4108000	The specificity depends on
4108000	4110000	the material itself.
4110000	4112000	Some are obvious,
4112000	4114000	some are not.
4114000	4116000	For example,
4116000	4118000	it's not obvious
4118000	4120000	because it's too small.
4120000	4122000	It's beyond EBSD's
4122000	4124000	detection limit.
4124000	4126000	I see.
4128000	4130000	It's quite interesting.
4130000	4132000	Thank you.
4132000	4134000	Thank you.
4134000	4136000	Any other questions?
4144000	4146000	No more questions?
4150000	4152000	If they have any questions,
4152000	4154000	they can send an email to you.
4154000	4156000	Okay.
4156000	4158000	It's the same email.
4158000	4160000	The traditional email.
4160000	4162000	Okay.
4162000	4164000	Thank you for your
4164000	4166000	wonderful presentation.

4168000	4170000	to explain your research.
4170000	4172000	It's very interesting.
4172000	4174000	You're welcome.
4176000	4178000	That's all
4178000	4180000	for today's presentation.
4180000	4182000	If you
4182000	4184000	haven't
4184000	4186000	joined
4186000	4188000	Taira's team,
4188000	4190000	you can
4190000	4192000	fill in the form.
