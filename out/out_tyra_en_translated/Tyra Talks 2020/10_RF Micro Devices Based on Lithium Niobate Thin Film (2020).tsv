0	5000	Recording has started.
5000	7000	All right.
30000	50000	In 2011 and 2015, he received his master's and Ph.D. degrees from the Narrow Engineering and Microsystems Institute of Tsinghua University.
50000	62000	He also served as a postdoc researcher at the University of Illinois's Urban Champion.
62000	73000	He is currently working as an assistant professor in the Department of Power and Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University.
73000	86000	Today, Prof. Ming-Huang will be giving a presentation on RF Microdevices Based on the ThinFILM Lithium NeoBit.
86000	101000	Prof. Ming-Huang, please give us a warm welcome and applause.
101000	106000	Thank you for your introduction. I am Prof. Ming-Huang Li.
106000	118000	I am currently working as an assistant professor in the Department of Power and Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University.
118000	122000	My background is the same as what I just introduced.
122000	125000	I received my master's degree in mechanical engineering from Tsinghua University.
125000	130000	After that, I completed my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University.
130000	136000	After completing my Ph.D. degree, I briefly served as a postdoc for a year in Taiwan.
136000	139000	I then looked for opportunities to work as a postdoc in the United States.
139000	144000	Later, I was able to successfully work as a postdoc in the ECE Department of UIUC.
144000	150000	My main research topics are divided into two directions.
150000	154000	The first one is a funding project for me.
154000	157000	It is a DAPA Amoeba project.
157000	166000	The goal is to develop a low-frequency mechanical rectifier that can be used in the military.
166000	169000	At the same time, we have another project under execution.
169000	173000	This is the topic I am going to talk about.
173000	178000	This is the topic I am going to talk about.
178000	183000	This is the topic I am going to talk about.
183000	186000	My research interests are these.
186000	190000	Whether it is a static power supply or a power supply,
190000	193000	As long as it is a microcomputing component or a supercomputer component,
193000	196000	They are all in my area of interest.
196000	202000	If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt.
202000	205000	Thank you.
205000	208000	This is my outline today.
208000	212000	First, I will start with our motivation.
212000	214000	The motivation is divided into two parts.
214000	221000	The first part is why we want to apply the sound wave component to the RF system.
221000	224000	It has a very long history.
224000	226000	But maybe everyone doesn't know why.
226000	229000	So I will start from this point.
230000	240000	Next, I will explain why lithium niobate is now considered to have a chance to become a star of the day.
240000	248000	I will introduce a few classic components in the current field.
248000	251000	Then I will explain their characteristics one by one.
251000	253000	Finally, there are two simple case studies.
253000	256000	The latter two parts are what I am doing.
256000	260000	The first one is about the adjustment of the temperature coefficient.
260000	264000	And its theoretical calculation and simulation.
264000	267000	The second part is what I started to do after I returned to Taiwan.
267000	270000	Due to these small components,
270000	273000	Usually, you have to make it with a seamless device.
273000	276000	If the device is not so useful,
276000	280000	In fact, the performance of the components will not be so ideal.
280000	285000	So after returning to Taiwan, we hope to reduce the loading in the process as much as possible.
285000	290000	So we developed all the thin-shaped lithium niobate components.
290000	295000	After returning to Taiwan, we hope to use the same concept.
295000	299000	We use surface-to-surface components to make.
299000	301000	We have also achieved some results recently.
301000	306000	The first part is my motivation.
307000	316000	Just like all human life requirements,
316000	320000	We hope to obtain information quickly and conveniently.
320000	324000	This is why the communication system has been improving.
324000	332000	From 2G and 3G decades ago to 4G and 5G in recent years,
332000	338000	We all hope that the communication system can meet all our needs.
338000	345000	It also includes high-speed transmission, low latency, and high reliability.
345000	354000	Based on this requirement, 5G communication is divided into three categories.
354000	358000	The first is high-speed, the so-called ENBB part.
359000	363000	It mainly uses high frequency bandwidth.
363000	367000	Because when the center frequency is higher,
367000	374000	The same ratio of bandwidth allows you to accommodate more communication channels.
374000	378000	This can improve the transmission speed of your data.
378000	383000	On the other hand, we also hope to have a low latency network.
383000	392000	Low latency network is used for safety or special applications.
392000	394000	For example, the network of a self-driving car.
394000	403000	If the network is interrupted in the process of self-driving,
403000	406000	It may not be able to receive important information.
406000	410000	This will create some doubts about the safety of passengers.
410000	417000	Therefore, this low latency and uninterrupted network is also an important part of 5G.
417000	423000	In addition, in smart homes or smart cities,
423000	427000	In the future, we will hope to build an Internet of Things system.
427000	431000	Therefore, we also hope to have some low-power transmission
431000	436000	To meet the applications of these sensor nodes.
436000	441000	Since 5G divides our needs into three categories,
441000	444000	It is impossible for them to operate on the same frequency band.
444000	447000	Because the frequency band is limited,
447000	453000	The number of channels or users that can be accommodated within the frequency band is also limited.
453000	458000	So it is obvious that if we want to meet these three needs at the same time,
458000	463000	It must be distributed in different frequencies on the distribution of frequency bands.
463000	466000	So we can see at the bottom of this picture,
466000	472000	In fact, 5G is divided into three parts.
472000	475000	Low-band is less than 1GHz,
475000	478000	Mid-band is between 1GHz and 6GHz,
478000	485000	High-band is between 6GHz and 100GHz.
485000	490000	Generally, Low-band and Mid-band are divided into FR1,
490000	493000	And MW is divided into FR2.
496000	502000	Is there any difference between 5G frequency band, 4G and 3G?
502000	505000	In fact, there is a big difference.
505000	509000	The main difference is that 5G hopes to
509000	516000	Use the limited frequency left by the communication system.
516000	519000	And hope to give them a new mission.
519000	527000	So in addition to the existing 3G and 4G infrastructure in the 5G communication system,
527000	531000	It also needs to insert these new frequencies in addition.
531000	535000	The biggest challenge of these new frequencies is that
535000	541000	It is very different from the traditional 4G network or 3G communication.
541000	545000	The frequency range of some bands is very large.
545000	550000	For example, we have the so-called band N77 and band N79.
550000	556000	These two frequencies may account for more than 10% of the frequency range.
556000	560000	In terms of N77, it accounts for 24%.
560000	563000	For higher frequency bands, such as band 258,
563000	565000	Its frequency range is about 10%.
565000	571000	The size of the frequency range has a great impact on hardware design.
571000	576000	Because at present, most of the radio waves used in the current communication system,
576000	582000	Especially in mobile phones, are radio waves.
582000	586000	The frequency range of these radio waves is limited.
586000	591000	The frequency range of these radio waves is usually controlled by the characteristics of its voltage material.
591000	595000	So for the current frequency range of 10% to 20%,
595000	598000	It is very difficult to achieve with the current technology.
598000	604000	So this is a new challenge from the system to the hardware design.
604000	609000	We also believe that we can get some new opportunities in this new challenge.
610000	625000	This graph shows the communication system architecture used by 3G, 4G, EET, and 5G carriers.
625000	630000	Compared with the traditional 3G and 4G,
630000	636000	It is obvious that 5G wants to have more applications,
636000	639000	So it has more usable frequency bands.
639000	645000	In order to properly process these signals, we need more filters.
645000	651000	The filter is used to process a specific frequency band signal.
651000	656000	For example, if the center frequency band of my filter is 1GHz,
656000	659000	And the frequency band is 400MHz,
659000	665000	So I will probably go from 980MHz to 1020MHz.
665000	668000	The frequency in the middle is allowed to pass.
668000	673000	I will try to suppress the signal beyond this frequency band.
673000	679000	So I can use these filters alone to select the communication frequency band I want,
679000	683000	And erase other signals.
683000	688000	In this way, it will be more convenient for me to process the following signals,
688000	691000	And the error rate will be lower.
691000	694000	Since the frequency band keeps increasing,
694000	697000	As we described earlier,
697000	704000	When the frequency band increases, we need more filters.
704000	707000	These filters also hope to have large frequency bands.
707000	716000	Therefore, the characteristics of the filter and its size need to be precisely controlled.
716000	725000	Especially if we want the phone to be able to use 5G communication properly,
725000	730000	So many filters have to be stuffed into the phone.
730000	735000	Therefore, the size of the filter is very strict.
739000	745000	This brings us to the first topic today.
745000	749000	Why do we want to apply the frequency band software to 5G communication?
749000	754000	Especially 5G communication with strict size restrictions.
754000	760000	The reason is that the frequency band is lower than the battery band.
760000	765000	Therefore, the size of the frequency band will be smaller than the battery band.
765000	768000	In the above picture,
768000	773000	We can compare the EM duplexer in the form of a battery band,
773000	777000	And the duplexer produced by the frequency band software.
778000	784000	The size of the duplexer is 10 times smaller than the battery band.
784000	796000	Therefore, we can expect a frequency band to be 100 times smaller than the EM duplexer.
796000	803000	In the same space, we can put more frequency band filters to meet our communication needs.
803000	809000	The frequency band is a mechanical resonance component.
809000	819000	In general, the quality of mechanical resonance will be higher than that of the EM duplexer.
819000	823000	Therefore, it usually has the characteristics of low insertion loss.
824000	835000	The most important thing is that the EM duplexer still needs to go through the steps required by the general semiconductor manufacturing process.
835000	839000	For example, exposure, salinity, time, etc.
839000	842000	These technologies are very mature in the industrial world.
842000	852000	Therefore, the EM duplexer can also be mass-produced and maintain a very stable salinity.
852000	855000	Sorry, I have a question.
855000	856000	Please go ahead.
856000	857000	It's a bit of an outlandish question.
857000	860000	Because what I'm doing is resonator, but what I'm doing is superconductor.
861000	864000	So, I don't understand.
864000	867000	What is the reason for the fundamental physics?
867000	873000	The quality factor of the resonator will be higher and the loss factor will be lower.
873000	878000	Because it feels like it uses a lot of energy to vibrate something.
878000	883000	It has the effect of EM in a space.
883000	887000	I can't understand intuitively why its quality is better.
887000	896000	In my opinion, this wave can be limited to a certain range.
896000	899000	Because mechanical vibration can be understood as
899000	903000	For example, I take a beam and let it vibrate.
903000	905000	Its boundary is very clear.
905000	910000	Because my beam is a beam with a fixed length and height.
910000	916000	So when it vibrates, it's like it's in this object.
916000	918000	It produces a beam.
918000	928000	But if it's EM, I'm not sure if it has such a good boundary to limit its EM.
928000	933000	It's the distribution of electromagnetic waves in space that produces a beam.
933000	939000	But I do know that there are some high-quality EM resonators.
939000	941000	It's like some dielectric resonators.
941000	945000	It should be a transmission line mode.
945000	948000	Its Q can reach several hundred.
948000	951000	But in terms of deep wave components,
951000	954000	At present, commercial components,
954000	959000	We call it an amplifier component of a deep wave filter.
959000	962000	Its Q can reach about 4000 to 5000.
962000	967000	So I think it still has a difference of one or two quantities.
967000	972000	Oh, I see. Okay, thank you.
972000	975000	Okay, I'll go on.
975000	984000	At present, 4G LTE has a lot of communication frequency.
984000	991000	Usually, there are about 3 to 4 wireless modules in a mobile phone.
991000	993000	To meet the needs of different frequencies.
993000	998000	For example, Wi-Fi has 2.4G and 5G.
998000	1001000	These two may be a module.
1001000	1007000	The traditional GSM communication and CDMA communication may be another module.
1007000	1013000	In such a module, it will contain a lot of active and passive components.
1013000	1015000	For example, in terms of this package,
1015000	1020000	It contains 4 PA, which is the so-called power amplifier.
1020000	1025000	To generate enough energy for long-distance transmission.
1025000	1031000	It has 18 filters and 5 switch modules.
1031000	1033000	There is also a collective circuit for communication.
1033000	1038000	There is also a chip for impedance matching.
1038000	1042000	So in such a module, it actually contains 18 filters.
1042000	1048000	So we can imagine that if there are three such modules in our mobile phone.
1048000	1050000	It has more than 50 filters.
1050000	1056000	In the future, we hope that 5G can accommodate more bands.
1056000	1061000	So we can expect that the number of filters will continue to increase.
1061000	1070000	At the same size, we hope that these filters can be small and high-performance.
1070000	1075000	So this is also the main challenge of the current filter design.
1075000	1087000	The second part is to explain why we think that Li-Lian NIOBE is a material with a good prospect.
1087000	1098000	Before the introduction of this LN, we can briefly review the three common transmitters.
1098000	1104000	The first one on the left is the traditional transceiver.
1104000	1113000	Its material is usually Li-Lian NIOBE or Li-Lian TENTALATE.
1113000	1117000	These two materials are all man-made crystals.
1117000	1122000	So they generally do not appear in the normal environment.
1122000	1124000	Because they are man-made crystals.
1124000	1130000	Because the traditional transceiver uses a thicker base.
1130000	1137000	So when we use a very small indexing electrode to stimulate the sound wave on the surface.
1137000	1140000	It usually forms a surface wave.
1140000	1143000	There are many forms of surface waves.
1143000	1148000	But the most common ones are usually Rayleigh waves or Leaky waves.
1148000	1152000	The Leaky wave has the opportunity to get a relatively large magnetic resonance.
1152000	1155000	But its loss will also be relatively large.
1155000	1160000	In terms of Rayleigh waves, its typical magnetic resonance factor is about 7%.
1160000	1168000	In our field, we are used to using KT² or KEffective² symbols to represent magnetic resonance.
1168000	1171000	Its Q is about 1000.
1172000	1178000	The second one is also the most popular model of transceiver at present.
1178000	1180000	We call it FBAR.
1180000	1190000	It is a transceiver with a film buck acoustic wave resonator.
1190000	1194000	After a long search and research,
1194000	1203000	we finally determined that aluminum nitride is the most suitable commercial application for FBAR.
1203000	1207000	Because other materials have more or less other problems.
1207000	1213000	Its general magnetic resonance factor can give you about 6.5%.
1213000	1216000	Its Q is about 3000 in 2GHz.
1216000	1224000	But there are already some companies, such as Brokon, which is the predecessor of Avago.
1224000	1229000	In terms of Brokon, their Q should be able to do more than 45,000.
1229000	1234000	In order to strengthen its magnetic resonance feature,
1234000	1243000	some researches will use KONG element to dope it into aluminum nitride.
1243000	1247000	Generally, it is used to improve the transceiver.
1247000	1255000	When aluminum nitride is sputtered, KONG element is used to dope it into aluminum nitride.
1255000	1262000	The higher the content of KONG element, the higher its magnetic resonance factor will be.
1262000	1267000	However, due to the increase in the defect of KONG element,
1267000	1274000	KONG element's magnetic resonance factor will decrease as time goes by.
1274000	1278000	The third type is the so-called LAMP wave.
1278000	1283000	It is usually made from aluminum nitride.
1283000	1286000	It is a fairly good material now.
1286000	1289000	Its coupling is about 6.5%.
1289000	1293000	Because its thickness becomes very thin,
1293000	1296000	it is usually less than one wavelength.
1296000	1304000	You can see that its electrode configuration is very similar to that of SOHL.
1304000	1308000	However, what it triggers is not a surface wave, but a body wave.
1308000	1312000	The body wave will be described by another set of equations.
1312000	1316000	So it will have completely different characteristics from SOHL.
1316000	1321000	Since the coupling of aluminum nitride itself is not particularly strong,
1322000	1329000	and its coupling will change according to the direction of the electrode and the form of the wave,
1329000	1333000	its coupling will generally be between 1% and 4.5%.
1333000	1336000	The Q value is about 2000.
1336000	1340000	By combining the above three different components,
1340000	1344000	we can see that we are very concerned about its two characteristics.
1344000	1347000	The first is its magnetic resonance.
1347000	1349000	The second is the quality factor.
1349000	1359000	The definition of magnetic resonance is probably the ratio of mechanical energy to total energy.
1359000	1369000	Because we want to know how much energy is transferred from electricity to the mechanical field
1369000	1374000	when we give some energy to the electrode on the surface.
1374000	1378000	So we generally use KT square as a very important indicator.
1378000	1381000	The second indicator is the so-called quality factor.
1381000	1384000	Q has a lot of definitions,
1384000	1392000	but the most widely known one is the ratio of the energy stored in our system
1392000	1397000	and the energy lost by each cycle of movement.
1397000	1402000	So the higher the Q, the lower the energy loss.
1402000	1407000	When the energy loss is lower, I have a chance to make a green wave that has a lower energy loss.
1407000	1413000	Because KT square and Q are very important,
1413000	1418000	we will define our performance indicator,
1418000	1421000	which is to multiply Q by KT square.
1421000	1427000	So we can use F bar as an example.
1427000	1435000	Its performance indicator is probably between 100 and 200.
1435000	1438000	This graph shows...
1438000	1440000	Sorry, I have a question.
1440000	1442000	Can I go back to the last page?
1442000	1447000	You said that your excitation is at 2 GHz,
1447000	1449000	but my question is that,
1449000	1452000	for example, the受 is the surface wave,
1452000	1455000	or the lamp wave on the right is the body wave.
1455000	1462000	Is the excitation mode 2 GHz or not?
1462000	1465000	My question is, what is its phonon frequency?
1465000	1468000	It's 2 GHz.
1468000	1472000	Oh, so that's only a few million EVs.
1472000	1474000	Let me check the Planck constant.
1474000	1476000	It should be.
1476000	1478000	Okay, I see. Thank you.
1479000	1484000	In fact, according to the characteristics of IDT,
1484000	1486000	it has a periodicity.
1486000	1489000	So its complete cycle will be a wavelength.
1489000	1493000	So we will also use the size of these wavelengths
1493000	1499000	and the relationship of IDT cycle to design a mode that suits them.
1499000	1502000	That's how it works in practice.
1502000	1505000	Okay, so I just checked.
1505000	1508000	Okay, so I just checked.
1508000	1510000	I'm more used to the unit of energy.
1510000	1512000	Anyway, it's multiplied by h.
1512000	1514000	So what I mean is,
1514000	1515000	I'm curious about one thing,
1515000	1518000	that is, if 2 GHz is multiplied by Planck constant,
1518000	1520000	it's less than 10 mEV.
1520000	1521000	That is to say,
1521000	1524000	if I give this device at least 10 mEV,
1524000	1526000	it will have a signal.
1526000	1528000	It will trigger a quantum, right?
1528000	1530000	A quantum.
1530000	1535000	I'm not so sure about the definition of physics.
1535000	1536000	Oh, okay.
1536000	1540000	But basically, its mode is 2 GHz mode.
1540000	1541000	That's for sure.
1541000	1543000	Okay, I see. Okay, thank you.
1550000	1553000	This graph shows
1553000	1559000	the motion of these three different components.
1559000	1560000	Generally speaking,
1560000	1562000	the Resonator of the Soul
1562000	1565000	is made on the surface of the crystal,
1565000	1567000	so there is no boundary around it.
1567000	1570000	So we will artificially add
1570000	1573000	the so-called Acoustic Reflector.
1573000	1578000	It is made in the form of the so-called Block Reflector.
1578000	1579000	That is, my grating,
1579000	1581000	its cycle,
1581000	1583000	is about a quarter of the wavelength.
1583000	1585000	This method of stacking
1585000	1588000	to enhance its ripple on the boundary reflection.
1588000	1589000	On the right,
1589000	1592000	you can see the motion of its surface wavelength.
1592000	1594000	Its motion mode
1594000	1597000	has a ripple on the surface.
1597000	1599000	Then in the depth of the crystal,
1599000	1602000	about a few lambda below,
1602000	1604000	it is a non-moving state.
1604000	1607000	So its ripple exists on the surface of the system.
1607000	1609000	What is different from the surface wavelength
1609000	1611000	is that the two graphs below,
1611000	1614000	which are FFAR and LandWave,
1614000	1617000	they are vibrating the whole structure.
1618000	1622000	FFAR is a longitudinal mode
1622000	1627000	in the center of the crystal.
1627000	1630000	So its upper and lower surfaces
1630000	1632000	will move in different directions.
1632000	1635000	Then the center of this material
1635000	1636000	is the node of the movement,
1636000	1639000	so its stress will be the greatest.
1639000	1640000	On the right,
1640000	1643000	it is the so-called LandWave motion mode.
1644000	1647000	Although LandWave
1647000	1650000	also uses the IDT electrode as the trigger,
1650000	1653000	its upper and lower surfaces are free surfaces,
1653000	1656000	so it generally has two different motion modes.
1656000	1659000	The first is the so-called symmetrical motion,
1659000	1661000	that is, the upper and lower surfaces
1661000	1664000	move in different directions.
1664000	1668000	So its center plane
1668000	1671000	is a mirror mode.
1671000	1675000	The second is the so-called asymmetric motion,
1675000	1678000	that is, the upper and lower surfaces
1678000	1680000	move in the same direction.
1680000	1683000	So it is more like a high-speed fractal mode.
1686000	1690000	After understanding the basic components
1690000	1694000	and their motion and some of its characteristics,
1694000	1696000	we can talk about
1696000	1700000	how to make a deep wave filter.
1700000	1703000	In fact, when we generally analyze,
1703000	1707000	we will only look at its physical behavior
1707000	1709000	at the level of a device,
1709000	1711000	that is, at the level of a single rectifier.
1711000	1714000	But when it comes to designing a filter,
1714000	1716000	we generally use
1716000	1719000	the so-called ladder filter circuit.
1719000	1721000	With such a circuit,
1721000	1723000	we can treat each rectifier
1723000	1725000	as an independent component,
1725000	1728000	so we use a simplified model to describe it.
1728000	1730000	In terms of a rectifier system,
1730000	1733000	it can be seen as a combination of
1733000	1737000	quality, resistance, and strength.
1737000	1739000	On the circuit,
1739000	1741000	we can find that
1741000	1743000	it has the same motion
1743000	1745000	as the connected
1745000	1748000	resistor, capacitor, and inductor.
1748000	1750000	It has the same mathematical form.
1750000	1752000	So we also tend to use
1752000	1754000	such a set of equivalent circuits
1754000	1756000	to describe it.
1756000	1758000	Because of this,
1758000	1760000	we can directly use
1760000	1762000	the circuit design tools
1762000	1764000	to design and simulate.
1764000	1766000	It will be more convenient.
1766000	1768000	With such a set of equivalent circuits,
1768000	1770000	it also has a C0
1770000	1772000	parallel to the main
1772000	1774000	motional branch.
1774000	1776000	The meaning of this C0
1776000	1778000	is that it is a static capacitor
1778000	1780000	produced between the
1780000	1782000	rectifier capacitor
1782000	1784000	or the electrode
1784000	1786000	.
1786000	1788000	Such a model
1788000	1790000	is usually called
1790000	1792000	Modified Butterworth-Van Dyck model
1792000	1794000	or MVVD model.
1794000	1796000	Such a set of models
1796000	1798000	can be seen on the circuit
1798000	1800000	as a
1800000	1802000	rectifier and
1802000	1804000	a anti-rectifier model.
1808000	1810000	Its rectifier frequency
1810000	1812000	is mainly connected
1812000	1814000	by the connected
1814000	1816000	RLC.
1816000	1818000	The parallel rectification
1818000	1820000	is determined by the
1820000	1822000	ratio of Cm and C0.
1826000	1828000	After obtaining
1830000	1832000	a single rectifier
1832000	1834000	motion form,
1834000	1836000	we can start
1836000	1838000	designing the filter.
1838000	1840000	In the case of
1840000	1842000	Ladder Filter,
1842000	1844000	it has a series resonator
1844000	1846000	and a parallel resonator.
1846000	1848000	In general,
1848000	1850000	the wavelength of the parallel resonator
1850000	1852000	is slightly different from
1852000	1854000	that of the series resonator.
1854000	1856000	We want to
1856000	1858000	match the
1858000	1860000	anti-rectifier frequency
1860000	1862000	of the parallel resonator
1862000	1864000	with the series resonator.
1864000	1866000	Through such a circuit,
1866000	1868000	we can use
1868000	1870000	two parallel resonators
1870000	1872000	with different frequencies
1872000	1874000	to form the
1874000	1876000	passband of the filter.
1876000	1878000	The passband can be controlled.
1878000	1880000	As long as
1880000	1882000	we carefully select
1882000	1884000	the separation
1884000	1886000	of the resonator,
1886000	1888000	the parallel resonator
1888000	1890000	and the anti-rectifier,
1890000	1892000	we can achieve the effect of
1892000	1894000	controlling the wavelength.
1894000	1896000	In theory,
1896000	1898000	there seems to be a way to
1898000	1900000	make it.
1900000	1902000	However,
1902000	1904000	by observing such a circuit,
1904000	1906000	we can find that
1906000	1908000	the K effective square
1908000	1910000	is limited by a factor.
1910000	1912000	After some
1912000	1914000	deductions,
1914000	1916000	we can find that
1916000	1918000	the K effective square
1918000	1920000	is related to
1920000	1922000	Fp and Fs.
1922000	1924000	Another potential factor
1924000	1926000	is that it is related to
1926000	1928000	the opamp factor.
1928000	1930000	On the other hand,
1930000	1932000	the opamp factor
1932000	1934000	determines the size of
1934000	1936000	the K effective square
1936000	1938000	and affects the separation
1938000	1940000	between Fp and Fs.
1940000	1942000	In order to meet the requirements
1942000	1944000	of 5G communication,
1944000	1946000	such as 10% and 20%
1946000	1948000	frequency,
1948000	1950000	we must find
1950000	1952000	the K effective square
1952000	1954000	as the basis of
1954000	1956000	the design of the resonator.
1956000	1958000	Therefore,
1958000	1960000	let's look at
1960000	1962000	the material
1962000	1964000	lithium niobate.
1964000	1966000	It is a material
1966000	1968000	with a long history.
1968000	1970000	It was probably
1970000	1972000	synthesized
1972000	1974000	30 or 40 years ago,
1974000	1976000	and it has a very
1976000	1978000	unique feature of
1978000	1980000	a three-dimensional
1980000	1982000	crystal structure.
1982000	1984000	Therefore,
1984000	1986000	it has different
1986000	1988000	opamp characteristics
1988000	1990000	in different wave directions.
1990000	1992000	It has also been widely used
1992000	1994000	in the design of
1994000	1996000	this kind of
1996000	1998000	surface wave components.
1998000	2000000	For general
2000000	2002000	surface wave components,
2002000	2004000	its pixel speed is
2004000	2006000	about 4000mps.
2006000	2008000	Its effective coupling
2008000	2010000	is about 17%,
2010000	2012000	and its Q is about 1000.
2012000	2014000	However,
2014000	2016000	we have always thought
2016000	2018000	that we did not fully
2018000	2020000	apply the characteristics of
2020000	2022000	this material,
2022000	2024000	because its K effective square
2024000	2026000	is actually much lower
2026000	2028000	than the theoretical prediction value
2028000	2030000	of this material.
2030000	2032000	Therefore,
2032000	2034000	about 20 years ago,
2034000	2036000	there was a famous paper
2036000	2038000	that mainly analyzed
2038000	2040000	the coupling of
2040000	2042000	lithium niobate crystal
2042000	2044000	in three different directions.
2044000	2046000	Since lithium niobate
2046000	2048000	is a three-dimensional crystal,
2048000	2050000	it has different characteristics
2050000	2052000	for its X-cut,
2052000	2054000	Y-cut and Z-cut.
2054000	2056000	The so-called X-cut
2056000	2058000	refers to
2058000	2060000	the X-axis of the material
2060000	2062000	as the Y-axis of the crystal,
2062000	2064000	and the wave transmission
2064000	2066000	will be on the YZ plane.
2066000	2068000	Similarly,
2068000	2070000	the Y-cut and Z-cut
2070000	2072000	respectively represent
2072000	2074000	the wave transmission
2074000	2076000	on the ZX and XY planes.
2078000	2080000	This article
2080000	2082000	mainly discusses
2082000	2084000	the thickness
2084000	2086000	of the three different
2086000	2088000	cuts and
2088000	2090000	the thickness of the different
2090000	2092000	waves.
2092000	2094000	It can be seen that
2094000	2096000	whether it is X-cut or
2096000	2098000	Y-cut,
2098000	2100000	in terms of these three cuts,
2100000	2102000	we target
2102000	2104000	two modes respectively.
2104000	2106000	The first is the so-called SH0,
2106000	2108000	which is the level-cut mode.
2108000	2110000	It can be seen that
2110000	2112000	there is almost no up-and-down movement
2112000	2114000	on the surface,
2114000	2116000	and its movement occurs
2116000	2118000	in the shear inside the plane.
2118000	2120000	The second mode
2120000	2122000	is the so-called S0 mode,
2122000	2124000	which is similar to SH0.
2124000	2126000	There is no up-and-down movement
2126000	2128000	on the surface,
2128000	2130000	but its wave transmission
2130000	2132000	is in the shear inside the plane.
2132000	2134000	Based on the analysis
2134000	2136000	of these two modes,
2136000	2138000	it can be found that
2138000	2140000	when you select the thickness
2140000	2142000	of the film properly,
2142000	2144000	the K-square,
2144000	2146000	that is,
2146000	2148000	the thickness of the film,
2148000	2150000	has a chance to reach 30%
2150000	2152000	or more than 40%.
2158000	2160000	From this theory,
2160000	2162000	it can be found that
2162000	2164000	when we
2164000	2166000	thin the film
2166000	2168000	from the thick wafer
2168000	2170000	to a very thin film,
2170000	2172000	it actually has a chance
2172000	2174000	to get a very large
2174000	2176000	film thickness,
2176000	2178000	which can meet
2178000	2180000	our demand for
2180000	2182000	high-frequency green wafers.
2182000	2184000	As for this technology,
2184000	2186000	why did it start to develop
2186000	2188000	around 2010,
2188000	2190000	mainly because
2190000	2192000	lithium nitrate
2192000	2194000	itself is a material
2194000	2196000	that is not easy to process,
2196000	2198000	and it has a very good
2198000	2200000	resistance to
2200000	2202000	all kinds of acids and alkynes.
2202000	2204000	This threshold
2204000	2206000	was broken about 10 years ago,
2206000	2208000	which is mainly the progress
2208000	2210000	of smart card technology,
2210000	2212000	which allows us
2212000	2214000	to do research
2214000	2216000	at a relatively
2216000	2218000	cheap price
2218000	2220000	to obtain such a crystal.
2220000	2222000	The method of smart card
2222000	2224000	is like this.
2224000	2226000	We mainly prepare two wafers.
2226000	2228000	One is the pressure crystal
2228000	2230000	we need,
2230000	2232000	and the other is the
2232000	2234000	board we carry
2234000	2236000	the pressure film.
2236000	2238000	So at the beginning,
2238000	2240000	we put a very thin layer
2240000	2242000	of electrolyte
2242000	2244000	on the pressure crystal,
2244000	2246000	and then,
2246000	2248000	in addition to being used
2248000	2250000	for bonding,
2250000	2252000	it can also be used
2252000	2254000	to resist
2254000	2256000	the depth of lithium nitrate
2256000	2258000	and can be used
2258000	2260000	for bonding.
2260000	2262000	So when we do smart card,
2262000	2264000	we use the
2264000	2266000	lithium nitrate arrangement method
2266000	2268000	to inject a thin layer of
2268000	2270000	lithium nitrate
2270000	2272000	into a certain depth
2272000	2274000	on the surface of the crystal,
2274000	2276000	and then,
2276000	2278000	after a simple surface
2278000	2280000	cleaning and bonding,
2280000	2282000	use a heat treatment method
2282000	2284000	to produce a stronger
2284000	2286000	heat resistance
2286000	2288000	and then crack
2288000	2290000	on that layer,
2290000	2292000	separating the two layers of crystal.
2292000	2294000	So finally,
2294000	2296000	after the bonded crystal
2296000	2298000	is exposed to the surface,
2298000	2300000	the surface is very smooth
2300000	2302000	and the pressure material
2302000	2304000	is very thin.
2304000	2306000	This material is very suitable
2306000	2308000	for some subsequent processing
2308000	2310000	to get the lithium nitrate
2310000	2312000	we need.
2316000	2318000	Okay,
2318000	2320000	do you have any questions?
2324000	2326000	If not,
2326000	2328000	I will continue to the next part.
2330000	2332000	Before we
2332000	2334000	design the components,
2334000	2336000	we will briefly
2336000	2338000	discuss these
2338000	2340000	thin boards
2340000	2342000	and their transmission behavior.
2342000	2344000	Generally speaking,
2344000	2346000	there are two main modes
2346000	2348000	for thin boards.
2348000	2350000	The first mode
2350000	2352000	is called Rayleigh-Lamb Wave.
2352000	2354000	The second mode
2354000	2356000	is called Shear Horizontal Wave.
2356000	2358000	These two modes
2358000	2360000	are completely different.
2360000	2362000	However,
2362000	2364000	both Rayleigh-Lamb
2364000	2366000	and Shear Horizontal Wave
2366000	2368000	have the same feature
2368000	2370000	that they
2370000	2372000	have the so-called
2372000	2374000	Shear Horizontal Wave.
2374000	2376000	The Shear Horizontal Wave
2376000	2378000	can be simply understood as
2378000	2380000	the wavelength of the wave
2380000	2382000	for a certain mode.
2382000	2384000	Its wavelength
2384000	2386000	will actually
2386000	2388000	depend on
2388000	2390000	the thickness of the thin board.
2390000	2392000	For this S0-Lamb Wave,
2392000	2394000	when my board
2394000	2396000	is very, very thin,
2396000	2398000	its wavelength
2398000	2400000	may be close to 10,000 ms.
2400000	2402000	However,
2402000	2404000	when I slowly
2404000	2406000	thicken my thin board,
2406000	2408000	it will actually
2408000	2410000	transform from Rayleigh-Lamb Wave
2410000	2412000	to Rayleigh-Wave.
2412000	2414000	Therefore,
2414000	2416000	their final frequency
2416000	2418000	will be close to the thin frequency.
2418000	2420000	Therefore,
2420000	2422000	it can be clearly seen that
2422000	2424000	in these different waves,
2424000	2426000	in addition to
2426000	2428000	the different waves,
2428000	2430000	the frequency will also
2430000	2432000	be affected by the thickness.
2432000	2434000	Therefore, their frequency
2434000	2436000	is very important.
2436000	2438000	Since the frequency
2438000	2440000	has frequency,
2440000	2442000	other features
2442000	2444000	and features
2444000	2446000	will also have frequency.
2446000	2448000	For example,
2448000	2450000	the Shear Horizontal Wave
2450000	2452000	is also a parameter
2452000	2454000	with frequency.
2454000	2456000	Next,
2456000	2458000	we will use
2458000	2460000	the so-called
2460000	2462000	30° Rotated Y-Cut
2462000	2464000	Lithium Niobate
2464000	2466000	as an example.
2466000	2468000	This is a simulated
2468000	2470000	result.
2470000	2472000	Let's assume
2472000	2474000	that the surface of
2474000	2476000	the Y-X Lithium Niobate
2476000	2478000	is coated with
2478000	2480000	periodic IDT electrodes.
2480000	2482000	Through these electrodes,
2482000	2484000	we can trigger
2484000	2486000	a frequency
2486000	2488000	called
2488000	2490000	a0s0
2490000	2492000	and a1s1.
2492000	2494000	In addition to
2494000	2496000	LandWave,
2496000	2498000	there are other
2498000	2500000	so-called
2500000	2502000	Shear Horizontal Wave,
2502000	2504000	Shear Horizontal Wave,
2504000	2506000	Shear Horizontal Wave,
2506000	2508000	Shear Horizontal Wave,
2508000	2510000	Shear Horizontal Wave,
2510000	2512000	Shear Horizontal Wave.
2512000	2514000	When the thickness of the electrode
2514000	2516000	is increased to a wavelength,
2516000	2518000	almost all the
2518000	2520000	frequencies of the wave
2520000	2522000	will decrease.
2522000	2524000	Except for a special wave
2524000	2526000	called
2526000	2528000	a0s0 Shear Horizontal Wave,
2528000	2530000	which is almost a parameter,
2530000	2532000	other frequencies
2532000	2534000	will be significantly affected.
2534000	2536000	In addition to the frequency,
2536000	2538000	the periodic IDT
2538000	2540000	is also a parameter
2540000	2542000	that is very sensitive.
2542000	2544000	So we can see that
2544000	2546000	these different modes
2546000	2548000	have a very big difference
2548000	2550000	in the thickness
2550000	2552000	of the electrodes
2552000	2554000	under different thicknesses.
2556000	2558000	In this picture,
2558000	2560000	with such a special section
2560000	2562000	and a specific
2562000	2564000	wave direction,
2564000	2566000	we can find that
2566000	2568000	it actually has a lot of potential
2568000	2570000	because its periodic IDT
2570000	2572000	can be greater than 40%.
2572000	2574000	Therefore,
2574000	2576000	such a material
2576000	2578000	with such a
2578000	2580000	Shear Horizontal Wave
2580000	2582000	will obviously be
2582000	2584000	quite suitable for
2584000	2586000	wide-frequency wave design.
2586000	2588000	I have a question.
2588000	2590000	This picture
2590000	2592000	is normalized by lambda,
2592000	2594000	but if it is actually
2594000	2596000	a few gigahertz,
2596000	2598000	is it one centimeter?
2598000	2600000	Is it millimeter scale?
2600000	2602000	It should be
2602000	2604000	in micrometer scale.
2604000	2606000	Micrometer scale?
2606000	2608000	Yes.
2608000	2610000	Because it is related to
2610000	2612000	the frequency,
2612000	2614000	the frequency of each mode
2614000	2616000	is actually quite different.
2616000	2618000	So for SH,
2618000	2620000	it is about
2620000	2622000	4,000 to 5,000 meters per second.
2622000	2624000	So if it is operated
2624000	2626000	at 1 gigahertz,
2626000	2628000	its thickness should be
2628000	2630000	less than 1 micron,
2630000	2632000	in order to achieve
2632000	2634000	such a high coupling.
2634000	2636000	I see.
2636000	2638000	Thank you.
2638000	2640000	I have a question here.
2640000	2642000	Sorry.
2642000	2644000	Does KT
2644000	2646000	square
2646000	2648000	equal 100%
2648000	2650000	have any special meaning?
2650000	2652000	Does it mean that their energy can be exchanged?
2652000	2654000	So far,
2654000	2656000	I have not seen 100%.
2656000	2658000	But I think
2658000	2660000	in theory,
2660000	2662000	in terms of definition,
2662000	2664000	it is true.
2664000	2666000	100% means that
2666000	2668000	if you add
2668000	2670000	1 mW RF,
2670000	2672000	it will produce
2672000	2674000	1 mW phonon.
2674000	2676000	I don't know
2676000	2678000	if it can be directly
2678000	2680000	seen as phonon.
2680000	2682000	We generally
2682000	2684000	see it as
2684000	2686000	an energy coin.
2686000	2688000	Because
2688000	2690000	its
2690000	2692000	K effective square
2692000	2694000	is equal to
2694000	2696000	Cm divided by C0.
2696000	2698000	Cm represents
2698000	2700000	motional capacitance.
2700000	2702000	It is actually related to
2702000	2704000	my mechanical strength.
2704000	2706000	C0 is my
2706000	2708000	capacitance,
2708000	2710000	and Cm is my
2710000	2712000	actual capacitance.
2712000	2714000	There are two kinds of energy.
2714000	2716000	The first one is
2716000	2718000	1 mole
2718000	2720000	divided by
2720000	2722000	CmV square.
2722000	2724000	It is a
2724000	2726000	mechanical domain energy.
2726000	2728000	The second one is
2728000	2730000	1 mole divided by
2730000	2732000	C0V square.
2732000	2734000	It is an
2734000	2736000	electrical domain energy.
2736000	2738000	It is 1 mole
2738000	2740000	divided by
2740000	2742000	CmV square.
2742000	2744000	It is a
2744000	2746000	mechanical domain energy.
2746000	2748000	If we imagine it as
2748000	2750000	a wave source,
2750000	2752000	we can also use
2752000	2754000	the MCK system
2754000	2756000	to represent
2756000	2758000	the energy produced
2758000	2760000	by its spring energy
2760000	2762000	and my
2762000	2764000	actual transducer capacitance.
2764000	2766000	Can I use
2766000	2768000	your explanation?
2768000	2770000	Yes.
2774000	2776000	According to
2776000	2778000	their high coupling
2778000	2780000	characteristics,
2780000	2782000	these articles
2782000	2784000	were published
2784000	2786000	in 2015.
2786000	2788000	They are new
2788000	2790000	results.
2790000	2792000	According to
2792000	2794000	their materials,
2794000	2796000	they started
2796000	2798000	to look for
2798000	2800000	new components.
2800000	2802000	The first article
2802000	2804000	is a
2804000	2806000	level-cut module.
2806000	2808000	It
2808000	2810000	uses
2810000	2812000	two
2812000	2814000	pairs of capacitors.
2814000	2816000	It is similar to
2816000	2818000	the form of a fingerprint capacitor,
2818000	2820000	but it has only one pair.
2820000	2822000	It is a
2822000	2824000	level-cut module.
2824000	2826000	It uses
2826000	2828000	two pairs of
2828000	2830000	capacitors
2830000	2832000	to generate
2832000	2834000	SH0
2834000	2836000	by
2836000	2838000	coupling
2838000	2840000	the
2840000	2842000	current
2842000	2844000	and the
2844000	2846000	wave direction.
2846000	2848000	According to
2848000	2850000	their
2850000	2852000	research,
2852000	2854000	SH0
2854000	2856000	generates
2856000	2858000	SH0
2858000	2860000	by coupling
2860000	2862000	the current
2862000	2864000	and the wave direction.
2864000	2866000	SH0
2866000	2868000	generates
2868000	2870000	SH0
2870000	2872000	by coupling
2872000	2874000	the current
2874000	2876000	and the wave direction.
2876000	2878000	We can also see that
2878000	2880000	when we set the frequency
2880000	2882000	to a relatively low range,
2882000	2884000	because some special applications
2884000	2886000	do not require such a high frequency,
2886000	2888000	for example, 50 MHz is enough,
2888000	2890000	its Q can reach 5000,
2890000	2892000	and
2892000	2894000	the coupling is also about 30%.
2894000	2896000	The overall
2896000	2898000	performance indicator,
2898000	2900000	which is KT square times Q,
2900000	2902000	is about 1500.
2902000	2904000	At present,
2904000	2906000	the highest
2906000	2908000	coupling we have
2908000	2910000	is about this level.
2910000	2912000	Of course,
2912000	2914000	we also find that
2914000	2916000	the Q value of the material
2916000	2918000	is quite related
2918000	2920000	to the thickness of
2920000	2922000	the thin film of
2922000	2924000	LN.
2924000	2926000	Because the
2926000	2928000	high-performance,
2928000	2930000	high-Q, high-coupling,
2930000	2932000	and low-frequency capacitors
2932000	2934000	have a thickness of
2934000	2936000	about 2 microns,
2936000	2938000	but the example on the right
2938000	2940000	is a study of
2940000	2942000	EPFL.
2942000	2944000	What they use is very thin,
2944000	2946000	only 400 nm
2946000	2948000	of LN.
2948000	2950000	So,
2950000	2952000	it can be seen that
2952000	2954000	even if it can reach a very high frequency,
2954000	2956000	its Q
2956000	2958000	will drop from 5000
2958000	2960000	to 700.
2960000	2962000	It can also reach
2962000	2964000	a very similar
2964000	2966000	electro-mechanical coupling
2966000	2968000	under the same
2968000	2970000	H over LN,
2970000	2972000	that is,
2972000	2974000	under the thickness of
2974000	2976000	normalization,
2976000	2978000	which is about 30%.
2978000	2980000	The third case is...
2980000	2982000	Sorry,
2982000	2984000	I have a little problem
2984000	2986000	with the previous statement.
2986000	2988000	My intuition is that
2988000	2990000	the effect of
2990000	2992000	LN is very large.
2992000	2994000	Is this right?
2994000	2996000	Or is there another reason?
2996000	2998000	This is our current guess.
2998000	3000000	Because we actually
3000000	3002000	used some AFN methods
3002000	3004000	to measure
3004000	3006000	some extremely thin
3006000	3008000	LN thin films.
3008000	3010000	The roughness of those surfaces
3010000	3012000	is less than 1 nm.
3012000	3014000	So we are not sure
3014000	3016000	why the Q
3016000	3018000	or other performance
3018000	3020000	will go up
3020000	3022000	as long as the film
3022000	3024000	is thin.
3024000	3026000	And when it is thin,
3026000	3028000	the result will be worse.
3028000	3030000	Is there any reason
3030000	3032000	not to make it very thick?
3032000	3034000	Is it going to take a long time?
3034000	3036000	Is it expensive?
3036000	3038000	Mainly based on
3038000	3040000	the previous picture.
3040000	3042000	If my thickness is too thick,
3042000	3044000	I can't enjoy
3044000	3046000	Oh, I got it.
3046000	3048000	Thank you.
3050000	3052000	The third example
3052000	3054000	is the so-called
3054000	3056000	A1 mode resonator.
3056000	3058000	This A1 mode
3058000	3060000	is a high-level LN wave.
3060000	3062000	It looks like
3062000	3064000	it connects
3064000	3066000	many thickness-shear
3066000	3068000	waves together.
3068000	3070000	So we can see
3070000	3072000	its movement
3072000	3074000	is horizontal
3074000	3076000	instead of vertical.
3076000	3078000	The advantage of
3078000	3080000	such a resonator
3080000	3082000	is that
3082000	3084000	its feature size
3084000	3086000	is mainly controlled by
3086000	3088000	its thickness.
3088000	3090000	Because its thickness
3090000	3092000	direction becomes
3092000	3094000	its real 1 in 2 wavelength.
3094000	3096000	So a very thin resonator
3096000	3098000	can achieve
3098000	3100000	a very high frequency
3100000	3102000	of coupling.
3102000	3104000	So in this design,
3104000	3106000	its Q is about
3106000	3108000	300-400.
3108000	3110000	And its
3110000	3112000	operating frequency
3112000	3114000	is about 3.2 GHz.
3114000	3116000	The coupling is about 40%.
3120000	3122000	So by combining
3122000	3124000	the above demonstrations,
3126000	3128000	we can get
3128000	3130000	that S0, SH0
3130000	3132000	and A1 modes
3132000	3134000	are very potent
3134000	3136000	and can be applied
3136000	3138000	in high-level and high-coupling situations.
3138000	3140000	However,
3140000	3142000	there are
3142000	3144000	some relative
3144000	3146000	shortcomings.
3146000	3148000	For example,
3148000	3150000	due to the thinner membrane structure,
3150000	3152000	it becomes unusually fragile.
3152000	3154000	There may be
3154000	3156000	some problems
3156000	3158000	with the coupling.
3158000	3160000	Secondly,
3160000	3162000	lithium niobate
3162000	3164000	is a material
3164000	3166000	with a very low thermal conduction rate.
3166000	3168000	Its thermal conduction rate
3168000	3170000	is only twice that of silicon oxide,
3170000	3172000	which is about 1% or 2% of
3172000	3174000	metal.
3174000	3176000	So it does not conduct heat very well.
3176000	3178000	So when communicating
3178000	3180000	at high power,
3180000	3182000	it can easily
3182000	3184000	have some negative effects.
3184000	3186000	Thirdly,
3186000	3188000	its temperature factor
3188000	3190000	is quite high.
3190000	3192000	So when the temperature
3192000	3194000	changes in the environment,
3194000	3196000	when using mobile phones
3196000	3198000	in the suburbs
3198000	3200000	and in the northern and southern regions,
3200000	3202000	the frequency will change
3202000	3204000	with the temperature.
3204000	3206000	In this case,
3206000	3208000	it is difficult to convince everyone
3208000	3210000	that it can do a good
3210000	3212000	and stable communication.
3212000	3214000	So this is mainly
3214000	3216000	a few problems with this material.
3216000	3218000	However,
3218000	3220000	although it has some problems,
3220000	3222000	some companies
3222000	3224000	and some research institutions
3224000	3226000	have also tried to use
3226000	3228000	such components to make
3228000	3230000	some durable and high-frequency
3230000	3232000	lithium niobate.
3232000	3234000	The N79 filter above
3234000	3236000	satisfies the N79 band
3236000	3238000	mentioned earlier.
3238000	3240000	The frequency is about 10% of the strict conditions.
3240000	3242000	The center frequency is about 5GHz.
3242000	3244000	It uses
3244000	3246000	the so-called A1 mode
3246000	3248000	rectifier.
3248000	3250000	Below is what I did
3250000	3252000	with my colleagues at UIUC.
3252000	3254000	It uses a higher mode
3254000	3256000	to make
3256000	3258000	a 10GHz filter.
3258000	3260000	Of course, it is a demo,
3260000	3262000	so you can see that
3262000	3264000	its passband is not as beautiful
3264000	3266000	as the company's design.
3266000	3268000	Next,
3268000	3270000	I will quickly talk about
3270000	3272000	two case studies.
3272000	3274000	The first one
3274000	3276000	is our goal
3276000	3278000	to reduce
3278000	3280000	the dependence of
3280000	3282000	this rectifier
3282000	3284000	on temperature.
3284000	3286000	Due to this temperature factor,
3286000	3288000	it is mainly related to
3288000	3290000	the material.
3290000	3292000	In terms of Ln,
3292000	3294000	its temperature
3294000	3296000	factor is
3296000	3298000	about 70 to 90 ppm
3298000	3300000	per degree C.
3300000	3302000	According to different
3302000	3304000	cutting surfaces,
3304000	3306000	in order to
3306000	3308000	improve this performance
3308000	3310000	to be enough
3310000	3312000	for the filter
3312000	3314000	or rectifier to be used,
3314000	3316000	we would like to
3316000	3318000	reduce its TCF
3318000	3320000	from 60 to 70 ppm
3320000	3322000	to 20 ppm or less.
3322000	3324000	In order to convince
3324000	3326000	others that
3326000	3328000	it is a candidate
3328000	3330000	for the future
3330000	3332000	wireless communication hardware.
3334000	3336000	Therefore,
3336000	3338000	we do a simplified analysis
3338000	3340000	of its TCF source.
3340000	3342000	TCF actually
3342000	3344000	refers to
3344000	3346000	the frequency,
3346000	3348000	the normalized frequency
3348000	3350000	of temperature.
3350000	3352000	Therefore,
3352000	3354000	in terms of mathematical form,
3354000	3356000	it is partial f, partial t
3356000	3358000	divided by its TCF frequency.
3358000	3360000	After calculation,
3360000	3362000	we can divide it into
3362000	3364000	three elements.
3364000	3366000	Since the frequency
3366000	3368000	is related to
3368000	3370000	the frequency of my wave
3370000	3372000	and the wave
3372000	3374000	is related to the
3374000	3376000	speed of my material
3376000	3378000	and its density,
3378000	3380000	the first element is
3380000	3382000	the frequency of my wave
3382000	3384000	with the change of temperature.
3384000	3386000	The second element is
3386000	3388000	the frequency of my material
3388000	3390000	with the change of temperature.
3390000	3392000	The third element is
3392000	3394000	the frequency of my material
3394000	3396000	with the change of temperature.
3396000	3398000	In addition to these three elements,
3398000	3400000	there is another element
3400000	3402000	that is related to
3402000	3404000	the characteristics of
3404000	3406000	the pressure current.
3406000	3408000	Therefore,
3408000	3410000	we need to understand
3410000	3412000	the characteristics of
3412000	3414000	its material first.
3416000	3418000	Traditionally,
3418000	3420000	the method of temperature compensation
3420000	3422000	has been
3422000	3424000	in modern technology
3424000	3426000	for a long time.
3426000	3428000	There is no better way
3428000	3430000	than this,
3430000	3432000	which is to select
3432000	3434000	a material with
3434000	3436000	a perfect ratio.
3436000	3438000	For example,
3438000	3440000	the temperature factor of lithium niobate
3440000	3442000	is about negative 70 ppm per kelvin.
3442000	3444000	However, silicon oxide,
3444000	3446000	a very common material,
3446000	3448000	has a positive temperature factor
3448000	3450000	of about 90 ppm per kelvin.
3450000	3452000	Therefore,
3452000	3454000	if we can
3454000	3456000	perfectly
3456000	3458000	mix these two materials
3458000	3460000	with a perfect ratio,
3460000	3462000	for example,
3462000	3464000	silicon oxide,
3464000	3466000	we can theoretically
3466000	3468000	reduce Tcf to zero.
3468000	3470000	However,
3470000	3472000	in the process of
3472000	3474000	such a production,
3474000	3476000	we will find
3476000	3478000	that if we ignore
3478000	3480000	the wave
3480000	3482000	and its electric field
3482000	3484000	distribution
3484000	3486000	and its
3486000	3488000	motion distribution,
3488000	3490000	it is actually
3490000	3492000	unpredictable.
3492000	3494000	Secondly,
3494000	3496000	when the film becomes very thin,
3496000	3498000	the metal electrode
3498000	3500000	on the top
3500000	3502000	will also have a certain degree of impact.
3502000	3504000	In particular,
3504000	3506000	the Tcf of the metal electrode
3506000	3508000	is generally quite large.
3508000	3510000	Therefore,
3510000	3512000	when we want to
3512000	3514000	target some thin components
3514000	3516000	with high electromagnetic cohesiveness,
3516000	3518000	we must not ignore
3518000	3520000	the Tcf of the metal electrode.
3520000	3522000	As early as 1985,
3522000	3524000	Professor Kenya Hashimoto
3524000	3526000	discussed
3526000	3528000	some deep-wave
3528000	3530000	temperature coefficients of delay
3530000	3532000	on different surfaces.
3532000	3534000	For example,
3534000	3536000	a special op-amp material
3536000	3538000	has a free surface
3538000	3540000	with a metal electrode on the surface,
3540000	3542000	but there is no power.
3542000	3544000	It is an open-strip.
3544000	3546000	The metal electrode on the surface
3546000	3548000	is short-circuited
3548000	3550000	and becomes short-strip,
3550000	3552000	or the whole surface is covered
3552000	3554000	with metal and grounded.
3554000	3556000	Every situation
3556000	3558000	will show that
3558000	3560000	their Tcf is different.
3560000	3562000	In particular,
3562000	3564000	in the two cases,
3564000	3566000	open-strip and short-strip,
3566000	3568000	the mechanical structure
3568000	3570000	of these two cases
3570000	3572000	has not changed.
3572000	3574000	The difference is
3574000	3576000	whether the Tcf of the metal electrode
3576000	3578000	is grounded or not.
3578000	3580000	It will also have a great impact
3580000	3582000	on the Tcf of the metal electrode.
3582000	3584000	In conclusion,
3584000	3586000	when we deal with
3586000	3588000	a material with
3588000	3590000	high Tcf,
3590000	3592000	we cannot ignore
3592000	3594000	the Tcf of the metal electrode.
3598000	3600000	To solve this problem,
3600000	3602000	we use
3602000	3604000	the so-called
3604000	3606000	multi-section model.
3606000	3608000	Since
3608000	3610000	our goal is
3610000	3612000	relatively simple,
3612000	3614000	it is a deep wave
3614000	3616000	that only circulates in one dimensional space.
3616000	3618000	Therefore,
3618000	3620000	we do not need to develop
3620000	3622000	too complicated 3D analysis.
3622000	3624000	We hope to
3624000	3626000	transform
3626000	3628000	such a complex structure
3628000	3630000	with Tcf and metal
3630000	3632000	into a
3632000	3634000	multi-section model
3634000	3636000	with Tcf
3636000	3638000	and Tcf
3638000	3640000	in different areas
3640000	3642000	with different Tcf
3642000	3644000	and Tcf
3644000	3646000	in different areas
3646000	3648000	with different Tcf
3648000	3650000	and Tcf
3650000	3652000	and Tcf
3652000	3654000	and Tcf
3654000	3656000	and Tcf
3656000	3658000	and Tcf
3658000	3660000	and Tcf
3660000	3662000	and Tcf
3662000	3664000	and Tcf
3664000	3666000	and Tcf
3670000	3672000	We also found that
3672000	3674000	in the case of
3674000	3676000	하대기
3676000	3678000	different areas
3678000	3680000	require different models.
3680000	3682000	For example,
3682000	3684000	we divide the graph into three zones.
3684000	3686000	The first zone
3686000	3688000	is the free surface
3688000	3690000	and the surface is open circuit.
3690000	3692000	That is, the surface has no electric field.
3692000	3694000	The second zone
3694000	3696000	is the metal electrode
3696000	3698000	on the surface
3698000	3700000	and it gives a fixed voltage.
3700000	3702000	It may be
3702000	3704000	a small signal
3704000	3706000	that is dc ground.
3708000	3710000	Its condition will become
3710000	3712000	a metallized surface
3712000	3714000	and a short circuit
3714000	3716000	boundary condition.
3716000	3718000	The third zone is more complicated
3718000	3720000	because it is between two electrodes
3720000	3722000	and it will
3722000	3724000	have a horizontal electric field
3724000	3726000	between the two electrodes.
3726000	3728000	So we guess
3728000	3730000	when the metallization ratio
3730000	3732000	is very high,
3732000	3734000	we should think
3734000	3736000	that the surface
3736000	3738000	has no electric field
3738000	3740000	and it is a free surface
3740000	3742000	with a short circuit boundary.
3742000	3744000	When the metal
3744000	3746000	is very small
3746000	3748000	and the two electrodes are
3748000	3750000	very far away,
3750000	3752000	maybe we should use
3752000	3754000	the open circuit boundary
3754000	3756000	to describe it.
3756000	3758000	Based on this idea,
3758000	3760000	we also use
3760000	3762000	the method of
3762000	3764000	finite element
3764000	3766000	to simulate
3766000	3768000	a thin film of
3768000	3770000	lithium niobate
3770000	3772000	to observe the temperature change
3772000	3774000	and we can see
3774000	3776000	that its result
3776000	3778000	is quite similar
3778000	3780000	to what we just guessed.
3780000	3782000	When the wavelength
3782000	3784000	is very long,
3786000	3788000	it should be said
3788000	3790000	that it will
3790000	3792000	use the gap
3792000	3794000	as a boundary
3794000	3796000	of 2λ.
3796000	3798000	When the wavelength
3798000	3800000	is less than 2λ,
3800000	3802000	we generally
3802000	3804000	regard it as a short circuit
3804000	3806000	and if it is larger,
3806000	3808000	we regard it as
3808000	3810000	an open circuit boundary.
3812000	3814000	Based on this hypothesis,
3814000	3816000	we can simulate
3816000	3818000	the temperature coefficient
3818000	3820000	under three different cases
3820000	3822000	and then
3822000	3824000	combine it
3824000	3826000	with the mathematical formula
3826000	3828000	we just introduced.
3828000	3830000	Theoretically,
3830000	3832000	we can predict
3832000	3834000	the temperature coefficient
3834000	3836000	of the uniformly distributed
3836000	3838000	resistors.
3840000	3842000	In order to
3842000	3844000	do the experimental verification,
3844000	3846000	we made
3846000	3848000	two different resistors.
3848000	3850000	The first one
3850000	3852000	has a mechanical electrode
3852000	3854000	and a capacitor.
3854000	3856000	It can stimulate
3856000	3858000	the magnetic field of the resistors.
3858000	3860000	The second one
3860000	3862000	has a capacitor and a capacitor
3862000	3864000	to stimulate the magnetic field
3864000	3866000	of the capacitors.
3868000	3870000	I have an idea.
3870000	3872000	Sorry.
3872000	3874000	Will it be published?
3874000	3876000	Well,
3876000	3878000	you give it
3878000	3880000	a DC bias,
3880000	3882000	VIN,
3882000	3884000	and GND.
3884000	3886000	Then you use the
3886000	3888000	SIO2 to
3888000	3890000	hold the material
3890000	3892000	you want.
3892000	3894000	If you give it
3894000	3896000	a DC current,
3896000	3898000	it will push
3898000	3900000	each other away.
3900000	3902000	If you give it
3902000	3904000	a DC current,
3904000	3906000	it will push
3906000	3908000	each other away.
3908000	3910000	If you give it
3910000	3912000	a DC current,
3912000	3914000	it will push
3914000	3916000	each other away.
3916000	3918000	Then you can use
3918000	3920000	the electrodes to
3920000	3922000	hold the substrate.
3922000	3924000	You can use
3924000	3926000	the DC current
3926000	3928000	to resist
3928000	3930000	the temperature coefficient.
3930000	3932000	Is it feasible?
3932000	3934000	Let me think about it.
3934000	3936000	The DC current
3936000	3938000	is from the VIN, right?
3938000	3940000	Yes.
3940000	3942000	I didn't say that.
3942000	3944000	I made a mistake.
3950000	3952000	The two pictures
3952000	3954000	are the experimental
3954000	3956000	components.
3956000	3958000	The picture on the left
3958000	3960000	has three electrodes.
3960000	3962000	Because it has
3962000	3964000	a capacitive electrode,
3964000	3966000	it is suitable to
3966000	3968000	stimulate the osmosis.
3968000	3970000	The picture on the right
3970000	3972000	has two electrodes,
3972000	3974000	but it is arranged
3974000	3976000	as an array.
3976000	3978000	The array
3978000	3980000	doesn't affect
3980000	3982000	the temperature coefficient.
3982000	3984000	We use the array
3984000	3986000	to connect
3986000	3988000	all the electrodes
3988000	3990000	to enhance the output signal
3990000	3992000	for easy observation.
3992000	3994000	Then we can
3994000	3996000	process the components.
3996000	3998000	First of all,
3998000	4000000	we take a lithium-niobate wafer
4000000	4002000	and
4002000	4004000	use a low-temperature
4004000	4006000	layer of
4006000	4008000	oxidized gas
4008000	4010000	on the surface.
4010000	4012000	We use the exposure
4012000	4014000	to define the
4014000	4016000	assembly shape of the components.
4016000	4018000	Then we use
4018000	4020000	a dry-etching method
4020000	4022000	to remove
4022000	4024000	lithium-niobate and
4024000	4026000	silicon oxide at the same time.
4026000	4028000	The dry-etching
4028000	4030000	mainly uses
4030000	4032000	some gas from the filter,
4032000	4034000	which has a stronger
4034000	4036000	activity relationship
4036000	4038000	to successfully remove
4038000	4040000	these two materials.
4040000	4042000	After the assembly
4042000	4044000	of the components is completed,
4044000	4046000	another exposure
4046000	4048000	is used
4048000	4050000	to apply
4050000	4052000	the metal electrode
4052000	4054000	using the lift-off method.
4054000	4056000	Finally, we use the
4056000	4058000	XF2 gas
4058000	4060000	to remove
4060000	4062000	the silicon oxide
4062000	4064000	at the bottom
4064000	4066000	to make the components.
4066000	4068000	As you can see,
4068000	4070000	there are two cuts
4070000	4072000	around the components.
4072000	4074000	These two lines
4074000	4076000	not only define
4076000	4078000	the area around the components
4078000	4080000	with darker brown color,
4080000	4082000	but also the area
4082000	4084000	where the silicon oxide
4084000	4086000	is removed.
4086000	4088000	In the experiment,
4088000	4090000	we measured
4090000	4092000	two different
4092000	4094000	electrode components.
4094000	4096000	First of all,
4096000	4098000	two electrode devices
4098000	4100000	will trigger
4100000	4102000	1,3,5,7,9 and so on.
4102000	4104000	Due to the high-strength
4104000	4106000	silicon oxide,
4106000	4108000	it also produces
4108000	4110000	a lot of free smoke,
4110000	4112000	so we don't
4112000	4114000	specifically discuss
4114000	4116000	those electrodes.
4116000	4118000	We only discuss
4118000	4120000	the first three
4120000	4122000	electrodes of each design.
4122000	4124000	For this device,
4124000	4126000	its Q is 450,
4126000	4128000	KT2 is 5.5
4128000	4130000	for free smoke,
4130000	4132000	and TCF can also
4132000	4134000	be used.
4134000	4136000	Its displacement
4136000	4138000	and shear stress
4138000	4140000	are different,
4140000	4142000	but its electrode
4142000	4144000	won't change with the mode.
4144000	4146000	So,
4146000	4148000	these different modes
4148000	4150000	also have different
4150000	4152000	temperature factors.
4152000	4154000	We can also observe
4154000	4156000	similar phenomena
4156000	4158000	from these three electrode devices.
4158000	4160000	We trigger the so-called
4160000	4162000	Q, which is around
4162000	4164000	1,000 or 3,000,
4164000	4166000	KT2 is around 12%
4166000	4168000	for free smoke,
4168000	4170000	and its three
4170000	4172000	temperature factors are also different.
4172000	4174000	According to the previous theory,
4174000	4176000	we can calculate
4176000	4178000	its
4180000	4182000	theoretical temperature factor
4182000	4184000	and compare it with the experiment.
4184000	4186000	What we can see
4186000	4188000	is that
4188000	4190000	the simulation of model
4190000	4192000	and finite element are quite similar.
4192000	4194000	Their error is less than 1%,
4194000	4196000	but compared with the measurement,
4196000	4198000	the error is around
4198000	4200000	3%.
4200000	4202000	Although
4202000	4204000	the expected result
4204000	4206000	is slightly worse than
4206000	4208000	the expected result,
4208000	4210000	I think
4210000	4212000	its accuracy
4212000	4214000	can be used
4214000	4216000	to design more detailed components.
4216000	4218000	Or,
4218000	4220000	we don't need to rely on
4220000	4222000	finite element before
4222000	4224000	actually making the components.
4224000	4226000	We can directly calculate
4226000	4228000	the value of our temperature factor
4228000	4230000	to assist designers
4230000	4232000	in the design of
4232000	4234000	compressors and filters.
4234000	4236000	This is the conclusion.
4236000	4238000	We use some methods
4238000	4240000	to calculate its temperature factor,
4240000	4242000	and
4242000	4244000	its error is quite small
4244000	4246000	compared with the previous theory.
4246000	4248000	The second case is
4248000	4250000	the research I did
4250000	4252000	after I came back to Taiwan.
4252000	4254000	The main reason is that
4254000	4256000	we encountered
4256000	4258000	a big problem
4258000	4260000	in the production of components.
4260000	4262000	It was found in the
4262000	4264000	Lillian Nile Basin Fin Action.
4264000	4266000	The RF power required
4266000	4268000	for this action
4268000	4270000	is quite large,
4270000	4272000	about 800-900W.
4272000	4274000	Generally speaking,
4274000	4276000	there is not much RF power
4276000	4278000	in the Lillian Nile Basin Fin Action,
4278000	4280000	because the RF power
4280000	4282000	is quite old.
4282000	4284000	So,
4284000	4286000	before we start
4286000	4288000	the research on
4288000	4290000	RF components,
4290000	4292000	we need to
4292000	4294000	pull back our research
4294000	4296000	to see the effect.
4296000	4298000	At the same time,
4298000	4300000	we hope to solve
4300000	4302000	the problem of
4302000	4304000	thermal conductivity.
4304000	4306000	The thermal conductivity problem
4306000	4308000	of LN-SINFIN device
4308000	4310000	mainly comes from two reasons.
4310000	4312000	The first one is
4312000	4314000	the high temperature factor,
4314000	4316000	and the second one is
4316000	4318000	the poor thermal conductivity.
4318000	4320000	So, when you drive
4320000	4322000	with high power,
4322000	4324000	you will find that
4324000	4326000	the frequency starts to decrease
4326000	4328000	near the rectifier.
4328000	4330000	So, when the temperature
4330000	4332000	changes,
4332000	4334000	the frequency starts to change.
4334000	4336000	Therefore,
4336000	4338000	if there is no good thermal conductivity,
4338000	4340000	the frequency will
4340000	4342000	decrease
4342000	4344000	as you drive
4344000	4346000	with higher power.
4346000	4348000	So, there will be
4348000	4350000	a non-thermal phenomenon.
4350000	4352000	If there is a non-thermal phenomenon
4352000	4354000	in the rectifier,
4354000	4356000	it means that
4356000	4358000	there will be a non-thermal phenomenon
4358000	4360000	in the rectifier itself,
4360000	4362000	which may cause
4362000	4364000	a distortion
4364000	4366000	when the signal is transmitted,
4366000	4368000	or even increase
4368000	4370000	the error rate
4370000	4372000	of the code, etc.
4372000	4374000	So, in order to
4374000	4376000	solve this problem,
4376000	4378000	there is a group of
4378000	4380000	ideas that
4380000	4382000	we can come back
4382000	4384000	and use the concept of SOHL
4384000	4386000	to bind the LN synth
4386000	4388000	to a substrate
4388000	4390000	with a block reflector.
4390000	4392000	We can use
4392000	4394000	these reflectors
4394000	4396000	to virtually
4396000	4398000	create a floating resonator
4398000	4400000	that can
4400000	4402000	reproduce the
4402000	4404000	sound wave reflection
4404000	4406000	characteristics.
4406000	4408000	In fact, it is directly
4408000	4410000	bound to the board.
4410000	4412000	If it is directly
4412000	4414000	bound to the board,
4414000	4416000	it can actually
4416000	4418000	enhance the efficiency of
4418000	4420000	heat transfer,
4420000	4422000	so that it can theoretically
4422000	4424000	solve the problem of
4424000	4426000	temperature non-thermal.
4426000	4428000	In fact, this idea
4428000	4430000	already had a series of
4430000	4432000	patents in 2004 and 2009,
4432000	4434000	but it has not been
4434000	4436000	developed well.
4436000	4438000	Mainly because
4438000	4440000	there was not enough technology
4440000	4442000	to produce LN synths.
4442000	4444000	However, it has become possible
4444000	4446000	in recent years,
4446000	4448000	so this also forms
4448000	4450000	a new research direction.
4452000	4454000	In particular,
4454000	4456000	there are two professors
4456000	4458000	from the University of
4458000	4460000	Tokyo, Japan,
4460000	4462000	Michio Katota and
4462000	4464000	Shuji Tanaka.
4464000	4466000	They use
4466000	4468000	the structure of
4468000	4470000	LN synths.
4470000	4472000	They successfully demonstrated
4472000	4474000	that even if it is a
4474000	4476000	SO type resonator,
4476000	4478000	my coupling can also be
4478000	4480000	greater than 40% and
4480000	4482000	operate at high frequency.
4482000	4484000	It is like the
4484000	4486000	newly introduced
4486000	4488000	release synth
4488000	4490000	resonator.
4490000	4492000	I don't release it,
4492000	4494000	but I bound it to
4494000	4496000	the sound wave reflection layer
4496000	4498000	with a very strong boundary.
4498000	4500000	It can be seen as a
4500000	4502000	release component.
4502000	4504000	The same design concept
4504000	4506000	was also adopted by the company.
4506000	4508000	Murata called it
4508000	4510000	IHP-SOL,
4510000	4512000	Incredible High Performance-SOL.
4512000	4514000	Through some
4514000	4516000	designs,
4516000	4518000	its coupling
4518000	4520000	can be maintained at
4520000	4522000	about 9%.
4522000	4524000	Mainly, the company uses
4524000	4526000	a relatively low coupling,
4526000	4528000	but its Q can be greater than 3000.
4528000	4530000	Murata's idea is
4530000	4532000	that they don't want to
4532000	4534000	use so many layers of reflectors.
4534000	4536000	For example, it needs
4536000	4538000	two materials,
4538000	4540000	silicon oxide and
4540000	4542000	aluminum nitrate,
4542000	4544000	to stack five or six layers
4544000	4546000	to make this reflector.
4546000	4548000	From the perspective of the company,
4548000	4550000	this design method is not economical,
4550000	4552000	so they hope to use
4552000	4554000	a single silicon oxide layer
4554000	4556000	as the simplest
4556000	4558000	reflector.
4558000	4560000	In fact,
4560000	4562000	they have observed
4562000	4564000	a pretty good effect,
4564000	4566000	because it raises the Q
4566000	4568000	to more than 3000.
4568000	4570000	Based on this idea,
4570000	4572000	at least
4572000	4574000	at this stage
4574000	4576000	of my investment,
4576000	4578000	no one has discussed
4578000	4580000	Synthene Lithium Niobate
4580000	4582000	on silicon oxide
4582000	4584000	on silicon.
4584000	4586000	So,
4586000	4588000	we raise the Q
4588000	4590000	to this level.
4590000	4592000	The wafers we use
4592000	4594000	are silicon
4594000	4596000	500μm,
4596000	4598000	silicon oxide 2μm,
4598000	4600000	and the transfer Ln
4600000	4602000	is 0.7μm.
4602000	4604000	We hope
4604000	4606000	to use the so-called
4606000	4608000	shear horizontal sole.
4608000	4610000	Its wave motion
4610000	4612000	is like the picture on the right.
4612000	4614000	It is a cut wave on the surface,
4614000	4616000	so its motion
4616000	4618000	will decrease rapidly
4618000	4620000	in the substrate.
4620000	4622000	So, we think it has a chance
4622000	4624000	to become a high-Q,
4624000	4626000	high-coupling model.
4626000	4628000	By inserting a layer of
4628000	4630000	oxide between
4630000	4632000	Synthene Ln and silicon substrate,
4632000	4634000	it should be able to effectively
4634000	4636000	reduce the leakage
4636000	4638000	to the substrate.
4640000	4642000	For this structure,
4642000	4644000	we study
4644000	4646000	its propagation direction.
4646000	4648000	We use the Final Element
4648000	4650000	to simulate
4650000	4652000	its wave distribution
4652000	4654000	at different thickness
4654000	4656000	of lithium niobate
4656000	4658000	when it is
4658000	4660000	propagated on the
4660000	4662000	two-dimensional plane.
4662000	4664000	By
4664000	4666000	setting the surface
4666000	4668000	of the crystal
4668000	4670000	as open
4670000	4672000	or short-circuit condition,
4672000	4674000	based on the
4674000	4676000	so-called
4676000	4678000	outerless approach,
4678000	4680000	we can calculate
4680000	4682000	the size of
4682000	4684000	its base
4684000	4686000	lithium niobate.
4686000	4688000	So,
4688000	4690000	we can see that
4690000	4692000	the SH sole
4692000	4694000	has a very large
4694000	4696000	difference in coupling.
4696000	4698000	In order to get the highest coupling,
4698000	4700000	the propagation direction
4700000	4702000	will be selected
4702000	4704000	at the angle of
4704000	4706000	10 degrees
4706000	4708000	backward on the y-axis.
4708000	4710000	By combining
4710000	4712000	the simulation results
4712000	4714000	at different thicknesses
4714000	4716000	of lithium niobate,
4716000	4718000	we can also find that
4718000	4720000	its lithium niobate
4720000	4722000	is also a
4722000	4724000	design parameter that
4724000	4726000	we can control.
4726000	4728000	After understanding the
4728000	4730000	propagation direction,
4730000	4732000	we start to study
4732000	4734000	its dispersion behavior.
4734000	4736000	It can be seen that
4736000	4738000	when there is no electric shock
4738000	4740000	on the surface,
4740000	4742000	such as the previous situation,
4742000	4744000	when the thickness of lithium niobate
4744000	4746000	is greater than 0.15,
4746000	4748000	the coupling will
4748000	4750000	decrease.
4750000	4752000	This situation is
4752000	4754000	quite similar to
4754000	4756000	the plate wave of SH0.
4756000	4758000	That is to say,
4758000	4760000	the dotted line above
4760000	4762000	and the purple dotted line
4762000	4764000	below
4764000	4766000	have a similar
4766000	4768000	coupling reduction mode.
4768000	4770000	However,
4770000	4772000	we also find that
4772000	4774000	when we apply some electric shock
4774000	4776000	on the surface,
4776000	4778000	especially the heavier metal,
4778000	4780000	the higher the rate of increase.
4780000	4782000	Similarly,
4782000	4784000	through simulation observations,
4784000	4786000	we find that
4786000	4788000	when the metal on the surface
4788000	4790000	is heavier,
4790000	4792000	it can actually help
4792000	4794000	the horizontal wave
4794000	4796000	to concentrate
4796000	4798000	the strain energy
4798000	4800000	on the surface.
4800000	4802000	Since most of the strain energy
4802000	4804000	is concentrated in the opaque layer,
4804000	4806000	it has a chance
4806000	4808000	to get a higher coupling.
4808000	4810000	That is to say,
4810000	4812000	when the thickness
4812000	4814000	of the metal electrode
4814000	4816000	is limited,
4816000	4818000	we should use
4818000	4820000	the heavier metal
4820000	4822000	to design
4822000	4824000	to get a higher coupling.
4824000	4826000	For example,
4826000	4828000	this is a comparison
4828000	4830000	between gold and aluminum.
4830000	4832000	It can be seen that
4832000	4834000	when the thickness of gold
4834000	4836000	is 0.025 lambda,
4836000	4838000	it can actually
4838000	4840000	increase the coupling to 40%.
4840000	4842000	However,
4842000	4844000	aluminum, which is a lighter material,
4844000	4846000	needs a thicker electrode
4846000	4848000	to achieve a similar effect.
4850000	4852000	The last part
4852000	4854000	is to discuss
4854000	4856000	the impact of different modes.
4856000	4858000	Since
4858000	4860000	we want to use SH
4860000	4862000	as a target,
4862000	4864000	we compare SH
4864000	4866000	and Longitudinal Leaky Soul
4866000	4868000	to see
4868000	4870000	what is the difference
4870000	4872000	between the two modes.
4872000	4874000	Through analysis,
4874000	4876000	it can be found that
4876000	4878000	SH Soul is more likely
4878000	4880000	to be affected
4880000	4882000	by the two-layer structure
4882000	4884000	of lithium niobate and silicon arsenide.
4884000	4886000	However, Leaky Soul
4886000	4888000	has a larger position
4888000	4890000	than SH Soul,
4890000	4892000	which means that
4892000	4894000	its wave is more likely
4894000	4896000	to be lost by substrate transmission.
4896000	4898000	Therefore,
4898000	4900000	it can be seen that
4900000	4902000	the impedance ratio
4902000	4904000	of Leaky Soul
4904000	4906000	is about 20-30 dB higher
4906000	4908000	than that of SH Soul.
4908000	4910000	Therefore,
4910000	4912000	it is not a good choice.
4912000	4914000	Finally,
4914000	4916000	in order to verify
4916000	4918000	the effect of SH Soul,
4918000	4920000	we use the
4920000	4922000	OnePort single-layer
4922000	4924000	SH Soul resonator
4924000	4926000	with traditional IDT electrode
4926000	4928000	and grating reflector.
4928000	4930000	However,
4930000	4932000	unlike the traditional one,
4932000	4934000	we use a
4934000	4936000	Synthene-Lithium Niobate
4936000	4938000	on silicon arsenide
4938000	4940000	on silicon
4940000	4942000	as a reference point.
4942000	4944000	This is the
4944000	4946000	one-port single-layer
4946000	4948000	SH Soul resonator.
4948000	4950000	In addition,
4950000	4952000	SH Soul has a
4952000	4954000	smaller position
4954000	4956000	than SH Soul,
4956000	4958000	which means
4958000	4960000	that
4960000	4962000	its wave
4962000	4964000	leakage is
4964000	4966000	relatively small.
4966000	4968000	Therefore,
4968000	4970000	its wave
4970000	4972000	leakage is
4972000	4974000	relatively small.
4974000	4976000	The picture in the lower right corner
4976000	4978000	is the actual
4978000	4980000	picture of the component.
4980000	4982000	In this picture,
4982000	4984000	its wave length is 8 microns.
4984000	4986000	Finally,
4986000	4988000	this is the result of the experiment.
4988000	4990000	We selected
4990000	4992000	3 different components,
4992000	4994000	Lambda,
4994000	4996000	8, 6, and 4 microns
4996000	4998000	to compare.
4998000	5000000	It can be seen that
5000000	5002000	the difference in Q
5002000	5004000	is relatively large.
5004000	5006000	Here we use
5006000	5008000	the definition of body Q,
5008000	5010000	which is to use its group delay
5010000	5012000	and its S11
5012000	5014000	to calculate its Q value.
5014000	5016000	Its definition of Q is
5016000	5018000	similar to the traditional one,
5018000	5020000	but through a new formula,
5020000	5022000	which is the formula of body Q,
5022000	5024000	it can equalize
5024000	5026000	every Q value
5026000	5028000	on this resonance scale,
5028000	5030000	and it can be seen that
5030000	5032000	the highest Q value
5032000	5034000	of the resonator
5034000	5036000	we designed
5036000	5038000	is about 960,
5038000	5040000	and the carbon
5040000	5042000	is about 25.5%.
5042000	5044000	Therefore,
5044000	5046000	FOM is about 245.
5046000	5048000	Compared with the traditional
5048000	5050000	F-bar resonator,
5050000	5052000	its performance indicator
5052000	5054000	is between 100 and 200.
5054000	5056000	Therefore,
5056000	5058000	more than 200
5058000	5060000	indicates that
5060000	5062000	the component we designed
5062000	5064000	has a certain performance.
5064000	5066000	At least,
5066000	5068000	it may outperform
5068000	5070000	some low-performance
5070000	5072000	F-bar components.
5072000	5074000	We also
5074000	5076000	measured
5076000	5078000	the power handling
5078000	5080000	of this resonator.
5080000	5082000	It can be seen
5082000	5084000	that
5084000	5086000	compared with
5086000	5088000	the previously released
5088000	5090000	SYNFIN
5090000	5092000	lithium-ion battery components,
5092000	5094000	this SO-TYPE
5094000	5096000	resonator
5096000	5098000	does not have
5098000	5100000	any significant
5100000	5102000	fluctuation
5102000	5104000	after 10 dBm RF power.
5104000	5106000	Therefore,
5106000	5108000	it can be further verified
5108000	5110000	that when I use
5110000	5112000	SO-TYPE components,
5112000	5114000	it can dissipate heat
5114000	5116000	through the base plate,
5116000	5118000	which can greatly improve
5118000	5120000	the power handling problem.
5122000	5124000	At the same time,
5124000	5126000	we also used the combination
5126000	5128000	of different thicknesses
5128000	5130000	of L-N and C-NR
5130000	5132000	to get a higher
5132000	5134000	capacitance coefficient
5134000	5136000	of more than 36%,
5136000	5138000	but its Q is reduced
5138000	5140000	to about 250.
5140000	5142000	This is a prediction
5142000	5144000	from the metal we used.
5144000	5146000	Due to the
5146000	5148000	absorption of
5148000	5150000	the acoustic of the metal,
5150000	5152000	it is actually much
5152000	5154000	stronger than aluminum.
5154000	5156000	In other words,
5156000	5158000	the loss of the metal
5158000	5160000	is much greater than that
5160000	5162000	of aluminum,
5162000	5164000	which is about 4-5 times higher.
5164000	5166000	Therefore, we estimate
5166000	5168000	that the Q of the components
5168000	5170000	is the effect of the metal electrode.
5170000	5172000	However, this still needs further verification.
5172000	5174000	Through such a high-coupling
5174000	5176000	resonator,
5176000	5178000	its coupling is about 38%-35%,
5178000	5180000	we can use
5180000	5182000	such a resonator
5182000	5184000	to synthesize the filter.
5184000	5186000	We used five
5186000	5188000	resonators to synthesize
5188000	5190000	the filter,
5190000	5192000	and in the software,
5192000	5194000	we made it
5194000	5196000	sound
5196000	5198000	and input
5198000	5200000	and output matching.
5200000	5202000	We can find that
5202000	5204000	we can potentially
5204000	5206000	increase the frequency to 29%,
5206000	5208000	and the insertion loss is less than
5208000	5210000	the standard 3dB.
5210000	5212000	This also verifies that
5212000	5214000	the higher the coupling of
5214000	5216000	my resonator,
5216000	5218000	we will have the opportunity to
5218000	5220000	make a wider filter to meet
5220000	5222000	the growing needs of
5222000	5224000	5G communication.
5224000	5226000	So this is my
5226000	5228000	second part of the conclusion.
5228000	5230000	We used
5230000	5232000	Synthene Lithium Niobate
5232000	5234000	on Substrate to
5234000	5236000	make the SOHL components.
5236000	5238000	We can increase the coupling
5238000	5240000	to more than 20% or 30%,
5240000	5242000	and the Q can be nearly 1000.
5242000	5244000	And we also
5244000	5246000	verified that
5246000	5248000	using these high-coupling devices,
5248000	5250000	we have the opportunity to get
5250000	5252000	a very large filter
5252000	5254000	and the insertion loss
5254000	5256000	can also meet the needs of
5256000	5258000	communication.
5258000	5260000	The loss will be less than 3dB.
5260000	5262000	In the future,
5262000	5264000	we hope to
5264000	5266000	improve our
5266000	5268000	manufacturing capacity
5268000	5270000	and make the frequency
5270000	5272000	higher.
5272000	5274000	In addition to
5274000	5276000	our manufacturing capacity,
5276000	5278000	we will also need
5278000	5280000	to find
5280000	5282000	more interesting models
5282000	5284000	to support our research.
5284000	5286000	Finally,
5286000	5288000	of course,
5288000	5290000	there is a projection.
5290000	5292000	Lithium Niobate
5292000	5294000	is a very strong
5294000	5296000	supply material.
5296000	5298000	It also has a very interesting
5298000	5300000	optical feature,
5300000	5302000	but I don't understand this part.
5302000	5304000	Now there are also several more
5304000	5306000	well-known groups
5306000	5308000	to invest and research
5308000	5310000	acoustic optical devices.
5310000	5312000	For example, Stanford
5312000	5314000	and Harvard have
5314000	5316000	some teams
5316000	5318000	to discuss this.
5318000	5320000	Finally, I would like to
5320000	5322000	thank my founding
5322000	5324000	research, my students,
5324000	5326000	and my ex-bosses.
5326000	5328000	My report ends here.
5328000	5330000	Thank you.
5330000	5332000	OK, thank you Ming-Huang for
5332000	5334000	bringing us such a wonderful speech.
5334000	5336000	Let me see
5336000	5338000	if anyone has any questions.
5338000	5340000	If you do,
5340000	5342000	please turn on your microphone
5342000	5344000	or leave your question
5344000	5346000	in the chat dialog.
5346000	5348000	I can help you ask Ming-Huang.
5348000	5350000	I want to ask
5350000	5352000	a question.
5352000	5354000	Can you hear me?
5354000	5356000	Yes.
5356000	5358000	Hello, my name is Shreff.
5358000	5360000	I am a PhD student
5360000	5362000	at Taitung University.
5362000	5364000	I have read
5364000	5366000	several of your papers.
5366000	5368000	Previously,
5368000	5370000	Rob Candler
5370000	5372000	from UCLA
5372000	5374000	came to visit.
5374000	5376000	I worked with him
5376000	5378000	at that time.
5378000	5380000	However,
5380000	5382000	I was doing
5382000	5384000	fieldwork.
5384000	5386000	The papers you wrote
5386000	5388000	were about piezoelectric radiation.
5388000	5390000	Now,
5390000	5392000	I am also working on this.
5392000	5394000	I am glad
5394000	5396000	to hear
5396000	5398000	your speech today.
5398000	5400000	It is rare
5400000	5402000	to find such advanced research in China.
5402000	5404000	For example,
5404000	5406000	there should be
5406000	5408000	no manufacturers
5408000	5410000	in Taiwan.
5410000	5412000	Yes.
5412000	5414000	I don't know
5414000	5416000	if there are any
5416000	5418000	in Taiwan,
5418000	5420000	but there should be none.
5420000	5422000	I have read
5422000	5424000	your papers.
5424000	5426000	For example,
5426000	5428000	piezoelectric radiation
5428000	5430000	is done by UCLA
5430000	5432000	and Northeastern.
5432000	5434000	Piezoelectric radiation
5434000	5436000	is done by piezoelectric
5436000	5438000	and magnetic materials.
5438000	5440000	It is a big topic.
5440000	5442000	I want to know
5442000	5444000	the difference between
5444000	5446000	piezoelectric radiation
5446000	5448000	and magnetic materials.
5448000	5450000	I think
5450000	5452000	there are many
5452000	5454000	deep
5454000	5456000	physical phenomena
5456000	5458000	to discuss.
5458000	5460000	When we were
5460000	5462000	implementing the AMIBA project,
5462000	5464000	our main competition
5464000	5466000	was a Stanford group.
5466000	5468000	Their papers were published
5468000	5470000	earlier than ours
5470000	5472000	in Nature Communication.
5472000	5474000	You can read it.
5474000	5476000	They used a stick-shaped lithium-ion battery.
5476000	5478000	It should be
5478000	5480000	8 or 10 cm long.
5480000	5482000	It was a
5482000	5484000	metal stick.
5484000	5486000	They used
5486000	5488000	some suspension
5488000	5490000	to float it in the air
5490000	5492000	and make it vibrate
5492000	5494000	to radiate electromagnetic waves.
5494000	5496000	There were
5496000	5498000	several difficulties
5498000	5500000	that they didn't overcome.
5500000	5502000	First,
5502000	5504000	the surface of the battery
5504000	5506000	was exposed
5506000	5508000	to electromagnetic radiation
5508000	5510000	near the electrode.
5510000	5512000	It means
5512000	5514000	the battery
5514000	5516000	lost a lot of energy.
5516000	5518000	Second,
5518000	5520000	its Q was too high.
5520000	5522000	I think it was
5522000	5524000	between 100,000 and 1 million.
5524000	5526000	It ran down very slowly.
5526000	5528000	It seemed
5528000	5530000	that such a system
5530000	5532000	was not suitable
5532000	5534000	for communication.
5534000	5536000	It took a long time
5536000	5538000	to go from 1 to 0.
5538000	5540000	So they could only
5540000	5542000	use frequency modulation.
5542000	5544000	Frequency modulation
5544000	5546000	may also be affected
5546000	5548000	by its high Q.
5548000	5550000	If you are interested,
5550000	5552000	I think you can read
5552000	5554000	their papers.
5554000	5556000	We decided to use
5556000	5558000	PZT later.
5558000	5560000	We found a PZT manufacturer
5560000	5562000	that could provide
5562000	5564000	high-quality buck PZT.
5564000	5566000	Its Q was over 1,000.
5566000	5568000	It was very rare.
5568000	5570000	We used PZT.
5570000	5572000	But PZT had its own problem.
5572000	5574000	Its dielectric constant was too high.
5574000	5576000	So it
5576000	5578000	had almost no so-called
5578000	5580000	field-to-field effect.
5580000	5582000	It went from the moment
5582000	5584000	it left Resonator
5584000	5586000	to its original state.
5586000	5588000	But I think
5588000	5590000	PZT was not suitable
5590000	5592000	for communication.
5592000	5594000	Especially for measuring.
5594000	5596000	We measured it for a month or two.
5596000	5598000	But we found
5598000	5600000	that it was wrong.
5600000	5602000	Actually,
5602000	5604000	I used
5604000	5606000	Urban Nitride.
5606000	5608000	But I asked
5608000	5610000	UCL to make it.
5610000	5612000	They measured
5612000	5614000	the resistance
5614000	5616000	of the resistor.
5616000	5618000	So we couldn't measure anything.
5618000	5620000	PZT is made of
5620000	5622000	resin material.
5622000	5624000	So it's not that easy.
5624000	5626000	Yes.
5626000	5628000	I saw
5628000	5630000	they made
5630000	5632000	some other
5632000	5634000	alloy materials.
5634000	5636000	Not PZT.
5636000	5638000	Yes.
5638000	5640000	In this field,
5640000	5642000	you know
5642000	5644000	they made
5644000	5646000	PZT.
5646000	5648000	They have a
5648000	5650000	very strong
5650000	5652000	material team in
5652000	5654000	Northeast University.
5654000	5656000	Otherwise,
5656000	5658000	they are not
5658000	5660000	specialized in materials.
5660000	5662000	So I think
5662000	5664000	it's not that easy.
5664000	5666000	Another question
5666000	5668000	about architecture.
5668000	5670000	I don't have the answer yet.
5670000	5672000	For example,
5672000	5674000	they call it
5674000	5676000	mechanical antenna.
5676000	5678000	Mechanical antenna.
5678000	5680000	You can find
5680000	5682000	some articles
5682000	5684000	about it.
5684000	5686000	For example,
5686000	5688000	about radiation efficiency
5688000	5690000	and size,
5690000	5692000	we talked about
5692000	5694000	due limit.
5694000	5696000	I read some articles
5696000	5698000	that say
5698000	5700000	mechanical antenna
5700000	5702000	but I
5702000	5704000	don't understand it.
5704000	5706000	I don't understand it.
5706000	5708000	Yes.
5708000	5710000	When I was in the US,
5710000	5712000	our boss
5712000	5714000	told us about it.
5714000	5716000	He thought it could
5716000	5718000	go beyond the limit.
5718000	5720000	He wanted us to write
5720000	5722000	a theoretical paper.
5722000	5724000	But later,
5724000	5726000	he wanted to meet
5726000	5728000	DAPA's schedule.
5728000	5730000	So we just ignored it.
5730000	5732000	It doesn't seem
5732000	5734000	to have any new results.
5734000	5736000	Yes.
5736000	5738000	I'm not sure
5738000	5740000	whether it can
5740000	5742000	go beyond the limit.
5742000	5744000	But I think
5744000	5746000	we can calculate it
5746000	5748000	from a theoretical point of view.
5748000	5750000	It might be a great
5750000	5752000	theoretical paper.
5752000	5754000	But we thought
5754000	5756000	we couldn't handle it.
5756000	5758000	The last question
5758000	5760000	is a small one.
5760000	5762000	I'm curious.
5762000	5764000	For example,
5764000	5766000	when you simulate
5766000	5768000	the design of
5768000	5770000	multi-modem
5770000	5772000	or two-sided,
5772000	5774000	if it's complicated,
5774000	5776000	how do you
5776000	5778000	analyze it?
5778000	5780000	Because you can't
5780000	5782000	just recognize it.
5782000	5784000	From simulation?
5784000	5786000	I'll start from
5786000	5788000	a so-called
5788000	5790000	periodic session.
5790000	5792000	I'll go back to the beginning.
5798000	5800000	For example,
5800000	5802000	with this IDT-type
5802000	5804000	resonator,
5804000	5806000	we mainly
5806000	5808000	trigger some modes
5808000	5810000	with a horizontal capacitor.
5810000	5812000	These modes are
5812000	5814000	non-linear.
5814000	5816000	So we usually
5816000	5818000	start with a
5818000	5820000	periodic structure.
5820000	5822000	The advantage of a periodic structure
5822000	5824000	is that it won't be affected
5824000	5826000	by the boundary.
5826000	5828000	Its modes are beautiful.
5828000	5830000	For example,
5830000	5832000	with this A1 resonator,
5832000	5834000	the upper part
5834000	5836000	contains an electrode
5836000	5838000	and its boundary simulation.
5838000	5840000	The lower part
5840000	5842000	contains an electrode.
5842000	5844000	So I don't have a boundary.
5844000	5846000	You can clearly recognize
5846000	5848000	that this is A1 mode.
5848000	5850000	With this simulation,
5850000	5852000	you can roughly
5852000	5854000	grasp the position of
5854000	5856000	resonance frequency
5856000	5858000	and the shape of
5858000	5860000	its mode.
5860000	5862000	Then you can do a complete simulation.
5862000	5864000	Then you can probably
5864000	5866000	find out from the comparison
5866000	5868000	of frequency.
5868000	5870000	Basically, they are the same.
5870000	5872000	Then you can easily
5872000	5874000	find the corresponding mode.
5874000	5876000	This is my own approach.
5876000	5878000	If you do a complete
5878000	5880000	device simulation,
5880000	5882000	you may not
5882000	5884000	think that
5884000	5886000	this is the mode you want to design.
5888000	5890000	When I was doing
5890000	5892000	research,
5892000	5894000	I would simulate
5894000	5896000	a Bach resonator.
5896000	5898000	Sometimes its mode
5898000	5900000	is quite complicated.
5900000	5902000	If I do a very simple simulation,
5902000	5904000	it will be difficult to identify
5904000	5906000	whether it is the mode I want to design.
5908000	5910000	If you use eigenfrequency,
5910000	5912000	it will be more complicated.
5912000	5914000	Because eigenfrequency lists
5914000	5916000	all possible mechanical modes.
5918000	5920000	So I would suggest that
5920000	5922000	when you confirm your electrode configuration,
5922000	5924000	you can do frequency sweeping.
5924000	5926000	This is the so-called frequency
5926000	5928000	response simulation.
5928000	5930000	Although many mechanical modes
5930000	5932000	exist,
5932000	5934000	they can't be triggered by your electrode.
5934000	5936000	They can't be received by your electrode.
5936000	5938000	So many modes will disappear.
5938000	5940000	Only a few
5940000	5942000	are enough
5942000	5944000	to be received
5944000	5946000	by these electrodes.
5946000	5948000	In this way,
5948000	5950000	you can reduce a large part of
5950000	5952000	the work.
5954000	5956000	Thank you for your answer.
5956000	5958000	I am also working on
5958000	5960000	this field now.
5960000	5962000	It is a difficult topic.
5962000	5964000	I hope to have more opportunities
5964000	5966000	to communicate in the future.
5966000	5968000	If there is a chance,
5968000	5970000	you can
5970000	5972000	write an email to me
5972000	5974000	or make an appointment
5974000	5976000	to discuss.
5976000	5978000	Thank you.
5980000	5982000	Due to time constraints,
5982000	5984000	today's speech ends here.
5984000	5986000	You can turn on your microphone.
