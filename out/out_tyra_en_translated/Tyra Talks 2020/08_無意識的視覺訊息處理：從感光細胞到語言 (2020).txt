Hello everyone, welcome everyone to today's Tire Talk, we are very honored to invite Dr. Hong Shaoming today, he is now a post-doctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology, and he is my colleague.
He brought us today's speech topic is unconscious visual information processing, from sensory cells to language. If I'm not mistaken, most of the content of today's speech has been published recently.
First of all, let me introduce Shaoming to you. Dr. Shaoming got his medical school degree from Duke University and the University of Singapore.
When he was a doctor, his main job was to study the unconscious process. After he got his Ph.D., he came to Caltech.
His current boss is Shinsuke Okada. His main job is to continue his Ph.D. research on the unconscious process. His main tools are psychophysics, fMRI, EEG, and eye tracking.
One thing that is different from the usual speech is that we now applaud and thank Shaoming for bringing us the speech, but we have to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear everyone's applause.
Thank you for your introduction. I am Shaoming Hong. Thank you all for joining today's speech.
Today I want to talk about a research topic that I am very interested in, which is unconscious information processing. I will focus on the visual level.
As you can see from the title, there are two extremes, one is perception and the other is language. I want to tell you that unconscious language processing may cover a very large range.
From perception, from light information to telemetry information, that is the first level of our visual and external world interaction.
All the way to language, we usually think that language is a higher-level and more integrated message in the whole visual process. For example, you have to understand a sentence, you have to know the meaning of the words between them, and you have to know how different strokes work.
Today I want to convey a message to everyone, that is, unconscious information processing may exist in different levels of visual information processing, which may cover a very wide range.
What is consciousness? Until now, scientists have not been able to give a very good scientific definition. In this speech today, most people in the field of consciousness science use the definition that consciousness has sensory content.
For example, you can see the words on my slide now, which are in your visual consciousness. For example, you can hear my voice now, which is in your auditory sensory content.
We say that you are aware of these auditory or visual stimuli and have sensory content.
Is there any content? Do not be confused with the state of consciousness. What is the state of consciousness? For example, if you are too bored to talk about it, you may fall asleep and enter an unconscious state.
What we are talking about today is not the state. What I am talking about today is the state of unconsciousness without sensory content.
Is there any sensory content? You may often hear a metaphor. You can see the picture below. You may have seen it on the poster, which is a simple picture I drew myself.
Consciousness and unconscious processing seem to be just a corner of the iceberg. From the perspective of message processing, this may not be a big problem.
Because we receive a lot of messages every minute and every second, but only a small part of the message is really presented in our consciousness.
The rest of the messages that are not presented in our consciousness have always been a subject of research that I have been interested in.
What happened to these messages? Did our brain ignore these messages and ignore them? Or can these messages still affect our brain and further affect our behavior?
There are three main questions to discuss today. The first question I want to ask is the question that I have been interested in since I was a classmate.
What kind of information can be processed unconsciously? We can have a very simple paradoxical hypothesis.
The first is that simple, single-digit, and low-level messages can be processed in an unconscious situation.
On the contrary, another hypothesis may be more complex, integrated, and high-level messages. These messages are more difficult to process, so they cannot be processed in an unconscious situation.
Or they can be processed. These are two opposing hypotheses.
The second question I want to ask is whether unconscious processing is equivalent to automated processing.
What does this mean? Once this process starts, it will not be disturbed by other external processes.
We can have a very simple paradoxical hypothesis here.
The first is that unconscious processing will not be affected by the difficulty of what we do consciously, or how we use our attention.
On the contrary, another hypothesis may be that what we consciously process is more difficult, or what we do will interact with the unconscious message processing.
These are two different hypotheses.
Finally, I want to turn to a completely different angle and discuss with you the neural basis of unconscious processing with the study of nucleus resonance and brain imaging.
Without further ado, let's move on to the first study.
The first study I want to discuss with you is the integration relationship between sound and shape.
We want to know if this integration relationship can be produced in an unconscious situation.
If you look at the title, the title is actually a bit mysterious.
What we want to say is that this word can sound round or sharp before we understand it.
What does this mean?
If we want to answer this question, we may have to take a few steps back and think about what we originally wanted to ask.
What we want to know is how we name an object.
Imagine, for example, that 100,000 years ago, we may have some very basic language systems, but we do not have such complex grammar and structure as we do now.
When we go out to hunt, I see some objects, such as the stone on the left or the crystal on the right.
When I go back to the group, I want to tell my master that the two things I see today are object A and object B.
I must use two different sounds to express these two objects.
In this case, what sound should we use to express these objects?
A very famous contemporary linguist, Arthur Shearer, said that the process of using what sound or what object to express external objects is very likely to be arbitrary.
In other words, I use sound A to express the stone on the left, and sound B to express the crystal on the right.
Perhaps another possibility is that different tribes or people with different languages ​​have a common connection.
They all tend to use a certain type of sound to represent the round object on the left, and then use another sound to represent the pointed object on the right.
This means that there is a very strong connection between our sound and shape.
Does psychology have any evidence to support such a connection?
In fact, we have a very famous cross-sensory sound and visual correspondence called Bubakiki Effect or Bubakiki Phenomenon.
What is Bubakiki Phenomenon?
Those who have a background in psychology may be very familiar with it.
If you don't have a background in psychology, imagine that you are an experimenter today.
You walk into the lab and the experimenter tells you that what you are going to do today is very simple.
We will show you two pictures, the round picture on the left and the pointed picture on the right.
These two pictures are two words used by a remote African tribe.
One of the words is called Bubakiki and the other is called Kiki.
Your job is very simple.
Your job is to tell us which one is Bubakiki and which one is Kiki.
Even if you haven't heard of this phenomenon before, you may be able to guess what sound most people use to express the object on the left and what sound to express the object on the right.
In fact, the answer is that people use a softer sound to express the round object on the left and a sharper sound to express the pointed object on the right.
This is a phenomenon corresponding to sound and shape.
This phenomenon is highly consistent.
Why do I say it is highly consistent?
It is highly consistent that it can exceed the age.
What does this mean?
In an experiment, they took a group of adults and a group of children under the age of three.
They used different shapes on the right, round shapes, pointed shapes, and these words.
The homework is the same as the homework you just did.
They asked these children and adults to use these words to describe these shapes to name these shapes.
They found that children under the age of three have a very similar pairing pattern with us.
They also use a softer sound to describe these round shapes and a sharper sound to describe these pointed shapes.
This means that the corresponding time between sound and shape can be very early, even before these children have a complete language training or a complete cultural experience.
This is the first evidence.
The second evidence is that this phenomenon is even a cross-language phenomenon.
What does this mean?
It means that regardless of whether your mother tongue is Chinese or Mandarin, English or German, the results of the experiment on different species are very similar.
We use the sound of the round shape to represent the round shape, and vice versa.
The real problem of our research is here.
Why does this happen?
Here I provide two very intuitive hypotheses.
The first hypothesis is that this is a conscious association.
This consciousness is not the same as our whole speech to discuss consciousness.
This means that we intentionally connect some things together.
What does this mean?
It means that when I hear this thing, it sounds sharp and sharp.
So this pattern is also sharp.
I want to connect these two things together.
The original thing means the same.
In other words, the reason why there is a connection between sound and shape is because everyone intentionally connects sound and shape together.
This is a possibility.
But this possibility does not seem to be able to explain these past data very well.
Why are there such similar connections between children and adults?
Or why do people who cross-language have such a connection?
The second hypothesis is that perhaps the correspondence between sound and shape happened before these stimuli material entered our conscious state.
So it is a very early processing process.
This early processing process may be very common.
So it can explain that we have seen these studies in adults and children, or in different languages.
You can find this Bubakiki effect.
This whole study is used to test whether the Bubakiki effect can really occur in the unconscious state.
So at the beginning, our research question is very simple.
We want to know if the Bubakiki effect can occur in the unconscious state.
The first experiment we did was very easy.
We found some, for example, this round shape, and then paired with the word Bubu.
Then the pointed shape is paired with the word Kiki.
These are the pair or congruent pairs we talked about.
When you compare the word, the sound, and the shape, you will have an inconsistent pair.
The question we want to ask is very simple.
If we can make the receiver not see these pairs, and then we look at their reaction to these pairs.
If it's still different, does that mean that they can still deal with sound and shape when they can't see these pairs?
The next question is, how do we make the receiver unable to see these pairs?
Our approach is a technique called Continuous Flash Suppression.
The concept is like this.
In this case, if one eye shows you a very bright square, like these colorful squares, we call them Mondrians.
When one eye looks at this colorful square, if the other eye lets you see a very bright square,
it usually takes a few seconds for you to see the object on the other eye.
In these few seconds, the object is basically unconscious to you or the visual material to you.
What do we do at this time?
We put the congruent and incongruent pairs into your other eye.
Then we measure how long it takes for the receiver to see.
Our assumption is that if the congruence of sound and shape can be processed unconsciously or subconsciously,
the time when they see the higher congruence pair and the incongruence pair may be different.
This is our assumption.
I'll go into more detail about time.
You'll see three different visual representations later.
Basically, one corresponds to their non-priority vision, one is the priority vision, and the other is the image that is closer to what they really see.
At the beginning, there will be a random SOA.
After the end, we'll show him two colorful flickering squares.
What we're going to do is put a pair of congruence or incongruence in the other eye on the left or right.
What they're going to do on this assignment is when they see any part of this pair,
press a button and we'll record the time it responds.
So this is a detection task.
We measure the time and we call it suppression time.
It means that this pair can be suppressed.
How long can we keep it out of our consciousness?
Our assumption is that if the correspondence of sound and shape can exist before they enter our consciousness,
congruent pair and incongruent pair will spend different amounts of time.
In order to make sure that the receiver has a good time doing this,
they see the stimulation material and then react, not just press a button.
At the end of each trial, we also added a location task.
Basically, we just said,
Oh, you saw it.
Where did you see it?
Is it on the left or right?
That's just to make sure that our receiver is a good receiver.
You can see that the average accuracy rate is quite high here.
When we analyze, we only analyze the trials that respond correctly.
Back to the question, what exactly did we find?
This is the 20 receivers we received in this experiment.
There are a lot of things in this graph.
Let's look at the first column first.
You can see a orange dot, which means that this is one of the receivers.
The orange dot is the time it spends in incongruent pairs.
The dark blue dot at the bottom is the time it spends in congruent pairs.
The bar at the bottom is the difference between the two.
Its y-axis is on the right.
So in other words,
this receiver needs to spend more time to see incongruent pairs.
What we're doing here is very simple.
We put these individual data together and make an average.
Then we see that this is the average of all people's data.
Then it's a positive bar.
What does this mean?
We call it a congruency benefit.
When the shape of the word and the outer circle is more consistent,
they will enter the state of consciousness of our receivers earlier.
This means that the correspondence between the sound and the shape
seems to have been dealt with before entering the state of consciousness.
So in the first study,
we pointed out to some extent that
it seems to occur before or before consciousness.
Then we found something called congruency benefit.
When the sound and the shape are consistent,
it will enter our state of consciousness earlier.
For people who are more sensitive to experimental design or experiments,
they immediately feel that it doesn't seem right.
Let's take a step back and look at the relationship between the word and the shape.
What we've been claiming is that the sound of the word,
the phonology of the sound, and the shape will have a congruency effect.
When they are consistent, it's easier for you to see them.
But the relationship between the word, the shape, and the inner circle
is the relationship between the word's word form, orthography, and shape.
So in other words, if you look at these congruent pairs in our first experiment,
they are not only correspondent between sound and shape,
they are also correspondent between shape and shape.
In other words, the congruent pair looks more like it visually.
In other words, we may have found some kind of integration phenomenon.
But this integration phenomenon may not be cross-sensory,
but only exists in the visual domain.
So in other words, when the word looks very similar to the shape of the outside,
the receiver will see it earlier.
When it's not, the receiver will see it later.
In order to prove that the sound really plays a very important role,
we made some changes in the next experiment.
We used some so-called neutral symbols or neutral text.
These things look neither far nor near.
What we do is that we train the receiver to put the sound on these symbols.
So the receiver will call these symbols bubu or kiki.
Then let's see if the symbols they trained
can produce the congruency benefit we just saw with a higher consistency shape.
It's still a bit abstract, so I'll go straight into the details of our experiment.
This time we really chose two languages from Africa,
called bi-language.
You can see that there are two different texts on the left.
Why did we choose this language?
Why did we choose these two different letters?
Because in another study,
our collaborators found that
if you ask the receiver to pair the two different words on the left and right
with different sounds,
the receiver basically has no preference.
If you ask them to pair with a sharp sound or a round sound,
their response is usually chance, 50%.
So we defined these as neutral letters.
It's neither round nor sharp.
What we do is very simple.
We ask the receiver to connect this to the sound of kiki or bubu.
Let's take a sip of water.
There are two stages in this experiment.
The first one is the training session.
What we do in the training session is to let them do a very simple matching task.
At the beginning, they will hear a sound.
You can see that in the upper right corner, they hear the sound of bubu or kiki.
Then they see one of the words in the two words.
What they have to do is tell us that this is matched or unmatched.
At the end of each trial, we will tell them that what they did was right or wrong.
So we didn't really tell them what was matched and what was unmatched.
It's up to them to figure out what the composition between them is at the end of each trial.
Through this training method,
if they answer 20 questions in a row,
we assume that they have learned which word and which sound should be paired.
In other words, in this experiment,
the consistency of things depends on what word is paired with what sound.
For example, we collected two experiments here, two groups of subjects.
In 2A, we asked them to pair this word with bubu and this word with kiki.
In other words, these two pairs are congruent in 2A.
In 2B, we collect another group of subjects and reverse the pairing relationship.
At this time, the pairs in the lower right corner become incongruent pairs.
As I just said,
the congruency depends entirely on what the word represents.
After the training, these subjects will move on to the next stage.
Basically, it's exactly the same as the experiment we did before,
but now we use these neutral symbols.
What did we find?
Let me recap for you.
In the first time, we found this congruency benefit.
When the shape of the word and the outside is more consistent,
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.
In 2A and 2B, we also found a very similar phenomenon.
In other words, the point is not the shape of the word, but the sound represented by the word.
As long as the sound and the shape of the outside are more consistent,
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.
After this experiment,
we found that a short training can cause a very similar unconscious phenomenon.
That is, if the shape of the word is consistent with the outside,
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.
If you follow this stage carefully,
you will find that there is no sound element in the formal experiment.
How does our sound element come from?
Let's assume that after it sees the word,
it will extract the sound of the word.
If the sound is consistent with the shape of the outside,
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.
If the sound is inconsistent with the shape of the outside,
it will move on to our conscious state later.
So the sound is a bit like we assume that they will read the sound of the word.
So in the next experiment,
we want to directly introduce the sound component.
If we directly introduce the sound component,
according to the results we found before,
this sound should help a shape you couldn't see originally.
If they are consistent,
it should help you see the shape you couldn't see originally.
At this time, we turn to another paradigm,
which is called the masking paradigm.
This approach is like this.
We will present a visual shape.
This situation is also a pointed shape or a round shape.
The presented time is only 33 milliseconds.
So if you use a 60Hz monitor,
it's about two frames.
The time is actually quite short.
Before and after this time,
we will put some noisy patterns.
These noisy patterns are to make you unable to see the shape.
In fact, the whole experiment is that the receiver will answer,
oh, I saw it or I didn't see it.
In the process of their answer,
we will do some staircasing to adjust the brightness of this thing.
So what we want to know is
what is the threshold for the receiver to see this shape?
How high or low do we want to adjust the brightness?
The receiver will just see this shape.
The important thing at this time is that
we will play a sound at the same time,
or 150 milliseconds before or after.
This sound may be consistent with this pattern or inconsistent.
According to our previous results,
if this sound is consistent with this pattern,
it should help the receiver see this pattern.
Is that true?
The answer is that this is true.
We found that if the sound is played
at 150 milliseconds before the shape,
the receiver will have a significant threshold reduction phenomenon.
yx is the threshold.
You can think of this as
how many luminance they need to see the shape.
So the lower it is, the easier it is to see the shape.
So when the sound is played at 150 milliseconds before,
if the sound is consistent with the shape,
the receiver will be easier to see the shape.
Again, it means that
the integration between the sound and the shape
is very likely to occur in a preconscious state
or unconscious state.
Through this series of studies,
the first thing we found was that
the effect of boobakiki
can occur in an unconscious state
or in a conscious state.
We also explained that
the important thing is what the word itself represents,
what the sound is,
not what the shape of the word is.
Finally, we found that
if you use a sound directly,
it will help a shape
that should have been hidden by the mask
to be seen more easily.
So again, it proves that
the correspondence between sound and shape
is very likely to occur
before the conscious threshold.
This is the first part of the experiment.
Do you have any questions?
If it's too fast or too slow,
you can tell me.
If you have any questions,
you can type next to me,
and I will help you ask.
You can also turn on the microphone yourself to ask.
But we set the microphone to silent.
So if you didn't notice,
you have to turn on the microphone
to ask questions.
I have a question.
Sorry.
Go ahead.
In the picture of the contrast,
does the contrast mean
that 22% and 23%
are gray and black?
The contrast is actually the alpha value.
OK.
Isn't 22% and 23% very different?
I can't see it with my naked eye.
Yes, it's very different.
The unconscious effect is usually very small.
One of the reasons is that
in the process of doing these experiments,
we want to make the audience unable to see.
For example, there are two ways.
The first is to make it very dark.
The second is to use masking or CFS
to make people unable to see.
So we intentionally or unintentionally
make the amount of information very small.
Usually the effect will not be very large.
Of course, this is statistically significant.
But it's hard to tell the difference
between the two.
But this is actually the point.
The point is that
in your consciousness,
you can't tell the difference.
OK.
But maybe your eyes
can still tell the difference.
But we consciously eliminated it.
So I can't feel it.
You can say that.
OK. Thank you.
OK.
Let's move on to the next research.
If you have any questions,
we can come back and discuss.
OK.
In this experiment,
we will explain to you that
the integration between sound and shape
can occur in the unconscious state.
The next research I want to talk to you about is...
Sorry.
Someone has a question.
He's next to me.
OK.
His question is this.
He said he wanted to ask
how to test the difference between
the dominant eye
and the dominant eye.
What part of the experiment will it affect?
OK.
This is a good question.
I don't have the official results
to support the second question.
But if I remember correctly,
the dominant eye is
when you put the design material
and what you want the other person to see,
which we call the suppressor,
in which eye?
I remember doing it.
The results are similar.
So it's a bit like a convention.
We put the suppressor on the dominant eye
because it's usually easier for you
to see what's on the other eye.
Because it's your superior eye.
So relatively speaking,
if what's on that eye is very salient,
it's even harder for you to see
what's on the other eye.
This is the reason.
So how do we know the dominant eye?
There are many ways to test it.
The simplest way is that
you can, for example,
form a small hole.
You can stretch out your hand
and look at something through the hole.
Both of your eyes have to open.
At this time,
you close one of your eyes,
and you'll find that
only one eye can see
what you're looking at.
That eye,
we usually call it the dominant eye.
When I force you to use one eye,
which eye will you look at?
You can try it later.
Excuse me.
Can I ask a question?
Go ahead.
My name is Wen Wen.
I'm from the University of Tokyo.
Hello.
I'd like to ask,
will there be a discussion later
about why there's this
congruence benefit?
Why do consistent things
enter the conference earlier
than inconsistent things?
Because in different fields,
sometimes inconsistent things
may be more salient.
And consistent things
are not very attractive.
Why do consistent things
in perception
have a more attractive position?
That's a good question.
And I've been facing this question myself.
Because in my different experiments,
sometimes consistent things
enter the state of consistency earlier,
and sometimes inconsistent things
enter the state of consistency earlier.
I'll come back.
I'll come back to this question
after all three of my research is done.
Okay, thank you.
I don't know how you control your time,
but I have a question.
If you think this is too much,
we can ask together at the end.
Okay, I'll speak faster.
How do you control
the age and gender of the audience?
There's no control in this study.
So we basically collect young people,
18 to 35 years old.
This is a visual study.
It's a bit of a conventional convention.
And gender is balanced.
Age is that period.
Gender is balanced.
Okay, I'm going to move on to the next study.
So in the next study,
I'm going to talk about a
unconscious science.
Everyone is relative.
Unconscious science is not a very popular science.
But in unconscious science,
of course, there are also more popular things.
That is,
unconscious meaning or language processing.
Okay, I want to tell you that
this language processing
will still be controlled by
the high and low difficulty of what we do.
Okay, like I said,
Unconscious meaning or language processing
has always been a
prominent field in this field.
Why?
In fact, intuitively speaking,
if we find that there is unconscious processing today,
the first thing I will be interested in is
that when I didn't see this word
or didn't hear this word,
can I understand what it means?
This is actually a pretty intuitive
and everyone wants to know the problem.
That's true.
This field has been studied for decades.
Everyone in different visual paradigms,
including Mr. Ye Su-lin of the Taiwan Psychological Department,
also found that
the meaning of a word,
even if you don't see it,
can also be read by you.
It will even affect the judgment of another word.
Okay, as you can see,
in the third Continuous Flash Suppression,
this is the paradigm we used
in the first experiment.
Okay, under this paradigm,
unfortunately or even luckily,
in fact, its results have not been stable.
Some experimenters found that
the meaning of the word can indeed
survive under this paradigm.
Even if the recipient can't see the word,
the meaning of the word seems to be able to be extracted
and then affect their judgment of another task.
Some of the experiments
did not work.
Okay, this experiment,
this study,
the initial intention
is actually to know
why there is this difference.
We want to make a big assumption
that maybe in different paradigms,
everyone uses the same paradigm,
but some people find it,
some people can't find it.
The reason is actually something else.
The reason we want to mention here is
whether it is related to the difficulty of the task.
What does this mean?
It means that
we assume that there is conscious processing
and unconscious processing.
Conscious processing
actually shares the same resources.
You can think of it as attention.
If they share the same resources,
then conscious processing,
if the task is more difficult,
then you spend all the resources.
Your unconscious processing
can't be produced.
In other words,
if you do this conscious task now,
it's actually quite simple.
Then you have more resources
that can be distributed to unconscious processing.
Next, we want to discuss this study
with everyone
to see if this hypothesis is true.
In order to test this hypothesis,
we made a paradigm called
Double Stroke Paradigm.
What is this paradigm?
For example, I will show you two words now.
You may be very intuitive to read red and blue.
Of course, there are other reasons
why people don't read blue and red.
But one of the reasons is
if I ask you to read the colors of these words now,
the left is blue and the right is red,
you will find that reading colors
is much more difficult than reading words.
Why?
Because when we read colors,
we are easily disturbed by words.
This is a famous
Stroke phenomenon.
You don't have to worry that
our readers will not read red and blue,
because we are doing research in English.
So in the case of reading colors,
as I just said,
usually the reader will have a higher
level of language interference,
so they want to read words.
Because reading words is a stronger process,
and it is usually relatively automated.
On the other hand,
when they read words,
they usually read better.
Because the color here
has a weaker effect.
If there is an effect,
it is usually called the Reverse Stroke Effect.
Let's define these two different conditions
as high-low and low-low.
In the case of reading words,
it is relatively simple, it is low-low.
But in the case of reading colors,
it is more difficult, it is high-low.
What we want to know is
if we put another word
before they react to this word
so that they can't see it,
will the consistency between the two words
affect their judgment of this word?
If it does,
what should it be in?
Should it be in a high-difficulty situation
or a low-difficulty situation?
I will go into the details of our research.
The same is used here
is the paradigm of double-eyed reading.
So you will still see
three different strings later.
At the beginning,
we just try to
keep the first word from being seen.
This is a bit different from before.
Before, we wanted to measure
how long that thing would be seen.
In this experiment,
we don't want it to be seen.
So let's show you again.
This is actually a
slightly different paradigm.
You will find that the way it flashes
is a bit different.
If you want to know the technical details,
we can discuss it later.
What we want to do
is just to make the receiver see this word.
So the receiver in this process,
when we put the first word
prime,
it can actually react.
If it says, oh, I saw it,
they press a button,
we will label this trial
as a conscious trial.
These trials
will not be analyzed later.
What we are interested in
is when they can't see this word,
how do they affect the next word?
In this process,
they say they can see it.
In the process of not seeing it,
we will adjust the brightness of this word
to keep this word
always almost visible
and a little bit invisible.
If they don't see the word
in this situation,
we will move on to the next stage.
We will present a word with color.
We will teach it
to read words in some experiments.
In some experiments,
we teach it to read colors.
That's the case of low difficulty
and high difficulty.
In the first layer,
when we say,
oh, it can actively report
that it has seen
or has not seen the word,
that is a subjective report
that they have not realized this word.
We also want to establish
an objective standard
that when it really
didn't see this word,
what would happen?
What we do is
we add a location task.
What is this?
At the end of each trial,
we ask it to judge
and ask it to guess
that you just didn't see that word,
that prime.
Please guess
whether the word
is above or below.
That's the logic.
If it really didn't see that word,
then its performance on this task
should be chance,
because it didn't see that word.
Indeed, across several experiments,
we found in this study
that their performance
on the location task
is about chance,
and there is no difference
with 50%.
So we want to establish
that subjectively and objectively,
it really didn't see that word.
In the case that it didn't see
that word,
if the two words
are not the same,
will it affect you
to read words or read colors?
The answer is yes.
This is the case of reading words.
The case of reading words
is a relatively low-difficulty situation.
You can see that the left corner
is our result.
This is when the two words
are the same,
it is congruent.
This is the case where the two words
are inconsistent.
In an inconsistent situation,
they will take about 5% of the time.
This is a standardized
normalized RT,
because we put a lot of
blank trials
at the same time
in this experiment,
that is,
in the case
where the word should be put,
the word should be put,
we sometimes
didn't show anything.
So that's our baseline.
So compared to the baseline,
if the two words are inconsistent,
they will take
about 5% of the time.
This is a relatively simple
case of reading words.
In the case of reading colors,
this is a high-low,
a more difficult situation.
We found that this effect
disappeared.
So at least so far,
this seems to indicate that
unconscious processing
does not seem to be so automated.
Because the exact same design
is in one situation,
there will be
unconscious interference.
In another situation,
there will be
unconscious interference.
What happened?
Just like we just said,
we just assumed at the beginning
that this was related to
the difficulty of the task,
the high and low.
If it really has
something to do with
the difficulty of the task,
then think about it.
This is a
reading color is
a relatively difficult task.
If I keep training
the collector to do this task,
let him do it for a long time,
do it to a level
that he becomes very powerful.
In theory,
this high-difficulty task
becomes simpler and simpler,
becoming a low-difficulty task.
When this high-difficulty task
becomes a low-difficulty task,
if we follow our theory,
it should have more resources
that can be distributed to
unconscious information processing.
At this time,
interference should be re-generated.
If you have participated in
visual research,
you will find that
visual scientists love to
do a lot of trials.
In fact,
at this time,
we have also
taught everyone to do
about 350 trials.
So they did
a total of
30-40 minutes.
The first thing we want to do
is to see
if there is a difference
in the performance of the
previous trial and the
subsequent trial.
Compared with the
previous quarter trial
and the subsequent quarter trial,
they are faster
in the subsequent quarter trial.
We found that
this may mean that
the difficulty of this task
has relatively
become lower
because they do better and better.
At this time,
let's look at
the first
quarter trial.
Basically,
their performance
is very similar
to that of all
trials.
They will not be
interfered with
by
this
unconscious word.
In the subsequent
quarter trial,
we found that
the original interference
phenomenon
was produced
when we
saw the
interference
phenomenon
when we
read the
words.
At this time,
it conforms to
our assumption
that
when the
first
quarter trial
occurs,
the
second
quarter trial
occurs.
The
combination of
the two
experiments
at least
explains
one thing,
which is
the
unconscious
prime
that
they can't
see,
and
the
unconscious
target
that
they
are reacting
to.
When the
first
quarter trial
occurs,
they are
more likely
to be
interfered with
by
this
unconscious
word.
When the
second
quarter trial
occurs,
they are
more likely
to be
interfered with
by
this
unconscious
word.
When the
first
quarter trial
occurs,
they are
more likely
to be
interfered with
by
this
cold
object
or
subconscious
object.
When the
second
quarter trial
occurs,
they
are
more likely
to be
interfered with
by
this
unconscious
object before
the
first
trial.
In fact,
we call the
observer to pay
attention to the
meaning of the
word, so
we ask him to
pay attention to
the phenomenon
that we want
to see.
That is a
speech interference
phenomenon.
These two
things are
consistent,
so we
say that
it is
cognitive
set
align or
task set
align.
On the
contrary,
when we
see this
phenomenon,
it is
likely that
it is not
a task
difficulty
adjustment,
but a
different reason
for the
nature of
their
work.
This
explanation
can also
explain
our
results.
Another
question you
may ask
is what
is the
consistency
that
causes
their
work
to
become
slower or
faster?
We have
just mentioned
that it is
actually related to
the conflict
between the
meanings of
the two
words.
Another
possibility is
that our
prime word
is always
blue and
red,
and our
target word
is always
blue and
red.
Maybe it's
related to
the conflict
between
the two
words.
In order to
solve these
two problems
at the same time,
we did
two things
in the
following two
experiments.
The first
thing is that
we replaced
the target
word with
these two
words,
Navy and
Scarlet.
These two
words still
have a consistent
or inconsistent
relationship
with the
original
word
meaning.
A very
interesting phenomenon
is that when we
use these two
words as
target words,
when we ask
the user to
read the
color or
read the
words,
their difficulty
is completely
reversed.
At this time,
when we
ask him to
read the
color,
he will not
be disturbed
by the
color.
This is actually
also reported
in the text
file.
In other
words,
in this
experiment,
if we
find any
interference,
it will
come from
the word
meaning.
If we
find interference
coming from
this new
low-difficulty
task,
that is,
the task of
reading the
color,
it means that
the important
thing is
the difficulty
of the
task.
If the
difficulty
of the
task is
easy to
be disturbed,
it means that
the important
thing is that
the thing
done by the
receiver is
consistent with
the interference
we want to
see,
that is,
the
Cognitive
Set is
aligned.
What do
we find?
We found
no effect
in the
task of
reading the
word.
This is a
new,
simple task.
This is a
simple task.
In this case,
without the
effect,
we found
a very similar
interference phenomenon
as before.
When the
meaning of
these two
words is
different,
its reaction
will be slower.
Through
these two
experiments,
we can
tell everyone
that
only the
meaning of
the word
alone
can make
the receiver
see the
word
in a
consistent
way.
We can
also say that
only the
meaning of
the word
alone
can
make
the receiver
see the
word
in a
consistent
way.
