00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tara Talk on May 9th. I am today's host, Hong Shi-an.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
We are honored to invite Xu Ruifu to speak for us today.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
Xu Ruifu is currently a research assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
He will be entering the PhD program at NTU in September.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
His main research is on micro-fine-graining and material studies.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
Today's topic is the Ultimate Challenge of Antenna Miniaturization.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Before we start, let's give the speaker a round of applause.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
Before we start, please remember to turn on your microphones.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
Let's give the floor to Ruifu.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Thank you for the introduction.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

01:22.000 --> 01:34.000
I graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2016.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
I studied for a year and graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
I used to work as a research assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I was originally planning to go to UCLA, but decided to stay in Taiwan.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
Part of the reason is that I am now organizing a group of people to discuss Taiwan's PhD policy.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Last year, I was elected to be the president of NTU.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Prior to that, I was also a consultant at the Executive Yuan.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
I have been concerned about the current situation.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
In the past 10 years, the number of PhD students in Taiwan has dropped from 20,000 to 15,000.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
This is a three-fold decrease.

02:21.000 --> 02:33.000
At this point in time, people will be thinking about whether there is a need to adjust the way we nurture PhD students.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
Whether there is a need to gather more resources to nurture our young researchers.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
In addition to doing academic research, I am also concerned about this public policy.

02:46.000 --> 02:57.000
I will spend a lot of time introducing the basic knowledge of the frontline and why we need to study this topic.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Later, I will talk about some of the results of my previous research.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
Perhaps most people are familiar with and have an impression of the frontline.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
It is an electromagnetic textbook.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
If there is an electron with an acceleration, it will produce electromagnetic radiation.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
That is the basic definition of physics.

03:20.000 --> 03:33.000
If the frontline is a circuit, it is more like a transition device.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
What kind of transition is it?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
It is a guided wave and a free space wave.

03:40.000 --> 03:53.000
A guided wave is a wave that travels from the transmission line to the air.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
There is a device in the middle that can transform the electromagnetic wave.

04:00.000 --> 04:10.000
In the transition region, we can design structures or materials to achieve the desired effect.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
If we look at this in a circuit-based way,

04:15.000 --> 04:26.000
for example, in this picture, we have a voltage source with its own generator resistance.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
It is transmitted through the transmission line to the antenna.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
The RL stands for Loss.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
It may be the loss of various sources.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
For example, conductive loss.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
The R stands for the place where the radiation is emitted.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
For the whole system,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
whether it is heat loss or radiation loss,

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
it is the dissipation of energy in the circuit.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It can be represented by this resistor.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
It also has some conductive or electromagnetic properties.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
If we express an antenna in a circuit, it is like this.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
In our impression, there are various kinds of antennas in life.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
For example, this is what we think of the most.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
It is called an O-level antenna.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
It can be seen in Wi-Fi AP.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
It is rarely seen in Doraemon comics or our roof.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
But sometimes we see this kind of antenna.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
It is called Yagyuda.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
It is called octagonal antenna.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
There is also this kind called helical antenna.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
It is characterized by high concentration and is cylindrical.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
There is also this kind of horn antenna.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
Or the simplest and most common is called patch antenna.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
It has a ground and a metal plate.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Many people may have the impression of an antenna.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
In addition to this, it is a long-standing mobile phone.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
You can see that it is connected to a very simple O-level antenna.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
Many people may wonder why our mobile phones do not have this.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
In fact, the antenna of our mobile phones is usually integrated into its chip and its shape.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
For example, there is a famous story.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
It is the iPhone 4 antenna door incident.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
When the user holds this place, it is called the death grip.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
As long as you hold it, you will die.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
This is a very famous incident.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
It is because it integrates its metal frame with its received frequency.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
Unfortunately, when it was designed, it did not consider that the user's hand would lead to the short circuit of the receiver.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
In fact, the design of the antenna can be extended from an ancient physical problem

07:07.000 --> 07:16.000
to the modern user experience, aesthetics, and system performance.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
Next, I will talk about some of the most common design parameters of antennas.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
The first one is called radiation pattern.

07:26.000 --> 07:34.000
Radiation pattern is a mathematical expression expressed in an image.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
Usually, it is used to express some of the characteristics of radiation,

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
such as the intensity of its power, the intensity of its magnetic field,

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
or its fragrance, or all kinds of characteristics.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
Usually, when we look at the radiation pattern,

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
we call it the far-field region.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
There are two main reasons for the far-field region.

08:03.000 --> 08:11.000
One is that the radiation pattern is no longer related to its distance.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
It can be a more independent reference parameter.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
The other is that it will become a flat wave form.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
So there are many characteristics of radiation,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
whether it is your power flux or your field strength.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
They are all described in this way.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
For example, this image shows the radiation pattern of an antenna in the form of a spherical coordinate.

08:34.000 --> 08:43.000
We can express it as its power or its field strength.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
This is called the major lobe.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
This is where the magnetic field is strongest.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
One of the important parameters of antenna design

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
is how to design its radiation characteristics into the shape and shape you want.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
The second important parameter is called directivity and gain.

09:08.000 --> 09:17.000
Directivity is the intensity of the radiation of the antenna in a specific direction

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
and the average value of the antenna in all directions.

09:22.000 --> 09:31.000
So it can be used to show how concentrated the intensity is in that place.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
The difference between gain and directivity is that

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
it looks at how the antenna effectively converts the radiation it receives

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
into the intensity it can actually receive in another place.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
So the relationship between the two is that there is a difference in radiation efficiency.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
Radiation efficiency is usually the ratio of the power received by the antenna structure

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
to the actual radiation output.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
It is between 0 and 1.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
This radiation efficiency is something we care about.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
For example, in the design of a mobile phone,

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
the radiation efficiency directly affects the performance of the battery.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Or some more important applications affect the power consumption.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Another parameter is more practical, called realized gain.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
If we look at this circuit diagram,

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
when the transmission goes to the antenna end,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
there is a problem with the resistance matching.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
In other words, if the resistance cannot be matched,

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
some of the waves of energy will be reflected back.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
In this case, it will be less efficient.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
Realized gain is the ratio of the power received by the antenna

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
to the gamma-reflected value of the gain.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
This is the most practical aspect of the performance of the antenna.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I have a question.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Hello, I'm sorry.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I have a very basic question.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I really don't know much about this.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
For an antenna,

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
we know that it usually has amplitude modulation and phase modulation.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
In your design,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
or the parameters you are talking about now,

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
is there a difference between amplitude and phase modulation in AM?

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Or do you just need to get the maximum signal?

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
If it is an antenna,

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
our main consideration is how to get the maximum signal.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
At the end,

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
we can use circuit design or some mathematical theory to make some modifications.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
In fact, the strength of the signal,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
which I will talk about later,

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
the ultimate goal behind the strength of the signal is

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
how to make the data transmission rate of your communication system

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
higher and better.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
The higher the data transmission rate,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
in fact, it will have many aspects.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
The strength of the signal is one.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
But, for example, the AMFM I just mentioned

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
is actually a different modulation method.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
It will also affect the transmission rate.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
There are many different places that affect the transmission rate.

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
But our ultimate goal is to improve the transmission rate of the entire communication system.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
The design of the antenna,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
the main consideration is the strength of the signal.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
Thank you.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
Bandwidth is also an important indicator.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
As I will talk about later,

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
there is a well-known basic communication company called Channel Capacity.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
There is a well-known information theorist called Shannon.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
In addition to the strength of the signal,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
another thing that affects the transmission rate is bandwidth.

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
But bandwidth is actually a broader thing.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Bandwidth just means that

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
the characteristics of our antenna

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
can maintain the characteristics we want within a certain frequency range.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
So it can indicate a lot of physical variables,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
such as input resistance,

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
for example, the beamwidth of the radiation pattern I just mentioned,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
or the polarization you want.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
It can have a lot of physical variables.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
But what we see most often is the bandwidth of resistance.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
The reason why the antenna produces radiation

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
is because it produces resonance of the structure at a certain frequency.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
When resonance occurs,

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
the resistance and the reactance will change drastically.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
As long as you can match the impedance,

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
the energy will be absorbed.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
So if we want to achieve a broad bandwidth,

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
where the impedance is bandwidth,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
we often see a parameter,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
which is the reflection factor I mentioned earlier.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
How to make this bandwidth as wide as possible

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
will affect the transmission rate of the entire system.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
After talking about some basic features of the antenna,

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
I will slowly move on to the part about antenna miniaturization.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Antenna miniaturization is a very old topic.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
It was discussed at the beginning of World War II.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
At the beginning, there was a person who had a lot to do with us.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
He was a professor at MIT named Zhu Lancheng.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
In fact, in the early years,

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
he also helped a lot with the teaching and teaching in Taiwan.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
He was a professor at MIT.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
In 1948, he proposed this concept for the first time.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
What is it?

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
He said that the design of the antenna was a bit like a blind man's vision.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
He felt that a certain design could achieve a target.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
For example, what kind of radiation efficiency do I want?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
What kind of gain do I want?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
What kind of bandwidth do I want?

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
However, we often modify the east and the west.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Change a little bit here and there.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
We want to see how we can get the best design target.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
But there seems to be some kind of connection between them.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
It seems that you can't change everything at the same time.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
There will always be some kind of trade-off.

16:19.000 --> 16:29.000
Professor Zhu Lancheng proposed the concept of how to describe the relationship between them for the first time in 1948.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
His idea was not very complicated.

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
He used a sphere to wrap up the antenna structure.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
He used a sphere that could enclose the entire antenna structure.

16:43.000 --> 16:51.000
He assumed that there are ideal characteristics in the sphere.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
For example, there is no loss in it, and there is no storage of energy.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Assume that there is a vibrating mode in it.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It may be the simplest mode.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
The vibrating mode is a general expression.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
After assuming the vibration mode,

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
calculate the vibrating mode of the spherical wave.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
The second step is to convert the vibrating mode of the spherical wave into an equivalent circuit.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
Each Z represents a vibration mode in it.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Through the calculation of the equivalent circuit,

17:24.000 --> 17:48.000
we can calculate how much energy is stored and how much energy is dissipated by the electromagnetic wave.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
This is the quality factor.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I'd like to talk a little bit about the quality factor.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
The concept of the quality factor that we first came across

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
was probably in the system of spring-force oscillation.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
At that time, we were looking for the lower the loss, the better.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
The higher the Q value, the better.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
It means that the energy is not wasted,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
and it is a high-efficiency oscillation.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
But the opposite is true for the antenna.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
We are not looking for the higher the Q value, the better.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Because for the circuit system,

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
Q also represents the energy that is lost and the energy that is radiated.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
For the circuit system,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
the energy that is lost and the energy that is radiated are both a kind of loss.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
So if you want to have a wider frequency band,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
the lower the Q value, the better.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
But this involves another problem.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
In the end, the lower the Q value, the better.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Is it that your energy is all used up in the circuit?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Or is it radiation?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
This is another problem.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
So it's possible that your...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
My question is,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
but if what we're doing today is all commercial circuits,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
all communications,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
you can't just choose a narrowband,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
a transmission band,

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
and then you just need to make a very large Q,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
the noise bandwidth will be very small.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
So for the receiver,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
you can still use a very large Q antenna.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
You're right.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
But usually we still expect the wider the frequency band, the better.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
But in this case,

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
it depends on what your needs are in the design scenario,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
and how you want to solve this problem.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
But if we only evaluate the performance of the antenna itself,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
whether it's gain or bandwidth,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
or radiation efficiency,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
we expect it to be the larger the better.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
But in reality,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
if you really can't reach that bandwidth,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
there are other techniques that you can use to overcome it.

20:01.000 --> 20:07.000
For example, is it possible that the resonance frequency band can be switched?

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
Then you can save some design space.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
If it's really narrowband.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
So as I said, the lower the Q value, the better.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But there's another problem.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Is your Q value low because the energy is used in the circuit or radiation?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
If it's all used in the circuit,

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
that means the radiation efficiency is very, very low.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
By doing this calculation,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
we get a general expression.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
This expression doesn't look like this at first,

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
but the people in the back keep improving and modifying it.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
This is roughly the limit that everyone accepts in the current antenna design field.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
From this relationship, we can see that K is the wave number.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
It's 2pi over lambda.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
So here, A is the enclosing sphere.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
So it's equal to the ratio of A to lambda.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
So if your antenna is getting smaller and smaller,

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
for example, far smaller than the wave length,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
it's actually this three-dimensional direction that will dominate.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
Then it will become very large very quickly.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
So that means your Q is lower bound.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Its Q is considered lower bound,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
so your lower bound will keep getting higher.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
In other words, the frequency of your system will definitely be downgraded.

21:31.000 --> 21:37.000
In 1948, this article was the first to discuss this issue.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
No matter how much you modify it,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
in fact, your antenna performance will have a theoretical limit.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
This problem becomes a bit like the Holy Grail in the antenna design field.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
It's an issue that everyone wants to discuss and pursue.

21:55.000 --> 22:03.000
The formula that I just mentioned is also the channel capacity proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948.

22:03.000 --> 22:14.000
It says that the amount and rate of data that can be transmitted by communication

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
is related to our frequency and signal-to-noise ratio.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
In other words, if we want to improve our data transmission rate,

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
either our frequency can be improved,

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
or our signal-to-noise ratio can be improved.

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
There is a very interesting experiment.

22:41.000 --> 22:48.000
In theory, this limit cannot be proven.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
If you really want to prove it, you can only prove that

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
I propose a design, and I break your boundary,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
so your theory has a problem.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
So in 2012, these people gathered their strength.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
They searched for more than 100 articles in IEEE APS's 7,800 articles

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
to analyze its performance to see if it is within this theoretical bound.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Here are some of their calculations.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
So they got the picture I put in the speech projection video.

23:25.000 --> 23:33.000
The difference between virtual and real is only the mode used.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
In this picture, the horizontal axis is KA,

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
which is the ratio of the physical size relative to the wavelength.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
So from this picture,

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
it explains why this Friedman's limit is exceeded.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
In fact, it is not exceeded.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
It is related to its impedance matching.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Its impedance matching has been modified.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
If impedance matching is also considered,

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
it does not exceed the theoretical limit.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
So according to his paper,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
this theoretical limit seems to be correct.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
This is one thing.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
Another thing is that its KA is only 0.1.

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
For example, if the antenna is at 3GHz resonance,

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
3GHz is about 10 cm.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
Yes, 10 cm.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
In this case, 0.1 is about 1 cm.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
So this is the feeling of 0.1 wavelength.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Another thing is that when KA is very, very small,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
many studies have pointed out that

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
all existing historical designs

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
are well below this theoretical bound.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
Even if the theoretical limit tells us

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
that the performance of the antenna will definitely deteriorate,

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
we will still design well below the theoretical limit.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
What is the theoretical limit?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
B long.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
B is bandwidth.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Long is the radiation efficiency of the antenna.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
So the radiation efficiency will directly affect

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
our signal-to-noise ratio.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
So it directly affects our transmission rate.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
These two things must be considered together.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Because in the previous theoretical limit,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
it only considered the quality factor.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It is related to bandwidth.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
But often the radiation efficiency and bandwidth

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
will have a trade-off.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
There have been new theoretical discussions.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
For example, in this article in 2017,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
he discussed that

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
in fact,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
in this formula,

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
when the signal-to-noise ratio is less than 1,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
it will be converted into this formula.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
At this time,

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
the main dominant channel capacity

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
is the intensity of the signal.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
The intensity of the signal will be directly related to the radiation efficiency.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
So he did not use the structure of Ka to the quality factor

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
to deduce,

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
but to deduce directly from the radiation efficiency.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
He also deduced a theoretical bound.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
In 2017, this theory is still being renewed.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
To refine.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
So when we know such a limit and background,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
we will think about

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
where we have the need for this application.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
This picture is a peninsula.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I have not been there.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I just downloaded it from the Internet.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
It is a VLF antenna of the U.S. Navy.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
How big is this peninsula?

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
At kilometer square.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
It is about 100 football fields.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Its energy consumption is 8 MW.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
It is about a hydropower dam.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Each antenna is 300 meters.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
It is about the Eiffel Tower.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
What is the antenna doing?

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
It is related to submarine communication.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
It is to do submarine communication.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Why is it so big and so powerful?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Because of the wavelength.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
It is a frequency of 3 to 30 kHz.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
It can do underwater and underground communication.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Because at this frequency,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
it can penetrate water or oil.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
It can also reflect in the elevator.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
But this frequency is very long.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
10 to 100 kilometers.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
So if you want to operate efficiently

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
in a wavelength or half a wavelength,

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
it is inevitable that it is a huge monster.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
So your cost will be very high.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Another one is

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
if you want to be more practical,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
become a portable device.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
For example, when you are diving,

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
you also want to communicate.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
For example, when you are caving,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
you also want to communicate.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
It is inevitable that if you wear it,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
there will be a problem of battery life

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and physical size.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
At this time,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
your traditional antenna structure

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
will become very inefficient

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
and unusable.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
Because for this wavelength,

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
our place is electrically small.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
It is here.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
It is well below theoretical bound.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
In addition to low-frequency applications,

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
we are also looking forward to

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
some applications with higher frequencies.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
For example,

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
our Apple Watch is a portable device.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Although it is not so huge,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
if we want to put the antenna

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
in a very small place,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
it will also be electrically small.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Or we may want to design

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
a medical device.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
After it reaches the human body,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
it will not only be electrically small,

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
but its signal will also be very, very weak.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
In addition,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
some people are thinking about wearable devices,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
such as clothes or contact lenses.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
These may also have higher frequencies,

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
but also require an electrically small scene.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
How to solve this problem?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
In fact,

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
humans have used a similar concept before,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
but it did not happen in the antenna.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It happened in other places.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
If you look at the picture on the right,

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
this is the circuit board of our ancient age.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
There is also this kind of electrode and capacitor on it.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
This chip is very early.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
It is called the surface wave filter.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
So later,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
we can make the circuit very small,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
and no longer use these,

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
what is it called?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Distributor or something.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
This kind of characteristic electrode and capacitor

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
can be integrated into the chip and become smaller

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
because of this surface wave filter.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
What is its basic concept?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It is what we learned in high school.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
The frequency is equal to the frequency times the wavelength.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Then our acoustic wave

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
is about 1,000 to 10,000 meters per second.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
But our speed of light is 3 times 4,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
which is 8 square meters per second.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
So if we want to use the same operating frequency,

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
the wave speed will be proportional to the wavelength.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
So intrinsically,

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
if you use a mechanical wave as a resonance,

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
its physical size will be about 10 to the 5th order.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
In the deep wave filter and later,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
in fact, our mobile phones are already in use.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
It is called duplexer, diplexer, or filter.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
They are all used to operate frequency components or oscillators.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
These things have long been used

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
in the deep wave components of mechanics,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
which is the surface wave filter.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
There is also a newer technology

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
called the Fog Acoustic Wave.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
So is it possible to realize this in the antenna?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Everyone is thinking about

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
whether it is possible to apply a similar concept

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
to make it smaller.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
It can really shrink it,

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
or although it is smaller,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
its performance is acceptable.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
So everyone has been discussing a new concept

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
for about a year or two.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
In fact, it is not possible,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
but I started to think about it again.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
I proposed a term called Mechanical Antenna.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It is relatively electrical,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
called mechanical.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
In this article in 2019,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
they should also be part of the DAPA team.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
They were discussing

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
what kind of research there is now

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
and what is the difference between it and traditional antenna.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
This is how he described it.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I want to clarify one thing.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
Because ZOO, or ZOO Theory,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
is basically a circuit.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
But in fact,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
you can replace all the components on the circuit

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
with equivalent mechanical components.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
So in theory,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
the equation is still correct.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
It's just that now you have changed Lambda to be very small,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
so K becomes very large.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Sorry, Lambda is very large,

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
so K becomes very small.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
But that one square plus three squares,

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
that relation should still be Holtz, right?

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Theoretically, it is like this,

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
but there is not a very strict,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
complete argument.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
That's what we think.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
This will be discussed later.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Then this Mechanical Antenna,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
he described it like this.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
He said, for example,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
if we think about the source of the electromagnetic wave,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
it can be a moving electron,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
which becomes a current.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Does that moving become a physical motion,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
rather than a current?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
So he said,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
you can take a desystatic field source,

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
like a magnet or charge distribution,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
then mechanically move it

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
to modulate its external field.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
So for an observer,

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
the electromagnetic wave he received,

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
for them,

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
it is no different from the equivalent electrical induced dipole.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
It can do this.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
Then he discussed some different designs in it.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
For example, on the left,

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
in some ferroelectric or ferromagnetic materials,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
there will be a lot of dipole moments.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
Then you apply some stress to it,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
alternating stress.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
The dipole moment may change direction

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
and produce an electromagnetic wave.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Or more violently,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
you spin the whole ferromagnetic iron

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
to produce an electromagnetic wave radiation.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
You can check this paper if you are interested.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
But I think many of his discussions are still very primitive.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
In fact, I don't fully believe it.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
Then he summarized the current mechanical antenna,

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
operating band, and some references.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
My focus now is on this area,

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
from very high frequency to ultra high frequency.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
Then I use these ferro materials

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
as the source of radiation.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I am more focused on this area

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
because the data rate of this frequency is higher,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
so there may be commercial applications.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
But in fact, if it is low frequency,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
it is a military application.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
But I haven't found a partner yet,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
so I may be interested in developing it.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
I know they are already doing it in the US.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
The other article is also published this year.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Not mine.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
He is also discussing

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
the structure of different new mechanical antennas.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
For example, there is a model of general antenna.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
When it is electrically small,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
in order to make it match,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
it will become very lossy.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
There is a problem with it.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Then your radiation efficiency will become poor.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It is also difficult to match.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Then this mechanical antenna

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
can also draw some equivalent circuits

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
to calculate its radiation.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
In this article,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
the main comparison is

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
electrolyte,

35:54.000 --> 36:00.000
that is, electric charge,

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
or Pielo electric material.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
In the end, Klein said

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
that in the structure of Pielo electric alternating dipole,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
we can expect that

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
it is smaller than the traditional dipole antenna.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
When it is small,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
its relative efficiency

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
can be up to 10 to 6 times.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
This is already published in the article of Applied Physics.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
If we use the characteristics of the electric charge,

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
its radiation efficiency can be up to 10 to 6 times.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
However, don't think 10 to 6 times is very powerful.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Because it may only be a completely useless thing

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
to be slightly usable.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Because there is the theoretical bound.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Sorry, I keep interrupting.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I have a question.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
This is a small question.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
The surface acoustic wave,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
or mechanical wave in general,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
is its lossiness related to temperature?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Is it related to the temperature of the material?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Yes.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Yes.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
So in theory,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
the lower my imagination is,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
the higher its Q is, right?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Yes.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
The characteristics of its resonance

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
will definitely be affected by temperature.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
But what about its sensitivity?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
What about the situation of Q downgrade?

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
So when I read these articles,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
I naturally think of a few questions.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
The first one is,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
just now,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
our bandwidth efficiency product,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
this theoretical bound,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
can the mechanical antenna

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
make a similar prediction?

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
What is its definition?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
This is the first question.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
The second question is,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
is the mechanical antenna

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
below or beyond the Q limit?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
If it is below the Q limit,

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
how close can it approach the theoretical bound?

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Does it have any practical application value?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
These are all questions

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
that have not yet been answered.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
Can I ask a few questions?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
I'm just curious.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
So generally speaking,

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
what materials are currently used?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
The second question is,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I think the mechanical wave

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
has a high Q,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
but is it impossible

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
to make an amplifier component?

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
No one has done this before.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Is it possible to do

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
a mechanical amplifier component?

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
The first question is,

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
what did you just say?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
I forgot.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Sorry.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Generally speaking,

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
what materials are used?

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Materials.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
For example,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
this is called electric.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
It can hold charge

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
and make some mechanical motion.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
This is called magnet.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
But you can also apply

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
the dipole moment in the material.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
For example,

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
there are some piezoelectric materials

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
or ferromagnetic materials.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
You can let the dipole moment

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
generate an equivalent current or magnetic current

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
to generate electromagnetic radiation.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
So the main materials used are

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
piezoelectric materials,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
ferromagnetic materials,

39:36.000 --> 39:43.000
or purely charged and magnetic materials.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
The second question is,

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
why did you mention

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
the mechanical amplifier?

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
I think it's easy to make an amplifier

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
in a battery.

40:04.000 --> 40:12.000
But if you receive a mechanical wave,

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
do you need to...

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
It's not difficult to send a mechanical wave,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
but how do you receive it

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
and how do you amplify it?

40:26.000 --> 40:31.000
Is this a more realistic question?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Or do you want to turn it into an electronic signal

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and amplify it?

40:36.000 --> 40:42.000
I think if I'm thinking about

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
applying this,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I would think about

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
what difficulties it faces

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
on the receiving end.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
But this seems a bit too broad,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
so I don't know if you...

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Like you said,

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
this is a very deep research.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
For example,

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
I know piezoelectric materials

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
because they already have

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
a lot of commercial applications,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
like the Surface Acoustic Wave

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
or Bar Acoustic Wave.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
For these,

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
they have some equivalent circuit models.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
For example,

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
if you receive it,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
you can turn it from an electromagnetic wave

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
into a mechanical wave.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Then the mechanical wave

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
can be equivalent to a circuit

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
and do some calculations and matching

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
with the circuit.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
But the difficulties I'm facing now

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
will be discussed later.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
These are also other difficulties.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
In the case of piezoelectric,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
the properties are well-known.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
This is called multi-fluid material.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
At first glance,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
I thought,

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
what is this word?

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
If we look at it from this picture,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
it's electrically polarizable

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
or magnetically polarizable.

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
There is a intersection between them.

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
There is ferroelectric and ferromagnetic.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
At the same time,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
there is ferroelectric and ferromagnetic,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
which is called multi-fluid.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
If it is a physical property,

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
for example,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
electrical will have electrical polarization,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
and the applied magnetic field

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
will have magnetization.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
There will be a corresponding

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
piezoelectricity between them.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
For example,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
from stress to electrical field,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
electrical field becomes stress.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
This is called magnetoelectricity.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Magnetoelectricity is

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
when you give it a stress,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
it can become a magnetic field.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
This is the relationship between the changes.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
There are some materials,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
but the research progress

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
between them is not the same.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
In 2015,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
the UCLA group,

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
we cooperated with their group.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
They proposed this structure,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
that is to say,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
using MANS.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Basically,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
it is the

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
far-acoustic resonator.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
However,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
it allows the stress,

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
the force,

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
to drive the other ferromagnetic material.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Then,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
the magnetic dipole moment

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
will generate the same magnetic current,

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
generating electromagnetic radiation.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Why did they develop such a component?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
In addition to what I just said,

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
it may have a relatively high frequency application.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
In addition,

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
it can be integrated with some materials.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
However,

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
my research is based on this research

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
to make some extensions.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
However,

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
I also hope that

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
since I have decided to stay in Taiwan,

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
I can develop this component.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
The governing equation behind it

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
is basically

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
in addition to Maxwell's equation,

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Newton's law,

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
there is another one

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
to describe its

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
magnetization behavior,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
called Landau-Lipschitz-Gilbert equation.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
This equation basically describes

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
that if your electron has an external applied

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
magnetic field,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
it will have a precession

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
and some loss.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
It describes the relationship

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
between your magnetization

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
and your applied magnetic field

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
dynamically.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
They use this model

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
to do FDTD numerical simulation calculation

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
to calculate

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
its theoretical performance and upper limit.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
It was published in 2015.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
In 2017,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
this structure,

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Sound of Nature,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
said that

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
it has measured this signal

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
in the experiment.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
If you look at this picture,

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
it uses a home antenna

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
at 2.5 GHz.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
It has a similar structure.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Ammonium nitride is a PLA electric material.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
Iron is another kind of magnetic material.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Ferromagnetic material.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
The contrast of these two pictures

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
is that

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
the strength of the signal

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
in their operating band

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
is obvious.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
This is a reflector.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
It has energy in it,

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
but its reflector

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
does not have radiation.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
It has a signal

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
about 20 dB older.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
It claims that

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
its device

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
is experimentally successful.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
However,

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
I have some questions.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
One is that

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
the UCLA group

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
is Northeastern.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
The UCLA group

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
has not been able to do it yet.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
The other is that

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
it claims that

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
it does not need

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
a biased magnetic field.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
It can also have a strong coupling.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
This is what

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
we usually think about

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
when we think about radiation theory.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
The UCLA group and I

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
have used

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Ferromagnetic Resonance,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
or FMR,

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
to describe radiation.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
If you want to produce FMR,

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
you must have a biased magnetic field.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
This is explained by

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
H-current law.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
I am not sure if it is true,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
but they have published Nature.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
Next is my research.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
Based on this structure,

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
I did some extension work,

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
from simulation to actual experiment.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
My starting point is extension work.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
We are running out of time,

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
so you may have to finish it as soon as possible.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
OK.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
The rest is just some results.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I will try to speed up.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
So,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
based on their design structure,

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
I was wondering if it is possible

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
to explore some of the features of their project.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
So I referred to some

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
design of resonator.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
The reason for doing this is

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
because their operating direction

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
is longitudinal.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
If you have something made of metal,

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
your radiation efficiency will be downgraded.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
This is the property of image current.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
So I was wondering

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
if it is possible that it is not longitudinal,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
but lateral,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
implanted resonance.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
This implanted resonance

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
may be able to do some planning.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
This article was published the year before.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
It was in conference,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
because it was not done yet.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
So I designed this structure.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
I used COMSOL simulation,

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
and then used an ideal and simple assumption

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
to calculate the radiation.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
So,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
I designed this structure.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
First,

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
if you want to generate a plant,

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
you need two orthogonal resonant pairs,

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
and a 90-degree difference.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
In this case,

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
you can generate an original model.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
I calculated the magnitude.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Then,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
I used the magnitude

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
to make some initial assumptions.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
The stress field and magnetic current

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
are proportional.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
Then, I calculated the original radiation,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
the electromagnetic radiation.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
Then, I used the original radiation

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
to calculate the original performance.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Then,

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
I calculated this initial picture,

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
which is directly related to the model,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
and its radiation pattern,

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
which is a circular polarized dipole.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
You can observe that

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
in very low frequency,

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
which is not the resonant band,

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
the magnitude is small,

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
but the motion is mostly circular.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
In the operating band,

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
the magnitude is much larger,

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
and the motion is circular.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
In other bands,

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
the motion is almost non-circular.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
That's about it.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
I have a question.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
You show the actual numbers.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Your bandwidth is micron,

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
and it's 10 to the power of 6 to the power of 7.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
Is the displacement actually nanometer or sub-nanometer?

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Yes.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
This is a simulation.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
But at the end of the day,

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
if you want to make a device,

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
your environment may be like an optical table.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Otherwise, the noise will be super loud.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
Yes.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
I will put my experiment results at the end.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
No, that's called verifying your theoretical calculations.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
No problem.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
It should be downgraded.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
I don't know.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
I will talk about this later.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
In fact, this size is very idealized.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
In fact, our fabrication process...

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
I think I showed the diameter.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
How much is it?

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
This simulation case is an idealized case.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
If the motion is circular,

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
it means the radius is close to the height.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
There will be a circular mode.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
But in fact,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
the material cannot be made so small and so thick.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
So it will become like a disk.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
If I simulate with a disk,

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
its mesh will become very complicated.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Because its width and thickness are a bit different.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
You may have a very fine mesh here.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Then your mesh element will become a lot.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Then the calculation will be very long and not very accurate.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
So you will see some strange results.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
If it is a circular motion of a disk,

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
is it really feasible?

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
I think I have some problems with simulation.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Anyway, let's do it.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
So the first version,

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
I asked UCL to make a chip.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
This chip is the bow antenna in front.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
In order to feed a 90-degree angle,

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
I made a coupler.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
Then it will feed a 90-degree angle.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
This is the proportion map.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
Then I made a matrix.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
One is nickel.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
They used nickel earlier.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
But in fact, nickel cannot be used in high-frequency applications.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
The material is also a big problem.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
Then there are different radius sizes.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Then I use a home antenna in the far-field region to receive.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
The one below is the magnetic field to be biased.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
It's DC.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
Then I use a patch antenna to compare.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
This patch antenna is fabricated.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
Its receiving wall and its noise

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
are about 20 dB different.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
It's where the reflection coefficient is.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
I want to compare it with the environment noise.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
There should be a difference.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
Anyway, this is the band I designed.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
Theoretically, this is what you want to see.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
This picture is S21.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
This is patched.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
This is patched.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
This is patched.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
This is its background noise, red.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
This is where the signal strength is.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
I want to see if it can be compared with the noise.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
I want to see if it can be compared with the noise.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Obviously, S21 is patched.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
Obviously, S21 is patched.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
4-pole and low-pole,

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
I made another standard.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
I soldered a small 50-ohm resistor.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
I soldered a small 50-ohm resistor.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
I soldered a small 50-ohm resistor.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
I compared it with the resistance of the terminal.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
I used a bandwidth.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
I compared it with two things.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
One is patched.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
The other is the terminal resistor.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
4-pole is the actual result.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
4-pole is the actual result.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
This picture is a little bit wrong.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
This picture is a little bit wrong.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
There is a false wire.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
It is not corrected.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
Blue.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
My first measurement was 2 years ago.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
My first measurement was 2 years ago.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
It is not very successful.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
Original antenna radiation.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
The 4-pole and low-pole are not clearly visible.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
The 4-pole and low-pole are not clearly visible.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
Specific frequency band.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
I compared it with the S11.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
It is not very visible.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
It is not very visible.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
It is not very visible.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
It is not very visible.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
It is not very visible.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
It is not very visible.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
The other reference.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
The showed is the difference.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
The showed is the difference.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
The shown is the difference.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
The shown is the difference.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
The shown is the difference.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
The shown is the difference.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
The shown is the difference.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
The shown is the difference.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
The shown is the difference.

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
So the final conclusion is

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
So the final conclusion is

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
My coupler itself has radiation

56:34.000 --> 56:39.000
So how to eliminate coupler radiation

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
So the first step is

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
I don't want to do the original plan

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
I just look at one of its modes

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
For one mode, I just need to add an electrode

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
No need to fit such a large coupler

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
No need to fit such a large coupler

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
The second step is

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Even if I want to look at radiation

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
I need to make sure the material has a circular mode

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
So what I'm doing now is

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I need to look at the material

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
To see if it really has a circular mode

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
This can be done using some mechanics

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
To look at the vibration mode

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
After these two things are confirmed

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
We'll see if there's a circular mode

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
We'll see if there's a circular mode

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
In terms of mechanics

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
No one has ever discussed the circular mode

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
In terms of the circular mode

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
If it's for a system with poor signal quality

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
It's very important

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Because using the circular mode

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Improves the transmission of data

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
But in the end, this is a bigger problem

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
In addition to the theoretical questions I mentioned earlier

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
And the structure

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
Which application can actually be used

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
To achieve this performance

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
At the moment, I'm doing some extensions on this work

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
But this is actually a pretty new topic

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
There's still a lot to explore

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
That's all for my speech

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Thank you

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Does anyone have any questions?

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
If not, I'll ask a question

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
I have a question about

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
The working mechanism of your system

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
Can you go back to the structure diagram

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
There's a piezoelectric

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
And there's a ferroelectric on top

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
Can you explain a little bit

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
How this thing

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
Generates and receives signals?

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
Let's look at this diagram

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
If we look at the diagram on the right

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
The first thing that the piezoelectric material does

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Is that there's an electrode on both sides

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And there's a voltage difference

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
Which creates an electrode

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
And this electrode

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
The alternating electrode

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
Will produce a deformation in the opamp material

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
And this deformation creates a resonance

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
So this is an electrical field

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
Which becomes a resonance through the piezoelectric electricity

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
The resonance of the structure

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
Will cause a change in the stress

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
And in the magnetostrictive material

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Its characteristic is

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
If it has an applied stress field

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
The magnetization or magnetic dipole moment

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Or its internal magnetic field

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Will have something to do with the applied stress

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So its magnetization will change

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
But this is also a problem and challenge

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Because the piezoelectric electricity

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Has a commercial application

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So its behavior is well known

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
But in the magnetostrictive material

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Its theory is not so complete

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
We should have

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Also been related to G.E.F.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
When they discovered this phenomenon

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And it's more primitive

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
If you apply a stress

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It will cause deformation

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And the magnetic field of its beam will change

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So they want to use this design

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000
To produce dynamic magnetization in the resonance

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Theoretically, dynamic magnetization

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Is equivalent to magnetic current

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Just like AC current

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
If you have AC magnetic current

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It will also produce electromagnetic radiation

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
That's about it

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But the problem is

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
There are many discussions about this material

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
For example

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
What is the effect of its power absorption

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And what is the efficiency of its coupling

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And so on

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
What is the acoustic buffer?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
This thing

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
They want the fundamental mode

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The standing wave

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
This is related to their theoretical prediction

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
When you are in the resonance

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
For example, you must be 2 times the wave

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
2 times the 3rd wave

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Is the second wave the stress wave?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Yes, it's the mechanical stress resonant wave

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So that thing is to form a cavity

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Yes, it's to make the standing wave

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
The strongest stress field

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
To work on the magnetic material

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Theoretically, we apply the strongest stress field

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It should have the strongest magnetic field change

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
So they added this acoustic buffer

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Is the magnetic radiation as strong as the electrical radiation?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I rarely heard of someone

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
It's usually an electric dipole

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It's rare to have a real magnetic dipole

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
There is a type of antenna

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
It's called loop antenna

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It's like a donut

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Loop antenna is a loop current

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
We know that according to

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I forgot the current

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Anyway, it's a loop current

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
It's equivalent to a magnetic dipole

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Alternative magnetic dipole

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
So there is a design called loop antenna

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
When we calculate

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Sometimes we use this equivalent theory

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
To calculate its radiation with magnetic dipole

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Its characteristics are indeed different

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
For example, it may be more inductive

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Or some characteristics are different

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
But it does have this

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
It's called loop antenna

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
OK

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Another question I'm interested in

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You just mentioned

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
This is the original signal

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
It will make your transmission better

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
It should be better than signal to noise

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Yes

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Why is this?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Well

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
One is

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Under this architecture

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Because it's a longitudinal magnetic current

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
According to image theory

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
If it's on a

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Infinite metal surface

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Actually its direction

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Its radiation will cancel

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Their original design

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
They didn't consider this problem

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Of course, if you don't need to put it on any metal plane

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
You won't have this problem

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But it's possible that

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Your antenna is still placed on some metal

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
So you will have this problem

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
In longitudinal

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
This is the antenna design itself

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I didn't put it in the video

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It's

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Originality

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
It's usually used in satellite communication

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Why?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Because satellite communication

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Has very high requirements for sensitivity

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
In fact

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
General antenna

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
If you don't use originality

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
But random or linear

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
There will be some problems when it's transmitted

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
For example

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
The first one is

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
If you want to receive

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
You need alignment

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Then you need to align the antenna

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
That's a lot of trouble

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Originality won't have this problem

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
The second one is

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
For example, in many architectures

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
When it's reflected and transmitted

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
The loss of originality will be much smaller

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
OK

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
So there may be differences between S and P in the antenna

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
S and P

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Like booster angle

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
S-Wave or P-Wave

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The reflection rate is different

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Or

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I didn't understand this in detail

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
But

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
They will talk about something called

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Faraday effect

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
What else?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Multipath loss

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
But if you have very high requirements for the system

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I usually want to use originality

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Just because of our mobile phones and Wi-Fi

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
There is no such thing as system requirements

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Just say whatever

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
But if you are

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
To satellite or military

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
If the sensitivity requirement is very high

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I would prefer to use originality

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
It also has

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Linearity is a direction of modulation

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Originality can also double its capacity

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It's kind of like a better choice

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
But it's usually more difficult to implement

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
OK, I see

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Thank you

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Is there any other questions?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
May I ask

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
What is the thickness of the electrode?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Between the piezoelectric

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And magnetostrict layer

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
What material is it?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000
The thickness of the electrode here

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I think it's about

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It should not be

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It should be 0.1 micrometer

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
It's very, very thin

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Then my material

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Color is according to them

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
That is, the process

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
They should be using

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
They started with PT

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000
But the last fabricated thing

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
This is where it connects to the electrode above

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I remember they used PT

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
It's thin

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And then the electrode

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Will affect its resonance

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
There will be some

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Mod

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Resonance mod

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And then there will be some loss

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
But relatively speaking

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Not so serious

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
but

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
If you want to optimize

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Electrode factors will also need to be considered

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Because it may be like a buffer

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
So you

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Your stress may not necessarily

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Will affect the

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Magnetostrict material

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I understand what you mean

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Because if you want

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Resonance stress field

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
It needs an air cavity design

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
That is

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
In bioacoustic wave resonator

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
It will have different designs

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
You will reduce

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
There is a kind of

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
You have to try to keep

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Its energy in this structure

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
To correct

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
It may have an air cavity

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Or a reflector design

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Because your theory is

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I hope your strain

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Can cause a magnetic field

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Change

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
but

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I'm talking about your buffer layer now

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Because your government

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Must be small

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Because it is a p-zoid material

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Maybe less than

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
One nanometer

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Yes

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Then you have a layer on top

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Such a thick metal

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I don't know

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Magnetostrict

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
How much magnetic field

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The electrode he used

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
That is

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
The electrode he actually fabricated

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Not as thick as intended

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
But indeed

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
In fact, how much

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Magnetization change

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Also

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Still studying

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
That is

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Either you look at its power absorption

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Or look at it

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
At least you have to make sure

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
It has power absorption

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
You can look at its radiation

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
That is

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Now is

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
For example, this

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Magnetostrict

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Some characteristics of power absorption

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Everyone is still studying

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I'm just curious

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Like your structure

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
How do you design

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
The frequency of your work

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Basically just

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
That depends on

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Is the thickness of the material of the magnetostrict

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
No, it's the total thickness

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Roughly speaking

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
That's right

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
But I use COMSOL first

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
That is

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
In theory, each mode of it

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
It should be able to calculate

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Geometric

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Some relationships

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Resonance

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But roughly the thickness

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
The main thing is to determine its resonance frequency

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
That's right

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
How many modes do you want it to work

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That is

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Fundamental mode

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
That is

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I see

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
OK

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Thank you

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Then

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
At first

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I will use COMSOL first

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
To simulate

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Maybe this

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
The mode you want

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Its characteristic mode

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
What frequency is it

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I have a question

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Yes

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
That is

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Where is your device

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
You said you are teaching UCLA, right?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I am with

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
That is

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
They are a center called

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
California

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Nano system

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
What

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Then it is actually

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Someone is responsible for theoretical

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Someone is responsible for fabrication

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Someone is responsible for material development

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Then I am with them

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Fabrication group

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Cooperate

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
So I put my design

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Draw a layout for it

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Then he helped me make it

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Then send it to me

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Then I measure

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
But I am now

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I hope I can be in Taiwan directly

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
To develop these materials

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
You finished answering my question

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
That is

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I want to ask Taiwan

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Can you do this in Taiwan

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Oh yeah

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I am now

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Because actually

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Like Taichung Institute of Technology

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
They may

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Someone was studying before

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Surface Acoustic Wave Filter

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Or something

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But as far as I know

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
All over Taiwan

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
No one is studying now

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
No one is doing

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
That is

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
BoFilter with commercial application

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
But in fact

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
BoFilter this thing has been

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
What brocon

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Avago

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
They are already

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It is already

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Commercial

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
But Taiwan does not have this technology now

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
That is

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
BoFilter

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
In fact, it is for

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Compared with SoFilter

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Its high-frequency performance

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Is much better

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It can be up to 6GHz

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It can be a good filter

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Then very small

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Probably

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
1mm

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Or smaller

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
1mm2

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Next I have a

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
It's my little suggestion

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It's not common

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
It's not a problem

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
That is

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I guess Ted should be the same as me

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That is, we may all have a little

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Occupational disease

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
There is a little bias

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I think this

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Measure this thing for the first time

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
To verify its quality

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Or to deny

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
That

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Northeastern quality

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I think this

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
This may be you

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Not only do you have to go to the light table

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
You still have to low temperature

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
You may have to give it a cover

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
That

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
New Metal Cam

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
What to cover the magnetic field of the earth

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Should be

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
You really have to be able to control your

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Your

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
That field

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
You should say you have to control your

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Background

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
To be very low

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
May be able to see

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Yes, that's right

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I think you have to vacuum

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Of course

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
You have to vacuum at low temperature

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Otherwise you have to turn the air into ice

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Put it in

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Yes, it should be

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Should be

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I think so too

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
So Ted, do you think so?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Yes, it is

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Because

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Something with wind power is

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I think it needs

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
How much 4K

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
At least

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I think this is my opinion

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Is

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
You

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I'm talking like this now

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Oh, you have to control your environment

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
To do this

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
This measurement

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It feels like it's not commercializable

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Or

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
More practical

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Technology

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
But I think this is the first step

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
So I don't think he

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It's impossible to pull up in the future

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
But I

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I look at it now

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You have to do the first measurement now

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
May be

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's not that your device is bad

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Or your simulation is wrong

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Or something

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I think it may be

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Measurement

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Not easy to do

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
But there should be a chance

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Yes

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Yes

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Like that

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Northeastern

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
The two of them

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
That thing

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Since 2017

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
There is no more

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Repeat work

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Because I know how to do

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Graduate from graduate school

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Ha ha ha ha

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Is

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
They switched to low-frequency applications

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Then

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Yes

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I don't know

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Anyway, I just

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Keep going

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
OK

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Is there any other questions?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
If not

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Then I'll put that first

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Recording

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Turn it off
