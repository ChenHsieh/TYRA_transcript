1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Recording has started.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In fact, he was originally a law student at NTU Law School.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He had studied in the Department of Law at Hokkaido University in Japan for a year.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Not only did he complete his law degree, he also obtained a lawyer's license.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He also worked at a large law firm in Taiwan and Japan.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
To add to that, Ming-Hsi and I have known each other for a long time.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We were classmates in the same year at NTU Law School.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In our hearts, Ming-Hsi has always been a strong character like a god.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We thought it was difficult for him to study law.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We didn't expect him to be able to study history.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Not only that, he is also the president of NTU's Food & Beverage Association.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
To us, he has always been a very strong god.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He also won countless books.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think it's very impressive.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's cool about Ming-Hsi is that he always follows a two-way path.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He studies both law and history at the same time.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
At the moment, he is in the Department of History at NTU Law School.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He also combined his two-way background with his major.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
His field of research includes modern international law history,

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
East Asian legal modernization,

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Sino-US relations history,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
international economic law and tax law, and so on.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was thinking about today's topic, foreign law.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
For many people, foreign law is a familiar and uncertain concept.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So let's talk about the rules of today's speech.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Today's speech is actually quite simple.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you have any questions,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you can either turn on your microphone and ask the speaker directly.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ming-Hsi likes this kind of interactive speech mode.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Or if you are shy or worried about affecting the speaker's flow,

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you can also post your questions in the chat area.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I will find the right time to ask.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
After Ming-Hsi finishes his speech,

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
we will also have a Q&A session.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If everyone is okay,

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
let's welcome Ming-Hsi.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello, everyone.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Can you see my PowerPoint?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you for your introduction.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
As Yi-An said,

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
we are both university classmates.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But in the legal department of NTU,

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think Yi-An and I are quite different.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yi-An left the legal department to study psychology

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and became a lawyer.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am honored to have Yi-An as my host.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Today's topic is

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
controlling US citizens in China.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is my research plan for the first-year students

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
in the history department of NTU.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This plan is still in the early stages,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
so I would like to share it with you.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I found that in this project,

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
there are fewer liberal arts students.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So I will spend a little more time

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to introduce to you

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the current situation of humanities

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and legal studies in the US.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So today's speech will be divided into several parts.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
One is self-introduction.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I don't think I need to introduce too much,

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
because Yi-An has given me a very detailed explanation.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The second part is to share with you

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
what history is.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is actually a common question for everyone.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I am often asked by teachers

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
in different departments or classmates.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because history is abstract.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We can say that what happened in the past is history.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There are so many things in history.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As a historian or a doctoral student in history,

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
how do we choose the topic?

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How do we do research?

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In other words, what are the doctoral students

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
in the history department doing?

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why do I want to study legal history?

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is the relationship between law and history?

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In particular, why do I want to choose the topic

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
of international law as my research topic?

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
After the introduction of these major subjects

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and the background,

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will talk about my initial research in the first year.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That is, what is the foreign law in the United States?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In the past, in high school textbooks,

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
we often heard that foreign law

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is a part of an unequal treaty.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
In the past, our country or China

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
suffered a lot of unequal treatment.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then it was a matter of losing power.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is it true? Is it true?

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Did the United States benefit from this?

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Who benefited from this?

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The first research in the history department

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
is to clarify some facts and some institutional backgrounds.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The higher level is to develop theories.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So in the end, I want to talk about my future plan.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How do I develop these facts and their theoretical meanings

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and then carry out my future research?

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So here, actually,

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yi-An has already introduced it to me.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not drunk.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to talk about the last point.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That is, why do I want to study history?

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
In fact, my initial goal was

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
to teach in a law school in the United States.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Here, I think there is something very interesting

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that I can share with you.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
In the United States, professional schools,

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
such as law schools,

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
their practice is very different from

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
what we usually do in history, physics, or math.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
As a historian, I will tell you

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
what the origin and evolution of this system is.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As you know,

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
in the world of legal education,

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
North America is very special.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
They do not have legal education in the university.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Unlike in Taiwan, Japan, Germany,

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the United Kingdom, or France,

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
we can choose the law department

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
after graduating from high school.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
After graduating from the law department,

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you can take a law exam.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then you can become a lawyer

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
or continue to study for a master's degree

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and return to the law department to teach.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is not the case in the United States and Canada.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The U.S. Department of State does not have a law department.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You have to graduate from the Department of State

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
before you can get your first law degree,

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
which is called JD, or Juris Doctor.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's the same as MD.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It has the title of a doctor,

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but it's not a Ph.D. doctor.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So traditionally,

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
when there was a law school in the United States,

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
they thought that

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
law was a skill,

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
not a subject.

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So in the 19th century,

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the teachers of the law school

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
were some senior lawyers,

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
judges, or food workers.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And the education of the law school

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
was to have these food workers

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
tell you how to become a good lawyer.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So the course of the law school

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
was very food-oriented.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It taught you how to sign a contract,

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
how to act or defend in front of the jury,

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
how to interact and interrogate,

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
how to get along with the judge,

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and so on and so forth.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Later, everyone thought

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
that if you teach at school,

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you still need to have a little bit of academic knowledge.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But there was no such thing as a law Ph.D.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So what should you do?

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There is still a method

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
taught at law schools in the United States

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
called traditional track,

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
which allows you to become a teacher of the law school.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What is traditional track?

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's when you graduate from college

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and become a JD,

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
your first law degree.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
After that,

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you become a lawyer for three years

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
or a judge assistant for three years

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
to gain food experience.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
After gaining food experience,

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you go to the law department of the university

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to apply for the position of teacher.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
When you're a teacher,

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
it's usually three years.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You have to teach on the side.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What you teach is to teach some legal writing,

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
mathematical writing, and so on.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
These are related to food.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
During the three years you teach,

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you have to write a master's thesis.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If this master's thesis is well written,

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you can go to various schools

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and apply for the position of assistant professor.

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Once you become an assistant professor,

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
you'll be like other departments.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You'll start writing thesis,

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
升等,教書, and so on.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But later,

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
in the 1970s or 1980s,

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
we found that

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the failure of being a fellow

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and not becoming an assistant professor

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
is very high.

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This can also be seen.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In JD for three years,

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you're learning how to write a book,

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and then you become a lawyer for three years.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It doesn't make sense.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When you go back to law school,

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you suddenly start writing a thesis.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Like everyone here,

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
we all study Ph.D.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We all know that

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
writing a thesis requires a lot of practice,

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and then you need someone to lead.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You need a lot of research methods, and so on.

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So later, the U.S. Law School

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
came up with a new way

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to make you a teacher,

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
which is the so-called JD Ph.D. double degree.

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
In other words,

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you get a Ph.D. in another field,

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
such as history, economics,

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
politics, language,

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
psychology, and so on.

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then you go to JD,

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and then you become a lawyer for two years.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
At this point, you don't have to be a fellow,

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and you can take your Ph.D. thesis

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Basically,

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
all the new professors at the U.S. Law School

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
are JD Ph.D. double degrees.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is my original goal.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to get a Ph.D. in history first,

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and then I want to get a Ph.D. in JD.

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Then I can apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There are more and more Chinese people

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
applying for a Ph.D. degree

232
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
at the U.S. Law School

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
through this kind of double degree.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But as far as I know,

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
no one in Taiwan

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
has applied for a Ph.D. degree

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
at the U.S. Law School in this way.

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So I want to give it a try.

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Next,

240
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
in the past,

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
most of the Ph.D. and JD degrees

242
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
were obtained at different schools.

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
For example,

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Professor Ian Ayers,

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
who is very famous for

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
doing legal economic analysis

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
at Yale University.

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He was MIT's Econ Ph.D.,

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
plus Yale's JD,

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and then he taught at Yale.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For people in mainland China,

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
for example,

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Professor Li Ji at UC Irvine,

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
he was a political science Ph.D.

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
at Northwestern University,

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
plus Yale's JD,

257
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and then he taught law at UC Irvine.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So this is what I want to challenge.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I want to practice and hone my knowledge

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
in the history department,

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
learn the methods of history,

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and write papers.

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Later on,

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
in the last stage of my Ph.D. program,

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in the 6th, 7th, or 8th year,

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I applied for a Ph.D. degree

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
at another school.

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I was a lawyer in the U.S. for two years,

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and then I taught at a law school.

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is a brief explanation

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
of why I want to

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
apply for a Ph.D. degree in history.

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
On the one hand,

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I always have this idea of cross-field.

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think this kind of training and environment in the U.S.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
is the best fit for my research.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The last thing I want to add is that

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I just said that

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Taiwanese have not yet read Ph.D. and JD,

280
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
right?

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The next question must be

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that in Taiwan's law department,

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
there are many legal scholars

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
who claim to have obtained a Ph.D. degree in the U.S.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What kind of degree did they read?

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What kind of career path did they embark on?

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Since they are different from Americans

288
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
who cultivate law schools,

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
they must have a different set of things, right?

290
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So I wrote LLM and JSD here later.

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Here I would like to explain to you

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
what this is.

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
LLM is generally translated as

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
a legal master's degree.

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It is a Latin abbreviation.

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It means that

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
if you are not in the U.S. today,

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
for example, the U.K., France,

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Taiwan, or Japan,

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you have already studied law in college.

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So it is an abbreviation

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
for a legal master's degree

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
for foreigners.

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is called LLM.

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You only need to study for nine months

306
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
without writing a paper.

307
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Then you can be qualified

308
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
to be a lawyer in New York.

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So in most cases,

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in general, in Taiwan or Japan,

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
if you have been a lawyer for three or five years

312
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and you think you need to retire,

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you can go to the U.S.

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and study for nine months.

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Among these LLM students,

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
some may be interested in academics.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So you can find a professor

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
who is willing to teach you

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
while you are studying LLM.

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Then you can enroll

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and become a JSD,

322
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
which we generally call

323
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
a legal master's degree.

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This JSD is actually very different

325
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
from our general Ph.D.

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Because once you enroll,

327
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you are a doctoral candidate.

328
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So you don't need to take classes,

329
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you don't need to be a teacher,

330
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you don't need to be a lecturer.

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
In principle, if you write a paper,

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you can graduate after the exam.

333
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So there are some very famous

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
LLM teachers in China.

335
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They may only study JSD for a year and a half

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
or two years

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
before they graduate.

338
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There are a lot of people like this.

339
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because JSD is not like

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
our Ph.D. training,

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you have to take classes,

342
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
take exams,

343
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
be a lecturer,

344
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
teach, and so on.

345
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So the problem with a JSD graduate

346
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
is that

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
their quality is not very certain.

348
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Some people are JSD,

349
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
their boss has very high requirements for them,

350
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
asking them to continue to take classes,

351
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
continue to study methods,

352
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
or take the qualification exam with them.

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Or some students are very smart.

354
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I have a lot of JSD teachers

355
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
in the Department of Law in Canada.

356
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They are very smart.

357
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They watch the lecturers

358
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
have a seminar in the law school every day,

359
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and they will kill each other.

360
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
They watch Huashan's paper every day

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and become a big family.

362
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
After they return to China,

363
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
they can be a Ph.D.

364
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and teach law in Taiwan.

365
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But in the US Department of Law,

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you can hardly see any teachers

367
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
who are JSD.

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Because they are

369
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Ph.D. for foreigners.

370
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is a brief introduction.

371
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I used to think that

372
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
if I went to the US to study law,

373
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I could just study LLM and JSD.

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But I thought,

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
no,

376
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I want to try to

377
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
receive the same training as Americans.

378
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If Americans want to become a professor of law,

379
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I will become a professor of law.

380
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So I started with Ph.D.

381
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Later,

382
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in my senior year,

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I will see if I can get a J.D.

384
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and try to find a job

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
in the US Department of Law.

386
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Next, I will answer a question.

387
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What is history?

388
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I am often asked this question.

389
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I think this is a disaster question.

390
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's like I want to ask,

391
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
what is physics?

392
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What is math?

393
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It is difficult to define a subject.

394
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But I think I can try

395
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to look at this subject

396
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
from a more specific perspective.

397
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What is it?

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think from the perspective of abstract theory,

399
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
in the Western context,

400
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
history is also a method of philosophy.

401
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In other words,

402
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the research we do in history

403
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
is the same as asking a question,

404
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
giving it a false hypothesis,

405
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and then verifying it, right?

406
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It is the same as philosophy, physics, and chemistry.

407
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We need to ask a question,

408
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and then use some methods to answer it,

409
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
to verify if your hypothesis is correct.

410
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Of course, this is a bit of nonsense.

411
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Because anyone who studies Ph.D.

412
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
has to do this kind of study.

413
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So I think we can look at history

414
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
from a different perspective.

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Whether it is Greece or China,

416
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
people in ancient times

417
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
have a cycle of history.

418
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
By cycle of history,

419
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I mean that

420
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
for them,

421
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
history is something that

422
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
happens over and over again.

423
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
For example,

424
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
in the Tang Dynasty,

425
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Emperor Taizong said that

426
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
history is the key to understanding the mind.

427
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In other words,

428
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
as long as you study the past,

429
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you will learn some lessons.

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
By cycle of history,

431
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I mean that

432
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
there is nothing new under the sun.

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So I understand the past,

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and I understand the future.

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Because what happened in the past

436
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
will keep happening over and over again.

437
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So as long as I know the past,

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I will know how to face the same thing in the future.

439
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What should I do when it happens again?

440
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But as we all know,

441
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
this is a kind of fantasy.

442
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
How is it possible that

443
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
people 200 years ago

444
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
would face the same problems

445
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
as we do now?

446
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course, it is different.

447
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
In the 18th and 19th centuries,

448
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
history was taken over by the state.

449
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There was a very

450
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
purposeful approach

451
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
to help

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
build a democratic country.

453
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
For example,

454
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
when Germany was about to be unified,

455
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
a group of historians came out

456
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and wrote history of Germany.

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They told us that we were different

458
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
from the Italians.

459
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We have a glorious history.

460
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Who is German?

461
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We have a common memory.

462
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This also happened

463
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
in the end of the Qing Dynasty

464
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and the beginning of the Republic of China.

465
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Chinese historians told you

466
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
that we are all descendants of the Yan Emperor.

467
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So we have a common ancestor.

468
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We must agree that we are all Chinese.

469
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So for a while,

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
history was used by the state

471
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
to build the common memory of the nation.

472
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
In the 19th century,

473
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
there was another trend.

474
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Social science,

475
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
political science,

476
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and other social sciences

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
wanted to become

478
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
like natural science

479
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and discover the common principles

480
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
of human society.

481
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
They wanted to analyze

482
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
why the French Revolution happened,

483
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
what its causal relationship was,

484
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and what its social background conditions were.

485
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If we can build

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
a abstract theory

487
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that the French Revolution

488
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
will happen

489
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
when the four conditions

490
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
are met,

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
we can predict

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
when the next revolution will happen

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
or prevent it from happening.

494
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Another famous example

495
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
is Marx.

496
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He said that human history

497
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
has a process.

498
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We will go from feudalism

499
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
to a small class revolution

500
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to a large class revolution.

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Many historians' work

502
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
is to prove

503
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
the theory of social science

504
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and the process

505
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
of social science principles.

506
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Until now,

507
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
many historians in mainland China

508
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
are still trying to prove

509
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the process of Marxism

510
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
in China.

511
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is the purpose

512
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
of the third kind of history.

513
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The fourth kind of history

514
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
is similar to the second kind of history,

515
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
but it starts to ask smaller questions.

516
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Historians want to

517
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
understand the history of the past

518
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and develop quantitative studies

519
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
of economics or politics.

520
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The most famous example

521
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
is Professor Daniel Clerman

522
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
at the University of South Carolina.

523
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
He taught at the University of Chicago

524
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
because his wife was a lawyer

525
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
who was afraid of the cold.

526
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
His family moved to South Carolina.

527
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He is a history doctor

528
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and a law professor

529
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
at the University of Chicago.

530
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
His research is very interesting.

531
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He uses the documents

532
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and information

533
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
he discovered

534
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
in history training

535
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and his strong

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
statistical and quantitative background

537
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
to do some

538
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
theoretical practical research.

539
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Some questions

540
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
are difficult to answer.

541
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Does judicial independence

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
help economic development?

543
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We are not like natural science,

544
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
which can control all variables

545
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
in the laboratory.

546
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
When we want to study this topic,

547
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
we have to do some social experiment

548
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to do the cause-and-effect theory,

549
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and we need to find

550
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
a lot of agent variables.

551
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Every time a country

552
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
does judicial independence reform,

553
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
it often follows

554
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
many other reforms at the same time.

555
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This is the best way

556
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
to understand the relationship

557
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
between judicial independence

558
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and economic development in the UK.

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Professor Dan Clearman

560
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
has some very good information.

561
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
For example,

562
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
he found that

563
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
in the 18th and 19th centuries,

564
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the UK was doing judicial independence reform.

565
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
At the same time,

566
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
East India Company

567
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
was listed

568
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
in London Stock Exchange

569
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
because

570
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
there was no

571
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
good information transmission system.

572
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Therefore, news from London

573
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
had to wait three or five days

574
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
before it could be sent to Amsterdam.

575
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
He thought

576
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
that the agent variables

577
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
of economic development

578
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
were the high and low prices

579
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
of East India Company's shares.

580
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Whenever a judicial independence

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
law or reform

582
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
occurred in the UK,

583
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
East India Company's shares

584
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
would rise or fall

585
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
when the news

586
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
was sent to Amsterdam.

587
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He used statistics

588
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to infer the situation in the UK.

589
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In the end,

590
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
he concluded that

591
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
every judicial independence reform

592
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
in the UK

593
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
had something to do

594
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
with the rise of

595
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
East India Company's shares.

596
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Without historical training,

597
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
East India Company's shares

598
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
would not have risen.

599
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This is another theory.

600
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
In the early years,

601
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
there was a theory

602
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that asked

603
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
why there was

604
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
no China in the West.

605
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In the early years,

606
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
historians liked to ask

607
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
why there was no capitalism in China,

608
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
why there was no scientific revolution in China,

609
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and why there was no

610
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
revolution in China.

611
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The next theory is

612
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
very popular recently,

613
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
but it is a bit similar

614
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
to the idea of a national state.

615
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Historians believe that

616
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the people's historical memory

617
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
should not serve the country.

618
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Therefore,

619
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
historians began to write

620
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
some important historical memories.

621
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
For example,

622
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
transitional justice should tell you

623
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that the Nazi massacre

624
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
against the Jews

625
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
was really horrible.

626
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We should remember this

627
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
forever.

628
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Because it happened once,

629
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
it may happen again.

630
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The main consciousness of Taiwan

631
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
must be awakened,

632
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
because the people of Taiwan

633
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
have been oppressed for the past 400 years.

634
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
These popular historical writings

635
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
are actually shaping historical memory.

636
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Another group of people

637
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
believe that

638
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
history should not serve the country,

639
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
so there are a lot of historical studies

640
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
to deconstruct the national state.

641
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
For example,

642
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
tradition is invented,

643
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and tradition does not have

644
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
a long history of 5,000 years.

645
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The so-called descendants of the King of Japan

646
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
only appeared for 100 years.

647
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The so-called Japanese cuisine

648
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
was invented after the Ming Dynasty.

649
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
In the Middle Ages,

650
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
the Emperor of Japan believed in Buddhism,

651
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
so he told everyone not to eat meat.

652
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
In ancient East Asia,

653
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
there were four categories of animals

654
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
in the world,

655
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
such as grass fish and birds.

656
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
At that time,

657
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the Emperor of Japan said

658
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that everyone was not allowed to eat meat,

659
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
grass fish and birds.

660
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
In fact,

661
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
before the Ming Dynasty,

662
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the Japanese did not eat beef or pork,

663
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
so the so-called barbecue and fried pork chops

664
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
were far-fetched Japanese cuisine.

665
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
They appeared in the late 19th century

666
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and even in the early 20th century.

667
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Finally, I think history

668
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
is different from everyone else.

669
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
In politics and sociology,

670
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
they ask more objective questions,

671
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
but in history,

672
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
they also ask subjective questions.

673
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Traditional sociology

674
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
may ask a question,

675
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
such as

676
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
whether the exam system

677
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
has promoted social movement.

678
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So some historical sociologists

679
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
will look for a lot of past history

680
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
to see if there are some

681
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
poor and hard-working people

682
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
who became good officials

683
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
because of the imperial examination,

684
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and then flew to Tengda

685
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and became famous

686
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
from the Han dynasty.

687
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But historical sociology

688
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
will ask a question.

689
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Objectively,

690
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
even if the imperial examination

691
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
really promoted social movement,

692
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
did the people at that time

693
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
really realize that

694
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
the imperial examination

695
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
promoted social movement?

696
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
In the Han dynasty,

697
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
there were some economic works.

698
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We can find out from economics

699
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
what is the meaning of

700
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Chou Chou's The Theory of Economics?

701
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What does it mean in economics?

702
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But historians may ask

703
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
a person who has not studied

704
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
modern economics,

705
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
has not studied Adam Smith,

706
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
or has not studied economics

707
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
in NTU,

708
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
how can he write The Theory of Economics?

709
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I think this is the difference

710
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
between historical sociology

711
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and other subjects.

712
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The next question is

713
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
what is legal history?

714
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Why is legal history

715
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
a field worth studying

716
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
for me?

717
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The first argument is,

718
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
of course,

719
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
all the legal experts in the court

720
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
are historians,

721
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
because the court can only

722
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
judge what has happened.

723
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I am going to discuss

724
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
whether Su Jianhe killed someone

725
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
in the past or not.

726
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Is he guilty or not?

727
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We can only discuss

728
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
whether he killed someone in the past.

729
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The court cannot decide

730
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
whether he will kill someone in the future.

731
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This is a matter of fact.

732
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The court can only deal with

733
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
what has happened.

734
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
From the legal point of view,

735
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
when we make a judgment,

736
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
the court will always

737
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
make a judgment.

738
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
In the tradition of British and American law,

739
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
there are many cases

740
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that are not in the text,

741
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
so you have to tell everyone

742
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
whether the case in front of you

743
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
is the same as the case in the past.

744
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
If it is the same,

745
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you should apply the same law.

746
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
If it is different,

747
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
you should make another explanation.

748
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
There are some famous cases

749
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
where, for example,

750
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
a court said that

751
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
A car must pay

752
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
$10,000.

753
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Later,

754
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
a new case came out

755
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
where

756
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
A was hit by B car.

757
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Then

758
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
A told the court

759
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that the driver of B car

760
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
should pay me $10,000.

761
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But the lawyer of B car said

762
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
no, no, no,

763
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
our case is different from A car.

764
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because A car is black

765
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and B car is red.

766
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Because humans are more alert

767
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
when they see a red car.

768
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So

769
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
when they are hit,

770
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
they have to take more responsibility

771
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
because they see a red car.

772
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
British and American law

773
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
has been debating this kind of thing,

774
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
so you have to keep looking at

775
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
the past cases

776
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
as they are now.

777
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Then you need a lot of

778
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
historical training

779
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The second thing is that

780
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
there is a saying in English

781
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
that the past is like a foreign country.

782
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So when we study

783
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the history of law,

784
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
it's like we are studying

785
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
another country.

786
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So it's like we are now in Taiwan,

787
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
we are going to legislate.

788
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We will refer to what the Japanese do,

789
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
what the Germans do,

790
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
what the Americans do.

791
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Because these comparisons

792
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
can give you some ideas.

793
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But if you refer to other countries,

794
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
you will be surprised.

795
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because from a psychological point of view,

796
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
people all have this

797
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
in-domain effect.

798
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's not good to play big

799
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
in front of the case.

800
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But you will think

801
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
what you have is the best.

802
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But sometimes when you look at

803
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
foreign things,

804
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
you will know that

805
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
there are many different ways

806
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
in this world.

807
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
For example, if I want to control

808
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
cigarettes,

809
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
can I refer to

810
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
how people controlled

811
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
opium in the past?

812
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Of course, opium and cigarettes

813
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
are different things.

814
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But you can think about

815
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
some new ideas.

816
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The second thing is that

817
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
we all know that

818
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
humans have a path to rely on.

819
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There is one thing that people

820
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
have been doing for a long time,

821
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and the legal history

822
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
can help you understand

823
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the background of this system

824
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and its reasons.

825
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What did people think at that time?

826
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
After understanding the reason for

827
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
the path to rely on,

828
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
we should now verify that

829
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
this condition no longer exists

830
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
or the condition has changed,

831
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
which means that

832
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we should do something different.

833
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
For example,

834
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
in the debate on same-sex marriage,

835
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
it is said that two people

836
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
of the same sex can get married.

837
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If not, why?

838
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If there is, why?

839
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Has it really changed now?

840
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Another common legal history

841
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
is the debate on

842
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the structure of mainstream.

843
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
For example, we used to think

844
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
that Hitler's Nazi was terrible

845
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because he killed Jews.

846
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
He set up a prison court

847
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and let the judge judge

848
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
that homosexuals and Jews

849
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
are inferior species

850
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and are not suitable for having children.

851
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
On the other hand,

852
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
the United States

853
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is a free and democratic defender.

854
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Through World War II,

855
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
the United States

856
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
liberated

857
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
these oppressed people.

858
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
James Whitman,

859
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
a professor at Yale University,

860
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is also a doctor of history.

861
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
He wrote a book

862
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
called Hitler's American Model.

863
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He said that

864
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Hitler's

865
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
racial discrimination law

866
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
was widely referred to

867
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
in the United States

868
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
as the law of racial discrimination

869
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
that oppresses black people.

870
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In fact, Hitler once said

871
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
that Americans were too fierce to black people.

872
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We can't be so fierce.

873
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So, how did Hitler

874
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
know how to use the law

875
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
to oppress minorities?

876
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It came from the United States.

877
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
This is what I am doing now.

878
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I am using the third world approach

879
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
to look at the international law.

880
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
In the past,

881
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
we thought that the international law

882
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
was a principle of equal interaction

883
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
between sovereign states.

884
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But in fact, it was not.

885
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We know that the international law

886
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
was once used to oppress

887
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and to colonize.

888
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The Third World Approach

889
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
to International Law

890
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
has a group of scholars.

891
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Their goal is to tell you

892
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
how the international law

893
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
from the European international law

894
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to the international law of the world

895
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
has contributed a lot to China,

896
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Japan, Latin America, etc.

897
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
They want to tell you

898
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that the international law

899
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is a tool of oppression.

900
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We should not allow the international law

901
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
to become a tool of oppression again.

902
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
We must preserve these historical memories.

903
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This is what I think

904
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
the legal history is doing.

905
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Before I share my research,

906
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I would like to know

907
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
if you have any questions.

908
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I can answer first.

909
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I would like to know

910
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
what is the general history

911
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and what is the legal history.

912
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I think I have learned a lot.

913
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Even if I am a lawyer,

914
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think I have learned a lot.

915
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Should I continue?

916
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It seems that

917
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
everyone is still digesting.

918
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The information is a bit large.

919
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I will try to speak in plain language.

920
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I don't know if

921
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
everyone can understand.

922
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I think I have made it clear.

923
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I have heard a lot of concepts

924
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
for the first time.

925
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I am not sure

926
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
but you have made it clear today.

927
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The language is very good.

928
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I think it has helped me

929
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
to digest so much information.

930
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Can you hear me?

931
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yes.

932
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I have a question.

933
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I am curious

934
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
about the background

935
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you set up

936
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
in the beginning.

937
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What is history?

938
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The front part

939
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and the back part

940
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
are there any differences in views?

941
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
If so,

942
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
what do you think?

943
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Today's speech

944
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
is mainly to

945
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
deconstruct nationalism.

946
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
In the past, foreign law

947
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
was described as

948
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
a symbol of

949
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a third world people,

950
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Chinese, Japanese,

951
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
or non-Western people

952
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
being oppressed.

953
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But I will tell you

954
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that the actual operation

955
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
of this theory

956
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
is based on two things.

957
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The first is that

958
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I want to improve

959
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the meaning of the theory.

960
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
In the future,

961
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I may want to

962
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
use other methods

963
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
of political,

964
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
economic,

965
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and socialization

966
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
to make it more abstract

967
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and more applicable.

968
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I also hope you can

969
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
give me some advice.

970
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Many people

971
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
are not familiar with

972
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
law and history,

973
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
so I hope I can

974
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
give you a brief introduction

975
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
of what I am doing in this field.

976
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I also want to

977
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
take this opportunity

978
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
to let you know

979
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
what is the purpose

980
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
of the American Academy of Law

981
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and what is the purpose

982
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
of the American Academy of Law.

983
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Did I answer your question?

984
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yes, you did.

985
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Thank you.

986
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
If not,

987
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
please continue.

988
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Thank you.

989
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I think the training

990
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
from Northwestern University

991
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
is very interesting.

992
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Foreign students

993
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
have to take a class

994
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
in English.

995
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
The teacher will teach us

996
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
some tips.

997
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
When you don't know what to say,

998
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
just take a sip of water.

999
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
No one will ask you

1000
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
why you are drinking water.

1001
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Sometimes,

1002
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
you can relax

1003
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and think about

1004
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
what you want to say.

1005
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Let's move on

1006
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
to the topic of

1007
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
extracurricular law.

1008
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Extracurricular law,

1009
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
at least for me,

1010
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
is a term

1011
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
but we don't know

1012
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
what actually happens

1013
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
to it.

1014
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
To put it simply,

1015
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
extracurricular law

1016
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
is the privilege that

1017
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
foreigners are not

1018
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
under the jurisdiction

1019
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
of the local courts.

1020
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
In other words,

1021
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
in 1900,

1022
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
if an American

1023
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
stole or committed a crime

1024
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
in China

1025
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
or any other country

1026
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
wanted to sue him,

1027
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
the Chinese government

1028
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and the Chinese courts

1029
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
couldn't do anything

1030
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
because he was under the jurisdiction

1031
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
of the local courts.

1032
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Only the U.S. courts

1033
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
or the U.S. courts

1034
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
can deal with such cases.

1035
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This is extracurricular law.

1036
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Extracurricular law still exists

1037
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
in some countries.

1038
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
For example,

1039
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
if an American

1040
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
raped a woman

1041
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
or a child

1042
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
in a local court,

1043
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the Japanese courts

1044
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
couldn't bring him to trial

1045
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
because he was under the jurisdiction

1046
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
of the U.S. courts.

1047
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's not that the U.S. courts

1048
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
couldn't bring him to trial,

1049
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but the U.S. courts.

1050
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It sounds unreasonable.

1051
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Let's move on.

1052
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The first time that

1053
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the U.S. signed a treaty

1054
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
was in 1842,

1055
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
the Treaty of Nanjing,

1056
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
China signed a treaty

1057
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
after the Opium War.

1058
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
In this treaty,

1059
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
the U.K. required

1060
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
China to provide

1061
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
extracurricular law to the U.K.

1062
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The U.S. signed the treaty

1063
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
in 1844,

1064
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the Treaty of Wangxia,

1065
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
China.

1066
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
In Chinese textbooks,

1067
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
extracurricular law

1068
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
is a symbol of

1069
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
imperialism.

1070
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Today, our country's citizens

1071
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
are being bullied.

1072
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Why doesn't our country

1073
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
promote justice?

1074
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Why does the U.S. court

1075
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
have to bring him to trial?

1076
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
The U.S. court

1077
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
must be very biased.

1078
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
The U.S. court

1079
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
must tolerate

1080
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the U.S. people

1081
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
because the U.S. people

1082
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
betrayed the sovereignty

1083
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
of China.

1084
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The U.S. court must

1085
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
revolutionize the U.S.

1086
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The U.S. court

1087
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
must abolish extracurricular law

1088
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
so that the Chinese people

1089
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
will no longer be bullied.

1090
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Is it really like this?

1091
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Let's move on.

1092
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
For example,

1093
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
when the U.S. came to China

1094
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
to negotiate the Treaty of Wangxia,

1095
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the U.S. diplomat,

1096
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
William Cushing,

1097
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
gave a speech

1098
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
in the U.S. Congress.

1099
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
He said,

1100
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
his proudest moment

1101
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
was when the U.S. wrote

1102
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
the extracurricular law

1103
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
in the Treaty of Wangxia.

1104
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Because China

1105
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
is an uncivilized place.

1106
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The judges in their countries

1107
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
do not have three powers.

1108
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The county magistrates

1109
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
do not have three powers.

1110
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
How can the county magistrates

1111
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
be the judges?

1112
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
In Taiwan,

1113
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
can He Wen-je be a judge?

1114
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No.

1115
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Administrative and judicial

1116
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
should be separated.

1117
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
China is an uncivilized country.

1118
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
If you commit a serious crime,

1119
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
you will be imprisoned,

1120
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
you will be tortured,

1121
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
you will be beaten.

1122
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
If our people

1123
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
are the most advanced species,

1124
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
how can we obey the laws of the barbarians?

1125
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Therefore,

1126
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
obtaining the extracurricular law

1127
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
is a civilized victory.

1128
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It sounds like a good idea.

1129
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
However,

1130
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
historians have found

1131
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
that before 1868,

1132
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
we could not find

1133
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
any Chinese history

1134
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
against the extracurricular law.

1135
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
This is actually

1136
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
a very strange thing.

1137
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
If China is so powerful,

1138
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
why does China never object

1139
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to all the negotiations?

1140
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
China thinks it is good.

1141
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Why?

1142
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
If you want to extracurricular law,

1143
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
we will give it to you.

1144
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This question

1145
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is related to a very popular research topic

1146
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
in recent history,

1147
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
which is the multidimensionalism

1148
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
of the empire and the law.

1149
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
In fact,

1150
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the majority of human history

1151
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
is dominated by the British

1152
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and the Germans.

1153
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
In fact,

1154
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
the majority of human history

1155
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
is dominated by the Empire.

1156
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What is the Empire?

1157
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The simplest definition

1158
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
is that

1159
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
under a regime,

1160
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
there are many different

1161
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
ethnic groups

1162
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and activists.

1163
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
For example,

1164
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
the Qing Dynasty

1165
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
was an empire

1166
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
with Han people,

1167
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Tibetans,

1168
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Mongols,

1169
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
ethnic minorities

1170
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and Xinjiang people.

1171
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The next question is

1172
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
that we all know that

1173
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
there is a law called the Qing Dynasty Law.

1174
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But did the Qing Dynasty Law

1175
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
apply in Tibet?

1176
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Did the Qing Dynasty Law

1177
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
apply in Xinjiang?

1178
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
In fact, it did not.

1179
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Although the Qing Dynasty Law

1180
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
applied to most empires,

1181
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
the Roman Empire

1182
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
also applied the law to the Jews.

1183
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
In the Qing Dynasty,

1184
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the Mongols still applied

1185
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the traditional Mongolian law,

1186
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
while the Tibetans still applied the Tibetan law.

1187
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Only the Han people

1188
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
applied the Qing Dynasty Law.

1189
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This is understandable.

1190
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
When a country is very large

1191
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and is an empire,

1192
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
how could it be possible

1193
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to force a Mongolian

1194
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
to marry in a Confucian way?

1195
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This is also a question of

1196
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
the cost of rule.

1197
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
In order to maintain the operation of an empire

1198
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
and the coordination of the ethnic groups,

1199
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
you must use different laws

1200
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
to treat different people.

1201
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
This is now called

1202
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
the law pluralism.

1203
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Does Taiwan want to do the same thing?

1204
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Should the indigenous people

1205
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
apply the indigenous law

1206
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
or not?

1207
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
From the perspective of China,

1208
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
in 1842,

1209
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
the British said

1210
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that they wanted to

1211
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
apply the British law in China.

1212
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Think about it.

1213
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
What's wrong with

1214
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
the Mongolians

1215
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
applying the Mongolian law

1216
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and the British applying the British law?

1217
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
At that time,

1218
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
foreigners could only

1219
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
move around

1220
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
when they came to China.

1221
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Basically,

1222
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
it did not affect the original life of the Han people.

1223
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Therefore,

1224
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
there is nothing wrong with

1225
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
giving you a piece of land

1226
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and having your own law.

1227
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
In 1842,

1228
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
foreigners were limited to Guangzhou.

1229
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We call it the Guangzhou system.

1230
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Originally in Guangzhou,

1231
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
in 1842,

1232
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
China had already admitted

1233
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
that the Americans could apply the British law

1234
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
in Guangzhou.

1235
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Therefore, in 1842 and 1844,

1236
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
foreigners came to China

1237
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and told the negotiators

1238
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
that they wanted to apply the foreign law.

1239
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The Chinese thought it was good,

1240
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
so they gave it to them.

1241
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
However, in 1868,

1242
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
people found that something was wrong.

1243
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
At first,

1244
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
there were many cases

1245
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
in which

1246
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
foreigners committed crimes

1247
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
in China

1248
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and could not be punished.

1249
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
In these cases,

1250
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
too many countries had foreign law,

1251
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
so the legal vacuum was created.

1252
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Finally,

1253
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
in 1910,

1254
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
there were 23 countries with foreign law in China.

1255
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We often see in the files

1256
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
that an American

1257
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
committed a crime

1258
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and was arrested in the U.S. Court.

1259
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The first defense he made was

1260
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
that he was not an American,

1261
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
but an Englishman.

1262
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Because he had a lot of passports,

1263
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
he kept hiding.

1264
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Later, he made Shanghai the most

1265
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
famous criminal heaven in the world,

1266
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
because everyone would not be arrested.

1267
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
This problem became more and more serious,

1268
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
affecting China's security,

1269
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
China's economic development,

1270
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and so on.

1271
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Later,

1272
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
he began to think that

1273
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
it was a matter of right to enter the country,

1274
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and we had to oppose it.

1275
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
To this day,

1276
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
there is a modern meaning.

1277
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
For example,

1278
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
every year on January 11th,

1279
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
there is a Judiciary Day,

1280
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and the Judiciary Council

1281
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
holds a seminar and a celebration.

1282
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Why is there a Judiciary Day

1283
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
on January 11th?

1284
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Because January 11th, 1943

1285
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
was the day

1286
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
when China and the U.S.

1287
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
signed an equal treaty

1288
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and abolished foreign law.

1289
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
They thought that from that day on,

1290
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the judicial system of the Republic of China

1291
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
would no longer be dominated by the West.

1292
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Since then,

1293
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
the Nationalist government

1294
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
moved to Taiwan in 1949,

1295
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
so the Judiciary Day

1296
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
is still on January 11th.

1297
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Do you still remember

1298
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
the Lincoln case?

1299
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It was about a British man

1300
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
who died in Taiwan.

1301
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Later, he fled the country

1302
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and returned to the U.K.

1303
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
At that time,

1304
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
when the U.K. Supreme Court

1305
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
ruled that Lincoln

1306
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
should be transferred back to Taiwan,

1307
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the representative of the U.K.

1308
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
was Ambassador St. Luke.

1309
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I took his class with Ian.

1310
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Ambassador St. Luke was

1311
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
the Minister of Foreign Affairs

1312
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
at the time,

1313
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
and I took his class with Ian.

1314
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
He wrote in the newspaper

1315
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
that Lincoln should have

1316
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
a symbolic meaning.

1317
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Because the law of the U.K.

1318
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and its citizens

1319
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
cannot be transferred to

1320
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
an uncivilized country.

1321
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
At that time,

1322
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Ambassador St. Luke wrote

1323
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that the Lincoln case

1324
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
proved that the U.K.

1325
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
had already become

1326
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
a legally civilized country,

1327
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
so the U.K. would be willing

1328
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
to transfer people back to Taiwan.

1329
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
However, when the U.K. Supreme Court

1330
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
overturned the ruling,

1331
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
the U.K. was defeated.

1332
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
As a result,

1333
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
the U.K. had to

1334
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
fight against foreign law.

1335
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
My question is very simple.

1336
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Is it really easier to fight against

1337
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
foreign law?

1338
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
We can see that

1339
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the U.S. has to maintain

1340
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
a court in China,

1341
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and it has to invest a lot of money.

1342
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And we can also

1343
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
intuitively find that

1344
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
if a U.S. court

1345
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
in China

1346
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
favors U.S. citizens,

1347
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Chinese people

1348
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
should not do business

1349
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
with U.S. citizens.

1350
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Chinese people do not want to

1351
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
get along with U.S. citizens,

1352
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
which will worsen Sino-U.S. relations

1353
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and damage U.S. business interests in China.

1354
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
My question is

1355
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
if foreign law is really better,

1356
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
how does it actually work?

1357
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Let's look for its file.

1358
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Excuse me, can I ask a question?

1359
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yes, go ahead.

1360
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I want to ask...

1361
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You can go back to the presentation.

1362
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Okay.

1363
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I want to ask...

1364
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I want to ask...

1365
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I want to explain that

1366
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
the person who asked the question

1367
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
can introduce himself.

1368
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Okay.

1369
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm Hong Shaoming.

1370
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm also a post-doc at Caltech.

1371
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I graduated from the Department of Psychology at NTU.

1372
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I want to ask...

1373
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
When you talk about foreign law,

1374
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
you put foreign law

1375
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and multilateralism

1376
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
together.

1377
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But their essence is the same.

1378
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
At least on the surface,

1379
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
when you talk about

1380
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
multilateralism,

1381
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
it feels like you're talking about

1382
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
a country with different laws

1383
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
for different groups.

1384
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But foreign law is about

1385
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
the relationship between

1386
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
countries.

1387
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You mentioned that

1388
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
before 1868,

1389
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
China didn't oppose foreign law.

1390
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Maybe they thought

1391
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
foreign law was one form

1392
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
of multilateralism.

1393
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
After 25 years,

1394
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
they thought it wasn't right.

1395
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It wasn't the same as we imagined.

1396
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's about the relationship

1397
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
between countries.

1398
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Do you have any opinion on this?

1399
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Do you have any opinion on this?

1400
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Thank you.

1401
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I should say that

1402
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
under the pre-modern rule,

1403
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
everyone can accept multilateralism.

1404
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Because it's a low-cost

1405
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
method that can maintain national governance.

1406
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So most of the current research

1407
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
believes that

1408
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
before 1868,

1409
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Chinese central government officials

1410
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
simply believed that

1411
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
it was a matter of multilateralism.

1412
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's not necessarily within a country.

1413
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
For example,

1414
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
when the Pope came to China,

1415
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
China also respected the idea

1416
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
of using its own laws to deal with

1417
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
its own problems.

1418
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
After 1868,

1419
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I think it was because

1420
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
China wanted to modernize.

1421
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So in the process of modernization,

1422
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
it hoped that the whole country

1423
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
would adopt the same laws.

1424
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Because this approach

1425
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
can achieve the central authority

1426
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
and mobilization that modern countries want.

1427
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We can also see that

1428
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
after the founding of the Republic of China,

1429
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
China hoped that

1430
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang

1431
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
would adopt the laws of the Republic of China.

1432
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
China no longer respected its autonomy.

1433
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Its autonomy became very limited.

1434
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
The current People's Republic of China

1435
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
also hopes that

1436
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang

1437
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
will adopt the laws of the People's Republic of China.

1438
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I think the same is true for Hong Kong.

1439
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
At the beginning,

1440
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
China thought that

1441
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
it had adopted multilateralism,

1442
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
and that Hong Kong people could continue

1443
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
to use the law of the Republic of China.

1444
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
However, when China wanted to

1445
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
modernize the country,

1446
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
it wanted to adopt

1447
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
multilateralism.

1448
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
After all, we are one nation,

1449
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
one country.

1450
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Why can't we all

1451
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
use different things?

1452
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I think this idea

1453
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
is related to the nature of a nation.

1454
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
If all people,

1455
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
whether you are Mongolian,

1456
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
or Tibetan,

1457
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
are different,

1458
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
it means that China

1459
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
is not a single nation.

1460
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I think the real difference

1461
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
between multilateralism

1462
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and unilateralism

1463
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
is the effect

1464
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
it brings

1465
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
on the central power

1466
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and sovereignty

1467
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
in the process of

1468
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
transferring from the empire

1469
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
to a democratic country.

1470
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I think multilateralism

1471
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and unilateralism

1472
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
are different things.

1473
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Not necessarily.

1474
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Unilateralism is

1475
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
a legal multilateralism.

1476
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Let me think.

1477
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Yes, they are different things.

1478
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It should be said that

1479
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
under a democratic country,

1480
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
it wants its people

1481
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
to adopt the same set of laws.

1482
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
The reason why foreigners

1483
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
have adopted the same set of laws

1484
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
is because

1485
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
they have the potential

1486
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
to show the spirit

1487
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
of legal multilateralism.

1488
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
In some countries,

1489
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
however,

1490
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
legal multilateralism

1491
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and unilateralism

1492
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
are different things.

1493
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
They think they are different things.

1494
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Legal multilateralism is possible,

1495
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
but unilateralism is not.

1496
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
They can also explain

1497
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
why China did not object

1498
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
to unilateralism.

1499
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
In the beginning,

1500
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
they thought it was the same thing.

1501
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
They found that

1502
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
it was a different thing.

1503
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
When it interfered with

1504
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
the sovereignty of our country,

1505
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
they began to oppose it.

1506
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
If such an attack is established,

1507
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
legal multilateralism

1508
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
does not seem to be able

1509
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
to support whether foreign law

1510
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
is good or bad.

1511
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I think I will go back to

1512
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
what I said at the beginning.

1513
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Historians will ask

1514
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
why they could not find

1515
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
opposition in 1868.

1516
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
We will think that

1517
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
the subjective will of

1518
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
the historical activists

1519
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
mixed them with

1520
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
legal multilateralism.

1521
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That's right.

1522
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
The reason why

1523
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
people did not object

1524
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
is that

1525
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
people at that time

1526
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
did not think

1527
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
it was the same thing.

1528
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
In the beginning,

1529
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
they thought it was the same thing,

1530
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
so they did not object.

1531
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Later, they found that

1532
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
it was not the same thing.

1533
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It seems that

1534
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
the range of influence

1535
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
is not the same.

1536
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Anyway,

1537
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
we have spent too much time

1538
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
on this topic.

1539
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Thank you.

1540
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Oh, is that so?

1541
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Does it prove that Taiwan

1542
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
is a civilized country?

1543
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Well,

1544
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
the main reason why

1545
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Taiwan was invited

1546
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
was to ask

1547
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
whether there was a significant difference

1548
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
between the British and the Taiwanese

1549
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
in terms of mass movement.

1550
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I see.

1551
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Please go on.

1552
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
OK, I will finish it soon.

1553
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I seem to have a little bit of plagiarism.

1554
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I will finish it soon.

1555
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So,

1556
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
my research mainly focuses on

1557
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
the judicial reform of the United States

1558
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
in Shanghai in 1906.

1559
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
From 1844 to 1905,

1560
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
the U.S. did not establish

1561
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
a formal court in China.

1562
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Therefore,

1563
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
we often hear the term

1564
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
consular trial.

1565
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
What is a consular trial?

1566
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It is when a diplomat

1567
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
consulates as a judge.

1568
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
He will be sent to the local consulate

1569
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
to be tried.

1570
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Who is a judge?

1571
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It is a diplomat.

1572
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Sometimes,

1573
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
this diplomat also has some legislative powers.

1574
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
This is a tricky situation.

1575
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
When the U.S. criticized

1576
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
China's law of non-discrimination

1577
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and non-civilization,

1578
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
the U.S. did not discriminate.

1579
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
The diplomat is an executive,

1580
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and he has the right to be tried.

1581
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
At the same time,

1582
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
the diplomat is not civilized at all.

1583
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The diplomat is more like

1584
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
a governor-general,

1585
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
or even more like

1586
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
a magistrate in China,

1587
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
like Bao Qingtian,

1588
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
who is both a mayor and a judge.

1589
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Furthermore,

1590
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
the U.S. was not a rich country

1591
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
at that time.

1592
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
The U.S. did not invest

1593
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
a lot of personnel,

1594
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
finance,

1595
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
and legal professionals in China.

1596
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
For example,

1597
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
the U.S. sentenced a person to prison.

1598
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
At first,

1599
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
the U.S. did not even have a prison.

1600
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
The U.S. even rented a prison

1601
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
to the British and French,

1602
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
because the U.S. built a prison

1603
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
in Shanghai earlier than the French.

1604
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Why did the U.S. have

1605
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
a legislative reform in 1906?

1606
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
For me,

1607
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
this is a modern Chinese country

1608
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
that has encountered

1609
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
the U.S. imperialism.

1610
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
In this video,

1611
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
we can see two figures.

1612
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The first figure is

1613
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the date when the U.S.

1614
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
acquired the colony.

1615
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
We can see Hawaii,

1616
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Wake Island, Samoa,

1617
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
the Philippines,

1618
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
and Panama.

1619
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
They were all acquired

1620
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
at the end of the 19th century

1621
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
or the beginning of the 20th century.

1622
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
In other words,

1623
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
between 1844 and 1900,

1624
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
the average trade volume

1625
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
between China and the U.S.

1626
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
increased significantly

1627
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
and even doubled.

1628
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
This expansion of the U.S. imperialism

1629
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
brought a lot of trade

1630
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
between China and the U.S.

1631
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
At that time,

1632
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
the U.S. business community

1633
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
began to respond

1634
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
to the U.S. federal government

1635
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
that the Supreme Court

1636
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
was not enough

1637
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
to resolve the trade dispute

1638
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
between China and the U.S.

1639
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Because these judges

1640
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
are not legal people.

1641
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
They are just diplomats.

1642
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
As we all know,

1643
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
our diplomats abroad

1644
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
are also responsible

1645
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
for business affairs.

1646
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
They do not have legal expertise

1647
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
and are not able

1648
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
to do a trial.

1649
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So the efficiency of the court

1650
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
is very low

1651
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
and it is very painful

1652
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
for these people

1653
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
including sex workers,

1654
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
gamblers, and vagabonds.

1655
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
At that time,

1656
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
U.S. missionaries in China

1657
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
believed that these illegal immigrants

1658
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
had a serious impact on the image

1659
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
of the U.S. in China.

1660
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
In 1900,

1661
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
there was a protest in Shanghai

1662
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
against the U.S. import movement.

1663
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
The U.S. consulates

1664
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
were highly tolerant of sex workers.

1665
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So in 1900,

1666
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
all the white prostitutes in Shanghai

1667
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
said that they were American.

1668
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
At that time,

1669
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
the word American Girl

1670
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
meant prostitutes.

1671
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
When a prostitute was arrested,

1672
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
she would say,

1673
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I am American.

1674
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
When she was sent to the U.K.

1675
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
court,

1676
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
she would say,

1677
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I am American.

1678
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
When she was sent to the U.S.

1679
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
court,

1680
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
she would say,

1681
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I am American.

1682
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So we can see that

1683
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
the word extraterritoriality

1684
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
and consular jurisdiction

1685
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
were not important

1686
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
concepts to the U.S.

1687
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
until 1900.

1688
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
The frequency of

1689
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
extraterritoriality

1690
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
and consular jurisdiction

1691
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
increased significantly

1692
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
after 1900.

1693
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
On the other hand,

1694
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
we all know that

1695
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
the Eight-Nation Allied Forces

1696
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
were attacked in Beijing.

1697
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
After the attack,

1698
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Beijing signed the Qing Dynasty

1699
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Treaty.

1700
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
After the Treaty,

1701
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
the Qing Dynasty began

1702
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
to reform the modern legal system.

1703
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
At that time,

1704
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
the reform of the modern legal system

1705
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
was to transform Chinese law

1706
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
into Western modern law.

1707
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Basically,

1708
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
we see so-called

1709
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Legislative Codespotism

1710
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
and white light law

1711
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
later.

1712
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
We will see some citations

1713
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
of that book

1714
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
referred to

1715
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
the Great Qing Ming-Liu case.

1716
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
This case was

1717
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
published in 1906.

1718
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
As a result,

1719
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
in 1903,

1720
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
the arms tribunals

1721
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
signed an agreement

1722
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
that China

1723
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
should start

1724
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
legal and judicial reform.

1725
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Western countries should help us.

1726
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
If they help us,

1727
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
we will abolish

1728
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
foreign law.

1729
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
At that time,

1730
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
the U.S. faced two pressures.

1731
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
The first was

1732
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
the expansion of

1733
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
the U.S. Empire

1734
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and the development of

1735
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Sino-US trade relations

1736
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and the reform of

1737
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
the U.S. Constitution.

1738
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
The second was

1739
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
the reform of

1740
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
the U.S. Constitution.

1741
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
If the U.S. becomes

1742
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
a modern,

1743
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
civilized,

1744
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
and three-party

1745
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
court,

1746
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
the U.S.

1747
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
will not have

1748
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
a place to stand.

1749
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
In 1906,

1750
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
the U.S. established

1751
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
the United States Court for China.

1752
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It appointed a judge

1753
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
who had graduated from

1754
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
the University of Yale

1755
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
and was the director of

1756
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
the Philippine Procuratorate

1757
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and established a modern

1758
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
and formal court.

1759
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
After the judge came to power,

1760
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
he did three things.

1761
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
The first thing he did

1762
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
was to declare that

1763
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
he would not have any

1764
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
business dealings with the U.S.

1765
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
because the U.S. business community

1766
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
wanted him to deal with

1767
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
some business cases and disputes.

1768
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Instead, he dealt with

1769
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
brothels and casinos.

1770
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
He felt that there were

1771
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
many U.S. lawyers

1772
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
who had a bad image of the Chinese.

1773
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
So he called all the U.S.

1774
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
lawyers in Shanghai

1775
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
for a lawyer exam.

1776
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
The U.S. lawyer exam

1777
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
made 80% of the people

1778
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
think that U.S. lawyers

1779
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
should not come to the U.S.

1780
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
court.

1781
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
The next thing he did

1782
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
was to sue the boss

1783
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
of eight brothels

1784
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
and four casinos.

1785
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
In the past,

1786
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
the U.S. lawyers used

1787
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
the same trick

1788
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
to say that

1789
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
they were not U.S.

1790
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
lawyers,

1791
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
but the judge

1792
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
who asked them

1793
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
if they used

1794
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
U.S. consulates.

1795
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
He even asked the U.S. consulate

1796
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
to open their diplomatic documents

1797
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
and see if they had

1798
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
a passport in the U.S. consulate.

1799
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Some of the U.S. lawyers

1800
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
did not give a reason

1801
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
and said,

1802
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I do not care,

1803
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
you are an American.

1804
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
He wanted to eliminate

1805
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
the legal vacuum

1806
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
that caused

1807
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
a fierce backlash

1808
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
among the U.S. community

1809
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
in Shanghai.

1810
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
The U.S. judge was

1811
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
impeached and resigned

1812
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
a year later.

1813
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The next U.S. judge

1814
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
did not care.

1815
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
In the future,

1816
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I think there are several

1817
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
theoretical meanings

1818
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
that can be developed.

1819
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
The first is

1820
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
that cross-border trade

1821
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
is very common.

1822
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
For example,

1823
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
if a Japanese

1824
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
signs a trade contract

1825
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
with a Singaporean,

1826
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
he or she can use

1827
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
the New York State Act

1828
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
to settle the dispute

1829
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
in Paris.

1830
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I think

1831
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
the current situation

1832
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
is similar to the past.

1833
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
China in the 19th century

1834
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
pushed the situation

1835
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
to extremes.

1836
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
For example,

1837
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
there are nine countries

1838
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
in Tianjin.

1839
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
In Tianjin,

1840
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
there are ten laws

1841
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
in the same city.

1842
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
There are some

1843
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
theories that can be developed.

1844
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
The next is

1845
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
system competition.

1846
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
We know that

1847
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
in a globalized era,

1848
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
many countries

1849
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
will look for

1850
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
low-cost institutions.

1851
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
For example,

1852
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
labor laws

1853
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
or environmental laws

1854
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
are relatively loose.

1855
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
At that time,

1856
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
there were more than

1857
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
20 countries in China

1858
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
who competed

1859
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
with each other

1860
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
for the greatest interests

1861
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
in China.

1862
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I don't know

1863
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
if there are more theories

1864
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
that can be developed.

1865
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
The next is

1866
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
modern foreign law.

1867
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
For example,

1868
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
the US military

1869
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
has foreign law in Chongqing.

1870
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Is there any way

1871
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
to push back

1872
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
or deny the existence

1873
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
of foreign law

1874
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
from the actual

1875
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
implementation of

1876
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
the United States?

1877
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
At that time,

1878
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
the United States had a very

1879
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
intense backlash in China,

1880
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
which made it believe

1881
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
that the United States

1882
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
should not throw

1883
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
taxpayers' money

1884
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
overseas for foreign law.

1885
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
In fact,

1886
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Americans have been

1887
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
faced with the fact

1888
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
that they cannot

1889
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
manage their citizens

1890
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
without the support

1891
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
of the United States.

1892
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Is it really beneficial?

1893
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
For example,

1894
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
the image of the United States

1895
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
is so bad,

1896
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and if the court is not fair,

1897
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
the Chinese will resist your goods.

1898
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Therefore,

1899
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
foreign law

1900
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
is not something

1901
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
that can be implemented

1902
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
indefinitely.

1903
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
In addition to the law itself,

1904
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
it is also necessary

1905
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
to understand the context

1906
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
of these systems,

1907
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and then think about

1908
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
more theoretical and abstract things

1909
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
according to your research.

1910
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
That's all for today.

1911
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
