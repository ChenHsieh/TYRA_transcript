00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
Welcome everyone to the Taira Talk on April 11th.

00:03.500 --> 00:09.000
We are honored to have Xiao Zhigang to give us a speech.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Today's topic is

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Single Photon Emission from Single Electron Transport

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
in a Soul-Driven Lateral Light Emitting Diode.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
It seems to be related to quantum computation.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Our speaker today studied in Hsinchu.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
He went to a research institute in NTU.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
He said that his research results were mainly in thermonuclear conduction.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
After graduating from the institute, he studied in the UK.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Now he is doing his PhD in QTEC at Daft University in the Netherlands.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Before we start, let's give our speaker a round of applause.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Please remember to turn on your microphones first.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Let's give the floor to Xiao Zhigang.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
No matter where you are, I hope you are all safe.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
What I'm going to talk about today is mainly my work as a PhD in QTEC.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
It was published in Nature Communication in February this year.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
The citation is here.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
If you are interested in more details, you can refer to this paper.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm not sure about the level of the audience today.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Or maybe everyone's field of expertise is different.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
So I'm not going to go very deep today.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
I will use some more straightforward methods to express.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
If you have any questions, you can ask directly.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
If you have questions online, it will be more interactive.

02:22.000 --> 02:37.000
Today's main work is to introduce a new or a new way to produce single-ray.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
We use a surface wave in a structure similar to an LED to produce a single-ray.

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
Today's topic is mainly about quantum communication.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Quantum computing is what I am studying and researching in QTEC in the Netherlands.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
If I have a chance later, I will share it with you.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
Anyway, today is mainly about quantum information technology.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
What kind of applications does quantum information technology have?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
I believe everyone has seen the movie.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
Quantum technology can make people shrink or travel through time and space.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
The Avengers tells you that quantum mechanics can achieve these things.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
But here I can tell you that these are all nonsense.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
These things have nothing to do with quantum mechanics.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
Anyway, now the movie is that no matter what it is, if you can't explain it, just use quantum mechanics.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Okay, let's get serious now.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
So today is mainly about quantum communication.

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
The main thing that quantum communication is doing is basically written very clearly in this review paper.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
Quantum communication is basically the technology of transferring a quantum state from one place to another.

04:18.000 --> 04:30.000
In quantum information, the traditional quantum state is carried by light.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
The so-called light is the basic example of light.

04:37.000 --> 04:45.000
In quantum communication, we use light to carry a quantum state.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
So if you can produce a single light, you can use this single light to carry a quantum state.

04:52.000 --> 05:03.000
One of the applications of quantum information is the so-called quantum key distribution.

05:03.000 --> 05:13.000
Basically, this protocol is a person named Alice.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
She sends a series of light, a series of single light.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.000
She encodes the quantum information into the direction of the light.

05:27.000 --> 05:39.000
The receiver Bob can get the quantum state of this light.

05:39.000 --> 05:49.000
Then she randomly selects and measures the direction of the light.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Of course, I won't talk about the details.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
But through such a protocol, they can establish a quantum key that shares with each other.

06:00.000 --> 06:09.000
After establishing this quantum key, it can be used to encrypt their information.

06:09.000 --> 06:18.000
The advantage of this protocol is that if a third party tries to steal the information in the process of transmitting the quantum key,

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
they will find out that the communication channel is not safe.

06:24.000 --> 06:33.000
We should stop and try different channels to do this communication.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
This is one of the important applications of quantum communication.

06:39.000 --> 06:53.000
More interesting quantum communication often uses a very important feature in quantum mechanics called quantum entanglement.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
What is quantum entanglement?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
For example, there is a quantum state here.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
Its quantum state is a superposition of 0, 0 and 1, 1.

07:08.000 --> 07:17.000
If it is such a superposition, it can send one of the light to Alice.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Then send the other light to Bob.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
When Alice goes to measure the information of this light value, it can be measured to 0 or 1.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
0 and 1 here is the quantum state of the light value.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
For example, we can make it horizontal or vertical.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
For example, you can define that the horizontal deviation is 0 and the vertical deviation is 1.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
When Alice measures the quantum state, it will randomly get 0 or 1.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
When Bob measures the quantum state, it will randomly get 0 or 1.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
But because these two lights are in a quantum entanglement state.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
So when Alice and Bob compare their results,

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
they will find that when Alice measures to 0, Bob will also measure to 0.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
When Alice measures to 1, Bob will also measure to 1.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
The characteristics of such a quantum entanglement are very important in quantum communication.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
Using such an entanglement state can achieve so-called quantum teleportation.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
The main reason is that you produce a quantum state of light here.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Then send one side to Alice and the other side to Bob.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
Alice will do another entanglement at the local stage.

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
In this way, she can teleport the light on her side to Bob.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
In the process, Alice did not directly throw this light to Bob.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
But she can teleport this light to Bob.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
Another application is that one day we can use a light

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
as a bridge between two local quantum computers.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
For example, we can convert the quantum state here into light.

09:32.000 --> 09:43.000
We can transfer this light to another quantum computer through light or air.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
Then convert this light to the quantum state of light on the local quantum computer.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
In this way, we can achieve a far-end connection between two quantum computers.

09:58.000 --> 10:10.000
We can also use light as a quantum component in quantum computing.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
We can use the quantum state of light to do quantum computing.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
This is mainly some of the main applications in quantum communication.

10:23.000 --> 10:31.000
In all these applications, there is a very important...

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Can you see the screen here?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Is it blocking the title?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
No?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
OK, it's fine.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
OK, it's fine.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
In all these applications, there is a very important component, the so-called single light source.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
You must have a light source that can emit a light.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
When you want it to emit a light, it will emit a light.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
You can trigger it to emit a series of light.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
They are separated in space and time.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
What is the difference between a single light source and a general light source?

11:24.000 --> 11:34.000
First of all, we can imagine that a classical light emitter is like a water spray gun.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
When you press it, it will spray out millions of water molecules.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
For example, you can't control that I only spray one water molecule at a time.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
But the single light source is a bit like a pistol.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
When you trigger it, it will shoot a bullet.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
So this is the main difference between classical and quantum light sources.

12:03.000 --> 12:15.000
More specifically, the difference is in their light statistics.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
Suppose we have a coherent light source, for example, a general laser.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Its light distribution is positive Poisson distribution.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
This means that suppose you have a laser.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
Let's say you have a very small hole.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
The light can only pass through that hole very little at a time.

12:45.000 --> 12:52.000
But no matter how you reduce the intensity of the light,

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
you will find that even if your average light number is 1,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
when you measure its light distribution,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
you will find that it is not all the same light.

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
40% is 0 light, 40% is 1 light, 20% is 2 light, and 5% is 3 light.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
For example, it is not an on-demand single photon source.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
The so-called single photon source, a perfect single photon source,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
will meet the sub-Poisson distribution.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
In a perfect situation, you will find that

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
the number distribution of the photon in its light source

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
is 100% when it is under 1.

13:36.000 --> 13:45.000
This is the biggest difference between classical and single light sources.

13:46.000 --> 13:55.000
In general, most of the so-called single light sources

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
are produced in a very simple way.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Hello.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Can I ask a question?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Yes.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Can you go back to the previous slide?

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
In quantum mechanics,

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
we have the uncertainty principle of light.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
For any quantity of uncertainty,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
you have delta P times delta R,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
which is greater than the percentage bar.

14:30.000 --> 14:37.000
I imagine that if you have an uncertainty distribution of light,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
which is the standard deviation of light,

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
what is the corresponding delta something?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Phase.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
The phase is completely uncertain.

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
So if you squeeze the light into a single light source,

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
the phase will have a very large standard deviation.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Yes.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh, okay.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I forgot.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Okay?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Let's continue.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
The way we produce a single light source on the mainstream

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
is actually very simple.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
You prepare a two-level system.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
You have a ground state and an excited state.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
But the important thing is that in your system,

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
you basically can only see at the same time,

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
or only control one,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
you can only have one two-level system.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
If you can isolate a two-level system,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
then you use light or electricity,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
no matter what, to trigger something.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Are you okay?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
You trigger it.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Because in your system,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
there is only one two-level system,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
so you can only produce one exciton.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
This two-level system will decay in its exciton lifetime

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
back to the ground state and produce a single light source.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
After decaying back to the ground state,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
you trigger it again.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
In the exciton lifetime, it will decay again.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Basically, you go through this cycle.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Then you can produce a single light source one by one.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
Basically, the mainstream single light source so far

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
basically uses this method.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Of course, there are some that use nonlinear queries,

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
which are different.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I won't discuss it here.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
A single emitter or two-level system like this

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
can be found in many different systems.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
For example,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
let's use a few examples.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
For example, we have a trapped ion.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Suppose you can trap an atom in your cavity.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Because there is only one atom,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
when you trigger it,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
it will emit light one by one.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Or let's say,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
in a diamond defect,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
a nitrogen vacancy,

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
such a defect can also be used as a single photon source.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
For example,

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
in the recently popular 2D Transition Metal Dichrogeny,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
this 2D semiconductor,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
you can also use some of its structural defects

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
as a single light source.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Another,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
currently

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
the most mainstream method

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
is to use the self-assembled quantum dot.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
The self-assembled quantum dot

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
basically looks a bit like

18:14.000 --> 18:21.000
you sprinkle some water droplets on a table.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Because of the surface tension,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
these water droplets will be connected one by one.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
After the connection,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
you can cover them all

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
to form a single quantum dot.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
For example,

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
I am now pointing at a single quantum dot.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
These quantum dots

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
can also be used as a single light source.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Basically,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
as you can see in this photo,

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
there are more than ten quantum dots.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
So you have to cover all the other quantum dots.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
For example, just look at this one.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
If you only look at this one,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
you will find that

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
when you stimulate it,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
you will get a single photon emission.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
But quantum dots

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
have some shortcomings.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
There are some shortcomings in practical application.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
One of them is

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
because of the way it grows,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
it is difficult to control its size.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
And it is difficult to control

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
where it will grow.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
For example,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
this is an example.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You see that these dots

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
are randomly distributed.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
You can't control

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
that I want a dot

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
to grow in a certain place.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
This kind of randomness

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
will result in

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
a less ideal

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
composition.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Another point is

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
when you use light

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
to stimulate a quantum dot,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
you may get

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
a bi-hexatone emission.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Because of the binding energy of the bi-hexatone,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
you will see that

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
its energy and hexatone energy

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
are a bit different.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
In this case,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
you have to use a spectrum filter

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
to cover the bi-hexatone

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
so that you can get

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
a pure single photon emission.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
OK.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
So this is the mainstream method.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
What I'm going to talk about now is

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
that we want to try

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
a method that has been proposed

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
for 20 years

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
but has not been done

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
before this paper.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Basically,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
what we want to do is

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
to mix two things together.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
OK.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Basically,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
you can think of it as

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
a LED and a wave.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
This is a wave.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm using a wave now,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
but in practice,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
it's a wave.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
We combine a LED

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
and a wave.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
With some special device production,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
we can achieve

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
a single photon emission.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
OK.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
First,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
let's talk about

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
what the LED and the wave are.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I'm sure everyone is familiar with LEDs.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
In Taiwan,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
you can see a lot of advertising boards.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
These things are all made with LEDs.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
It's easy to find LEDs on the platform.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
OK.

22:02.000 --> 22:10.000
The main structure of LEDs

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
is like this.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
It has a P-type semiconductor.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
There are a lot of electrons in it.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Electrons are

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
how to say

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
lack of an electron.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
You can compare it to a hole.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
It's like an electric hole.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Here,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
there is another N-type.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
This section

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
mainly has a lot of electrons.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
If we combine the electron and the electric area,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
we will have a P-N junction.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
The P-N junction

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
looks like this

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
in the conduction band and the valence band.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
OK.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
When you want them to glow,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
what you have to do is

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
apply a forward bias

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
so that the electron and the electric area

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
can overcome

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
the potential barrier.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
When you apply a sufficient forward bias,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
the electron will flow to the electric area

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
and the electric area will flow to the electric area.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Then you can

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
combine them in this place.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
When the electron sees the electric area,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
it will decay

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
and combine with the electric area

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
to produce light.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
This is a very simple

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
LED

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
way to produce light.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
It's very simple.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Why can't we

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
LEDs

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
generate single light?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Because when you

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
add a forward bias,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
you don't let

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
one electron

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
combine with one electric area

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
at a time.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
At the same time,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
you can't control the number.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Suppose

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
we can't

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
make a LED

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
when you

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
trigger it,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
it will only have one electron at a time.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It will only have one electron at a time

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
to combine with the electric area.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
In this case,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
you can imagine

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
that it should

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
produce single light.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
OK

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Then

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
OK

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
So we talked about

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
a way to

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
transmit an electron at a time.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
In this experiment,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
the technique we used

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
is a surface wave.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
A surface wave

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
is basically

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
a wave.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But this wave

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
will produce a dynamic

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
electric potential.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
This potential

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
can carry electrons.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
It's like a wave.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
This wave can carry electrons

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
to overcome a potential barrier.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
After overcoming it,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
you can control

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
the amplitude of the surface wave.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
You can control

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
how many electrons you need to carry at a time.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
So

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
in theory,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
if we can

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
carry one electron at a time,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
we can

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
let only one electron

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
reach the electric area at a time.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Then we can produce a single light.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
OK

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
What about

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
the surface wave?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
In Taiwan,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
we've all experienced it.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
A surface wave

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
is caused by

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
an earthquake.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
A part of the wave

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
is transmitted by a surface wave.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
A surface wave

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
has a low frequency but a high amplitude.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
So it's highly destructive.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
It's like

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
a wave

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
transmitting on the surface.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
OK

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
OK

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
As I said,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
in general,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
we've all experienced an earthquake.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
So how can we

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
produce a surface wave

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
on a small device?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
We need to

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
use the so-called

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
opamp.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
The so-called opamp

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
is

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
when you

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
add an electric field,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
it will cause a change in shape.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
At the same time,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
when it causes a change in shape,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
it will also cause an electric field.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
OK

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
So we

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
use this opamp

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
to produce

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
a surface wave

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
on our chip.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
The method is

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
as shown here.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
We have

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
a cross section

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
of an electric field.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
The cross section

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
of the electric field

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
determines

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
the frequency

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
of the wave

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
when it

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
transmits

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
on the surface.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
OK

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
When you have

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
something like this,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
when you send an AC signal,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
an RF signal,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
and a GHz signal,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
when it meets

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
the resonance frequency

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
of the transducer,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
it will produce a surface wave.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
The so-called resonance frequency

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
means that

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
the change in shape

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
produced by

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
each electrode

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
causes

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
constructive interference.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
This wave will

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
pass through here.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
OK

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
So

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
when we

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
use this

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
surface wave,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
our material is

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
gallium arsenide.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Gallium arsenide

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
has the property of

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
suppressing materials,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
so we can directly

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
produce a surface wave on it.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
We can use this

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
potential wave

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
to move electrodes.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
An experiment I did

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
in my previous group

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
is that we have two conductors,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
one on the left, one on the right,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
and one on the left.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
At the same time,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
there is only one electrode inside.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
The experiment I did

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
is very interesting.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I can send a surface wave

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
in this direction,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and push this electrode

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
to the left.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I can also send a wave

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
from left to right,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and push this electrode to the right.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
It can move like a table tennis ball.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
They demonstrated

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
that they can

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
move 60 times.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
This kind of technology

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
is actually

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Sorry

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Can you hear me?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Yes, I can.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I have a question.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I'm a high-performance engineer,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
so I have a question.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
How large is the potential

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
of the electrode

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
you draw below

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
the surface wave?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It's basically

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
gigahertz.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Gigahertz.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Yes, it's gigahertz.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The electrode you carried

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
is said to be

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
as close as possible to

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
the gap between

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
the surface wave and the electrode.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Is it better

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
or worse?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
You don't want it to be bigger.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
You want it to be

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
just the right size.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Basically, you want it to pass

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
the steepest

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
potential barrier.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
At the steepest point,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
it will only leave one electrode.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
It's just right.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
It depends on

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
the size of the surface wave.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Okay.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
How large is the scale?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I don't know much about semiconductor.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
It's probably

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
a few

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
MeV.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
It's m, right?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Yes.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Okay.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Okay.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Okay.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Thank you.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
You're welcome.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I have a question.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Okay.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Here,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
in the transport

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
experiment,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
from left to right,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
what is the

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
distance

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
transmitted?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
length scale here

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
is one UAM.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
So, have they

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
tried...

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
5 to 6 microns.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
5 to 6 microns.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
So,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
this experiment was done

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
at low temperature.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Yes.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
You have to be able to

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
define a quantum dot with an electrode.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
So, you have to

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
do it at low temperature

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
to see the discrete state.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
It's probably

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I forgot.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
It's probably 1K or 200

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
microns.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Okay, got it.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I also have a

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
question.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
That is,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
does this wave

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
need to be horizontal or vertical?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
The second question is

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
that

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
the electrode is very small.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
So, the electrical field

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
it feels locally should be...

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
If your wave is

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
symmetric,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
the electrical field it feels should be

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
oscillating back and forth.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
So, do you need to

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
make the surface acoustic wave

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
as asymmetric

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
so that it has a

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
directional run?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
No.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
No.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
So, it just followed the first wave?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Yes.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Okay.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Does this

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
surface acoustic wave

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
need to be horizontal or vertical?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It produces...

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Let me think about it.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
It produces...

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
It should be

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
horizontal.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Acoustic should be horizontal.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Acoustic can be horizontal

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
or vertical.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
But it produces...

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I don't know.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I don't know.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I don't know

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
if the transducer

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
produces a horizontal or vertical wave.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Okay.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I think...

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I don't know if I have it here.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
So, we can

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
see it like this.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Actually,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
the direction

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
is like this.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Circular.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Okay.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
So, it's mixed together.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Yes, it's mixed together.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It's really like water.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Yes, it's mixed together.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So, it's not just a wave.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Yes.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Okay.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
So, I hope

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I answered your question.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Yes.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Okay.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Last question.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Can this

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
produce a standing wave?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Yes, it can.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Yes.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
So, if I produce a standing wave

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
and there is a transducer

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
on both sides

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
and produce a standing wave,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
is it possible...

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Because now

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
the speed of the wave

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
should be

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
similar to

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
the speed of

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
the semiconductor.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Yes, but if there is

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
a transducer on both sides,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
if you change the relative phase

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
on one side,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
you can basically move

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
the wave slowly.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Yes.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Can you do it?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I think I can do it.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Yes.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
It won't be limited to this.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Okay.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Yes, I think I can do it.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Yes, I think I can do it.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
But...

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I think I forgot who said that.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
But I don't think I have

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
done this before.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Yes.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Okay.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I have a question.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Yes.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
How do you make sure

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
that is a single electron?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
How do you measure it?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
So,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
a structure like this

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
has two quantum dots.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
One on the left, one on the right.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
But there is

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
a channel like this.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
There is a channel like this.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
This channel

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
has a very sensitive

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
conductance.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Basically,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
if there are 0, 1, or 2 electrons,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
it will affect

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
the channel conductance.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
So the way to measure

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
the number of electrons

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
is to measure

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
the channel conductance.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It can

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
tell if there are

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
0, 1, or 2 electrons.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Yes.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
This is a very

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
common technology

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
in gate-defined quantum dots.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
It's called charge detector or charge sensor.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Okay, thank you.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Okay.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Is this QPC?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
This is QPC.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Okay.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
This is QPC.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
If you want to have another quantum dot,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
you can use charge sensor.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
But it's easier to do it in this experiment.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Okay.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
It's okay.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I just want to make sure.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Okay.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Okay.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
So, I mentioned

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
that I combined two things.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
LED and surface wave.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Let's combine these two things.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
We want to

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
combine these two things

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
to produce a surface wave.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
This is how we do it.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I'll show you an animation later.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But I'll use my mouth to explain.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I'll

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
make a LED first.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
I have electrons here.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I have electrons here.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
I have electrons here.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I'll make a surface wave.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
This surface wave

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
will modulate

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
the potential of conduction band

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
and valence band.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
What's more,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
an important component

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
is that

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I want to create

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
a 1D channel

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
in the middle of

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
the electromagnetic field.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
This 1D channel

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
can control

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
the width.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Basically,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
you can add two side gates

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
to control the height of the potential.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
You can control

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
the width of the channel.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You can control

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
the width of the channel

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
so that only one electron

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
can pass through.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
If only one electron can pass through

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
and produce a surface wave,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
let's assume

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
that the potential

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
between the electromagnetic field

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
and the wavelength

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
allows the surface wave

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
to produce a single light

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
when only one electron

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
can pass through.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Now I have an animation.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I hope you can

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
watch it smoothly.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
This is my device.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
This is my device.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
This is the

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
energy diagram.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
This is the

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
electromagnetic field.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
This is the 1D channel.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
The potential of this 1D channel

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
is controlled by the side gate.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
When I hit the surface wave,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
it will start to push the electrons.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
The electrons will push

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
forward.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Because of the channel,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
only one electron can pass through.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
When this electron is combined

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
with an electron,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
it produces a single light.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
The potential will carry

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
the next electron.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
So it will produce a single light

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
one by one.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
This is

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
how I

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
produce a single light.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Any questions?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I think you will

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
talk about it later.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
So,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
the gate on both sides

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
control the Fermi level

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
so that

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
both sides

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
are electric.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Yes, I will talk about it later.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I guess you will talk about it later.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Sorry to interrupt you.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
So next I will talk about

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
how to make this device.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Basically,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
what's interesting about this project

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
is that I don't need

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
a random quantum dot

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
or a defect.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
This device

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
can be

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
fabricated

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
deterministically

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
in any

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
place I want.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
What it needs

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
is

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
very conventional

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
photolithography and

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
electromagnetic electron.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
You don't need

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
any random

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
thing.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
This kind of

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
device is

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
good for

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
software integration.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
So,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
the starting point is

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
GaN and

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
AuGaS's quantum web.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I didn't show

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
the diagram here.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
It is

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
a plane

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
that allows

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
electrons and electrons

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
to exist.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
First of all,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
the next step is

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
to pattern

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
two surface gates.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Here is a surface gate

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
and here is another surface gate.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
These two surface gates

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
are used

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
to accumulate

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
electrons and holes.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
For example,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
if I want to

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
generate electrons here,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I just add a positive

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
voltage to this gate

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
to accumulate electrons.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Here,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I just add a negative voltage

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
to accumulate electrons.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
When I add the voltage,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I can control

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
electrons and holes.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
What's more convenient is that

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
electrons and holes

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
are controlled by voltage.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I can even

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
swap them.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I can have electrons

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
and holes on both sides.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
This is

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
a flexible

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
device.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Next,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I just mentioned

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
that I need a 1D channel

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
so that

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
each time

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
only one electron

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
can pass through.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I will make an etch.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Basically, I will use

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
the method of 10 electrons

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
to eat up

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
the electrons and holes

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
where electrons and holes

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
can exist.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
The dark part

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
of electrons and holes

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
can't exist.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Therefore,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
they can only pass through

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
the middle path.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Maybe

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
the etched channel

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
is still too wide.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I may need to add

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
two side gates

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
to control

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
the size of

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
the channel.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
OK.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Next,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
let's search.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Excuse me.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Hello.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I have a question.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
You showed the picture.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
How wide is the channel?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Is it sub-micron?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
It's about a micron.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I will show the device later.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Thank you.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I will show the actual device.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I want to ask

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
a stupid question.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
The etched channel

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
has

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
gallium arsenide and

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
aluminum gallium arsenide.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
It's

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
aluminum gallium arsenide

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
and gallium arsenide.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
It's a quantum well.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Does the etched channel

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
exceed

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
the two-deck?

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Yes, it exceeds

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
the two-deck.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
It exceeds the two-deck.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Yes, it exceeds the two-deck.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
If you

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
control

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
the voltage

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
below the two-deck,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
does it affect

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
the width

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
and narrowness

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
of the two-deck?

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I think so.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
It's right next to the two-deck.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Yes.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
OK.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I just thought of it.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Sorry.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
The etched channel

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
affects the two-deck.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
It doesn't affect

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
the two-deck.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It affects the two-deck.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
The two-deck is close to the two-deck.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
It affects the two-deck.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Yes.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I will continue.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Next,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
I want to generate

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
a surface wave.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I will make a transducer.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
It's the one I just mentioned.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
It's a transverse

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
electrode.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
After I add

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
a transducer,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I can

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
use

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
the RF frequency

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
to

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
generate a

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
surface wave.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
It will push

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
the electrode

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
to the

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
electric area.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
When the electrode

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
is pushed to the electric area,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
it will

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
combine

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
with

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
one of the electrodes.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
The two electrodes will

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
form an exon.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
After the two electrons form an exon,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
the two electrodes will decay

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
to form a photon.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Basically,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
this is how we

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
generate a single-beam.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I just showed you the animation,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
but now I will show you

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
step by step.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
This is

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
my actual device.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
This is my

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
sole transducer.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I use it to generate the sole finger.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
This electrode

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
is too small, so you can't see it.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
But it's basically

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
a transverse electrode.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
The gate

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
to accumulate

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
the electron hole is here.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
You can't see it now, but you will

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
see it in the next image.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
It looks like this.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
This side is for

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
accumulating the electron, and this side

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
is for accumulating the hole.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
For example,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
these black spots

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
are where I use

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
VH to remove them.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
These

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
dark spots

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
are where electrons and electrons can't exist.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
The surface wave

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
will come from this direction.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
It will

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
pass the electrons

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
to the electron area.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Next,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I will talk about

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
the results of the experiment.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
First, I mentioned

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
that this is basically

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
an LED plus a

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
surface wave.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I need to make sure

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
that my device

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
works like an LED.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
So,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
what I am doing is

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I am accumulating the electron

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
on one side, and then

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
accumulating the hole on the other side.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Then, I can apply

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
a source-engineering bias.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
A bias.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Theoretically,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
you would expect that

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
when the bias

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
is greater than

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
the Gaussian bandgap,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
it will

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
allow the electron

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
to overcome

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
the potential barrier.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
The same goes for the electron.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
The electron can run to the other side.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
In this case, you will see the current.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Basically,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
the Gaussian bandgap

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
is about

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
1.55EV.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
So,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
you will see

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
when I apply a bias,

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
when the bias is greater than

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
1.54EV,

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
the current will start to occur.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Basically,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
this graph

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
shows that

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
my lateral

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
p-n junction

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
really works.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
OK.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
OK.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Next,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
when we want to create a source-driven

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
single-photon source,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
what we need to do is

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
make it unable to shine

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
normally.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
So, what we need to do is

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
reduce the bias

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
to 1.45EV.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Basically,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
if I extend it,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
it's about here.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
So, basically,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
if you don't do anything,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
when the bias

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
is kept at 1.45EV,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
nothing will happen.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
There will be no current flowing,

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
and there will be no light.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
OK.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
When I

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
add an

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
RF signal,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
an AC signal on the

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
soul transducer,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
at its resonant frequency,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
it will produce a surface wave.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Then you will expect that

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
at the frequency

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
of the surface wave,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
if it can carry

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
electrons

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
to the electric field,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
you will see the current.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
OK.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Basically, it's like

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
an elevator.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
When you draw the potential,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
it will look like this.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
The blue part is

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
when you don't add

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
the soul,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the potential will look like this.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
When you add a soul,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
it will start to look like this.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
The soul will move forward,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
and the electrons will move up,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
and bring it to the electric field.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
It's like an elevator.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
It's like an elevator.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
OK.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Here,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I'm showing that

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
when I

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
add RF signal,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
when I

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
satisfy the soul transducer

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
resonant frequency,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I will see

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
something happen.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
At this X axis,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I'm measuring the

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
AC signal frequency.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Then,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
at the Y axis,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I'm measuring the current

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
size.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Basically, you can see

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
that at about

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
1.16 GHz,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
around 1.16 GHz,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
you will see a current

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
suddenly generate.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Other than that,

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
there is no signal.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
At this frequency,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
we designed

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
the soul transducer's resonant frequency.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
So you can see

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
that at this

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
resonant frequency,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
it seems

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
that the surface sound is generated,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
and the electrons

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
are brought from the electron field to the electric field.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
So we see a current generate.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
At the same time,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
we can also measure

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
the light signal.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Now,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
the blue part

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
is the current,

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
and the red part

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
is the light signal.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
You can see that the light signal

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
and the current signal

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
are basically matched.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
At the same frequency,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I see the current.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
This current

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
represents the electrons

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
being brought to the electric field.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Electrons and electrons are combined,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
so the light is generated.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
You can see that the light signal

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
and the current signal

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
are basically matched.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Because the area of light

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
is only

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
about a microsquare.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
So this is

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
basically

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
to scan the light signal.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Then I found that

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I saw light in a very small area.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Light is generated in this area.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
This area

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
basically corresponds to

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
the location of the electric field

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
we designed.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Okay.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I just

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
described

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
that

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
at this resonant frequency,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
there seems to be a wave on the surface

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
that causes

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
electrons to be brought to the electric field

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
to emit light.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
But we want to further prove that this is true.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
So what we do

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
is that we have a

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
time-resolved optical setup.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Basically,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I want to measure

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
how the light

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
emits

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
over time.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
How do we

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
do this?

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
We have a pulse generator

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
and an RF source

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
to drive

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
the wave on the surface.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
First, we synchronize it.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Then,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I synchronize the pulse

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
with the RF signal.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Then,

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I send the pulse

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
to a

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Time-to-Digital Converter.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
When the

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
converter receives

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
the pulse signal,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
it is a stopped pulse.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Then it starts to count.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
After it receives the signal,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
how long

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
will my

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
light detector receive

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
one light?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Or multiple lights,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
as long as there is a light signal.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Once it receives the light signal,

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
it will send a stopped pulse.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Then the Time-to-Digital Converter

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
will give

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
the time delay

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
between light and pulse.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
If my RF source

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
looks like this,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
and if my soul

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
is the same phase,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
then my

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
photon

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
will be carried

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
by the soul's

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
minimum.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
So the moment it is generated

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
is basically the same as the

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
minimum time.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
If my RF signal looks like this,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
then my Time-to-Digital

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Converter's

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
histogram will look like this.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
It will be a signal

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
with a time interval.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
For example,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
at 0.5 ns,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I will have a very strong signal.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
At 1.5 ns,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I will have a very strong signal.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
At 2.5 ns,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I will have another signal.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Basically, it will be the same

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
as the RF source's

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
cycle,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
as well as the soul's cycle.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Next,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I want to prove that

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
this signal really comes from

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
the surface wave.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I believe everyone in Taiwan,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
because I just mentioned an earthquake.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
As we all know,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
an earthquake occurs in Hualien.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
When you are in Hsinchu,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
when you feel it,

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
there will be a time interval in the middle.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
We can use

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
such a time interval

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
to prove that

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
this signal really comes from

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
the surface wave.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
First of all, my device,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
its soul transducer

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
and my p-n junction,

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
its interval is about

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
1 m.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I also know that

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
the surface wave's speed

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
on gallium arsenide is

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
about 3000 ms.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
You can calculate

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
its propagation time

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
is about 400 ns.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
So when you

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
hit a pole...

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Sorry.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
We are running out of time.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I don't know how much time you have left.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Maybe you should speed up.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
OK. Thank you.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
OK.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
So we know that

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
there will be a time delay of 400 ns.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
What I do here is

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I have a time delay.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I have a pole.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I hit the pole's RF signal.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
When the pole's RF signal

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
is applied to the soul transducer,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I see that

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
there is no signal.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
But interestingly,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
after 400 ns,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I can see a lot of RF signals.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
This delay

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
proves that

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
this signal is really

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
caused by the soul's

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
propagation

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
and the electron's

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
interaction with the electron.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
What's more interesting is

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
when I zoom in

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
to these RF signals,

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I can see that

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
they are a series of peaks.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
A pile of peaks.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
The cycle of these peaks

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
is exactly the same as the period of the soul.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
This means that

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
we are really using the soul

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
to inject

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
each electron

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
into the electric field.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
This proves that this is really

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
the light signal produced by the soul.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
OK.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I'm almost at the end.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
In the end,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
how do we really prove

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
that we produce a single ray?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
One thing is that

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
when a single ray

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
has two cameras,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
this single ray

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
can only be seen

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
by one of the cameras.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
It can't be received

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
by two cameras at the same time.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
So it's not received by camera 1,

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
but by camera 2.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
OK.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Suppose I have

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
a

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
time series digital converter.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I go to see its start

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
and stop.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Because it

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
can only be received

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
by one detector

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
at the same time.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
You will find that

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
when a single ray

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
is really produced,

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
there will be no time delay

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
equal to 0.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Because time delay equal to 0

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
means that two detectors receive the light signal at the same time.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
OK.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So there will be no time delay equal to 0.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
OK.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Here is an example.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
This is a very good single ray on the file.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
You will see a signal like this.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
When time delay equal to 0,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
there is no peak.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
There are peaks in other places,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
but there is no peak at 0.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
OK. Now back to my experiment.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
First of all,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
when I send

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
more than one light,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
one electron,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
through an autocorrelation histogram like this,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I will see that

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
when time delay equal to 0,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
there is still a very obvious peak.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And it's about the same height as everyone else.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
However,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
when I control the strength of my source

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and the height of my

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
potential barrier,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I can control

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
only one electron

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
through each time.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
On average, there is only one electron

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
combined with the electric current.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Then it becomes like this.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
You can see that

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
the peak of time delay equal to 0

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
is obviously suppressed.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
It's not 0.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's different from the

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
very good single photon source I showed earlier.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It's not perfect.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I can only say

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
there is still a certain chance

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
that two light will be generated at the same time.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
But the chance of

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
one light is

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
increased.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Basically, the signal of time delay equal to 0

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
is suppressed.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Then I can

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
do a probability estimate.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I can compare

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
in the same situation.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Suppose it's a Poisson distribution.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's a black

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
rectangle like this.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Suppose

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
it's my source.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I can see that the probability of a single photon

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
is increased.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Then the other

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
states of 0 light and multiple photons

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
are suppressed.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
My experiment

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
shows that

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
because of this design,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
the probability of

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
increasing single photon emission

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
is increased.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
OK.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
These are the results of my experiment.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Thank you.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
OK.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Does anyone

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
have any questions?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Can I ask a question?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Sorry.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
You go first.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I want to ask

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
how do you think

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
to correct the imperfect part

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
you just said?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
How do you correct

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
the imperfect part?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
OK.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
For example,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I think there is a problem.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
The confinement

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
caused by SOHL

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
is not strong enough.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
So

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
this

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
this

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
in this

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
during the transmission of SOHL,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
the number of electrons

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
is not

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
completely

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
one by one.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Sometimes it's two or sometimes it's zero.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I should

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
improve my confinement

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
so that

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
the probability of

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
single electron emission is higher.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
That's basically it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Thank you.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
OK. Thank you.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Can I change my turn?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
OK.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
My question is

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I want to

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
use the

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Garmin Ascend to make a

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
dark matter detector.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Can we contact you later?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I think there are some bad details

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
and some noise.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
OK.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
OK.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Anyway, my question is

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
if you don't use

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
your SOHL to drive

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
the channel,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
it's like

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
a calibration run.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Will it leak?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Will it leak to the other side?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Will it leak to the other side?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
You can still see it.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I'm not sure what you mean.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
You said don't use SOHL.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
You said don't use SOHL.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Yes. Don't use it.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And you keep measuring.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Can you measure anything?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
There should be only background.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
There should be only background.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
First of all, there is no light.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Electronics can't

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
combine with electronics.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
There will be no light signal.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So you can see the background

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
on both sides.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
But you can't see

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
the random event

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
of your single photon.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
The light signal on the other side

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
may not come from the device,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
but from the environment.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Yes. But in my scenario,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I don't know when it will appear.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
If I want to use it as a detector,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I need to know

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
the random event rate.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
What do you mean?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
If I don't trigger it,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
will there be a fake event?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
What will the fake event look like?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
What is its source?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
First of all,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
the source of the noise

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
may be the detector itself.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It depends on what kind of detector you use.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
For example,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
we use the Avalanche

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
single photon dive.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Even if you

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
cover all the light,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
there may still be

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
10 coms

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
every second.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
These 10 coms are all fake.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
This has nothing to do with the real signal.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Of course, there are some

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
fake events.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So you mean

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
the background counting

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
comes from your

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
APD, right?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yes.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Or if you have a

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
more powerful device,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
it may also come.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I imagine

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
there must be a pulse tube

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
in your refrigerator.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
If the pulse tube keeps shaking,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
it means

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
you didn't pulse your source,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and there will still be an event.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
The frequency

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
should match the resonance frequency.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Oh, I see.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I understand.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
We will keep in touch.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
This is very important to me.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Thank you.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I have a question.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Oh my god.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
The light coming out now

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
has no bias.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
The bias and phase

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
are all random.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Is it possible

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
to hold the gate

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
and make some micro-structures

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
to further control

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
the light's bias

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
or phase?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Phase may be more difficult,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
but if it's bias, it's possible.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
There are some ways.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
For example, you can do spin injection.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
For example, the electrons

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
you inject

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
are more of a spin.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
For example, a large spin out.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
If you use

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
this method,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
if the electrons you inject are all spin out,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
it will produce a corresponding polarization.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
It will produce a corresponding original bias.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Someone has also

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
done this.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Maybe you can add

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
a non-parallel

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
electrode.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Using its spin-orbital interaction,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
you can also use it to

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
rotate the electron's

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
spin direction.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
You can also use this

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
to control its spin direction.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
At the same time, you can also change

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
the light's polarization.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Okay.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
What about phase?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I think it's

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
more difficult.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Okay.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Got it.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Cool.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Thank you.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Hello, I have another question.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Okay, thank you.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I'm sorry.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
It's a bit like the RLFrequency.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
There are two pictures.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
One is

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
the picture with less frequency.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
The other is

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
the light.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Right.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
There are

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
four peaks

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
in the middle.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
What is the corresponding

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
polarity of these peaks?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
This is

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
because

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
when you

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
play RF signal,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Is it the polarity of your pulse?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Let me explain why.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
The reason is

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
when you play the pulse,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
you also produce

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
EM wave.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
It's like an antenna.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
It also acts as a radio.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
These peaks

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
are caused by the interference

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
between the radio and the pulse.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I see.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Okay.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I see.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I see.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I see.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I see.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I see.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I see.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I want to follow up

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
the question of the tab.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
You said EM wave is produced

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
in this.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
My question is

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
what is the impact of EM wave in this area?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Basically,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
this is related to

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
the time result measurement I just showed.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
You can see

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
if EM wave itself can drive

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
this signal,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
you will see that the signal

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
will produce at the same time

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
because the speed of light

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
is much faster than the speed of the soul.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So if there is a signal,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
you will see that there is a signal

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
in this place.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Okay.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Basically,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
this tells you that

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
EM wave itself can't drive

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
this charge transport.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
It can't drive,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
so it can't produce light.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Only the soul itself

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and its strength

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
are enough.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
This is a very good question.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
So

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
in this experiment,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
how much control do you have

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
on the resonance frequency

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
of the soul

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
or the amplitude?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Does it depend on the material

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
or does it depend on

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
the transducer you designed?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Frequency

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
depends on the transducer.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Basically, it depends on

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
the quality of the transducer.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
You can control

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
how narrow the resonance frequency

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
of the soul is.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
As for the amplitude,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
it depends on

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
how much power

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
you add to the RF signal.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
The more power you add,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
the greater the amplitude.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
But at the same time,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
when you add

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
too much power,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
your sample will heat up.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
When it heats up,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
the high temperature

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
for the

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
transport quantized

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
charge state is not a good thing.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
So

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
you can't really add

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
too much power.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
At the same time,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
we don't want it to be too large

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
that it can carry more than

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
one electron.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Then it won't produce light.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I have another question.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
It's about the production of components.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Yeah.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
When you're using 10 quantum wells,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
did you say you're using 10?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Yes.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Why did you choose

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
10? Because it's not

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
directional, right?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Yes, that's right.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You mean

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
if it's dry edge,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
the well

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
will be more...

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And like it...

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I didn't try.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Theoretically, it should be possible.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
But I didn't do that.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Because I just saw

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
that SM has a lot of residue.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Will it cause some

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
gradient decrease or even

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
cause some feedback problems?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It's also possible.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
It just so happens that

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I didn't do my edge well on this device.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So it's a little ugly.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I see.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Thank you.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I have a question.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I have a few questions.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The first one is,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
as far as I know,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
there's a very important thing

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
about producing single photon source.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It's the source's dead time.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
How long can it produce

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
a single photon source?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Because this is very related to

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
quantum communication.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Even if

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
you do it very well,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
every time there's a pulse,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
every time there's a cycle,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
there's an electron passing through.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Then the dead time

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
is about 1 nanosecond.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Because your frequency is 1 GHz.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
My frequency is 1 GHz.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Yes.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
So its dead time is

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
about 1 nanosecond.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Is this better than

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
the general single photon source?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Or is it worse?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Basically,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
it's about the same as

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
the best single photon source's

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
repetition rate.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
The best single photon source

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
can produce 1 GHz to 3 GHz.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Okay.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So this has potential.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Yes.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
The second question is,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I want to know how to

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
control the

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
one-time-only electron.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
So you have to adjust

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
the gate voltage.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Is it better to adjust it smaller?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Or is it better to reduce

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
the number of electrons?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Basically, the less, the better.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
In a better situation,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
you want to see quantized current.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
You want to see

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
when you change

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
the gate voltage,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
you'll see a quantized

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
quantum.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Yes.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
You'll see a quantum.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
That corresponds to

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
the one-time-only electron.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Okay.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
If you can see that, it's better.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
My device is not perfect.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I can't see the quantized

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
current quantum.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I think that's why

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
my single photon emission

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
has a peak

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
that's not really low.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
The question is,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
why can't you add

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
a smaller voltage?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Why can't your device

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
lower the voltage?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
If you lower

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
the electron density,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
what happens?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Can't you see the light?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
First of all, your signal will be weaker.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Yes.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So you'll need

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
a longer time

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
to accumulate these signals.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I think it's okay.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I think it needs to be less.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Yes.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Theoretically, it's okay.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
But that means

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
on average,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
on average,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
the electron density

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
in the cycle

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
is 1.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
In that case,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
first of all,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
even if

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
your source

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
is a gigahertz frequency,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
the light you emit

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
won't have

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
light in every cycle.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Okay.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Yes.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
That's not

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
the case.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And then

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
the brightness will be lower.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Yes.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I think it's okay.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
You can still

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
bring less

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
electrons

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
in every cycle.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Of course, it will still emit

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
light.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
So you mean

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
your experiment

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
is basically

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
a one-year experiment.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
So if you spend

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
a year to do this experiment,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
the G2 value will be lower.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Yes.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Theoretically, yes.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
But...

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I think

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
theoretically, yes.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Okay.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
But in practice,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
you won't want to do this.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Yes, I understand.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
The third question is

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
the reason why

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
a single photon source

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
can become a single photon source

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
is because...

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
For example,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
when an acetone is triggered,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
it can't trigger the second one

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
because the second one

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
will have a photon blockade problem.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
The acetone binding energy

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
will be different.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
What is the mechanism

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
of this device?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Your channel is narrow enough

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
to allow

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
only one electron

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
to pass through

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
at a time.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
This is the basic mechanism.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
This is very different

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
from the single photon source

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
of a single emitter.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Why don't you

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
use a quantum wire

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
to do this experiment?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
For example, if you use a quantum wire,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
it will pass through twice.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Yes.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Do you want to

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
collaborate with a German team?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
This is a good question.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But we...

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
We want to try it

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
in the future.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Okay.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
That's about it. Thank you.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Thank you.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Do you have any questions?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
If not,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I will turn off

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
the recording.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Thank you.
