00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Yes, okay.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome to the first lecture after the New Year.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm glad to have Sui-An here today

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
to share with us about psychology and law.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Law? I don't think so.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
The application of psychology in law

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
and the development of it.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Before we talk about the topic,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
let's introduce our speaker today.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Sui-An is a law major in NTU.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
She studied law in NTU.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Then she became a lawyer.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
She did well in the exam.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
In the process,

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
she participated in many research and activities in psychology.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
After graduating from law school,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
she interned in a law firm

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
and later became a professional lawyer.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
She also studied psychology in NTU.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
In the field of law,

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
she majored in the case of death

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
and the defense lawyer.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
That's her major.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
In the field of psychology,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
she did a combination of law and psychology.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
She studied the testimony of children

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
in the court.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
How to do it accurately and accurately.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
After graduating from law school,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
she went to Cornell

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
to continue her research.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Her research is about

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
cognitive psychology,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
psychological development,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
and the combination of law.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
We can hear more details today.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Sui-An will share the details with you.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Finally, I will share a fun fact with you.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Sui-An,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
besides...

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Did I tell you I wanted to say this?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I don't think I did.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Sui-An,

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
besides her extensive academic background,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
she is interested in drama performance.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
She is also passionate about it.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
In my previous research,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I majored in social psychology.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
In my previous research,

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
I needed an actor to play the victim.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I asked Sui-An to help me.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
She is a professional actor.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Without further ado,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
let's give the stage to Sui-An.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Let me give her a round of applause.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Thank you, Yen-Ping.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I feel a little shy.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Before we start,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
let me give you a warning.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
This is my first time

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
giving a live talk on the internet.

03:10.000 --> 03:10.000


03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
This is my first time

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
giving a live talk on the internet.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I'm a little nervous.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Please bear with me if I make any mistakes.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Please bear with me if I make any mistakes.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I want to say that

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
the audience today

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
may be from different fields.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I want to say that

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
after the talk,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
if you are interested in this field,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
you can read a book

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
or watch a TED talk on the internet.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
This talk will be divided into four parts.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
This talk will be divided into four parts.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
In the first part,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I will briefly introduce my background

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
and what is my relationship with this field.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I will also mention my relationship with Yen-Ping.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
She is a great benefactor in my life.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
She is a great benefactor in my life.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
In the second part,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I will talk about the research topics

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
in the field of law and psychology.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
In the second part,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I will talk about the research topics

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
in the field of law and psychology.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
The last part is about my own research.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
The last part is about my own research.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
The last part is about my own research.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Sorry, I made a mistake.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I forgot to mention some housekeeping.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I forgot to mention some housekeeping.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Yen-Ping will talk to her PowerPoint.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Yen-Ping will talk to her PowerPoint.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
She may not see

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
what you are talking about in the chat window.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
If you have any questions,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
you can leave a comment in the chat window.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I will read it for Yen-Ping.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Yen-Ping will find time

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
to answer the questions in the chat window.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
to answer the questions in the chat window.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
to answer the questions in the chat window.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Thank you.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Thank you.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Thank you.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Today's topic is

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
How can science help

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
establish a better legal system?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
You can see three pictures here.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
The left one

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
shows that although the legal world

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
is thought to be a humanistic

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
or socially scientific field,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
the right one, the picture of DNA,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
can help us

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
establish a better legal system.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
The middle picture

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
is a classic

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
picture of legal psychology.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
This is also a symbol of

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
American legal psychology.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
It will also appear later.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It shows that psychology is a field

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
that studies human behavior.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
that studies human behavior.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It shows that psychology is a field

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
that studies human behavior.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
The picture on the bottom right

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
is a picture of the brain.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
There are many researchers

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
in the field of neuroscience.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
They are thinking about

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
how to help us

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
establish a better legal system

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
through their research.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I am Suyi An.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I am Suyi An.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I am a doctoral student

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
at Cornell University

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Human Ecology

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
and Human Development.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Cornell University

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
has two different

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
fields of study

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
related to psychology.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
One is psychology,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
the other is human development.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I am in the field of human development.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
There are three fields of study

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
related to human development.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I am in the field of

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
legal psychology and human development.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I am in the field of

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
children, witnesses,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
and cognitive research.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
As Suyi An said,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I graduated from

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
the Faculty of Finance and Law

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
at Cornell University.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
During my time at the Faculty of Law,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I worked as a research assistant

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
in two different

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
fields of psychology.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I worked as a research assistant

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
in two different

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
fields of psychology.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
At first, I wanted to study

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
legal psychology

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
because I thought

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
since it is related to human development,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
it should be related to human behavior.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I have been interested in psychology.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
One day,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I was wondering

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
how I could get a chance

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
to study psychology.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
At that time,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Professor Zhang Yanping

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
asked me to work as a research assistant.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I accepted his offer

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
and he took me in.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I have been studying psychology

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
with Professor Zhang Yanping.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
At first,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I was working in

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
a social psychology lab

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
with Professor Lin Yizheng.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I was doing research

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
related to social psychology.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
In my senior year,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Professor Zhao Yishan

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
was a vice-professor

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
at NTU.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
He was a psychologist

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
who graduated from

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Jianqiao University.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
He was also a child witness.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I was interested in this field.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
At that time,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Professor Lin Yizheng was about to retire.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I started doing research

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
related to child witnesses with Professor Zhao Yishan.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
During my senior year,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I studied psychology

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
with Professor Zhao Yishan.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I have listed two pictures here.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
NTU has developed

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
a new cross-field course

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
for legal psychology.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
There are four professors

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
in three different fields,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
legal psychology,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
data science,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
and information science.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I'm not sure

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
if this course will be online.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
However,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
cross-field students

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
are becoming more and more

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
popular in Taiwan.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Here are some

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
researches I did

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
when I was in Taiwan.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
The first one

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
was with Professor Zhang Yanping,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
who is now a doctor,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
during Professor Lin Yizheng's

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
research period.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
The second one

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
was with Professor Zhao Yishan

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
during his research period.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
We did a study on

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
child witnesses.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
The study

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
was mainly

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
about

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
how witnesses

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
would react

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
to a crime

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
in a different place

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
after witnessing

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
a crime.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
The last one

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
was a study on children

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
in my master's thesis.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
We wanted to see

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
if there were

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
many cases

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
related to child custody.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
In those cases,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
the legal terms

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
were quite complicated.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
We also wanted to know

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
if there were any cases

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
related to divorce.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
We wanted to know

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
if children could understand

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
the legal terms

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
related to child custody

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
and if they could

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
imagine what it means

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
to be divorced.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Something like that.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
The second study

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
was with

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Professor Zhong Chengyu.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
He is currently

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
working at the Chinese Academy of Law.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
He is also our guest today.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
After I graduated

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
from NTU Law School,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I worked as a lawyer

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
for a period of time.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I mainly worked

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
at an international law firm.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
The lawyer I worked with

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
was Mr. Huang Zhihao.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Mr. Huang's specialty

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
was psychology

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
and law.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
He helped Taiwan

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
with many cases

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
related to child custody.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
The so-called

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
case related to child custody

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
could be

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
a crime

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
related to

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
a crime

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
that could be

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
sentenced to death.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
We called it

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
a crime related to

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
a crime

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
that could be

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
sentenced to death.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Mr. Huang's specialty

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
was psychology

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
and law.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
He helped Taiwan

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
with many cases

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
related to child custody.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
If you are interested

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
in working as a lawyer

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
for a crime related to

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
child custody,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
you may be interested

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
in the concept of

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
judicial psychology.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
For example,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
when we come across

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
cases related to death

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
or cases related to

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
child custody,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
we often see

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
the words

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
in red.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
For example,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
the evidence in the case

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
could be

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
related to

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Taiwan's

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Child Custody Rehabilitation

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Association.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Many cases

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
are

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
based on

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
scientific evidence.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
We need to

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
examine

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
whether the scientific evidence

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
in the case

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
is reliable

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
and what is the

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
evidence

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
that can be

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
re-examined.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
In Taiwan,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
we often see

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
cases related to

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
interrogation

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
or the

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
possibility of

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
further testing.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
We also need to

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
examine

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
whether the

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
evidence in the case

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
is reliable

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
and what is

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
the evidence

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
that can be

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
re-examined.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
We also need to

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
examine

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
whether the

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
is reliable

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
and what is

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
the evidence

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
that can be

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
re-examined.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
We also need to

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
examine

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
the evidence

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
that can be

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
re-examined.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
We also need to examine

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
whether the

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
evidence in the case

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
is reliable

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and what is

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
the evidence

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
that can be

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
re-examined.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
We also need to examine

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
whether the

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
evidence in the case

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
is reliable

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
and what is

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
the evidence

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
that can be

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
re-examined.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
We also need to examine

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
whether the

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
evidence in the case

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
is reliable

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
and what is

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
the evidence

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
that can be

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
re-examined.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
We also need to examine

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
whether the

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
evidence in the case

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
is reliable

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and what is

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
the evidence

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
that can be

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
re-examined.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
We also need to examine

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
whether the

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
evidence in the case

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
is reliable

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
and what is

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
the evidence

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
that can be

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
re-examined.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
We also need to examine

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
whether the

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
evidence in the case

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
is reliable

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
and what is

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
the evidence

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
that can be

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
re-examined.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
We also need to examine

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
whether the

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
evidence in the case

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
is reliable

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
and what is

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
the evidence

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
that can be

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
re-examined.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
We also need to examine

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
whether the

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
evidence in the case

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
is reliable

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
and what is

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
the evidence

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
that can be

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
re-examined.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
We also need to examine

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
whether the

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
evidence in the case

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
is reliable

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
and what is

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
the evidence

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
that can be

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
re-examined.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I'd like to share

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
a documentary I watched a while ago.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
It's about

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
a country in Africa

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
whose name I don't remember.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
In their

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
modern

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
judicial system,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
a part of it

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
is about

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
how to control

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
their maids.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Because the maids fly away,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
they need chains to

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
control their

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
maids.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
They will be punished

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
if they

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
join a national

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
ceremony.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
They even formalize

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
the existence of maids

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
and write it in their laws.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
This is still a thing

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
in the modern world.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Wow, that's amazing.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Thank you for your complement.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That's a scary story.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Let's move on.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
In fact,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
the reason why

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
many maids

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
were found guilty

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
was because of their children's testimony.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It's interesting that

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
some books

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
say that after the children grew up,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
they regretted

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
not seeing

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
what the maids

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
were doing.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Maybe they were

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
afraid of the adults

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
or other factors.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
That's why they said those words.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
They were doubtful.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
In other words,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
did the children lie

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
or did they

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
believe what they said?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Because of

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
external or internal reasons,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
they

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
might not

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
believe

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
what they said.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
They might not believe

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
everything they said.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
It's interesting.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
In the early 20th century,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
the earliest research

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
came from Alfred Binet.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
If you're a psychologist,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
you might know him.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
He was one of the

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
most important

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
researchers and

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
inventors

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
of modern IQ tests.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
He had a legal background.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Although his research

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
was based on IQ tests,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
according to

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
our Tibetan teachers,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
his research

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
was based on

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
the credibility of testimony.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
He published

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
a book in 1901.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
He said that

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
through his research,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
he thought that

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
the credibility of testimony

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
of men and women

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
was based on

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
the ability of human

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
to react to

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
the information

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
they received

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
from others

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
the ability

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
to

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
resist.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
He was very interested in this.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
From 1901

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
to

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
1960 and

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
1970,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
no one paid attention to this.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
In the 1960s and 1970s,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
children's testimony

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
became a hot topic.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
As women

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and children

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
started to

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
pay attention to

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
children's rights,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
many people started to

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
pay attention to

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
children's rights

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
in kindergartens,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
and there were many cases

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
about

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
inappropriate contact

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
with their family members.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Under these circumstances,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
the law and cases

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
changed the situation

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
so that most of the children

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
could not testify in court.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Suddenly, the condition

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
for children's testimony

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
to testify in court

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
and the age

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
for children to testify in court

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
led to many children's

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
testimonies

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
in court.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
The judge didn't know

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
how to deal with it,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
and the psychologist

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
didn't know what to do.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
My teacher

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
was an expert

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
who studied

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
children's intelligence

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and memory.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
He was an expert

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
in pure academic theory.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
He found that

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
a boy

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
was involved in a murder case.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
The father

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
seemed to have hit his mother

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
with a stick.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
He asked the boy

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
if he had seen

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
his mother

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
being dragged

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
to the back door

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
after the argument.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
The judge wanted to know

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
if the child's testimony

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
was credible,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
because it was related

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
to the father's crime.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
My teacher thought

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
that as a well-known

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
child memory expert,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
he couldn't answer the question.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
So he gathered

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
about 30 experts

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
from the U.S.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
to hold a meeting

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
in Cornell.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
The purpose of the meeting

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
was to discuss

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
how to transfer

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
psychological knowledge

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
related to children

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
to the court

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
and make it

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
a practical knowledge.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
So the experts

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
held a three-day meeting

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
in Cornell,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and came up with

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
a white paper

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
that slowly influenced

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
the combination

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
of psychology and law.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
In the 1980s,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
there was a famous case

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
called Mark Martin's

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Family Trials.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It was about a kindergarten

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
run by a family.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Suddenly,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
dozens of children

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
claimed to have

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
been sexually harassed

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
or sexually harassed

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
by various members

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
of the family

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
with different objects

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
of interest.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Most of the charges

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
were revoked

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
or turned into

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
conjury.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
The reason was

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
that the child testimony

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
in the case

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
seemed to be

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
impossible to find physical evidence.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Many experts

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
used psychological research

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
to help determine

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
whether the child testimony

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
was true or not.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
There's a documentary

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
about the case

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
that you can check out.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Mark Martin

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
published a book

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
in 1995.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
After the meeting

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
in Cornell,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
he began to receive

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
many letters

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
from lawyers

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
asking him

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
if he wanted to be

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
a part of the case.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
The lawyer said

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
he didn't mind

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
as long as

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
the child testimony

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
was easy to understand.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
You can check out

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
the documentary

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
online.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
The documentary

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
is about

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
how psychological research

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
can be applied

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
to children.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Any questions?

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Let's move on.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
The child testimony

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
is about

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
a man who

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
is a good man

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
but a very careless man.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It's a pre-testimony.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
There may be

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
some guidance issues.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
The child testimony

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
is about

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
a man who

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
is a good man

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
but a very careless man.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
The child testimony

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
is about

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
a man who

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
is a good man

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
but a very careless man.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
The child testimony

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
is about

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
a man who

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
is a good man

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
but a very careless man.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
The child testimony

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
includes

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
many additional

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
evidence

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
that may

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
have to do with

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
law and psychology,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
including how

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
electric vehicles

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
can be applied to

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
law,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
and when children

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
develop the ability to

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
lie.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
In some specific crimes,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
judges and judges

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
may have different

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
sympathies

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
for different

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
cultures,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
social status,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
and different

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
ways of

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
raising children,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
so we are

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
currently doing

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
a research

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
to explore

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
the different

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
aspects of

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
the child testimony.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
We hope

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
this research

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
can help

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
you understand

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
the different

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
aspects of

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
the child testimony.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I am also

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
working with

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Charles Brenner

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
on a research

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
called Fuzzy Trace Theory.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Fuzzy Trace Theory

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
is a method of

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
memorization

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
in which

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
we try to

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
visualize

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
the memory

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
of the victim

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
in a specific way.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
For example,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
we try to

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
visualize

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
the victim

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
on the African

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
prairie,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
and see if this

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
special way

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
can enhance

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
the memory

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
of the victim.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I am also

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
working with

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
a professor

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
in the Department of

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Law on

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
whether

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
most states

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
in the U.S.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
are able to

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
evaluate the

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
ability of

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
this method

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
of memorization

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
in the U.S.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I am also

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
working with

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Cornell

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
on a research

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
called

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
World Anti-Torture Center.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
We are also

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
working on

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
a book

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
on the

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
possibility

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
of

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
taking home

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
the message

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
that if you are

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
interested in

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
law and psychology,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
you should

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
go to the

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
American Psychological Society

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
to learn more about

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
law and psychology.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
In Europe,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
there is a

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
law and psychology

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
association

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
called

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
the American Psychological Society.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I think

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
it is a great resource

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
for people

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
who want to

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
study abroad.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
This book is

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
written by

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Elizabeth Loftus,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
an expert on

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
the study of

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
memory.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
It is a

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
great resource

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
for people

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
who want to

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
learn more about

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
law and

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
psychology.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
That's all

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
for today.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
If you have

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
any questions,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
please feel free

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
to ask.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Before we

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
start,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I would like to

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
ask you

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
a question.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You can turn on

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
the microphone

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
or leave a comment

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
and I will ask.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
How to turn on

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
the microphone?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Go to

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Blue Dream

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
and you will

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
find a

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
picture of

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Blue Dream.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Click on it and

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
you can talk.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Please go ahead.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
It's okay.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I just have a question.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
No, I mean

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
you can ask now.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Okay.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Do I need to introduce myself?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Sure.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I am

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Feng Mengzhang,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
and I am studying social science.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Hi.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Hi.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
So

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I was thinking

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
about the issue of

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
the gap between

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
children's

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
testimony and

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
objective situation.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
I am curious

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
about

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
how to

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
distinguish

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
the gap

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
between

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
the children's testimony

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and the objective situation.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Is it the memory

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
or the memory

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
that is affected

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
or the expression

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
that is affected?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
For example,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
the stereotype

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
that the person

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
was affected

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
by the stereotype.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
The description

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
of the stereotype

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
is the difference

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
between the control group

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
and the treatment group.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
One possibility is

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
that the stereotype

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
may cause

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
some mistakes

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
in the process

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
of memory

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
or memory.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Another possibility

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
is that

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
the stereotype

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
may cause

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
some mistakes

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
in the process

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
of memory

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
or memory.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Another possibility

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
is that

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
the stereotype

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
may cause

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
some mistakes

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
in the process

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
of memory

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
or memory.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Another possibility

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
is that

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
the stereotype

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
may cause

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
some mistakes

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
in the process

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
of memory

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
or memory.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Another possibility

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
is that

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
the stereotype

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
may cause

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
some mistakes

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
in the process

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
of memory

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
or memory.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Another possibility

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
is that

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
the stereotype

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
may cause

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
some mistakes

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
in the process

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
of memory

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
or memory.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Another possibility

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
is that

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
the stereotype

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
may cause

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
some mistakes

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
in the process

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
of memory

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
or memory.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
In fact,

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
there is no way

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
to distinguish

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
the information

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
given by

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
the person

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
and how he or she

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
remembers it.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
In fact,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
there is no way

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
to distinguish

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
the information

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
given by

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
the person

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
and how he or she

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
remembers it.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
In fact,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
there is no way

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
to distinguish

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
the information

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
given by

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
the person

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
and how he or she

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
remembers it.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
In fact,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
there is no way

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
to distinguish

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
the information

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
given by

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
the person

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and how he or she

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
remembers it.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
In fact,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
there is no way

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
to distinguish

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
the information

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
given by

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
the person

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
and how he or she

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
remembers it.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
There is another

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
big question.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I majored in

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
economics,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
so I will

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
think about

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
what is

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
the cause and effect

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
of human behavior.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Back to the question

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
of children's

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
testimony,

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
I was thinking

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
about the cause

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
and effect of

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
children's testimony

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
in court.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I can imagine

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
the cause and effect

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
of children's testimony

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
in court.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
For example,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
adults know that

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
there will be legal responsibility

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
if they testify,

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
but children

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
may not understand

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
the legal effect

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
behind the behavior.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
For example,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
the prosecutor may like

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
the father or mother

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
and want to tell

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
the good words

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
to the one he likes.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
The prosecutor may

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
want to please the authority

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
and obey the authority.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
If there is a big difference

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
between the cause and effect

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
of children's testimony

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
and adults' testimony,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
there may be

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
different contents.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I was wondering

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
if anyone has

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
analyzed this issue.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Yes,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I have seen

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
a lot of research.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
You just mentioned

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
a lot of things.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
For example,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
some of the research

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
has been converted

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
into a method

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
to interrogate children.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
The first method

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
is not to promise

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
the child

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
good or bad answers

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
or what kind of actions

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
the child will take.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
For example,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
if the police take the child

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
to McDonald's,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
the child will not

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
be attracted to McDonald's.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
The second method

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
is not to promise

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
the child good or bad answers

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
or what kind of actions

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
the child will take.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
The third method

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
is to give the child

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
a chance to

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
choose the right answer.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
For example,

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
most of the research

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
in Europe and America

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
does not recommend

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
the use of a telegram doll.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Telegram dolls

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
are very interesting

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
to most children.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
If you tell the child

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
to do certain things

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
with the doll

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
and not to do

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
certain things with the doll,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
it will affect

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
the child.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
In this process,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
if you tell the child

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
to do certain things

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
or not to do certain things,

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
it will affect the child.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
We are working on

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
how to maintain

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
the focus of the child

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
in the process of

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
asking questions to children,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
but not to give the child

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
too many external questions.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Many people are studying this.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I think this question

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
is professional and good.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Thank you.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
You just answered

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
the questions I wanted to ask.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
The next question I want to ask

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
is from

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
someone else.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Thank you.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Let me guess.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I used to work

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
at the Family Violence

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
and Sexual Assault Prevention Center

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
about six or seven years ago.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
You just said

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
that telegram dolls are not recommended.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
We use a lot of them.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
We try to

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
at least

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
use them

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
if there are

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
research papers.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
If you really

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
have to use a tool,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
telegram dolls

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
are the last step.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
They are too easy to use

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
because they have holes.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Children

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
may want to

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
insert different

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
body parts or objects

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
in order to

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
interpret the behavior.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
So,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
a better way

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
is to use a time line

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
or a pen

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
to

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
telegram the child.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Or,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
if you really need

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
to point out a specific part,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
telegram dolls

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
are less likely

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
to have body parts.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
So,

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
if you have

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
DNA evidence,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
children

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
are likely to be

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
sexually assaulted.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
So,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I don't recommend using them.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Okay.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Next,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
let me see his name.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Is his name

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Mingxin?

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Hi, everyone.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Thank you.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Can you hear me?

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Yes.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Hi,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I'm Mingxin Zhu.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I'm a doctoral student

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
at Northwestern University.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Yiyan is my classmate

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
in the Department of Law.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Thank you, Yiyan.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
I have two questions.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
The first question is

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
when a child

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
gives his testimony,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
the job of a lawyer

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
is to

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
incorporate his testimony

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
into the law.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
from a psychologist's point of view,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
if you find that

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
the testimony is likely to be contaminated,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
or if the contamination

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
is significant,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
if the contamination is light,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
is it possible

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
to correct it

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
or give it

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
a different weight

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
instead of throwing away

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
the entire testimony?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Is there a difference in the amount

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
rather than just having it or not?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
That's my first question.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
What about the second question?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Have I finished my question?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Okay,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
let's start with the first one.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
You asked about the evidence

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
and the evidence.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
From a psychologist's point of view,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
do you only discuss

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
the evidence and not the evidence?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
In fact,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
most people

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
in this field

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
are still trained

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
in psychology,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
so they don't think

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
much about how

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
a lawyer or a prosecutor

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
or an attorney

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
should use the evidence.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
For example,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
let's say that

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
this case has repeated interrogation.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
The contamination

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
may not have been discovered at the beginning,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
but it was discovered later.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Of course, you can ask an expert

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
to verify that

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
in the first two interrogations,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
there was no inducement

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
or contamination.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
In the first two interrogations,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
what was provided?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
In the third interrogation,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
there may be some external

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
inducement or

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
inappropriate reasons,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
so the child's testimony

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
may have been contaminated

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
or even changed.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
In fact,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
it can be used in the first two interrogations.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Psychologists may evaluate

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
the possibility of

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
external contamination

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
in each interrogation.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
As for

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
how lawyers

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
use scientific reports,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I think it's more like

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
a lawyer's strategy.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
As far as I know,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
ordinary children's legal psychologists

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
don't interfere

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
with how lawyers

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
use scientific reports.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
On the one hand, it's not suitable

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
because it's a legal profession.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Ordinary children's legal psychologists

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
don't understand this profession,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
so they provide

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
very pure scientific analysis reports.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
This is what I know

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
from my experience.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I mean,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
with your background,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
from a psychological point of view,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
is it possible that

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
the level of contamination

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
can be reduced

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
to a point

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
where there is no evidence?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Or is it possible

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
that it still exists

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and only needs

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
some correction

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
on the basis of

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
the level of contamination?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I've discussed this with my teacher.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
He rarely

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
accepts students

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
with dual backgrounds like me.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I asked him

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
if I needed to

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
give expert advice.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
He said it's simple.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I can't be an expert

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
on the same case

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
and defend the same case.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
He suggested

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
that this kind of thing

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
can be done

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
by

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
reducing the level

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
of contamination

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
to a point where

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
there is no evidence.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
First of all,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
even if I think this way,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
my child can't

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
have no evidence.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It's not a scientific term.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
It's a legal term.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I see.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
In my scientific report,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
even if I have a dual background,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I can't

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
cross-reference

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
the legal part.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I should leave it

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
to my legal team

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
to do it,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
even if I have a dual background.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
My second question

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
is that

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
your school has

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
a plan to

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
conduct an investigation.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Yes.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm curious

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
about the role of psychology

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
in the court in Taiwan.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
For example,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
is there any possibility of

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
cross-referencing?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
After our legal department

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
was sentenced to death,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
there are only some procedural

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
issues that can be reviewed.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
For example,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
are there any other

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
legal procedures?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
However,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'm curious

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
about the role of psychology

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
in the court in Taiwan.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I'm curious

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
about the role of psychology

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
in the court in Taiwan.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I think

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
it might be related

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
to the logic of religion.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
There are two judgments

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
in the Supreme Court

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
for the death penalty.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
The logic is that

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
a person can only

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
be held accountable

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
for the crime he committed.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
If a person

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
has a mental state

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
during the execution

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
or even before

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
the execution,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
which means

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
he can't be held

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
accountable for the crime

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
he committed,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
he shouldn't be sentenced to death.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
This doesn't mean

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
he should be sentenced to death.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
In Taiwan,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
as far as I know,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
there is still

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
no assessment

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
on this issue.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
The reason is that

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
there are three

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
common psychological

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
abilities

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
related to the death penalty.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
The first one is

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
whether the person

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
has the ability to

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
communicate with the lawyer

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
and defend himself.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
The second one is

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
whether he has the ability

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
to be held accountable

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
for the crime he committed.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
The third one is

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
the ability to be executed.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
As far as I know,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
in Taiwan,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
the ability to be held

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
accountable for the crime

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
he committed

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
is not necessarily

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
acceptable

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
or is still

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
a difficult concept.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
It's even more difficult

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
when it comes to the ability

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
to save the life

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
in the later stage,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
or the ability to be held

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
accountable

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
according to the law.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
As far as I know,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Taiwan's judicial system

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
doesn't deal with the issue

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
of the ability to save the life

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
and the ability to be held accountable.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Some states require

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
the lawyer to apply

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
at the last minute,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
so they are now

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
looking at

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
which states

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
don't allow

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
the application

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
of the ability

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
to be held accountable.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
They are still

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
doing statistics

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
on the case

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
of the death penalty.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I see.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
There's a minor point

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
that I'd like to add.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
You mentioned that the witch

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
wanted to see

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
if there's a chance

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
to confirm the death penalty.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yes, I saw that

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
and I think you're right.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
It's a minor point.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Thank you.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Thank you, Cha-Zheng.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Okay.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Let me ask

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
another question.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You mentioned

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
that

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
a friend here

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
asked a tricky question.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
He said,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
it sounds like psychology

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
has a great influence

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
on food in the US and Europe.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I'm curious

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
if it has an influence

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
on Taiwan's courts.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
You mentioned that

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
psychology

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
evaluates

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
the person

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
or the defendant

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I'm guessing

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
whether the person

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
has the ability

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
to be held accountable.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
But you didn't mention

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
that psychology

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
has a great influence

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
on the evidence

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
in Taiwan's courts.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Can you comment on that?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
As far as I know,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
there are five kinds of evidence

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
in Taiwan,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
such as human evidence,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
book evidence,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and so on.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
As far as I know,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
human evidence

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
has a great influence

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
on the evidence

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
in Taiwan's courts.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
As far as I know,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
for example,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Mr. Zhao Yishan

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
is a consultant

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
in the Ministry of Public Security.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Due to his influence

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
and the promotion

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
of some private groups,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
there is a new law

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
called

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Sexual Harassment Prevention Act.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
According to the law,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
it should be

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
carried out

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
by experts

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
in the field.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
As far as I know,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
there are many

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
psychologists,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
clinical psychologists,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
and so on.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Psychologists

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
are also

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
working on

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
the establishment

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
and modification

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
of articles

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
related to

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
sexual harassment.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
As far as I know,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
in the past few years,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Taiwan has been

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
more and more aware

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
that

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
first,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
science can enter the court,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
and second,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
science is not only

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
the so-called hard science,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
such as forensic evidence,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
and so on.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
There is also

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
the so-called soft science,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
and so on.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I think more and more

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
legal figures

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
in the legal system

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
are paying attention to it.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Not only judges,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
but also prosecutors and lawyers

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
are doing different

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
training.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I think it's pretty good.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
That's the situation in Taiwan.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Okay.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I have a question.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
It's my own question.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Do you have any other questions?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Do you have any other questions?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Do you have any other questions?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Let's think about it.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I'll go first.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Excuse me. Can you hear me?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Please go ahead.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I'd like to ask

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
that

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
the study design

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
you're using now

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
is based on quantitative research,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
or

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
is it qualitative?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Because

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
in the evidence part,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I know that

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I've seen the related research.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
They are

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
using the model of

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
the Maga Jury

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
to look at the decision

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
between the patient groups.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
They are in the qualitative part.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
So I think

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
the first question is

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
that you want to do a

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
quantitative research.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Is it based on

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
the data you presented before?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Is it based on

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
the data you presented before?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Or is it based on the quality?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
If it's a cross-border research,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
we are considering

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
both quantitative and quality.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
For quantitative research,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
the easiest way is to look at

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
the level of guidance

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
in each country.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
For the quality,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
we are considering

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
the level of guidance

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
in each country.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So we are considering

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
the level of guidance

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
in each country.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
So we are considering

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
the level of guidance

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
in each country.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
The second question is

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
How old is the child?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
How old is the child?

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
We currently have two groups.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
One is 5 years old

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
and the other is 8 years old.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
5 years old is

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
half of 8 years old.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
8 years old is half of 8 years old.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
5 years old and 8 years old.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
5 years old and 8 years old.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I have seen

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
online

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
that the relevant

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
children's interviews

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
are usually not appropriate

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
for the age of 11.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
for the age of 11.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
for the age of 11.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
for the age of 11.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
So I am not sure

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
if the same problem

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
will occur

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
in the law psychology.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
in the law psychology.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
in the law psychology.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Thank you.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
We are considering

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
two groups.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
One is the kindergarten group and the elementary school group.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
There are several reasons.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
First of all, the children's testimony

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
is what I saw

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
or what we did in the lab

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
or what I did

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
when I was in the elementary school class.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Many of us will mention the age under 11.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Many of us will mention the age under 11.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Because in the field of children's testimony,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
when it was created

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
or when everyone was doing research,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
it was to solve the problem of food.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
However, many cases

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
of child-like

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
disability

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
include victims

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
or witnesses.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
They may be children

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
who are quite young.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
In the United States,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
most of them are children

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
in kindergarten age.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So in the field of children's testimony,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
especially in the field of pedagogical research,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
the kindergarten group is usually included.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
As for the text of my testimony,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
we are still thinking about

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
the issue of openness.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
We are still thinking about

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
the issue of openness.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
We don't know

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
how rich the content

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
of the child's testimony

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
will be.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
However, there is a mystery

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
that can be solved.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
If the child is

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
very child-friendly

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and not too high-pressure,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
the issue of openness

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
will be solved.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
However,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
the child can speak a lot

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
in kindergarten.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
We are now

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
trying to solve the issue of openness

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
to collect the text of the testimony.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
We don't know

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
how the result will be.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Sorry, I want to add one more thing.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
If you want to work in Taiwan,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
the IRB

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
may be a little

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
more difficult.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
This is my personal experience.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Because Talking Age

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
is for children.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
They will require these things.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The IRB is now running.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
So,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
fingers crossed.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
The IRB in Taiwan

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
is probably the easiest

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
to work with

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
in the middle age hospital.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
If it is in other medical institutions,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
it may be very troublesome.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
That's right.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Now,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
the IRB in Taiwan

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
is running.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
fingers crossed.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Thank you.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Taiwan

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
involves children.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Thank you for

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
your encouragement,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
support and advice.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Thank you.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
So,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
do you have any other questions?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Let me ask you a question.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Do you have time?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Yes.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Please go ahead.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I'm sorry.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
You just mentioned a lot of research

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
about

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
the situation when children

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
were drawn for testimony.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Whether they were

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
sedated or

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
not,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
and so on.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
It's all about the situation

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
when children were drawn for testimony.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I'm thinking about

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
an extreme situation.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
If the situation is not reliable,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
let's say we get an article.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
The article says

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
that this is the testimony of a child.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It's written as an article.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
We don't know what happened.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Is there any way

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
to

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
estimate

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
the credibility

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
of the testimony?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Why do I think

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
it's like

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
we don't know

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
what happened

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
to the journalists.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
But we can

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
see from the news

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
that it's fake news.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
We have that ability.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Is there any way

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
to study the credibility

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
of the testimony?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I know that

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
a lot of people

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
would go directly.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
If it's just a text,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and there's no recording,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
let's first see

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
how the text

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
is made.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
For example, in Taiwan,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
a lot of text

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
is not written in text

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
because it's easier to record.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
It's actually a sample.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's hard to analyze

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
from a scientific point of view.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
If the quality is better,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
it's really a text.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
There's a way

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
that

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I'm not sure

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
if it's possible.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
You can analyze

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
the form of the question.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Is it an open-ended question?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
If not,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
does the way it's designed

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
have any guidance?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
For example,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
is there any information

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
that hasn't appeared

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
during the interrogation?

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
For example,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
did your dad

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
touch your sister?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
It's obviously a guidance question.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
But if it's

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
like,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
hello, I'm a policewoman.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Can you tell me

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
what your dad did to you?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Your dad might be a guide.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
If there is

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
a more complete text,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
and you can tell

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
the form of the question,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
you can analyze

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
the form of the question

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
and see how much

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
guidance it has.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I have no more questions.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Anyone else?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
If not,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
let's give Yilan another round of applause.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
That's all for today.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Thank you.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Thank you.
