00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's presentation by Project Tara.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm your host, Suyi An.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First of all, I'd like to thank our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
for being our speaker today.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm also very happy to have people from all cities

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and towns join us in this online academic presentation.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to spend a minute or two to introduce our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then I'm going to talk a little bit about today's event.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm really happy that Gaoxue can be our speaker today.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Gaoxue and I met in NTU.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Gaoxue's background is very, very special.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Gaoxue graduated from NTU's Department of Chemistry,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
so she didn't major in psychology.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Later, she studied at NTU's Psychological Institute,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is a laboratory in the field of development.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
She had a very special experience.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
After Gaoxue studied at the Psychological Institute,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
she didn't give up her original chemistry major.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Instead, she studied at NTU's Counseling Center.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
After graduation, she even became a full-time high school chemistry teacher.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gaoxue is currently studying in the Ph.D. class of the Catholic University of Belize.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As far as I know, she also studies in the field of psychological development.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
When I was preparing for this presentation, I was actually quite nervous.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because Gaoxue herself sent me a very rich CV.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
At first glance, I thought she was a god.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Gaoxue, if I say something wrong, you can correct me at any time.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was thinking about what to prepare.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The information is too rich.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Gaoxue has won many research-related awards,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
including the Best Dictionary and Dictionary Award

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
at the Taiwan Psychological Institute,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
as well as the Young Scholar Award

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
at the Taiwan Women's Studies Institute, etc.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can't wait to be awarded.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Today, Gaoxue will mainly share with us

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
her speech on the topic of gender equality.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After all, I'm not an expert,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so I'll leave it to Gaoxue to explain it to us later.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But I think this topic, especially recently,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
is particularly in line with the current situation.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
During COVID-19, Taiwan may not be very obvious,

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but abroad, there are indeed quite a lot of people

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
who are concerned about gender equality.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Many parents and children

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
may be stuck at home all day long

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is Gaoxue's brief introduction.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So the format we're going to do today is

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
after I'm done with my presentation,

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Gaoxue will start a one-hour speech.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Then there will be Q&A.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But the format of Project Hera is quite casual.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So if you have any questions,

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you can just turn on your microphone and ask.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Or if you're a little shy,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you can leave a comment in the chat.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Or I may also collect them into the last Q&A.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Or I may also collect them into the last Q&A.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's all for my introduction.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Gaoxue, I'll leave the rest to you.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Gaoxue, I'll leave the rest to you.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you, Annie, for the kind introduction.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hebrew

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hebrew

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hebrew

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hebrew

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hebrew

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hebrew

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hebrew

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hebrew

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hebrew

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hebrew

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hebrew

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hebrew

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hebrew

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But the training mode is mainly in Dutch and French.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
After introducing our school,

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
let me introduce myself first.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thank you very much for the introduction of Yi-An.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have been in Taiwan University

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
from the university to the master's class for eight years.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
At the university,

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
my major is chemistry,

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and my minor is psychology.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
At the master's class,

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I completed my master's thesis

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
under the guidance of

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the Department of Psychology.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
My specialization in research

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
is the development of psychology

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
in general psychology.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
In 2019,

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
as I just said,

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I joined the Catholic University of Taiwan

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to study for my doctorate degree.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
My specialization in research is still developing psychology.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
At the same time,

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I also joined the two subfields of

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
cultural psychology and health psychology.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
In the process,

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
as mentioned by Yi-An just now,

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I used to be a full-time

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
chemistry intern

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
at Songshan High School in Taipei City.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I also served as a full-time research assistant

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
at the laboratory of Professor Cao Zhengcao

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
of the Department of Communication and Technology at the University of Taiwan.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Because of this more diverse

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
or different experience,

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I am particularly interested in

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the related emotional experiences

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
in my family.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Especially,

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
what I care about is a social culture.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am particularly interested in the influence of

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
individuals and parents

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in this social culture.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Some of my research themes

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
include parenting stress,

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and emotional regulation

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
of how parents

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
deal with their emotions related to stress.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I particularly use

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
physiological indicators

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to measure the stress of an individual.

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I will use cultural perspective

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
or the network analysis

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
commonly used in communication psychology

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to care about the relationship

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
between people

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and the different phenomena

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
in people's minds.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
At the beginning of the report,

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I also introduced

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
my field,

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the field of developmental psychology.

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I referred to

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the introduction made by

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
my master's class teacher,

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Prof. Lei Ganlin,

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
in the online course of Coursera.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
From his point of view,

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
before we get to know

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
the development of psychology,

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we may need to understand

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
what psychology is.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Psychology cares about

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the knowledge of people and their minds.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It also includes

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the field of experimental psychology.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
In this field,

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we may want to care about

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
a person's cognitive,

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
our cognition,

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
our emotions,

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
our language,

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and even our intuition.

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We also include

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
social and personality psychology.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In this field,

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
we care about a person's personality,

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the interaction between a person

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and another person,

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and social psychology.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is a special cultural phenomenon

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
in a cultural community.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We care about the similarity

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and interdependence

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
between different cultures.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Of course,

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
applied psychology is also

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
a major field in psychology.

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
For example,

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
criminal psychology,

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
which I mentioned before,

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
also includes

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the interaction between

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
clinical psychologists

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and our cases.

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
These are the topics

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
of clinical psychology.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Even in our educational field

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
or organizational field,

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
there are many topics

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
discussed in psychology.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
However,

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
no matter what field we are in,

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
we must accept

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the training provided by

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the following three sets of knowledge.

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The first is

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
physiological psychology.

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No matter what field we are in,

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
we must understand

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that there is a set of physiological mechanisms

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
behind everyone's behavior

206
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and cognition.

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
In addition,

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
when we measure

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the abstract phenomenon

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in psychology,

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we must be sure

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that the phenomenon we measure

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
is what we think

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
in our mind.

215
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This method

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
is usually a psychometric method.

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It is the training

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
given to us

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
by the Department of Psychology.

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The last is

221
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
developmental psychology.

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Developmental psychology

223
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
provides us

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
with a holistic approach

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that allows us to understand

226
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that we are developing

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
with time.

228
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The previous time point

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
will affect

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
my current behavior

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
at this time point.

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
My current time point

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
will also affect

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
my future time point.

235
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We are all

236
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
constantly evolving

237
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and developing.

238
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In this case,

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
everyone will interact

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
with their society.

241
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Therefore,

242
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
they will play different roles.

243
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
For example,

244
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
students,

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
partners,

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
friends,

247
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and even parents.

248
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Under these different roles,

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
there will be corresponding

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
cognitive development,

251
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
linguistic development,

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
personality development,

253
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
emotional development,

254
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and even action development.

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There are different issues

256
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to discuss.

257
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
My own research

258
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
focuses on

259
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the issues

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
related to

261
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
a person's role

262
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
as a parent.

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
In fact,

264
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
parenting psychology

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
is a very popular

266
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
research topic

267
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
in developmental psychology

268
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
in the past.

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It is a very

270
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
new research topic.

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I can't say it is new.

272
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It is a very

273
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
popular research topic.

274
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Some researchers even believe that

275
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
parenting's

276
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
related life experience

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
is a very central aspect

278
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
in our modern life.

279
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The reason why

280
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
its experience

281
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
is so important

282
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
is that

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
after a person

284
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
becomes a parent,

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
he or she has done

286
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
a lot of things

287
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and behaviors

288
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that are driven

289
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
by parenting.

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that are driven

291
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
by parenting.

292
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
that are driven

293
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
by parenting.

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Some researchers even believe

295
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
it is a fundamental

296
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
human need

297
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or human motive.

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
or human motive.

299
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Parenting

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is a very important

301
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
life experience.

302
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
life experience.

303
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It is very complicated.

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It is very complicated.

305
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If a teacher

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
or a classmate

307
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
is a parent,

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If a teacher

309
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
or a classmate

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
is a parent,

311
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
he or she will

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
agree with me.

313
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
agree with me.

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Parenting

315
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
is a wonderful experience.

316
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
As a parent,

317
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
we have experienced

318
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
a lot of things

319
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
that we have never experienced

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
in the past.

321
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
As a parent,

322
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
we have gained

323
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
a sense of meaning.

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
a sense of meaning.

325
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
At the same time,

326
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
as a parent,

327
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
we have felt

328
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
a lot of pressure.

329
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
In my master's degree,

330
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I have

331
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
focused on

332
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
general situations.

333
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I have focused on

334
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
general situations.

335
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
When parents

336
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
take care of their children,

337
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
When parents

338
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
take care of their children,

339
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
they will feel

340
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the pressure of daily life

341
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to discuss.

342
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to discuss.

343
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
After I completed

344
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
a theoretical model

345
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
of a master's thesis,

346
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I went to

347
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sousan High School

348
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
to be an intern teacher.

349
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
to be an intern teacher.

350
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's like

351
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
what I wrote on Facebook.

352
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Maybe because

353
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I graduated from

354
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Taisa Psychology,

355
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I am an intern teacher

356
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
in chemistry.

357
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
During the internship,

358
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
many parents

359
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
come to me

360
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
to discuss

361
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
the psychological development

362
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
of their children.

363
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the psychological development

364
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
of their children.

365
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We feel that

366
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
these parents

367
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
are not discussing

368
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
the development

369
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
of their children.

370
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I feel that

371
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
these parents

372
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
need an ear

373
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
to listen to

374
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
their sufferings

375
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
in the past

376
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
ten years

377
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
or the past few years.

378
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
in the past ten years

379
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
or the past few years.

380
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
For example,

381
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
what they often tell me

382
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
is

383
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Master,

384
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I really don't know

385
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
what to do.

386
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Can you help me?

387
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We, as parents,

388
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
are really helpless.

389
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We are really tired.

390
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This group

391
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
is a group of

392
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
teenagers' parents

393
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
who told me

394
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that

395
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
when they talk about

396
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
this paragraph,

397
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
they are crying.

398
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They feel embarrassed

399
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and

400
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
quickly wipe their tears

401
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
with their clothes.

402
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and quickly wipe their tears

403
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
with their clothes.

404
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
During the internship,

405
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
during the internship,

406
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I often

407
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
think again

408
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and again

409
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
whether

410
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
my simple

411
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
daily

412
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
stress relief

413
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
model

414
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
is suitable

415
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to explain

416
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the strong depression

417
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
that these parents

418
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
feel.

419
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to explain the strong depression

420
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
that these parents

421
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
feel.

422
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
At this time,

423
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
last year,

424
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
in 2019,

425
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I met

426
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
my two bosses.

427
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They are recruiting

428
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
PhD students

429
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
to discuss

430
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the extreme

431
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
phenomenon

432
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
of parenting stress

433
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
especially for

434
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
parental burnout

435
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
.

436
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Therefore,

437
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I went from

438
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
NTU Psychology

439
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to

440
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the University of Paris

441
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
to discuss

442
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
a topic

443
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
specifically for

444
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
parental burnout

445
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
in my doctor's thesis

446
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
in more detail.

447
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This brings me

448
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to the main focus

449
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
of my report today,

450
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
parental burnout.

451
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I will use

452
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
the five main aspects

453
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to discuss

454
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
what parental burnout is.

455
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I will discuss

456
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
this concept

457
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
from the historical background.

458
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I will also

459
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
talk about

460
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
how we define

461
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
parental burnout

462
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
from the perspective

463
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
of psychology.

464
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I will also ask

465
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
a question

466
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
about why

467
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
parental burnout

468
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
is so important.

469
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It must be because

470
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
we consider

471
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
its consequences.

472
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Finally,

473
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
we want to provide

474
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
a method

475
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
for parental burnout

476
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
to be treated.

477
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Before treating it,

478
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
we must

479
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
have a clearer

480
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
understanding

481
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
of what

482
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
parental burnout

483
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
is.

484
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If you are a parent,

485
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you may have

486
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
experienced

487
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
these experiences.

488
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you are

489
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
a psychologist,

490
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you may have

491
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
heard

492
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
these experiences

493
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
from your parents.

494
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
These experiences

495
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
are what we

496
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
visit

497
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
those parents

498
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
who have

499
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
been

500
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
traumatized

501
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
by parental burnout.

502
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We visit them

503
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and ask them

504
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
what their

505
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
experience

506
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
is.

507
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
They will

508
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
tell us

509
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the same thing

510
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
that

511
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
their

512
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
experience

513
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
is

514
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
a

515
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
giant

516
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
fatigue.

517
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They live

518
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
like a

519
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
robot

520
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and deal

521
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
with

522
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
their

523
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
daily

524
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
life.

525
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Their

526
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
daily

527
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
life

528
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is

529
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
like

530
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
a

531
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
mess.

532
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They

533
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
constantly

534
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
yell at

535
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
their

536
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
children

537
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and

538
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
want to

539
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
take

540
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
care

541
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
of

542
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
their

543
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
children.

544
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But they

545
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
realize

546
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
it's

547
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
hard to

548
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
control

549
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
their

550
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
children.

551
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They

552
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
can't

553
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
stand

554
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
their

555
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
children.

556
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The

557
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
worst

558
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
thing is

559
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
they

560
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
tell us

561
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that

562
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
they

563
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
can't

564
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
imagine

565
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
them

566
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
becoming

567
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
their

568
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
child.

569
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This

570
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
is

571
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
what

572
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
the

573
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
researchers

574
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
in

575
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Sweden

576
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
found.

577
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They

578
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
found that

579
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
if a

580
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
child

581
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
has

582
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
a

583
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
brain

584
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
tumor,

585
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the

586
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
parents

587
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
tend to

588
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
have some

589
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
symptoms.

590
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They

591
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
also

592
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
have

593
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
symptoms

594
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
in

595
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
other

596
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
children

793
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It

794

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
easier

796
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000

we

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
estimate

822
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
that

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
at least

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000

is

889
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
something

890
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
we

891
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
should

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
about.

895
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We

896
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
organize a

906
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We

907
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
held

908
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000

invite

us

920
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
in

921
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
discussing

922
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
the

923
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
issue.

924
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Let's

925
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
go back to

926
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
science.

927
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
To

928
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
discuss

929
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
parental

930
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
burnout,

931
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
we

932
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
need to

933
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
tell you

934
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that

935
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the

936
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
phenomenon

937
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
is

938
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
real.

939
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We

940
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
define

941
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
parental

942
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
burnout

943
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
in

944
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
two ways.

945
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The

946
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
first

947
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
is

948
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the

949
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
concept

950
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
of

951
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
job burnout.

952
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We

953
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
change it

954
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
into a

955
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
parenting

956
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
context.

957
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The

958
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
top-down

959
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
approach

960
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
is

961
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the

962
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
first

963
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
way.

964
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The

965
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
second

966
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
way is

967
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to

968
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
talk to

969
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
parents

970
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
with

971
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
parental

972
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
burnout

973
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
syndrome

974
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
.

975
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
We

976
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
define

977
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
it as

978
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
a

979
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
psychological

980
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
syndrome.

981
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
There

982
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
are four

983
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
symptoms.

984
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The

985
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
first

986
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
symptom is

987
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that

988
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
you feel

989
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
exhausted

990
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
by your

991
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
parental

992
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
role.

993
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
For

994
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
example,

995
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I feel

996
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
completely

997
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
run down

998
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
by my

999
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
role as a

1000
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
parent.

1001
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The

1002
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
second

1003
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
symptom

1004
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
is that

1005
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
you feel

1006
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
emotionally

1007
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
distant

1008
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
from your

1009
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
child.

1010
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
For

1011
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
example,

1012
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I do

1013
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
what I

1014
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
am supposed

1015
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to do

1016
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
for my

1017
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
children,

1018
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
but

1019
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
nothing

1020
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
more.

1021
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
