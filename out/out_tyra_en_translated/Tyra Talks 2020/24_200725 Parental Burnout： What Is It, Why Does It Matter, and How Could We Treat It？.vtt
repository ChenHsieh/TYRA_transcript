00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's presentation by Project Tara.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
I'm your host, Suyi An.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
First of all, I'd like to thank our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
for being our speaker today.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
I'm also very happy to have people from all cities

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
and towns join us in this online academic presentation.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
I'm going to spend a minute or two to introduce our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
and then I'm going to talk a little bit about today's event.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
I'm really happy that Gaoxue can be our speaker today.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Gaoxue and I met in NTU.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Gaoxue's background is very, very special.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Gaoxue graduated from NTU's Department of Chemistry,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
so she didn't major in psychology.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Later, she studied at NTU's Psychological Institute,

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
which is a laboratory in the field of development.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
She had a very special experience.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
After Gaoxue studied at the Psychological Institute,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
she didn't give up her original chemistry major.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Instead, she studied at NTU's Counseling Center.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
After graduation, she even became a full-time high school chemistry teacher.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Gaoxue is currently studying in the Ph.D. class of the Catholic University of Belize.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
As far as I know, she also studies in the field of psychological development.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
When I was preparing for this presentation, I was actually quite nervous.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Because Gaoxue herself sent me a very rich CV.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
At first glance, I thought she was a god.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Gaoxue, if I say something wrong, you can correct me at any time.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I was thinking about what to prepare.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
The information is too rich.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Gaoxue has won many research-related awards,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
including the Best Dictionary and Dictionary Award

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
at the Taiwan Psychological Institute,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
as well as the Young Scholar Award

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
at the Taiwan Women's Studies Institute, etc.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I can't wait to be awarded.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Today, Gaoxue will mainly share with us

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
her speech on the topic of gender equality.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
After all, I'm not an expert,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
so I'll leave it to Gaoxue to explain it to us later.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
But I think this topic, especially recently,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
is particularly in line with the current situation.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
During COVID-19, Taiwan may not be very obvious,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
but abroad, there are indeed quite a lot of people

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
who are concerned about gender equality.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Many parents and children

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
may be stuck at home all day long

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
This is Gaoxue's brief introduction.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
The topic of our session today is

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
about Gaoxue's speech after her presentation.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
about Gaoxue's speech after her presentation.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
There will be Q&A at the end.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
But the Project Hera's mode is quite casual.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
So if you have any questions,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
you can just turn on your microphone and ask.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Or if you feel a little embarrassed,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
you can leave a comment in the chat.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Or you can also leave a comment

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
at the end of the Q&A.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
That's all for my introduction.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Gaoxue, it's your turn.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Gaoxue, it's your turn.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Thank you for your kind introduction.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Lin Gaoxue.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
My name is Lin Gaoxue.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm a Ph.D. student in the research lab of Parenthoven Research Lab.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Let me introduce our school first.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Our school's name in Chinese is the Parenthoven Research Lab.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Fifty years ago, there was a political dispute over the unification of Taiwan.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
In Belgium, this political dispute was led by the mother tongue.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
In Belgium, this political dispute was led by the mother tongue.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Fifty years ago, our Parenthoven Research Lab

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
was divided into two groups,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
which were the parents and native speakers.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
The first one was the first Parenthoben,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
which was more Spanish-speaking,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
while the other group was the second Parenthoven.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
We call it the Anthropology and Japanese Studies University.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
We are only different in terms of the knowledge,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
but our training is the Hangul and French.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
but our training is the Hangul and French.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
We are only different in terms of the knowledge,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
but our training is the Hangul and French.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
After introducing our school,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
let me introduce myself.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Thank you for the introduction.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I have been at the University of Taiwan

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
for 8 years.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
My major is Chemistry,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
and my minor is Psychology.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
My major is Psychology.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
In 2019,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I joined the University of Taiwan

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
to study for my Ph.D.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
My major is Psychology,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
and I joined the two subfields,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Culture and Health Psychology.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I used to be a full-time

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Chemistry teacher in Songshan High School,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
and now I am a full-time research assistant

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
in the Laboratory of Professor Cao Zheng-cao

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
at the Department of Communication and Technology

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
of the Department of Communication and Technology.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I am interested in the emotional experience

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
in my family,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
especially the influence of parents

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
in the social culture.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
The keywords of my research theme

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
include parenting stress, parental burnout,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
and emotional regulation

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
of how parents deal with their emotions related to stress.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I will use a physiological indicator

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
to measure the stress of a person.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I will use cultural perspective

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
or the network analysis commonly used in communication psychology

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
to care about the relationship between people

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
or the different phenomena in people's minds.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
At the beginning of the report,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I will introduce my field,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
the field of developmental psychology.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I refer to the introduction

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
made by my master's class teacher,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Prof. Lei Ganlin, in the online course of Coursera.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
From his point of view,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
before we get to know the development of psychology,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
we may need to understand what psychology is.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Psychology cares about the knowledge of people and minds.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
It also includes the field of experimental psychology.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
In this field,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
we may want to care about a person's cognitive,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
emotions, language,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
and even our intuition.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
We also include social and personality psychology.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
In this field, we care about a person's personality.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
We care about social psychology

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and the special cultural phenomenon

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
in a cultural community.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
We also care about the similarities and differences

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
between different cultures.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Of course, applied psychology is also a major field in psychology.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
For example, criminal psychology,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
which I mentioned before.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
It also includes the issues of clinical psychology

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
in the interaction between clinical psychologists and patients.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
In the field of education or organization,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
there are also many issues discussed in psychology.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Regardless of the field,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
we must accept the training provided by the following three sets of knowledge.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
The first is physiological psychology.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Regardless of which field we are,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
we must understand that there is a set of physiological mechanisms

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
behind everyone's behavior and cognition.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
In addition to this,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
when we measure the abstract phenomenon in psychology,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
we must be sure that the phenomenon we measure

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
is what we think in our mind.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
This approach is usually a psychometric method.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
The last is developmental psychology.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Developmental psychology provides us

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
with a holistic approach

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
that allows us to understand that each of us is developing over time.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
The current time will affect my current behavior,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
and the current time will affect my future time.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
So we are all evolving and developing

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
over a period of time.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
In this case, everyone will interact with their society,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
so they will play different roles.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
For example, you may play a student,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
you may play a partner, you may play a friend,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
or even a parent.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
The development of cognition,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
the development of language, the development of character,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
the development of emotion, and even the development of action

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
will be discussed in different topics.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
My research focuses on the relevant issues

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
when a person is a parent.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Parenting psychology

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
is a very popular research topic

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
in developmental psychology in the past.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Some researchers even believe that

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
the relevant life experience of parenting

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
is a very central aspect of our modern life.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
The reason why this experience

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
is so important is that

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
when we are middle-aged and become parents,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
we do a lot of things

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
that are driven by parenting.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Some researchers even believe

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
that parenting is a fundamental human need

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
or human motive.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Since parenting is such an important life experience,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
it is very complicated.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
If there are teachers or students

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
who are now parents,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
they will be very familiar with the following sentence.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Parenting is a very good experience.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Because of being parents, we have experienced a lot of things

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
and gained a sense of meaning.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
But at the same time,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
we also feel a lot of pressure because we are parents.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
In my master's class,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I especially focused on the general situation.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
When parents are taking care of their children,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
they feel the daily pressure to discuss.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
After I completed a theory model

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
for a master's thesis,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
like what I wrote on Facebook,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
maybe because I am a chemistry intern

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
who graduated from NTU,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
many parents came to me to discuss

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
the psychological development of their children.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
In fact,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
rather than discussing the development of their children with me,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I feel that these parents need an ear

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
to listen to their pain

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
in the past few years.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
For example,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
what they often say to me is,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Teacher, I really don't know what to do.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Can you help me? We are really helpless as parents.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
We are really tired.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
This is what a group of teenagers' parents told me.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
When they talk about this,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
they usually play along with their tears.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
In the course of the internship,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I often think about

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
whether my simple model

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
of daily stress relief

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
is suitable to explain

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
the intense depression

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
these parents feel.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
At this time,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
in 2019, I met my two bosses.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
They are recruiting PhD students

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
to discuss the extreme phenomenon

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
of parenting stress,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
so I went from NTU Psychology

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
to the University of Paris.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
In particular, I will further discuss

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
the topic of Parental Burnout in my PhD paper.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
This brings me to the main focus of my report today,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Parental Burnout.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
I will talk about this concept from a historical background.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I will also talk about how we define

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Parental Burnout from the perspective of psychology.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I will also ask a question,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
why is Parental Burnout so important?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
It must be because we consider its consequences.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Finally, we want to provide a method

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
to deal with Parental Burnout.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Before dealing with it,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
let's start with the concept of Parental Burnout.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
If you are a parent,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
you may have experienced the following experiences.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
If you are a psychologist,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
you may have heard of these experiences from your parents.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
These experiences are what we visit

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
those parents who have obviously been

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
traumatized by Parental Burnout.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
We ask them,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
what is Parental Burnout?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
They will tell you,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
this is a giant fatigue.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
They live every day,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
just trying to get by.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
They live like a robot,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
dealing with Parental Burnout every day.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Parental Burnout is like a mess.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Parental Burnout is like a mess.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Just trying to take care of their kids.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
But they found out that

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
it is hard to control their kids.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
They could not bear their kids.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
The most horrible thing is,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
they told us,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
if they could not imagine

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
that they could become a parent like that.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
These are what we visit

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
parents of parental burnout.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
When we asked them about their experience,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
they told us.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
This phenomenon was discovered by

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
a Russian researcher, Enika.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
She found out that

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
parents of children with brain hemorrhage

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
seem to have some asthmatic phenomenon.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Not only that,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
parents of children with chronic illness

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
also have this phenomenon.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
For example,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
parents of children with diabetes

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
also have this phenomenon.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
We found out that

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
parents of children with special needs

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
also have this phenomenon.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
My two instructors,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
we asked them further.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Is it possible that

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
this asthmatic phenomenon

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
not only occurs in families with special needs?

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Is it possible that

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
this phenomenon also occurs in ordinary families?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Why did they ask this question?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Mainly because they observed

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
a large-scale change in modern culture.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Whether it's official or

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
books in our rooms,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
we promoted a kind of

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
noble guide on education,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
namely positive parenting.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
We asked our parents to

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
adopt non-violent,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
loving, supportive, and sensitive

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
education to face our children.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
If you see this kind of

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
propaganda,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
you can see that

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
there is even a positive parenting tip

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
on CDD's website in the US.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
A book was also published in the EU

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
to talk about how parents can

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
teach their children.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
One of the ideas is positive parenting.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
In Taiwan,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
CDD has been promoting

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
positive parenting.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Another thing is that

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
parents' custody

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
is also under the control of the government.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
For example,

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
if our parents take a strict education,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
such as scolding or beating our children,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
our government may not be able to

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
teach our children well.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
In this case,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
our parents' rights are constantly being adjusted.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Children's rights are constantly increasing.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
The concept of positive parenting is that

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
we need to respect our children.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
In fact, our children

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
are increasingly disrespecting our parents.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
We also see that

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
our husbands are still maintaining their jobs.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Many women are

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
starting to work.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
A family becomes a double-minded family.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
However, there are still many problems with children.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
The time that parents can allocate to their children

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
is relatively compressed.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
When parents' resources are compressed,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
it is easier for them to feel

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
the pressure of raising their children.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Of course,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
women should not return to the family environment.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
The change in the economic environment

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
makes the time for the husband and wife

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
to take care of their children less and less.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Because of this environment,

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
two teachers asked

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
if it is possible to see

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
parental burnout in ordinary families.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
In recent cross-cultural research,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
it is estimated that

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
at least 5% of parents in the United States,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
more than 3.5 million parents,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
are suffering from parental burnout.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Parental burnout is a new prevailing psychological syndrome.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
In fact,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
in a well-known psychological science website,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
there are experts who are specifically introducing

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
what parental burnout is.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
In the New York Times and CNN Opinion,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
many reporters and food workers

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
are constantly advocating parental burnout

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
during the quarantine period.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
We should provide the first-hand help

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
to such a phenomenon.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
In 2017,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
researchers from more than 100 countries

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
around the world

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
organized an international consulting

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
to focus on

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
what parental burnout is.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
We pay special attention to whether parental burnout

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
appears not only in the United States and Europe,

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
but also in various cultures around the world.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Basically, every year,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
we hold a seminar to share

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
the recent research results of parental burnout.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Last year, we held the first seminar

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
to discuss the epidemic in Belgium.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
This year, we will hold the second conference

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
on parental burnout in Poland.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
However, due to the epidemic,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
we will postpone it until next year, 2021.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Welcome to our seminar.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Let's join us

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
to discuss the topic of parental burnout.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Let's go back to science.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
To discuss parental burnout,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
the first thing we need to do is to tell you

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
that the phenomenon we measure really exists.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
We use two ways to define parental burnout.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
In the past,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
there was a very well-developed concept,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
job burnout,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
which was discussed.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
We changed it into a way

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
suitable for parenting context

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
through a top-down approach

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
to define parental burnout.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
The second way is to interview

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
parents who are already

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
in the job market.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
This is a bottom-up approach

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
to define parental burnout.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
After two years of research and definition,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
we finally defined it as a psychological syndrome

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
with four major symptoms.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
The first symptom is that

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
you feel exhausted by your role as a parent.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
For example,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I am completely run down by my role as a parent.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
The second symptom is that

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
you feel the distance between you and your child.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
For example,

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
I do what I am supposed to do for my children,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
but nothing more.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I can't stand my role as a father

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
and mother anymore.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
The last symptom is

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
contrast with previous parental self.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
For example,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I don't think I am a good father and mother

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
like I used to be to my children.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
After defining the four major symptoms

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
of parental burnout

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
through psychological syndrome,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
the next question is

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
whether the concept of parental burnout

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
is a specific concept.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
In our recent research,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
we asked parents about their work burnout

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
and their parental burnout.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
We took their answers

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
and did a factor analysis.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
We found that

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
when we separate the two factors,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
parental burnout and work burnout,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
it is more suitable than

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
when we combine the two concepts

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
into one.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
From this result,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
we can see that

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
parental burnout has a variable effect.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
I hope that

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
the above introduction can convince you that

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
parental burnout really exists.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
It is a psychological concept

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
that can be measured

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
and has a professional definition.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
The next question is

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
if it really exists,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
is it really important?

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
If we want to consider whether it is important or not,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
we must consider its consequences.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
In the following session,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
in our early research,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
we found that parental burnout

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
can predict the idea of parents

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
avoiding and committing suicide

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
at the same time.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
We can imagine that

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
a parent who is under pressure

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
has two most common reactions.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
One is to avoid.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
However,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
parenting is completely different

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
from the work environment.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
If we feel tired at work,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
we can ask for sick leave,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
we can even resign.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
However, as parents,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
we can't ask for leave or resign.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
We are always the parents of the child.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
We can see that

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
parents have suicidal thoughts.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
In addition,

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
we can see that parents have drug addiction.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
If they have parental burnout,

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
we can imagine that

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
a person who wants to avoid these related things

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
may take drugs to avoid

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
and continue to think about these related issues.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
We can also see that

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
parents who are under parental burnout

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
can predict that

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
they will be violent to their children.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
We can also imagine that

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
when we are under pressure,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
in addition to avoiding,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
another way is to attack.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
We can see that

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
parents who are under parental burnout

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
are more likely to abuse their children.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
We can also see that

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
parents who are under parental burnout may ignore their children.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Finally, we can see that

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
parents who are under parental burnout

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
will be deeply affected

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
by the relationship between their husband and wife

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
when they are in a marital relationship.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
We can further discuss these consequences

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
for such issues.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
We need to make sure that

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
the consequences of parental burnout

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
occur after parental burnout.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
We need to make sure that

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
the consequences of parental burnout

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
occur after parental burnout.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
We use a research analysis method

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
to collect data for three times

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
at different time points across 5.5 months.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
to collect data for three times across 5.5 months across 5.5 months

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
to analyze whether our parental burnout

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
can predict the result of the next time point.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
For example,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
we can see that

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
ESCAPE IDIATION and PARENTAL NECKLACE

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
can be controlled

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Okay.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Thank you for your presentation.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I have a question.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
You mentioned that

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
PARENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
is a very important factor.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Do you find that

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
it has something to do with genetics?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Is it related to genes?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Or,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
in the future

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
when parents

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
get birthed in,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
there is also the risk of parental burnout?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Thank you.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
First of all,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
as far as I know,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
there are no proofs for THIS.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I have to admit that

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
the topic of parental burnout

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
is a new topic

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
in the last 5 years.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
So, I think,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
at least as far as my knowledge,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I haven't seen any discussion on the related genes.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
But I can see,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
for example, depression,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I can guess that

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
in the topic of parental burnout,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
or even in the topic of job burnout,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I am not familiar with the topic of job burnout.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But I think there are many genes

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
that play an important role.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
This is the first question.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
The second question is,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
can you repeat the second question?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
The first question is,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
can parents

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
get birthed in,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
there is also the risk of parental burnout?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Is there any similar phenomenon?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
OK.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
We are still in the process of research,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
so we don't know how the next generation

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
will raise their children.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
From the past research,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
we can see that

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
if the previous generation

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
took violent

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
or negative behavior,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
the next generation

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
will also take negative behavior.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
This is a vicious cycle.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
This is a very good question.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Maybe the parents

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
who are in parental burnout,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
their children

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
may continue to be in parental burnout.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But because our children have not grown up yet,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
we are not sure

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
if this phenomenon is possible.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But it is possible.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Thank you.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Let's see if there are any questions

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
from the audience.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Hello.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I have a question

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
about this paper.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
First of all, thank you for this presentation.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
My research is related to the role of parents.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
My group focuses on

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
the experience of parenting

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
, so there are many things to connect with.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I would like to ask about this paper.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
The author is Gao Xian.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
When he wrote this paper,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
he mentioned that

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
part of the parental psychological characteristics

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
for parents.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I would like to know

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
if this is a trend

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
or a goal standard

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
for parents.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I would like to know

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
if this is a trend

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
or a goal standard

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
for parents.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I would like to know

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
if this is a trend

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
or a goal standard

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
for parents.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I would like to know

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
if this is a trend

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
or a goal standard

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
for parents.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I would like to know

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
if this is a trend

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
or a goal standard

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
for parents.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I would like to know

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
if this is a trend

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
or a goal standard

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
for parents.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I would like to know

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
if this is a trend

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
or a goal standard

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
for parents.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
I would like to know

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
if this is a trend

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
or a goal standard

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
for parents.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I would like to know

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
if this is a trend

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
or a goal standard

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
for parents.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I would like to know

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
if this is a trend

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
or a goal standard

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
for parents.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I would like to know

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
if this is a trend

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
or a goal standard

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
for parents.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I would like to know

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
if this is a trend

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
or a goal standard

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
for parents.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I would like to know

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
if this is a trend

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
or a goal standard

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
for parents.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I would like to know

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
if this is a trend

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
or a goal standard

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000
for parents.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I would like to know

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
if this is a trend

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
or a goal standard

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
for parents.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I would like to know

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
if this is a trend

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
or a goal standard

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
for parents.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I would like to know

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
if this is a trend

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
or a goal standard

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
for parents.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I am a researcher

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000
and I immigrated to the US.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
I was originally from Taiwan,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Hong Kong, and the US.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I decided to move to the US

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
because I have a child with a mental disability.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I decided to move to the US

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
because I have a child with a mental disability.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I decided to move to the US

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
because my assumption was that

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
parents were expecting their children

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
to be a good parent.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
to be a good parent.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It was hard for them

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
to agree on their goals

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
when they were raised in a Chinese society.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
It was hard for them to agree on their goals

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
when they were raised in a Chinese society.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I assumed that

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
they would feel more pressure

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
to adjust their education

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
to fit the mainstream American culture.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I asked them similar questions.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I asked them similar questions.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
What do you think is a good parent

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
in your original culture?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
What do you think is a good parent

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
in your original culture?

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
What do you think is a good parent

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
in your original culture?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I am a family member with a mental disability.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I am a family member with a mental disability.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
In my culture,

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
the acceptance of parents

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
in this country is much higher.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
In my culture,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
parents respect their children

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
and how they raise their children.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Even if a child has an emotional breakdown,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
the society has a high tolerance for such a situation.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
The society has a high tolerance for such a situation.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
The pressure of raising a child with a mental disability

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
is much lower than in their original country.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
This cross-culture does not cause too much pressure on them.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
However, my research is a culture change.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
The current research is a culture change.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
It is not the same as the research that you are doing in your country.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
It is not the same as the research that you are doing in your country.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
This research is very interesting.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I want to share it with you.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Have you read a 2014 article by Charlie Sum Chu

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Have you read a 2014 article by Charlie Sum Chu

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
about Thai parenting?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
He is specializing in Chinese families

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
In the United States.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
He mentioned that

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Chinese parents

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
are proud of their children

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
but also make sure their children

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
are educated like the world requires.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
In addition to this,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
they also want their children

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
to stay in the family

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
and feel their values in China.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
They might even be strengthened.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I remember...

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Is it Kangyi?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I'm afraid I said it wrong.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I think it's Kangyi.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
They might strengthen

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
their original culture

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
in the immigrant family.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
That's what I remember.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I wouldn't be surprised

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
if that's the case.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Indeed,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
my research focuses on

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
disability.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I can only look at

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
the intersectionality

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000
between disability, culture, and parenting.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
It's very different

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
from just looking at the family.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I can only say that

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
having a family

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
with different characteristics

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
from other families

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
does affect the whole relationship.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I think

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I can do more research on this

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
in the future.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I don't know how to

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
take this into consideration.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It's just my opinion.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
You mentioned the education culture

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
of special families.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I think it's very interesting.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
You mentioned

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
the intersectionality

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
between special families

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and education culture.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
It's very interesting.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Thank you.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I'm looking forward to your paper.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Or any...

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Any publication.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I'm looking forward to your paper.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
My first paper

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
is on meta-synthesis.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
It's like a meta-analysis

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
of a qualitative model.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
This paper has been published.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I'll link it to you later.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
It's more of a literature review.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
It talks about the intersectionality

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
between parents.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
We generally talk about the role of parents.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
But there are many aspects

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
under the role of parents.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
They may just provide

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
the care of everyday life.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Or they may play

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
the role of

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
family financial support.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
At the same time,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
there are many other aspects

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
under the umbrella term

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
of parents.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
So my first paper

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
is about this.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
My second paper

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
is purely on qualitative research.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It hasn't been published yet.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I hope I can finish it this year.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I see.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I hope you can finish it soon.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I can't wait to see your paper.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I'm looking forward to

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
your comment.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Your first paper.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Okay.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I'll look for it.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Yiting is posting

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
her paper link

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
in the chat.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I'm quite happy

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
that today's discussion

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
is very heated.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I think it's as exciting

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
as the speech itself.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Due to time constraints,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I'd like to ask

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
whether you have

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
any last words

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
or take home message

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
for the audience

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
or future audience

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
who can listen to

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
the speech

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
on Project Taira.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Parental balance is a very important issue.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
We think it's a very important issue.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
There are many social cultures

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
and personal factors

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
that play an important role.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
As I said in the final remark,

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
we hope to rebalance

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
the entire research.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
In the past,

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
we only cared about the child's

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
positive development.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
We also hope that

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
we can care more about

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
the health of parents themselves

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
in the future research.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
We hope that

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
we can contribute

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
more to the research.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
That's all.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Thank you, Annie.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Thank you, Kaohsiung.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I think Kaohsiung's speech

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
is very useful

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
for parents

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
in Taiwan

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
who are struggling

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
to raise their children.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Thank you

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
for your participation.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I know Kaohsiung's video

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
is very interesting

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
and has references.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Today's speech

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
will be posted

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
on Project Taira's website.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
If you want to review

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
or recommend it to your friends,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
you can search

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
on Project Taira's website.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Good night to everyone

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
in Taiwan.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Have a wonderful Saturday

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
in Europe or America.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
That's all for today's speech.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I will leave

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
the chat

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
for a few more minutes

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
so you can

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
take a look at the chat.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I will also

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
download it.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Thank you, Kaohsiung.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Thank you.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
We have to turn off the recording.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Okay.
