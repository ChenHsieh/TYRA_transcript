1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes, okay.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to the first lecture after the New Year.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm glad to have Sui-An here today

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to share with us about psychology and law.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Law? I don't think so.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The application of psychology in law

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the development of it.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Before we talk about the topic,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
let's introduce our speaker today.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Sui-An is a law major in NTU.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
She studied law in NTU.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then she became a lawyer.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
She did well in the exam.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In the process,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
she participated in many research and activities in psychology.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
After graduating from law school,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
she interned in a law firm

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and later became a professional lawyer.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She also studied psychology in NTU.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In the field of law,

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
she majored in the case of death

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and the defense lawyer.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's her major.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In the field of psychology,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
she did a combination of law and psychology.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She studied the testimony of children

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in the court.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How to do it accurately and accurately.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
After graduating from law school,

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
she went to Cornell

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to continue her research.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Her research is about

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
cognitive psychology,

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
psychological development,

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and the combination of law.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We can hear more details today.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sui-An will share the details with you.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Finally, I will share a fun fact with you.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sui-An,

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
besides...

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Did I tell you I wanted to say this?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't think I did.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sui-An,

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
besides her extensive academic background,

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
she is interested in drama performance.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She is also passionate about it.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In my previous research,

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I majored in social psychology.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In my previous research,

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I needed an actor to play the victim.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I asked Sui-An to help me.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She is a professional actor.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Without further ado,

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
let's give the stage to Sui-An.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let me give her a round of applause.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you, Yen-Ping.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I feel a little shy.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Before we start,

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
let me give you a warning.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is my first time

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
giving a live talk on the internet.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000


63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is my first time

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
giving a live talk on the internet.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm a little nervous.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Please bear with me if I make any mistakes.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Please bear with me if I make any mistakes.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to say that

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the audience today

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
may be from different fields.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to say that

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
after the talk,

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
if you are interested in this field,

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you can read a book

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
or watch a TED talk on the internet.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This talk will be divided into four parts.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This talk will be divided into four parts.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In the first part,

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I will briefly introduce my background

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and what is my relationship with this field.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will also mention my relationship with Yen-Ping.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She is a great benefactor in my life.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She is a great benefactor in my life.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
In the second part,

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will talk about the research topics

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
in the field of law and psychology.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In the second part,

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I will talk about the research topics

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
in the field of law and psychology.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The last part is about my own research.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The last part is about my own research.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The last part is about my own research.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Sorry, I made a mistake.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I forgot to mention some housekeeping.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I forgot to mention some housekeeping.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yen-Ping will talk to her PowerPoint.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yen-Ping will talk to her PowerPoint.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She may not see

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
what you are talking about in the chat window.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you have any questions,

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you can leave a comment in the chat window.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will read it for Yen-Ping.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yen-Ping will find time

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
to answer the questions in the chat window.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to answer the questions in the chat window.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to answer the questions in the chat window.

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thank you.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Today's topic is

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How can science help

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
establish a better legal system?

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can see three pictures here.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The left one

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
shows that although the legal world

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
is thought to be a humanistic

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
or socially scientific field,

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the right one, the picture of DNA,

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
can help us

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
establish a better legal system.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The middle picture

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
is a classic

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
picture of legal psychology.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is also a symbol of

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
American legal psychology.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It will also appear later.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It shows that psychology is a field

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that studies human behavior.

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that studies human behavior.

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It shows that psychology is a field

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that studies human behavior.

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The picture on the bottom right

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
is a picture of the brain.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There are many researchers

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
in the field of neuroscience.

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They are thinking about

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
how to help us

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
establish a better legal system

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
through their research.

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I am Suyi An.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I am Suyi An.

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I am a doctoral student

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
at Cornell University

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Human Ecology

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and Human Development.

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Cornell University

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
has two different

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
fields of study

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
related to psychology.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
One is psychology,

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the other is human development.

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I am in the field of human development.

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There are three fields of study

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
related to human development.

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I am in the field of

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
legal psychology and human development.

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I am in the field of

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
children, witnesses,

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and cognitive research.

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
As Suyi An said,

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I graduated from

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the Faculty of Finance and Law

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
at Cornell University.

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
During my time at the Faculty of Law,

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I worked as a research assistant

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
in two different

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
fields of psychology.

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I worked as a research assistant

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
in two different

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
fields of psychology.

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
At first, I wanted to study

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
legal psychology

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
because I thought

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
since it is related to human development,

175
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
it should be related to human behavior.

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I have been interested in psychology.

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
One day,

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I was wondering

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
how I could get a chance

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to study psychology.

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
At that time,

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Professor Zhang Yanping

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
asked me to work as a research assistant.

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I accepted his offer

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and he took me in.

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have been studying psychology

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
with Professor Zhang Yanping.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
At first,

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was working in

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a social psychology lab

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
with Professor Lin Yizheng.

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I was doing research

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
related to social psychology.

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In my senior year,

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Professor Zhao Yishan

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
was a vice-professor

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
at NTU.

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He was a psychologist

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
who graduated from

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jianqiao University.

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He was also a child witness.

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I was interested in this field.

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
At that time,

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Professor Lin Yizheng was about to retire.

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I started doing research

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
related to child witnesses with Professor Zhao Yishan.

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
During my senior year,

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I studied psychology

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
with Professor Zhao Yishan.

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have listed two pictures here.

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
NTU has developed

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
a new cross-field course

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
for legal psychology.

214
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There are four professors

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
in three different fields,

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
legal psychology,

217
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
data science,

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and information science.

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm not sure

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
if this course will be online.

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
However,

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
cross-field students

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
are becoming more and more

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
popular in Taiwan.

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Here are some

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
researches I did

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
when I was in Taiwan.

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The first one

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
was with Professor Zhang Yanping,

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
who is now a doctor,

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
during Professor Lin Yizheng's

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
research period.

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The second one

234
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
was with Professor Zhao Yishan

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
during his research period.

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We did a study on

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
child witnesses.

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The study

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
was mainly

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
about

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
how witnesses

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
would react

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to a crime

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
in a different place

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
after witnessing

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
a crime.

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The last one

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
was a study on children

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
in my master's thesis.

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We wanted to see

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
if there were

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
many cases

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
related to child custody.

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
In those cases,

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the legal terms

256
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
were quite complicated.

257
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We also wanted to know

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
if there were any cases

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
related to divorce.

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We wanted to know

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
if children could understand

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the legal terms

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
related to child custody

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and if they could

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
imagine what it means

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
to be divorced.

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Something like that.

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The second study

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
was with

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Professor Zhong Chengyu.

271
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He is currently

272
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
working at the Chinese Academy of Law.

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He is also our guest today.

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
After I graduated

275
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
from NTU Law School,

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I worked as a lawyer

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
for a period of time.

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I mainly worked

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
at an international law firm.

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The lawyer I worked with

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
was Mr. Huang Zhihao.

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mr. Huang's specialty

283
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
was psychology

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and law.

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He helped Taiwan

286
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
with many cases

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
related to child custody.

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The so-called

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
case related to child custody

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
could be

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
a crime

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
related to

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
a crime

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that could be

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
sentenced to death.

296
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We called it

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
a crime related to

298
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
a crime

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that could be

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
sentenced to death.

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Mr. Huang's specialty

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
was psychology

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and law.

304
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He helped Taiwan

305
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
with many cases

306
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
related to child custody.

307
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If you are interested

308
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
in working as a lawyer

309
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
for a crime related to

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
child custody,

311
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you may be interested

312
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
in the concept of

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
judicial psychology.

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
For example,

315
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
when we come across

316
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
cases related to death

317
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
or cases related to

318
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
child custody,

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
we often see

320
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the words

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
in red.

322
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
For example,

323
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
the evidence in the case

324
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
could be

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
related to

326
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Taiwan's

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Child Custody Rehabilitation

328
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Association.

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Many cases

330
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
are

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
based on

332
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
scientific evidence.

333
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We need to

334
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
examine

335
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
whether the scientific evidence

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
in the case

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
is reliable

338
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and what is the

339
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
evidence

340
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
that can be

341
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
re-examined.

342
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In Taiwan,

343
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
we often see

344
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
cases related to

345
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
interrogation

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
or the

347
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
possibility of

348
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
further testing.

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We also need to

350
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
examine

351
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
whether the

352
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
evidence in the case

353
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is reliable

354
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and what is

355
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
the evidence

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that can be

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
re-examined.

358
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We also need to

359
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
examine

360
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
whether the

361
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
evidence in the case

362
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
is reliable

363
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and what is

364
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the evidence

365
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that can be

366
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
re-examined.

367
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We also need to

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
examine

369
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
whether the

370
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
evidence in the case

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
is reliable

372
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and what is

373
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the evidence

374
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
that can be

375
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
re-examined.

376
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We also need to

377
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
examine

378
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
whether the

379
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
evidence in the case

380
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
is reliable

381
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and what is

382
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the evidence

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
that can be

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
re-examined.

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We also need to

386
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
examine

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
whether the

388
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
evidence in the case

389
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
is reliable

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and what is

391
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the evidence

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
that can be

393
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000

re-examined.

805
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
We also need to examine

806
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
whether the

807
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
evidence in the case

808
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000

861
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
We also need to examine

885
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We also need to examine

886
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
whether the

re-examined.

893
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We also need to examine

894
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
whether the

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000

re-examined.

901
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We also need to examine

902
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
whether the

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000

that can be

908
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
re-examined.

909
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We also need to examine

910
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
whether the

911
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
evidence in the case

912
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
is reliable

913
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and what is

914
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
the evidence

915
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that can be

916
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
re-examined.

917
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We also need to examine

918
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
whether the

919
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
evidence in the case

920
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
is reliable

921
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and what is

922
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
the evidence

923
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that can be

924
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
re-examined.

925
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'd like to share

926
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
a documentary I watched a while ago.

927
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's about

928
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
a country in Africa

929
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
whose name I don't remember.

930
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
In their

931
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
modern

932
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
judicial system,

933
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
a part of it

934
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
is about

935
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
how to control

936
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
their maids.

937
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Because the maids fly away,

938
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
they need chains to

939
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
control their

940
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
maids.

941
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
They will be punished

942
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
if they

943
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
join a national

944
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
ceremony.

945
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
They even formalize

946
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
the existence of maids

947
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and write it in their laws.

948
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
This is still a thing

949
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
in the modern world.

950
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Wow, that's amazing.

951
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Thank you for your complement.

952
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's a scary story.

953
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Let's move on.

954
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
In fact,

955
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
the reason why

956
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
many maids

957
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
were found guilty

958
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
was because of their children's testimony.

959
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's interesting that

960
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
some books

961
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
say that after the children grew up,

962
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
they regretted

963
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
not seeing

964
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
what the maids

965
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
were doing.

966
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Maybe they were

967
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
afraid of the adults

968
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
or other factors.

969
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That's why they said those words.

970
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
They were doubtful.

971
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In other words,

972
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
did the children lie

973
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
or did they

974
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
believe what they said?

975
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Because of

976
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
external or internal reasons,

977
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
they

978
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
might not

979
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
believe

980
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
what they said.

981
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
They might not believe

982
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
everything they said.

983
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's interesting.

984
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
In the early 20th century,

985
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
the earliest research

986
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
came from Alfred Binet.

987
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
If you're a psychologist,

988
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you might know him.

989
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
He was one of the

990
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
most important

991
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
researchers and

992
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
inventors

993
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
of modern IQ tests.

994
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
He had a legal background.

995
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Although his research

996
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
was based on IQ tests,

997
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
according to

998
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
our Tibetan teachers,

999
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
his research

1000
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
was based on

1001
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
the credibility of testimony.

1002
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He published

1003
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
a book in 1901.

1004
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
He said that

1005
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
through his research,

1006
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
he thought that

1007
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the credibility of testimony

1008
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
of men and women

1009
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
was based on

1010
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
the ability of human

1011
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
to react to

1012
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
the information

1013
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
they received

1014
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
from others

1015
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and

1016
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
the ability

1017
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
to

1018
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
resist.

1019
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
He was very interested in this.

1020
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
From 1901

1021
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
to

1022
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
1960 and

1023
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
1970,

1024
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
no one paid attention to this.

1025
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
In the 1960s and 1970s,

1026
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
children's testimony

1027
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
became a hot topic.

1028
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
As women

1029
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and children

1030
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
started to

1031
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
pay attention to

1032
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
children's rights,

1033
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
many people started to

1034
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
pay attention to

1035
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
children's rights

1036
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
in kindergartens,

1037
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and there were many cases

1038
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
about

1039
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
inappropriate contact

1040
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
with their family members.

1041
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Under these circumstances,

1042
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
the law and cases

1043
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
changed the situation

1044
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
so that most of the children

1045
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
could not testify in court.

1046
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Suddenly, the condition

1047
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
for children's testimony

1048
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
to testify in court

1049
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and the age

1050
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
for children to testify in court

1051
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
led to many children's

1052
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
testimonies

1053
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
in court.

1054
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The judge didn't know

1055
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
how to deal with it,

1056
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and the psychologist

1057
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
didn't know what to do.

1058
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
My teacher

1059
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
was an expert

1060
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
who studied

1061
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
children's intelligence

1062
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and memory.

1063
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
He was an expert

1064
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
in pure academic theory.

1065
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
He found that

1066
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
a boy

1067
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
was involved in a murder case.

1068
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The father

1069
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
seemed to have hit his mother

1070
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
with a stick.

1071
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
He asked the boy

1072
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
if he had seen

1073
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
his mother

1074
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
being dragged

1075
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
to the back door

1076
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
after the argument.

1077
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
The judge wanted to know

1078
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
if the child's testimony

1079
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
was credible,

1080
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
because it was related

1081
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to the father's crime.

1082
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
My teacher thought

1083
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
that as a well-known

1084
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
child memory expert,

1085
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
he couldn't answer the question.

1086
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So he gathered

1087
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
about 30 experts

1088
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
from the U.S.

1089
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
to hold a meeting

1090
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
in Cornell.

1091
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The purpose of the meeting

1092
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
was to discuss

1093
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
how to transfer

1094
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
psychological knowledge

1095
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
related to children

1096
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
to the court

1097
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and make it

1098
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
a practical knowledge.

1099
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So the experts

1100
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
held a three-day meeting

1101
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
in Cornell,

1102
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and came up with

1103
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
a white paper

1104
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
that slowly influenced

1105
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
the combination

1106
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
of psychology and law.

1107
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
In the 1980s,

1108
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
there was a famous case

1109
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
called Mark Martin's

1110
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Family Trials.

1111
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It was about a kindergarten

1112
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
run by a family.

1113
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Suddenly,

1114
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
dozens of children

1115
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
claimed to have

1116
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
been sexually harassed

1117
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
or sexually harassed

1118
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
by various members

1119
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
of the family

1120
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
with different objects

1121
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
of interest.

1122
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Most of the charges

1123
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
were revoked

1124
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
or turned into

1125
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
conjury.

1126
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The reason was

1127
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
that the child testimony

1128
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
in the case

1129
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
seemed to be

1130
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
impossible to find physical evidence.

1131
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Many experts

1132
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
used psychological research

1133
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
to help determine

1134
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
whether the child testimony

1135
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
was true or not.

1136
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
There's a documentary

1137
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
about the case

1138
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
that you can check out.

1139
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Mark Martin

1140
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
published a book

1141
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
in 1995.

1142
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
After the meeting

1143
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
in Cornell,

1144
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
he began to receive

1145
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
many letters

1146
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
from lawyers

1147
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
asking him

1148
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
if he wanted to be

1149
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
a part of the case.

1150
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The lawyer said

1151
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
he didn't mind

1152
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
as long as

1153
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
the child testimony

1154
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
was easy to understand.

1155
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You can check out

1156
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
the documentary

1157
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
online.

1158
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The documentary

1159
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
is about

1160
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
how psychological research

1161
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
can be applied

1162
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
to children.

1163
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Any questions?

1164
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Let's move on.

1165
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
The child testimony

1166
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
is about

1167
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
a man who

1168
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
is a good man

1169
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
but a very careless man.

1170
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It's a pre-testimony.

1171
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
There may be

1172
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
some guidance issues.

1173
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The child testimony

1174
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
is about

1175
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
a man who

1176
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
is a good man

1177
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
but a very careless man.

1178
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The child testimony

1179
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
is about

1180
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
a man who

1181
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
is a good man

1182
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
but a very careless man.

1183
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The child testimony

1184
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
is about

1185
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
a man who

1186
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
is a good man

1187
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
but a very careless man.

1188
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The child testimony

1189
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
includes

1190
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
many additional

1191
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
evidence

1192
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
that may

1193
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
have to do with

1194
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
law and psychology,

1195
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
including how

1196
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
electric vehicles

1197
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
can be applied to

1198
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
law,

1199
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and when children

1200
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
develop the ability to

1201
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
lie.

1202
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
In some specific crimes,

1203
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
judges and judges

1204
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
may have different

1205
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
sympathies

1206
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
for different

1207
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
cultures,

1208
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
social status,

1209
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and different

1210
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
ways of

1211
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
raising children,

1212
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
so we are

1213
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
currently doing

1214
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
a research

1215
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
to explore

1216
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
the different

1217
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
aspects of

1218
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
the child testimony.

1219
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We hope

1220
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
this research

1221
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
can help

1222
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
you understand

1223
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
the different

1224
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
aspects of

1225
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
the child testimony.

1226
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I am also

1227
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
working with

1228
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Charles Brenner

1229
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
on a research

1230
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
called Fuzzy Trace Theory.

1231
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Fuzzy Trace Theory

1232
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
is a method of

1233
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
memorization

1234
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
in which

1235
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
we try to

1236
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
visualize

1237
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
the memory

1238
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
of the victim

1239
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
in a specific way.

1240
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
For example,

1241
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
we try to

1242
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
visualize

1243
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
the victim

1244
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
on the African

1245
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
prairie,

1246
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and see if this

1247
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
special way

1248
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
can enhance

1249
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
the memory

1250
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
of the victim.

1251
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I am also

1252
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
working with

1253
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
a professor

1254
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
in the Department of

1255
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Law on

1256
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
whether

1257
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
most states

1258
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
in the U.S.

1259
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
are able to

1260
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
evaluate the

1261
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
ability of

1262
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
this method

1263
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
of memorization

1264
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
in the U.S.

1265
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I am also

1266
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
working with

1267
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Cornell

1268
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
on a research

1269
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
called

1270
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
World Anti-Torture Center.

1271
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
We are also

1272
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
working on

1273
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
a book

1274
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
on the

1275
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
possibility

1276
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
of

1277
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
taking home

1278
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
the message

1279
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that if you are

1280
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
interested in

1281
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
law and psychology,

1282
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
you should

1283
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
go to the

1284
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
American Psychological Society

1285
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
to learn more about

1286
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
law and psychology.

1287
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
In Europe,

1288
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
there is a

1289
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
law and psychology

1290
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
association

1291
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
called

1292
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
the American Psychological Society.

1293
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I think

1294
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
it is a great resource

1295
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
for people

1296
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
who want to

1297
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
study abroad.

1298
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
This book is

1299
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
written by

1300
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Elizabeth Loftus,

1301
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
an expert on

1302
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the study of

1303
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
memory.

1304
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It is a

1305
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
great resource

1306
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
for people

1307
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
who want to

1308
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
learn more about

1309
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
law and

1310
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
psychology.

1311
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That's all

1312
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
for today.

1313
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
If you have

1314
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
any questions,

1315
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
please feel free

1316
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
to ask.

1317
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Before we

1318
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
start,

1319
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I would like to

1320
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
ask you

1321
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
a question.

1322
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You can turn on

1323
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
the microphone

1324
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
or leave a comment

1325
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and I will ask.

1326
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
How to turn on

1327
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
the microphone?

1328
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Go to

1329
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Blue Dream

1330
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and you will

1331
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
find a

1332
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
picture of

1333
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Blue Dream.

1334
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Click on it and

1335
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
you can talk.

1336
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Please go ahead.

1337
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's okay.

1338
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I just have a question.

1339
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
No, I mean

1340
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
you can ask now.

1341
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Okay.

1342
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Do I need to introduce myself?

1343
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Sure.

1344
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I am

1345
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Feng Mengzhang,

1346
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
and I am studying social science.

1347
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Hi.

1348
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Hi.

1349
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So

1350
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I was thinking

1351
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
about the issue of

1352
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
the gap between

1353
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
children's

1354
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
testimony and

1355
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
objective situation.

1356
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I am curious

1357
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
about

1358
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
how to

1359
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
distinguish

1360
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
the gap

1361
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
between

1362
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
the children's testimony

1363
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and the objective situation.

1364
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Is it the memory

1365
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
or the memory

1366
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
that is affected

1367
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
or the expression

1368
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
that is affected?

1369
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
For example,

1370
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
the stereotype

1371
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
that the person

1372
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
was affected

1373
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
by the stereotype.

1374
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
The description

1375
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
of the stereotype

1376
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
is the difference

1377
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
between the control group

1378
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and the treatment group.

1379
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
One possibility is

1380
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
that the stereotype

1381
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
may cause

1382
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
some mistakes

1383
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
in the process

1384
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
of memory

1385
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
or memory.

1386
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Another possibility

1387
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
is that

1388
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
the stereotype

1389
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
may cause

1390
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
some mistakes

1391
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
in the process

1392
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
of memory

1393
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
or memory.

1394
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Another possibility

1395
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
is that

1396
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
the stereotype

1397
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
may cause

1398
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
some mistakes

1399
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
in the process

1400
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
of memory

1401
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
or memory.

1402
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Another possibility

1403
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
is that

1404
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
the stereotype

1405
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
may cause

1406
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
some mistakes

1407
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
in the process

1408
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
of memory

1409
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
or memory.

1410
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Another possibility

1411
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
is that

1412
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
the stereotype

1413
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
may cause

1414
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
some mistakes

1415
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
in the process

1416
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
of memory

1417
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
or memory.

1418
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Another possibility

1419
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
is that

1420
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
the stereotype

1421
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
may cause

1422
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
some mistakes

1423
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
in the process

1424
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
of memory

1425
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
or memory.

1426
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Another possibility

1427
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
is that

1428
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
the stereotype

1429
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
may cause

1430
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
some mistakes

1431
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
in the process

1432
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
of memory

1433
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
or memory.

1434
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
In fact,

1435
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
there is no way

1436
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
to distinguish

1437
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
the information

1438
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
given by

1439
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
the person

1440
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and how he or she

1441
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
remembers it.

1442
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
In fact,

1443
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
there is no way

1444
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
to distinguish

1445
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
the information

1446
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
given by

1447
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
the person

1448
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and how he or she

1449
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
remembers it.

1450
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
In fact,

1451
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
there is no way

1452
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
to distinguish

1453
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
the information

1454
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
given by

1455
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
the person

1456
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and how he or she

1457
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
remembers it.

1458
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
In fact,

1459
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
there is no way

1460
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
to distinguish

1461
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
the information

1462
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
given by

1463
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
the person

1464
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and how he or she

1465
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
remembers it.

1466
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
In fact,

1467
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
there is no way

1468
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
to distinguish

1469
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
the information

1470
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
given by

1471
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
the person

1472
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
and how he or she

1473
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
remembers it.

1474
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
There is another

1475
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
big question.

1476
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I majored in

1477
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
economics,

1478
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
so I will

1479
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
think about

1480
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
what is

1481
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
the cause and effect

1482
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
of human behavior.

1483
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Back to the question

1484
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
of children's

1485
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
testimony,

1486
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I was thinking

1487
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
about the cause

1488
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
and effect of

1489
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
children's testimony

1490
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
in court.

1491
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I can imagine

1492
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
the cause and effect

1493
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
of children's testimony

1494
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
in court.

1495
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
For example,

1496
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
adults know that

1497
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
there will be legal responsibility

1498
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
if they testify,

1499
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
but children

1500
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
may not understand

1501
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
the legal effect

1502
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
behind the behavior.

1503
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
For example,

1504
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the prosecutor may like

1505
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
the father or mother

1506
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
and want to tell

1507
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
the good words

1508
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
to the one he likes.

1509
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
The prosecutor may

1510
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
want to please the authority

1511
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
and obey the authority.

1512
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
If there is a big difference

1513
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
between the cause and effect

1514
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
of children's testimony

1515
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and adults' testimony,

1516
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
there may be

1517
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
different contents.

1518
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I was wondering

1519
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
if anyone has

1520
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
analyzed this issue.

1521
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yes,

1522
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I have seen

1523
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
a lot of research.

1524
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You just mentioned

1525
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
a lot of things.

1526
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
For example,

1527
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
some of the research

1528
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
has been converted

1529
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
into a method

1530
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
to interrogate children.

1531
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
The first method

1532
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
is not to promise

1533
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
the child

1534
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
good or bad answers

1535
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
or what kind of actions

1536
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
the child will take.

1537
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
For example,

1538
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
if the police take the child

1539
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
to McDonald's,

1540
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
the child will not

1541
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
be attracted to McDonald's.

1542
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
The second method

1543
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
is not to promise

1544
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
the child good or bad answers

1545
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
or what kind of actions

1546
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
the child will take.

1547
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
The third method

1548
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
is to give the child

1549
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
a chance to

1550
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
choose the right answer.

1551
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
For example,

1552
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
most of the research

1553
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
in Europe and America

1554
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
does not recommend

1555
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
the use of a telegram doll.

1556
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Telegram dolls

1557
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
are very interesting

1558
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
to most children.

1559
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
If you tell the child

1560
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
to do certain things

1561
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
with the doll

1562
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and not to do

1563
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
certain things with the doll,

1564
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
it will affect

1565
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
the child.

1566
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
In this process,

1567
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
if you tell the child

1568
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
to do certain things

1569
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
or not to do certain things,

1570
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
it will affect the child.

1571
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
We are working on

1572
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
how to maintain

1573
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
the focus of the child

1574
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
in the process of

1575
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
asking questions to children,

1576
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
but not to give the child

1577
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
too many external questions.

1578
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Many people are studying this.

1579
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I think this question

1580
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
is professional and good.

1581
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Thank you.

1582
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You just answered

1583
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
the questions I wanted to ask.

1584
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
The next question I want to ask

1585
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
is from

1586
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
someone else.

1587
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Thank you.

1588
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Let me guess.

1589
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I used to work

1590
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
at the Family Violence

1591
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and Sexual Assault Prevention Center

1592
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
about six or seven years ago.

1593
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You just said

1594
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
that telegram dolls are not recommended.

1595
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
We use a lot of them.

1596
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We try to

1597
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
at least

1598
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
use them

1599
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
if there are

1600
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
research papers.

1601
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
If you really

1602
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
have to use a tool,

1603
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
telegram dolls

1604
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
are the last step.

1605
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
They are too easy to use

1606
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
because they have holes.

1607
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Children

1608
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
may want to

1609
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
insert different

1610
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
body parts or objects

1611
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
in order to

1612
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
interpret the behavior.

1613
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So,

1614
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
a better way

1615
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
is to use a time line

1616
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
or a pen

1617
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
to

1618
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
telegram the child.

1619
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Or,

1620
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
if you really need

1621
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to point out a specific part,

1622
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
telegram dolls

1623
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
are less likely

1624
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
to have body parts.

1625
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So,

1626
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
if you have

1627
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
DNA evidence,

1628
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
children

1629
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
are likely to be

1630
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
sexually assaulted.

1631
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
So,

1632
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I don't recommend using them.

1633
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Okay.

1634
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Next,

1635
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
let me see his name.

1636
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Is his name

1637
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Mingxin?

1638
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Hi, everyone.

1639
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Thank you.

1640
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Can you hear me?

1641
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yes.

1642
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Hi,

1643
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I'm Mingxin Zhu.

1644
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm a doctoral student

1645
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
at Northwestern University.

1646
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Yiyan is my classmate

1647
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
in the Department of Law.

1648
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Thank you, Yiyan.

1649
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I have two questions.

1650
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
The first question is

1651
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
when a child

1652
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
gives his testimony,

1653
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
the job of a lawyer

1654
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
is to

1655
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
incorporate his testimony

1656
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
into the law.

1657
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So,

1658
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
from a psychologist's point of view,

1659
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
if you find that

1660
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the testimony is likely to be contaminated,

1661
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
or if the contamination

1662
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
is significant,

1663
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
if the contamination is light,

1664
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
is it possible

1665
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
to correct it

1666
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
or give it

1667
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
a different weight

1668
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
instead of throwing away

1669
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
the entire testimony?

1670
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Is there a difference in the amount

1671
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
rather than just having it or not?

1672
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
That's my first question.

1673
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
What about the second question?

1674
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Have I finished my question?

1675
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Okay,

1676
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
let's start with the first one.

1677
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
You asked about the evidence

1678
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and the evidence.

1679
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
From a psychologist's point of view,

1680
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
do you only discuss

1681
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
the evidence and not the evidence?

1682
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
In fact,

1683
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
most people

1684
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
in this field

1685
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
are still trained

1686
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
in psychology,

1687
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
so they don't think

1688
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
much about how

1689
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
a lawyer or a prosecutor

1690
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
or an attorney

1691
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
should use the evidence.

1692
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
For example,

1693
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
let's say that

1694
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
this case has repeated interrogation.

1695
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
The contamination

1696
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
may not have been discovered at the beginning,

1697
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
but it was discovered later.

1698
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Of course, you can ask an expert

1699
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
to verify that

1700
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
in the first two interrogations,

1701
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
there was no inducement

1702
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
or contamination.

1703
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
In the first two interrogations,

1704
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
what was provided?

1705
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
In the third interrogation,

1706
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
there may be some external

1707
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
inducement or

1708
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
inappropriate reasons,

1709
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
so the child's testimony

1710
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
may have been contaminated

1711
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
or even changed.

1712
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
In fact,

1713
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
it can be used in the first two interrogations.

1714
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Psychologists may evaluate

1715
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
the possibility of

1716
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
external contamination

1717
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
in each interrogation.

1718
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
As for

1719
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
how lawyers

1720
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
use scientific reports,

1721
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I think it's more like

1722
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
a lawyer's strategy.

1723
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
As far as I know,

1724
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
ordinary children's legal psychologists

1725
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
don't interfere

1726
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
with how lawyers

1727
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
use scientific reports.

1728
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
On the one hand, it's not suitable

1729
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
because it's a legal profession.

1730
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Ordinary children's legal psychologists

1731
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
don't understand this profession,

1732
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
so they provide

1733
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
very pure scientific analysis reports.

1734
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
This is what I know

1735
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
from my experience.

1736
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I mean,

1737
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
with your background,

1738
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
from a psychological point of view,

1739
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
is it possible that

1740
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
the level of contamination

1741
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
can be reduced

1742
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
to a point

1743
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
where there is no evidence?

1744
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Or is it possible

1745
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
that it still exists

1746
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and only needs

1747
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
some correction

1748
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
on the basis of

1749
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
the level of contamination?

1750
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I've discussed this with my teacher.

1751
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
He rarely

1752
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
accepts students

1753
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
with dual backgrounds like me.

1754
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I asked him

1755
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
if I needed to

1756
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
give expert advice.

1757
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
He said it's simple.

1758
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I can't be an expert

1759
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
on the same case

1760
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
and defend the same case.

1761
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
He suggested

1762
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
that this kind of thing

1763
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
can be done

1764
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
by

1765
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
reducing the level

1766
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
of contamination

1767
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
to a point where

1768
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
there is no evidence.

1769
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
First of all,

1770
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
even if I think this way,

1771
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
my child can't

1772
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
have no evidence.

1773
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It's not a scientific term.

1774
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
It's a legal term.

1775
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I see.

1776
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
In my scientific report,

1777
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
even if I have a dual background,

1778
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I can't

1779
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
cross-reference

1780
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
the legal part.

1781
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I should leave it

1782
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
to my legal team

1783
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
to do it,

1784
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
even if I have a dual background.

1785
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
My second question

1786
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
is that

1787
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
your school has

1788
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
a plan to

1789
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
conduct an investigation.

1790
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yes.

1791
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I'm curious

1792
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
about the role of psychology

1793
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
in the court in Taiwan.

1794
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
For example,

1795
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
is there any possibility of

1796
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
cross-referencing?

1797
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
After our legal department

1798
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
was sentenced to death,

1799
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
there are only some procedural

1800
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
issues that can be reviewed.

1801
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
For example,

1802
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
are there any other

1803
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
legal procedures?

1804
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
However,

1805
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I'm curious

1806
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
about the role of psychology

1807
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
in the court in Taiwan.

1808
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I'm curious

1809
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
about the role of psychology

1810
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
in the court in Taiwan.

1811
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I think

1812
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
it might be related

1813
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
to the logic of religion.

1814
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
There are two judgments

1815
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
in the Supreme Court

1816
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
for the death penalty.

1817
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
The logic is that

1818
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
a person can only

1819
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
be held accountable

1820
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
for the crime he committed.

1821
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
If a person

1822
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
has a mental state

1823
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
during the execution

1824
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
or even before

1825
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
the execution,

1826
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
which means

1827
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
he can't be held

1828
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
accountable for the crime

1829
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
he committed,

1830
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
he shouldn't be sentenced to death.

1831
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
This doesn't mean

1832
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
he should be sentenced to death.

1833
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
In Taiwan,

1834
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
as far as I know,

1835
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
there is still

1836
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
no assessment

1837
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
on this issue.

1838
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
The reason is that

1839
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
there are three

1840
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
common psychological

1841
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
abilities

1842
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
related to the death penalty.

1843
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
The first one is

1844
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
whether the person

1845
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
has the ability to

1846
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
communicate with the lawyer

1847
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and defend himself.

1848
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
The second one is

1849
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
whether he has the ability

1850
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
to be held accountable

1851
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
for the crime he committed.

1852
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
The third one is

1853
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
the ability to be executed.

1854
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
As far as I know,

1855
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
in Taiwan,

1856
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
the ability to be held

1857
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
accountable for the crime

1858
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
he committed

1859
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
is not necessarily

1860
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
acceptable

1861
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
or is still

1862
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
a difficult concept.

1863
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's even more difficult

1864
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
when it comes to the ability

1865
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
to save the life

1866
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
in the later stage,

1867
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
or the ability to be held

1868
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
accountable

1869
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
according to the law.

1870
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
As far as I know,

1871
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Taiwan's judicial system

1872
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
doesn't deal with the issue

1873
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
of the ability to save the life

1874
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
and the ability to be held accountable.

1875
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Some states require

1876
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
the lawyer to apply

1877
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
at the last minute,

1878
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
so they are now

1879
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
looking at

1880
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
which states

1881
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
don't allow

1882
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
the application

1883
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
of the ability

1884
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
to be held accountable.

1885
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
They are still

1886
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
doing statistics

1887
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
on the case

1888
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
of the death penalty.

1889
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I see.

1890
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
There's a minor point

1891
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
that I'd like to add.

1892
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You mentioned that the witch

1893
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
wanted to see

1894
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
if there's a chance

1895
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
to confirm the death penalty.

1896
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Yes, I saw that

1897
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
and I think you're right.

1898
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
It's a minor point.

1899
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Thank you.

1900
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Thank you, Cha-Zheng.

1901
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Okay.

1902
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Let me ask

1903
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
another question.

1904
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
You mentioned

1905
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
that

1906
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
a friend here

1907
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
asked a tricky question.

1908
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
He said,

1909
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
it sounds like psychology

1910
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
has a great influence

1911
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
on food in the US and Europe.

1912
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I'm curious

1913
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
if it has an influence

1914
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
on Taiwan's courts.

1915
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You mentioned that

1916
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
psychology

1917
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
evaluates

1918
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
the person

1919
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
or the defendant

1920
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I'm guessing

1921
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
whether the person

1922
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
has the ability

1923
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
to be held accountable.

1924
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
But you didn't mention

1925
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
that psychology

1926
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
has a great influence

1927
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
on the evidence

1928
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
in Taiwan's courts.

1929
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Can you comment on that?

1930
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
As far as I know,

1931
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
there are five kinds of evidence

1932
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
in Taiwan,

1933
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
such as human evidence,

1934
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
book evidence,

1935
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and so on.

1936
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
As far as I know,

1937
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
human evidence

1938
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
has a great influence

1939
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
on the evidence

1940
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
in Taiwan's courts.

1941
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
As far as I know,

1942
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
for example,

1943
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Mr. Zhao Yishan

1944
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
is a consultant

1945
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
in the Ministry of Public Security.

1946
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Due to his influence

1947
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
and the promotion

1948
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
of some private groups,

1949
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
there is a new law

1950
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
called

1951
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Sexual Harassment Prevention Act.

1952
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
According to the law,

1953
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
it should be

1954
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
carried out

1955
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
by experts

1956
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
in the field.

1957
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
As far as I know,

1958
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
there are many

1959
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
psychologists,

1960
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
clinical psychologists,

1961
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and so on.

1962
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Psychologists

1963
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
are also

1964
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
working on

1965
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
the establishment

1966
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and modification

1967
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
of articles

1968
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
related to

1969
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
sexual harassment.

1970
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
As far as I know,

1971
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
in the past few years,

1972
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Taiwan has been

1973
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
more and more aware

1974
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
that

1975
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
first,

1976
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
science can enter the court,

1977
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
and second,

1978
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
science is not only

1979
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
the so-called hard science,

1980
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
such as forensic evidence,

1981
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and so on.

1982
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
There is also

1983
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
the so-called soft science,

1984
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and so on.

1985
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I think more and more

1986
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
legal figures

1987
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
in the legal system

1988
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
are paying attention to it.

1989
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Not only judges,

1990
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
but also prosecutors and lawyers

1991
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
are doing different

1992
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
training.

1993
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I think it's pretty good.

1994
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
That's the situation in Taiwan.

1995
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Okay.

1996
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I have a question.

1997
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
It's my own question.

1998
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Do you have any other questions?

1999
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Do you have any other questions?

2000
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Do you have any other questions?

2001
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Let's think about it.

2002
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'll go first.

2003
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Excuse me. Can you hear me?

2004
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Please go ahead.

2005
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I'd like to ask

2006
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
that

2007
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
the study design

2008
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
you're using now

2009
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
is based on quantitative research,

2010
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
or

2011
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
is it qualitative?

2012
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Because

2013
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
in the evidence part,

2014
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I know that

2015
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I've seen the related research.

2016
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
They are

2017
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
using the model of

2018
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
the Maga Jury

2019
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
to look at the decision

2020
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
between the patient groups.

2021
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
They are in the qualitative part.

2022
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So I think

2023
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
the first question is

2024
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
that you want to do a

2025
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
quantitative research.

2026
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Is it based on

2027
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
the data you presented before?

2028
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Is it based on

2029
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
the data you presented before?

2030
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Or is it based on the quality?

2031
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
If it's a cross-border research,

2032
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
we are considering

2033
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
both quantitative and quality.

2034
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
For quantitative research,

2035
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
the easiest way is to look at

2036
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
the level of guidance

2037
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
in each country.

2038
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
For the quality,

2039
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
we are considering

2040
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
the level of guidance

2041
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
in each country.

2042
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So we are considering

2043
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
the level of guidance

2044
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
in each country.

2045
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So we are considering

2046
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
the level of guidance

2047
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
in each country.

2048
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
The second question is

2049
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
How old is the child?

2050
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
How old is the child?

2051
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
We currently have two groups.

2052
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
One is 5 years old

2053
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
and the other is 8 years old.

2054
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
5 years old is

2055
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
half of 8 years old.

2056
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
8 years old is half of 8 years old.

2057
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
5 years old and 8 years old.

2058
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
5 years old and 8 years old.

2059
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I have seen

2060
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
online

2061
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
that the relevant

2062
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
children's interviews

2063
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
are usually not appropriate

2064
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
for the age of 11.

2065
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
for the age of 11.

2066
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
for the age of 11.

2067
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
for the age of 11.

2068
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
So I am not sure

2069
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
if the same problem

2070
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
will occur

2071
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
in the law psychology.

2072
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
in the law psychology.

2073
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
in the law psychology.

2074
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Thank you.

2075
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
We are considering

2076
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
two groups.

2077
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
One is the kindergarten group and the elementary school group.

2078
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
There are several reasons.

2079
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
First of all, the children's testimony

2080
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
is what I saw

2081
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
or what we did in the lab

2082
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
or what I did

2083
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
when I was in the elementary school class.

2084
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Many of us will mention the age under 11.

2085
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Many of us will mention the age under 11.

2086
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Because in the field of children's testimony,

2087
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
when it was created

2088
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
or when everyone was doing research,

2089
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
it was to solve the problem of food.

2090
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
However, many cases

2091
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
of child-like

2092
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
disability

2093
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
include victims

2094
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
or witnesses.

2095
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
They may be children

2096
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
who are quite young.

2097
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
In the United States,

2098
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
most of them are children

2099
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
in kindergarten age.

2100
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So in the field of children's testimony,

2101
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
especially in the field of pedagogical research,

2102
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
the kindergarten group is usually included.

2103
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
As for the text of my testimony,

2104
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
we are still thinking about

2105
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
the issue of openness.

2106
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
We are still thinking about

2107
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
the issue of openness.

2108
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
We don't know

2109
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
how rich the content

2110
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
of the child's testimony

2111
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
will be.

2112
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
However, there is a mystery

2113
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
that can be solved.

2114
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
If the child is

2115
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
very child-friendly

2116
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
and not too high-pressure,

2117
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
the issue of openness

2118
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
will be solved.

2119
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
However,

2120
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
the child can speak a lot

2121
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
in kindergarten.

2122
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
We are now

2123
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
trying to solve the issue of openness

2124
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
to collect the text of the testimony.

2125
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
We don't know

2126
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
how the result will be.

2127
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Sorry, I want to add one more thing.

2128
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
If you want to work in Taiwan,

2129
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
the IRB

2130
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
may be a little

2131
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
more difficult.

2132
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
This is my personal experience.

2133
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Because Talking Age

2134
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
is for children.

2135
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
They will require these things.

2136
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
The IRB is now running.

2137
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
So,

2138
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
fingers crossed.

2139
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
The IRB in Taiwan

2140
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
is probably the easiest

2141
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
to work with

2142
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
in the middle age hospital.

2143
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
If it is in other medical institutions,

2144
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
it may be very troublesome.

2145
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
That's right.

2146
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Now,

2147
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
the IRB in Taiwan

2148
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
is running.

2149
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So,

2150
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
fingers crossed.

2151
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Thank you.

2152
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Taiwan

2153
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
involves children.

2154
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Thank you for

2155
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
your encouragement,

2156
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
support and advice.

2157
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Thank you.

2158
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
So,

2159
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
do you have any other questions?

2160
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Let me ask you a question.

2161
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Do you have time?

2162
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Yes.

2163
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Please go ahead.

2164
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I'm sorry.

2165
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
You just mentioned a lot of research

2166
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
about

2167
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
the situation when children

2168
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
were drawn for testimony.

2169
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Whether they were

2170
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
sedated or

2171
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
not,

2172
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
and so on.

2173
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It's all about the situation

2174
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
when children were drawn for testimony.

2175
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I'm thinking about

2176
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
an extreme situation.

2177
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
If the situation is not reliable,

2178
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
let's say we get an article.

2179
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
The article says

2180
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
that this is the testimony of a child.

2181
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
It's written as an article.

2182
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
We don't know what happened.

2183
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Is there any way

2184
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
to

2185
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
estimate

2186
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
the credibility

2187
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
of the testimony?

2188
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Why do I think

2189
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
it's like

2190
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
we don't know

2191
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
what happened

2192
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
to the journalists.

2193
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
But we can

2194
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
see from the news

2195
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
that it's fake news.

2196
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
We have that ability.

2197
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Is there any way

2198
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
to study the credibility

2199
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
of the testimony?

2200
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I know that

2201
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
a lot of people

2202
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
would go directly.

2203
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
If it's just a text,

2204
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and there's no recording,

2205
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
let's first see

2206
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
how the text

2207
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
is made.

2208
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
For example, in Taiwan,

2209
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
a lot of text

2210
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
is not written in text

2211
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
because it's easier to record.

2212
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
It's actually a sample.

2213
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
It's hard to analyze

2214
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
from a scientific point of view.

2215
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
If the quality is better,

2216
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
it's really a text.

2217
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
There's a way

2218
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
that

2219
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I'm not sure

2220
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
if it's possible.

2221
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
You can analyze

2222
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
the form of the question.

2223
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Is it an open-ended question?

2224
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
If not,

2225
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
does the way it's designed

2226
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
have any guidance?

2227
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
For example,

2228
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
is there any information

2229
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
that hasn't appeared

2230
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
during the interrogation?

2231
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
For example,

2232
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
did your dad

2233
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
touch your sister?

2234
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
It's obviously a guidance question.

2235
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
But if it's

2236
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
like,

2237
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
hello, I'm a policewoman.

2238
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Can you tell me

2239
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
what your dad did to you?

2240
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Your dad might be a guide.

2241
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
If there is

2242
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
a more complete text,

2243
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
and you can tell

2244
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
the form of the question,

2245
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
you can analyze

2246
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
the form of the question

2247
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
and see how much

2248
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
guidance it has.

2249
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I have no more questions.

2250
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Anyone else?

2251
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
If not,

2252
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
let's give Yilan another round of applause.

2253
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
That's all for today.

2254
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Thank you.

2255
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Thank you.
