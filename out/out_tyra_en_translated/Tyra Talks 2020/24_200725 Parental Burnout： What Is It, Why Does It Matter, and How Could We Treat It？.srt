00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's presentation by Project Tara.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm your host, Suyi An.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First of all, I'd like to thank our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
for being our speaker today.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm also very happy to have people from all cities

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and towns join us in this online academic presentation.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to spend a minute or two to introduce our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then I'm going to talk a little bit about today's event.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm really happy that Gaoxue can be our speaker today.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Gaoxue and I met in NTU.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Gaoxue's background is very, very special.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Gaoxue graduated from NTU's Department of Chemistry,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
so she didn't major in psychology.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Later, she studied at NTU's Psychological Institute,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is a laboratory in the field of development.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
She had a very special experience.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
After Gaoxue studied at the Psychological Institute,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
she didn't give up her original chemistry major.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Instead, she studied at NTU's Counseling Center.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
After graduation, she even became a full-time high school chemistry teacher.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gaoxue is currently studying in the Ph.D. class of the Catholic University of Belize.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As far as I know, she also studies in the field of psychological development.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
When I was preparing for this presentation, I was actually quite nervous.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because Gaoxue herself sent me a very rich CV.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
At first glance, I thought she was a god.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Gaoxue, if I say something wrong, you can correct me at any time.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was thinking about what to prepare.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The information is too rich.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Gaoxue has won many research-related awards,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
including the Best Dictionary and Dictionary Award

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
at the Taiwan Psychological Institute,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
as well as the Young Scholar Award

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
at the Taiwan Women's Studies Institute, etc.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can't wait to be awarded.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Today, Gaoxue will mainly share with us

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
her speech on the topic of gender equality.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After all, I'm not an expert,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so I'll leave it to Gaoxue to explain it to us later.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But I think this topic, especially recently,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
is particularly in line with the current situation.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
During COVID-19, Taiwan may not be very obvious,

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but abroad, there are indeed quite a lot of people

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
who are concerned about gender equality.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Many parents and children

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
may be stuck at home all day long

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is Gaoxue's brief introduction.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The topic of our session today is

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
about Gaoxue's speech after her presentation.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
about Gaoxue's speech after her presentation.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There will be Q&A at the end.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But the Project Hera's mode is quite casual.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So if you have any questions,

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you can just turn on your microphone and ask.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Or if you feel a little embarrassed,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you can leave a comment in the chat.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Or you can also leave a comment

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
at the end of the Q&A.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's all for my introduction.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Gaoxue, it's your turn.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Gaoxue, it's your turn.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you for your kind introduction.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Lin Gaoxue.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm Lin Gaoxue.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
My name is Lin Gaoxue.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm a Ph.D. student in the research lab of Parenthoven Research Lab.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let me introduce our school first.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Our school's name in Chinese is the Parenthoven Research Lab.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Fifty years ago, there was a political dispute over the unification of Taiwan.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In Belgium, this political dispute was led by the mother tongue.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In Belgium, this political dispute was led by the mother tongue.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Fifty years ago, our Parenthoven Research Lab

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
was divided into two groups,

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
which were the parents and native speakers.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The first one was the first Parenthoben,

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
which was more Spanish-speaking,

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
while the other group was the second Parenthoven.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We call it the Anthropology and Japanese Studies University.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We are only different in terms of the knowledge,

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but our training is the Hangul and French.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
but our training is the Hangul and French.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We are only different in terms of the knowledge,

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but our training is the Hangul and French.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
After introducing our school,

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
let me introduce myself.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you for the introduction.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have been at the University of Taiwan

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
for 8 years.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My major is Chemistry,

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and my minor is Psychology.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
My major is Psychology.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In 2019,

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I joined the University of Taiwan

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
to study for my Ph.D.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My major is Psychology,

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and I joined the two subfields,

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Culture and Health Psychology.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I used to be a full-time

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Chemistry teacher in Songshan High School,

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and now I am a full-time research assistant

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
in the Laboratory of Professor Cao Zheng-cao

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
at the Department of Communication and Technology

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
of the Department of Communication and Technology.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I am interested in the emotional experience

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
in my family,

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
especially the influence of parents

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
in the social culture.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The keywords of my research theme

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
include parenting stress, parental burnout,

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and emotional regulation

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
of how parents deal with their emotions related to stress.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will use a physiological indicator

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to measure the stress of a person.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I will use cultural perspective

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
or the network analysis commonly used in communication psychology

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to care about the relationship between people

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
or the different phenomena in people's minds.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
At the beginning of the report,

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will introduce my field,

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the field of developmental psychology.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I refer to the introduction

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
made by my master's class teacher,

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Prof. Lei Ganlin, in the online course of Coursera.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
From his point of view,

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
before we get to know the development of psychology,

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
we may need to understand what psychology is.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Psychology cares about the knowledge of people and minds.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It also includes the field of experimental psychology.

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In this field,

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
we may want to care about a person's cognitive,

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
emotions, language,

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and even our intuition.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We also include social and personality psychology.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In this field, we care about a person's personality.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We care about social psychology

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and the special cultural phenomenon

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
in a cultural community.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We also care about the similarities and differences

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
between different cultures.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Of course, applied psychology is also a major field in psychology.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
For example, criminal psychology,

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
which I mentioned before.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It also includes the issues of clinical psychology

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
in the interaction between clinical psychologists and patients.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
In the field of education or organization,

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
there are also many issues discussed in psychology.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Regardless of the field,

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
we must accept the training provided by the following three sets of knowledge.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The first is physiological psychology.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Regardless of which field we are,

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
we must understand that there is a set of physiological mechanisms

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
behind everyone's behavior and cognition.

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In addition to this,

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
when we measure the abstract phenomenon in psychology,

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
we must be sure that the phenomenon we measure

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
is what we think in our mind.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This approach is usually a psychometric method.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The last is developmental psychology.

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Developmental psychology provides us

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
with a holistic approach

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that allows us to understand that each of us is developing over time.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The current time will affect my current behavior,

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and the current time will affect my future time.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So we are all evolving and developing

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
over a period of time.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In this case, everyone will interact with their society,

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
so they will play different roles.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
For example, you may play a student,

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you may play a partner, you may play a friend,

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
or even a parent.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The development of cognition,

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
the development of language, the development of character,

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the development of emotion, and even the development of action

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
will be discussed in different topics.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
My research focuses on the relevant issues

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
when a person is a parent.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Parenting psychology

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
is a very popular research topic

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
in developmental psychology in the past.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Some researchers even believe that

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the relevant life experience of parenting

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
is a very central aspect of our modern life.

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The reason why this experience

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
is so important is that

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
when we are middle-aged and become parents,

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
we do a lot of things

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that are driven by parenting.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Some researchers even believe

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that parenting is a fundamental human need

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
or human motive.

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Since parenting is such an important life experience,

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
it is very complicated.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
If there are teachers or students

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
who are now parents,

202
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
they will be very familiar with the following sentence.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Parenting is a very good experience.

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Because of being parents, we have experienced a lot of things

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and gained a sense of meaning.

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But at the same time,

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
we also feel a lot of pressure because we are parents.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
In my master's class,

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I especially focused on the general situation.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
When parents are taking care of their children,

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
they feel the daily pressure to discuss.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
After I completed a theory model

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
for a master's thesis,

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
like what I wrote on Facebook,

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
maybe because I am a chemistry intern

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
who graduated from NTU,

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
many parents came to me to discuss

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the psychological development of their children.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In fact,

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
rather than discussing the development of their children with me,

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I feel that these parents need an ear

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
to listen to their pain

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
in the past few years.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
For example,

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
what they often say to me is,

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Teacher, I really don't know what to do.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Can you help me? We are really helpless as parents.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We are really tired.

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is what a group of teenagers' parents told me.

230
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
When they talk about this,

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
they usually play along with their tears.

232
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
In the course of the internship,

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I often think about

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
whether my simple model

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
of daily stress relief

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
is suitable to explain

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the intense depression

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
these parents feel.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
At this time,

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
in 2019, I met my two bosses.

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They are recruiting PhD students

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
to discuss the extreme phenomenon

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
of parenting stress,

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
so I went from NTU Psychology

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
to the University of Paris.

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
In particular, I will further discuss

247
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
the topic of Parental Burnout in my PhD paper.

248
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This brings me to the main focus of my report today,

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Parental Burnout.

250
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I will talk about this concept from a historical background.

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I will also talk about how we define

252
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Parental Burnout from the perspective of psychology.

253
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I will also ask a question,

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
why is Parental Burnout so important?

255
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It must be because we consider its consequences.

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Finally, we want to provide a method

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to deal with Parental Burnout.

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Before dealing with it,

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
let's start with the concept of Parental Burnout.

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you are a parent,

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
you may have experienced the following experiences.

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
If you are a psychologist,

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you may have heard of these experiences from your parents.

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
These experiences are what we visit

265
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
those parents who have obviously been

266
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
traumatized by Parental Burnout.

267
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
We ask them,

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
what is Parental Burnout?

269
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
They will tell you,

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
this is a giant fatigue.

271
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They live every day,

272
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
just trying to get by.

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
They live like a robot,

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
dealing with Parental Burnout every day.

275
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Parental Burnout is like a mess.

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Parental Burnout is like a mess.

277
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Just trying to take care of their kids.

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But they found out that

279
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
it is hard to control their kids.

280
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They could not bear their kids.

281
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The most horrible thing is,

282
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
they told us,

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
if they could not imagine

284
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that they could become a parent like that.

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
These are what we visit

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
parents of parental burnout.

287
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
When we asked them about their experience,

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
they told us.

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This phenomenon was discovered by

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
a Russian researcher, Enika.

291
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
She found out that

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
parents of children with brain hemorrhage

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
seem to have some asthmatic phenomenon.

294
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Not only that,

295
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
parents of children with chronic illness

296
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
also have this phenomenon.

297
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
For example,

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
parents of children with diabetes

299
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
also have this phenomenon.

300
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We found out that

301
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
parents of children with special needs

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
also have this phenomenon.

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
My two instructors,

304
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
we asked them further.

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is it possible that

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
this asthmatic phenomenon

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
not only occurs in families with special needs?

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Is it possible that

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
this phenomenon also occurs in ordinary families?

310
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why did they ask this question?

311
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Mainly because they observed

312
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
a large-scale change in modern culture.

313
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Whether it's official or

314
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
books in our rooms,

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
we promoted a kind of

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
noble guide on education,

317
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
namely positive parenting.

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We asked our parents to

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
adopt non-violent,

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
loving, supportive, and sensitive

321
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
education to face our children.

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If you see this kind of

323
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
propaganda,

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you can see that

325
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
there is even a positive parenting tip

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
on CDD's website in the US.

327
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
A book was also published in the EU

328
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
to talk about how parents can

329
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
teach their children.

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
One of the ideas is positive parenting.

331
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
In Taiwan,

332
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
CDD has been promoting

333
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
positive parenting.

334
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Another thing is that

335
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
parents' custody

336
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
is also under the control of the government.

337
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
For example,

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
if our parents take a strict education,

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
such as scolding or beating our children,

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
our government may not be able to

341
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
teach our children well.

342
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
In this case,

343
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
our parents' rights are constantly being adjusted.

344
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Children's rights are constantly increasing.

345
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The concept of positive parenting is that

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
we need to respect our children.

347
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
In fact, our children

348
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
are increasingly disrespecting our parents.

349
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We also see that

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
our husbands are still maintaining their jobs.

351
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Many women are

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
starting to work.

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
A family becomes a double-minded family.

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
However, there are still many problems with children.

355
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The time that parents can allocate to their children

356
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is relatively compressed.

357
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
When parents' resources are compressed,

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
it is easier for them to feel

359
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
the pressure of raising their children.

360
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Of course,

361
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
women should not return to the family environment.

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The change in the economic environment

363
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
makes the time for the husband and wife

364
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
to take care of their children less and less.

365
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Because of this environment,

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
two teachers asked

367
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
if it is possible to see

368
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
parental burnout in ordinary families.

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
In recent cross-cultural research,

370
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
it is estimated that

371
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
at least 5% of parents in the United States,

372
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
more than 3.5 million parents,

373
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
are suffering from parental burnout.

374
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Parental burnout is a new prevailing psychological syndrome.

375
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
In fact,

376
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
in a well-known psychological science website,

377
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
there are experts who are specifically introducing

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
what parental burnout is.

379
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
In the New York Times and CNN Opinion,

380
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
many reporters and food workers

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
are constantly advocating parental burnout

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
during the quarantine period.

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We should provide the first-hand help

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to such a phenomenon.

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In 2017,

386
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
researchers from more than 100 countries

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
around the world

388
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
organized an international consulting

389
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
to focus on

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
what parental burnout is.

391
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We pay special attention to whether parental burnout

392
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
appears not only in the United States and Europe,

393
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but also in various cultures around the world.

394
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Basically, every year,

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we hold a seminar to share

396
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the recent research results of parental burnout.

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Last year, we held the first seminar

398
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
to discuss the epidemic in Belgium.

399
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This year, we will hold the second conference

400
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
on parental burnout in Poland.

401
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
However, due to the epidemic,

402
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
we will postpone it until next year, 2021.

403
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Welcome to our seminar.

404
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Let's join us

405
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to discuss the topic of parental burnout.

406
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Let's go back to science.

407
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
To discuss parental burnout,

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
the first thing we need to do is to tell you

409
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
that the phenomenon we measure really exists.

410
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We use two ways to define parental burnout.

411
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
In the past,

412
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
there was a very well-developed concept,

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
job burnout,

414
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
which was discussed.

415
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We changed it into a way

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
suitable for parenting context

417
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
through a top-down approach

418
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
to define parental burnout.

419
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The second way is to interview

420
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
parents who are already

421
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
in the job market.

422
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This is a bottom-up approach

423
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
to define parental burnout.

424
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
After two years of research and definition,

425
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
we finally defined it as a psychological syndrome

426
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
with four major symptoms.

427
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The first symptom is that

428
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
you feel exhausted by your role as a parent.

429
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
For example,

430
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I am completely run down by my role as a parent.

431
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The second symptom is that

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
you feel the distance between you and your child.

433
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
For example,

434
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I do what I am supposed to do for my children,

435
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
but nothing more.

436
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I can't stand my role as a father

437
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and mother anymore.

438
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The last symptom is

439
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
contrast with previous parental self.

440
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
For example,

441
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't think I am a good father and mother

442
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
like I used to be to my children.

443
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
After defining the four major symptoms

444
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
of parental burnout

445
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
through psychological syndrome,

446
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
the next question is

447
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
whether the concept of parental burnout

448
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
is a specific concept.

449
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
In our recent research,

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
we asked parents about their work burnout

451
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and their parental burnout.

452
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We took their answers

453
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and did a factor analysis.

454
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We found that

455
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
when we separate the two factors,

456
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
parental burnout and work burnout,

457
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
it is more suitable than

458
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
when we combine the two concepts

459
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
into one.

460
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
From this result,

461
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
we can see that

462
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
parental burnout has a variable effect.

463
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I hope that

464
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
the above introduction can convince you that

465
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
parental burnout really exists.

466
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It is a psychological concept

467
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that can be measured

468
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and has a professional definition.

469
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The next question is

470
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
if it really exists,

471
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
is it really important?

472
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If we want to consider whether it is important or not,

473
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
we must consider its consequences.

474
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
In the following session,

475
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
in our early research,

476
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
we found that parental burnout

477
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
can predict the idea of parents

478
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
avoiding and committing suicide

479
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
at the same time.

480
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We can imagine that

481
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
a parent who is under pressure

482
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
has two most common reactions.

483
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
One is to avoid.

484
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
However,

485
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
parenting is completely different

486
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
from the work environment.

487
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
If we feel tired at work,

488
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we can ask for sick leave,

489
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
we can even resign.

490
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
However, as parents,

491
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
we can't ask for leave or resign.

492
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
We are always the parents of the child.

493
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We can see that

494
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
parents have suicidal thoughts.

495
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
In addition,

496
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
we can see that parents have drug addiction.

497
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If they have parental burnout,

498
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
we can imagine that

499
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
a person who wants to avoid these related things

500
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
may take drugs to avoid

501
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and continue to think about these related issues.

502
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
We can also see that

503
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
parents who are under parental burnout

504
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
can predict that

505
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
they will be violent to their children.

506
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We can also imagine that

507
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
when we are under pressure,

508
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
in addition to avoiding,

509
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
another way is to attack.

510
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
We can see that

511
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
parents who are under parental burnout

512
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
are more likely to abuse their children.

513
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
We can also see that

514
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
parents who are under parental burnout may ignore their children.

515
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Finally, we can see that

516
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
parents who are under parental burnout

517
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
will be deeply affected

518
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
by the relationship between their husband and wife

519
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
when they are in a marital relationship.

520
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
We can further discuss these consequences

521
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
for such issues.

522
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We need to make sure that

523
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
the consequences of parental burnout

524
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
occur after parental burnout.

525
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We need to make sure that

526
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
the consequences of parental burnout

527
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
occur after parental burnout.

528
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We use a research analysis method

529
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
to collect data for three times

530
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
at different time points across 5.5 months.

531
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
to collect data for three times across 5.5 months across 5.5 months

532
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
to analyze whether our parental burnout

533
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
can predict the result of the next time point.

534
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
For example,

535
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
we can see that

536
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
ESCAPE IDIATION and PARENTAL NECKLACE

537
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
can be controlled

538
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
for the results of the next time point.

539
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
for the results of the next time point.

540
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You can see that

541
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
ESCAPE IDIATION and PARENTAL NECKLACE

542
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
can be controlled

543
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
for the results of the next time point.

544
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You can see that

545
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
ESCAPE IDIATION and PARENTAL NECKLACE

546
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
can be controlled

547
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
for the results of the next time point.

548
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You can see that

549
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
ESCAPE IDIATION and PARENTAL NECKLACE

550
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
can be controlled

551
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
for the results of the next time point.

552
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You can see that

553
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
ESCAPE IDIATION and PARENTAL NECKLACE

554
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
can be controlled

555
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
for the results of the next time point.

556
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You can see that

557
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000

Okay.

1196
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Thank you for your presentation.

1197
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I have a question.

1198
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You mentioned that

1199
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
PARENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

1200
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
is a very important factor.

1201
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Do you find that

1202
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
it has something to do with genetics?

1203
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Is it related to genes?

1204
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Or,

1205
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
in the future

1206
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
when parents

1207
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
get birthed in,

1208
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
there is also the risk of parental burnout?

1209
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Thank you.

1210
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
First of all,

1211
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
as far as I know,

1212
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
there are no proofs for THIS.

1213
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I have to admit that

1214
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
the topic of parental burnout

1215
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
is a new topic

1216
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
in the last 5 years.

1217
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
So, I think,

1218
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
at least as far as my knowledge,

1219
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I haven't seen any discussion on the related genes.

1220
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
But I can see,

1221
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
for example, depression,

1222
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I can guess that

1223
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
in the topic of parental burnout,

1224
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
or even in the topic of job burnout,

1225
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I am not familiar with the topic of job burnout.

1226
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But I think there are many genes

1227
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
that play an important role.

1228
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
This is the first question.

1229
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
The second question is,

1230
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
can you repeat the second question?

1231
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
The first question is,

1232
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
can parents

1233
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
get birthed in,

1234
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
there is also the risk of parental burnout?

1235
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Is there any similar phenomenon?

1236
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
OK.

1237
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
We are still in the process of research,

1238
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
so we don't know how the next generation

1239
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
will raise their children.

1240
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
From the past research,

1241
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
we can see that

1242
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
if the previous generation

1243
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
took violent

1244
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
or negative behavior,

1245
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
the next generation

1246
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
will also take negative behavior.

1247
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
This is a vicious cycle.

1248
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
This is a very good question.

1249
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Maybe the parents

1250
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
who are in parental burnout,

1251
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
their children

1252
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
may continue to be in parental burnout.

1253
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
But because our children have not grown up yet,

1254
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
we are not sure

1255
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
if this phenomenon is possible.

1256
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But it is possible.

1257
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Thank you.

1258
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Let's see if there are any questions

1259
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
from the audience.

1260
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Hello.

1261
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I have a question

1262
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
about this paper.

1263
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
First of all, thank you for this presentation.

1264
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
My research is related to the role of parents.

1265
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
My group focuses on

1266
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
the experience of parenting

1267
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
, so there are many things to connect with.

1268
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I would like to ask about this paper.

1269
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
The author is Gao Xian.

1270
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
When he wrote this paper,

1271
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
he mentioned that

1272
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
part of the parental psychological characteristics

1273
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
is their own EQ.

1274
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
The other part is that they want to be a perfect parent.

1275
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
This idea may also cause

1276
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
parental burnout.

1277
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I would like to know

1278
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
if this is a trend

1279
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
or a goal standard

1280
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
for parents.

1281
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I would like to know

1282
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
if this is a trend

or a goal standard

1284
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
for parents.

1285
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I would like to know

1286
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
if this is a trend

1287
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
or a goal standard

1288
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
for parents.

1289
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I would like to know

1290
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
if this is a trend

1291
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
or a goal standard

1292
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
for parents.

1293
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I would like to know

1294
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
if this is a trend

1295
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
or a goal standard

1296
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
for parents.

1297
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I would like to know

1298
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
if this is a trend

1299
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
or a goal standard

1300
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
for parents.

1301
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I would like to know

1302
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000

for parents.

1305
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I would like to know

1306
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000

1793
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I would like to know

1797
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I would like to know

1798
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
if this is a trend

1799
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
or a goal standard

1800
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
for parents.

1801
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I would like to know

1802
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
if this is a trend

1803
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
or a goal standard

1804
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
for parents.

1805
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I am a researcher

1806
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
and I immigrated to the US.

1807
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I was originally from Taiwan,

1808
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Hong Kong, and the US.

1809
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I decided to move to the US

1810
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
because I have a child with a mental disability.

1811
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I decided to move to the US

1812
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
because I have a child with a mental disability.

1813
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I decided to move to the US

1814
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
because my assumption was that

1815
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
parents were expecting their children

1816
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
to be a good parent.

1817
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
to be a good parent.

1818
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It was hard for them

1819
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
to agree on their goals

1820
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
when they were raised in a Chinese society.

1821
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It was hard for them to agree on their goals

1822
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
when they were raised in a Chinese society.

1823
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I assumed that

1824
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
they would feel more pressure

1825
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
to adjust their education

1826
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
to fit the mainstream American culture.

1827
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I asked them similar questions.

1828
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I asked them similar questions.

1829
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
What do you think is a good parent

1830
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
in your original culture?

1831
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
What do you think is a good parent

1832
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
in your original culture?

1833
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
What do you think is a good parent

1834
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
in your original culture?

1835
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I am a family member with a mental disability.

1836
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I am a family member with a mental disability.

1837
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
In my culture,

1838
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
the acceptance of parents

1839
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
in this country is much higher.

1840
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
In my culture,

1841
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
parents respect their children

1842
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
and how they raise their children.

1843
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Even if a child has an emotional breakdown,

1844
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
the society has a high tolerance for such a situation.

1845
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
The society has a high tolerance for such a situation.

1846
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
The pressure of raising a child with a mental disability

1847
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
is much lower than in their original country.

1848
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
This cross-culture does not cause too much pressure on them.

1849
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
However, my research is a culture change.

1850
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
The current research is a culture change.

1851
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
It is not the same as the research that you are doing in your country.

1852
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
It is not the same as the research that you are doing in your country.

1853
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
This research is very interesting.

1854
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I want to share it with you.

1855
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Have you read a 2014 article by Charlie Sum Chu

1856
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Have you read a 2014 article by Charlie Sum Chu

1857
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
about Thai parenting?

1858
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
He is specializing in Chinese families

1859
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
In the United States.

1860
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
He mentioned that

1861
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Chinese parents

1862
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
are proud of their children

1863
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
but also make sure their children

1864
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
are educated like the world requires.

1865
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
In addition to this,

1866
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
they also want their children

1867
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
to stay in the family

1868
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
and feel their values in China.

1869
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
They might even be strengthened.

1870
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I remember...

1871
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Is it Kangyi?

1872
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I'm afraid I said it wrong.

1873
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I think it's Kangyi.

1874
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
They might strengthen

1875
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
their original culture

1876
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
in the immigrant family.

1877
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
That's what I remember.

1878
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I wouldn't be surprised

1879
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
if that's the case.

1880
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Indeed,

1881
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
my research focuses on

1882
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
disability.

1883
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I can only look at

1884
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
the intersectionality

1885
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
between disability, culture, and parenting.

1886
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
It's very different

1887
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
from just looking at the family.

1888
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I can only say that

1889
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
having a family

1890
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
with different characteristics

1891
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
from other families

1892
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
does affect the whole relationship.

1893
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I think

1894
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I can do more research on this

1895
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
in the future.

1896
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I don't know how to

1897
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
take this into consideration.

1898
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
It's just my opinion.

1899
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
You mentioned the education culture

1900
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
of special families.

1901
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I think it's very interesting.

1902
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
You mentioned

1903
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
the intersectionality

1904
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
between special families

1905
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
and education culture.

1906
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
It's very interesting.

1907
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Thank you.

1908
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I'm looking forward to your paper.

1909
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Or any...

1910
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Any publication.

1911
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I'm looking forward to your paper.

1912
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
My first paper

1913
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
is on meta-synthesis.

1914
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
It's like a meta-analysis

1915
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
of a qualitative model.

1916
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
This paper has been published.

1917
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I'll link it to you later.

1918
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It's more of a literature review.

1919
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
It talks about the intersectionality

1920
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
between parents.

1921
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
We generally talk about the role of parents.

1922
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
But there are many aspects

1923
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
under the role of parents.

1924
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
They may just provide

1925
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
the care of everyday life.

1926
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Or they may play

1927
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
the role of

1928
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
family financial support.

1929
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
At the same time,

1930
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
there are many other aspects

1931
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
under the umbrella term

1932
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
of parents.

1933
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
So my first paper

1934
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
is about this.

1935
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
My second paper

1936
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
is purely on qualitative research.

1937
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It hasn't been published yet.

1938
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I hope I can finish it this year.

1939
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I see.

1940
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I hope you can finish it soon.

1941
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I can't wait to see your paper.

1942
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I'm looking forward to

1943
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
your comment.

1944
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Your first paper.

1945
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Okay.

1946
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I'll look for it.

1947
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Yiting is posting

1948
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
her paper link

1949
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
in the chat.

1950
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I'm quite happy

1951
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
that today's discussion

1952
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
is very heated.

1953
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I think it's as exciting

1954
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
as the speech itself.

1955
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Due to time constraints,

1956
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I'd like to ask

1957
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
whether you have

1958
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
any last words

1959
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
or take home message

1960
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
for the audience

1961
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
or future audience

1962
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
who can listen to

1963
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
the speech

1964
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
on Project Taira.

1965
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Parental balance is a very important issue.

1966
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
We think it's a very important issue.

1967
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
There are many social cultures

1968
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
and personal factors

1969
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
that play an important role.

1970
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
As I said in the final remark,

1971
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
we hope to rebalance

1972
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
the entire research.

1973
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
In the past,

1974
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
we only cared about the child's

1975
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
positive development.

1976
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
We also hope that

1977
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
we can care more about

1978
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
the health of parents themselves

1979
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
in the future research.

1980
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
We hope that

1981
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
we can contribute

1982
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
more to the research.

1983
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
That's all.

1984
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Thank you, Annie.

1985
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Thank you, Kaohsiung.

1986
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I think Kaohsiung's speech

1987
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
is very useful

1988
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
for parents

1989
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
in Taiwan

1990
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
who are struggling

1991
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
to raise their children.

1992
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Thank you

1993
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
for your participation.

1994
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I know Kaohsiung's video

1995
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
is very interesting

1996
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
and has references.

1997
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Today's speech

1998
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
will be posted

1999
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
on Project Taira's website.

2000
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
If you want to review

2001
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
or recommend it to your friends,

2002
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
you can search

2003
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
on Project Taira's website.

2004
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Good night to everyone

2005
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
in Taiwan.

2006
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Have a wonderful Saturday

2007
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
in Europe or America.

2008
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
That's all for today's speech.

2009
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I will leave

2010
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
the chat

2011
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
for a few more minutes

2012
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
so you can

2013
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
take a look at the chat.

2014
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I will also

2015
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
download it.

2016
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Thank you, everyone.

2017
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Thank you, Kaohsiung.

2018
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Thank you.

2019
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Thank you, everyone.

2020
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
We have to turn off the recording.

2021
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Okay.
