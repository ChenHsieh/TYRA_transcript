0	10000	You can find the recording online a week and a half later.
10000	16000	If you have any questions during this process,
16000	18000	you can leave a comment in the chat box.
18000	24000	We will have Q&A time at the end for everyone to ask questions.
24000	27000	Let's get started.
31000	35000	Thank you everyone for listening to my presentation.
35000	39000	Hello everyone, I'm Lai Jun-Hai.
39000	41000	You can call me Matt.
41000	47000	First of all, I would like to thank Tyra for inviting me to share my research.
47000	50000	Let me introduce myself.
50000	52000	I'm from Yonghe, Hsinchu.
52000	55000	I graduated from National University of China.
55000	60000	I worked as an engineer for a year and a half at BASF in Taiwan.
60000	64000	Then I went to UCLA to study engineering.
64000	66000	I graduated in 2017.
66000	71000	I am currently working at Startup Battery Streak.
71000	74000	At the same time, I am also a visiting scholar at UCLA.
74000	80000	My main work is focused on the development and mass production of new battery materials,
80000	83000	as well as the transfer between the company and UCLA.
84000	87000	Today's topic is
87000	92000	Designing pseudo-capacitance for fast-charging batteries.
92000	97000	That is, how to apply the mechanism of solid-state batteries to fast-charging batteries.
97000	102000	First of all, why do we need fast-charging batteries?
102000	106000	The first motivation is the accumulation of electromagnetic traffic.
106000	111000	Charging stations are currently set up in three levels.
111000	114000	The first level is the plug-in that everyone puts at home.
114000	117000	It can charge 3 to 6 kilometers per hour.
117000	120000	The second level is the charging station in the parking lot.
120000	124000	It can charge 20 to 30 kilometers per hour.
124000	129000	The third level is the fastest Tesla charging station.
129000	136000	It can charge 5 kilometers per minute.
136000	141000	Interestingly, the current charging station is still far less than the gas station.
141000	146000	But it is almost impossible to see such a long queue at the charging station.
146000	149000	Not everyone has an electric car,
149000	155000	but 5 kilometers per minute is still too slow compared to the time required for gas.
155000	162000	The second application of fast-charging batteries is the popularization of renewable energy.
162000	167000	As of last year, renewable energy has reached one-third of the global power generation.
167000	173000	50% of the power generation comes from renewable energy.
173000	178000	Other European countries also reach 20 to 30% of renewable power.
178000	185000	We all know that when wind and solar energy are converted into electricity,
185000	187000	they must be paired with suitable batteries.
187000	191000	However, these batteries can't be charged quickly,
191000	193000	so they are inefficient.
193000	196000	For example, when the wind speed is fast,
196000	198000	there will be a momentary large current.
198000	201000	The batteries that can't be charged at low power
201000	204000	will become waste heat and reduce the life of the battery.
204000	212000	So basically, this concept is the same as the concept of fast-charging batteries paired with aging cell phones.
212000	216000	The third application of fast-charging batteries is plant-based medical equipment.
216000	223000	Generally, the supply of such equipment is made up of a battery paired with a capacitor,
223000	228000	which is in the box at the bottom left.
228000	235000	Generally, the battery is used to monitor the function of low power for a long time,
235000	239000	while the capacitor is used to respond to high power in a short time.
239000	244000	Due to the limited size of the equipment and the need for different organ parts,
244000	249000	a single high-power battery is used to replace the two-in-one mode.
249000	254000	This has always been the trend in the development of this type of equipment power supply.
254000	258000	Of course, in addition to the above three applications,
258000	259000	there are other applications.
259000	261000	I won't go into detail here.
261000	263000	So in this main speech,
263000	268000	it mainly introduces how to improve the power density and energy density of the storage components using the materials of the capacitor.
269000	271000	As shown in the picture on the left,
271000	274000	the x-axis is the energy density,
274000	276000	and the y-axis is the power density.
276000	284000	First, I will briefly introduce the materials of the storage components and the techniques required for analysis.
284000	293000	Then, the first part will start with the high-power supercapacitor material in blue.
293000	298000	Then, the high-power characteristics will be achieved by using a non-oxidized carbonate residue.
298000	301000	The second part will start with the lithium battery.
301000	306000	Here is an example of fluorine,
306000	308000	L-NBOPF,
308000	312000	which achieves high power density by nanomerizing the battery material.
315000	319000	Generally, batteries or supercapacitors are basically composed of two terminals.
320000	327000	The positive terminal and the negative terminal are placed on the aluminum foil and copper foil respectively.
327000	330000	The two terminals are separated by a multi-hole separator,
330000	333000	which is the middle part of the separator,
336000	337000	to avoid short-circuit.
337000	339000	When charging the battery, the lithium battery moves in the capacitor,
339000	342000	and the battery material produces an oxidation reaction.
342000	346000	At the same time, the battery moves in the external circuit to achieve the balance of the electric current.
346000	350000	The electric current is the main focus of our discussion today.
350000	355000	It is mainly composed of the storage material, carbon, and the high-voltage supercapacitor.
355000	358000	The electric current needs to have a certain vacuum.
358000	359000	It is like a sponge.
359000	361000	It must contain enough electrolysis.
361000	366000	At the same time, it must have enough conductivity to be a high-voltage supercapacitor.
368000	371000	Although the structure of the battery and the capacitor are the same,
371000	373000	the storage mechanism is completely different.
373000	376000	The mechanism of the capacitor is absorbed by the lithium.
376000	381000	In the external circuit, the aluminum foil and the copper foil are separated and absorbed by the surface of the battery.
381000	384000	Because the lithium is absorbed by the surface for a short time,
384000	386000	this mechanism is most conducive to fast charging.
386000	389000	The disadvantage is that its surface area is limited,
389000	392000	so the density of energy is generally low.
392000	395000	In contrast, the storage method of the battery
395000	399000	uses the oxidation reaction inside the material.
399000	403000	In this case, the lithium can enter the material,
403000	405000	and its energy is far greater than that of the capacitor.
405000	408000	However, since the lithium moves very slowly inside the material,
408000	412000	it is therefore unable to do high-speed charging.
414000	417000	Next, we will introduce how to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.
417000	420000	Basically, it is based on electrical chemistry analysis.
420000	423000	We will make the pre-analyzed material into an electrolyte
423000	425000	and test it in the same electrolyte solution.
425000	428000	Generally, the device to be tested
428000	434000	has a single-phase electrolyte test on the upper left,
434000	439000	and a double-phase torque battery test on the lower left.
439000	441000	There are two main methods of testing.
441000	445000	The first method is the cyclic voltammetry,
445000	447000	which is abbreviated as CV.
447000	450000	The principle is to change the speed of voltage change
450000	452000	to measure the change in current.
452000	454000	The second method is the DC voltage test,
454000	456000	which is abbreviated as GC.
456000	459000	In the case of DC voltage charging,
459000	462000	it measures the change in voltage of the battery
462000	464000	and makes a diagram of the voltage.
468000	472000	Now we use GC and CV to get the diagram
472000	474000	to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.
474000	476000	They are two different storage mechanisms.
476000	479000	The capacitor on the left can be seen that
479000	483000	the CV is a rectangle,
483000	486000	while the GC is basically a diagonal.
486000	489000	The battery on the right is composed of a set of peaks,
489000	494000	while the GC is mainly composed of a horizontal line.
494000	496000	Now that we know how to judge the material of the battery
496000	497000	and the material of the capacitor,
497000	500000	we can look for the material of the fast charging battery.
500000	503000	What characteristics do we hope the fast charging battery has?
503000	507000	We hope it has the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry on the left,
507000	510000	which allows it to be a fast charging battery.
510000	513000	It also has the characteristics of the material on the right,
513000	515000	which increases the density of energy
515000	518000	by storing energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.
518000	521000	This is the material we are looking for.
521000	523000	The material of the capacitor
523000	528000	not only has a rectangle CV,
528000	532000	but also a diagonal GC,
532000	537000	and it stores energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.
539000	543000	Next, I will talk about the main character I will introduce today,
543000	545000	which is the T-Phased,
545000	547000	Orphohombic Phased,
547000	548000	NB205.
548000	551000	Next, I will call it NIOVIA.
551000	555000	In addition to having the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry,
555000	558000	its energy density
558000	564000	is equivalent to the energy density of lithium carbon dioxide,
564000	568000	which is in the lithium-ion battery.
568000	573000	Its energy density is 10 times that of the capacitor.
573000	575000	Its power density,
575000	578000	which is the power of its fast charging,
578000	581000	can also reach 10 times that of the battery.
581000	583000	Its only drawback is that
583000	589000	it is still oxygen-chloride,
589000	591000	so its power consumption
591000	598000	is the first topic we are going to fix.
598000	600000	The first part
600000	606000	is to mix carbon with NIOVIA
606000	609000	to improve the properties of NIOVIA.
609000	612000	We need to deduce a good NIOVIA,
612000	614000	and we will eventually deduce
614000	617000	what kind of properties a good NIOVIA battery needs
617000	622000	to show the characteristics of its lithium-ion battery.
622000	626000	A good NIOVIA battery
626000	628000	basically needs two parts.
628000	630000	The first is the high-voltage part,
630000	635000	and the second is the part that can have a high pore density.
635000	637000	In this study,
637000	639000	we mainly used three materials.
639000	642000	The first material is our protagonist, NIOVIA.
642000	646000	The second material is our chemical-capable
646000	650000	Reduced Graphene Oxide, also known as RGO.
650000	654000	Its purpose is to provide short-term conductivity.
654000	656000	The third material
656000	658000	is the one on the far right,
658000	661000	Carbide Derived Carbon, also known as CDC.
661000	665000	It is a kind of carbon dioxide.
665000	667000	Its main purpose is that
667000	671000	it has a polypore structure
671000	675000	and its size is in the micrometer level,
675000	678000	so it can provide long-term conductivity.
681000	683000	The way we prepare the battery
683000	687000	is to first plant NIOVIA on RGO.
687000	692000	Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO with CDC
692000	696000	to get NIOVIA RGO CDC,
696000	698000	also known as NRC.
698000	702000	Finally, we make NRC
702000	706000	into a commercial-grade battery
706000	708000	and test it to prove that
708000	710000	it has a high-power and high-density
710000	712000	storage characteristics
712000	714000	at the right pore density.
716000	720000	This slide shows the details of the material equipment.
720000	723000	The main equipment is
723000	727000	the water-heating method.
727000	729000	We put the precursor
729000	733000	into the autoclave
733000	735000	and heat it up to 180°C
735000	738000	for 12 hours.
738000	742000	Next, we wash the particles
742000	747000	and dry them.
747000	749000	After drying,
749000	752000	we heat it up to 500°C
752000	755000	to get the body structure we want,
755000	757000	which is T-phase,
757000	759000	or ophiobic phase.
759000	765000	Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO
765000	767000	with CDC.
767000	769000	The main purpose is to
769000	770000	make this composite material
770000	772000	in the form of surface electrolysis.
772000	775000	Next, we make it into a battery
775000	777000	and test it.
779000	783000	We have 20% NIOVIA,
783000	785000	40% NRC20,
785000	789000	and 60% NRC20.
789000	791000	The BET on the right
791000	793000	is the analysis of the surface electrolysis.
793000	796000	It shows that
796000	799000	the surface electrolysis of the material
799000	802000	increases with the
802000	804000	composition of the CDC.
804000	806000	This means that
806000	808000	this composite method
808000	811000	does not cause the CDC to lose its surface area,
811000	814000	or the CDC to be less airtight,
814000	816000	or its structure to collapse.
816000	818000	Therefore, we can use
818000	820000	a simple ratio to
820000	823000	achieve the airtightness we need.
823000	826000	There are also two black dots on the picture.
826000	828000	These two black dots
828000	830000	are where we directly plant NIOVIA
830000	832000	on the CDC.
832000	834000	If we
834000	836000	do not use
836000	838000	this composite method
838000	840000	but use
840000	842000	the water-heat method
842000	844000	to directly plant it on the CDC,
844000	846000	at high temperature,
846000	848000	the CDC's
848000	850000	surface area
850000	852000	will...
852000	854000	Because the surface area is too large,
854000	856000	the surface area will decrease
856000	858000	at high temperature.
858000	860000	We want to use the CDC
860000	862000	to improve the airtightness
862000	864000	of the electrode.
864000	866000	This is the idea.
868000	870000	Next, we need to
870000	872000	use the CV to judge the electrode.
872000	874000	Let's see if it is like a battery material
874000	876000	or an electric material.
876000	878000	In the case of changing the minority,
878000	880000	we can get the corresponding current.
880000	882000	Therefore, we use the current
882000	884000	to make judgments with the change of the minority.
884000	886000	If the
886000	888000	material is like a battery,
888000	890000	the change of the current
890000	892000	will be multiplied by the minority.
892000	894000	If the material
894000	896000	is like a capacitor,
896000	898000	the current
898000	900000	will be multiplied by the minority.
900000	902000	In other words,
902000	904000	when the minority is doubled,
904000	906000	the current will be doubled.
906000	908000	Combining these two formulas,
908000	910000	we can get
910000	912000	the following formula
912000	914000	from the experiment.
914000	916000	The current is equal to the magnitude
916000	918000	multiplied by the minority.
918000	920000	This is called
920000	922000	B-value analysis.
922000	924000	We want the material
924000	926000	to be as fast as the capacitor.
926000	928000	Therefore, we want the B-value
928000	930000	to be as close to 1 as possible.
932000	934000	This proves that the material
934000	936000	can do high-speed charging.
938000	940000	Next,
940000	942000	the NRC
942000	944000	can store different
944000	946000	current
946000	948000	at different speeds.
948000	950000	On the left,
950000	952000	we use the minority
952000	954000	to burn the NRC.
954000	956000	The lowest value
956000	958000	is 100% Cdc.
958000	960000	The way
960000	962000	we control the minority
962000	964000	is from the slowest 30-minute
964000	966000	charging point on the left to the
966000	968000	90-second charging point on the right.
968000	970000	The y-axis is the energy generated by me.
970000	972000	As time goes by,
972000	974000	the energy generated by me
974000	976000	will be reduced.
976000	978000	We want the line to be as flat as possible.
978000	980000	This means that the material
980000	982000	can do high-speed charging
982000	984000	as well as low-speed charging.
984000	986000	The lowest value is 100% Cdc.
986000	988000	As the amount of niobia increases,
988000	990000	the density of the NRC
990000	992000	will also increase.
992000	994000	Up to 40%, the increased current
994000	996000	will not be affected by the minority.
996000	998000	From 0% to 20% to 40%,
998000	1000000	the current will remain as flat.
1002000	1004000	From 0% to 60%,
1004000	1006000	the NRC will be
1006000	1008000	charged at 90 seconds.
1008000	1010000	The current is
1010000	1012000	less than 40%.
1012000	1014000	The highest value, 100%,
1014000	1016000	although the total
1016000	1018000	current is
1018000	1020000	less than 40%,
1020000	1022000	we can expect
1022000	1024000	that when the charging time
1024000	1026000	is less than 90 seconds,
1026000	1028000	the NRC will increase by 40%.
1030000	1032000	On the right is the B-value
1032000	1034000	introduced in the previous page.
1034000	1036000	When the curve
1036000	1038000	is closer to 1,
1038000	1040000	we mainly do CV
1040000	1042000	for different materials.
1042000	1044000	Then we do
1044000	1046000	the analysis of B-value.
1046000	1048000	The result of the analysis is in the lower right corner.
1048000	1050000	When the curve is closer to 1,
1050000	1052000	it means that the charging speed is faster.
1052000	1054000	By this, we can judge
1054000	1056000	that the charging speed of
1056000	1058000	NRC40 is faster than
1058000	1060000	NRC60 and 100%
1060000	1062000	of NIOBIA.
1062000	1064000	This also proves that when 60%
1064000	1066000	of the CVC is stored in the electrode,
1066000	1068000	the electrode has sufficient airtightness
1068000	1070000	to accommodate sufficient electrolysis
1070000	1072000	to show the characteristics
1072000	1074000	of NIOBIA lithium-ion battery.
1076000	1078000	Finally,
1078000	1080000	we combine the NRC40
1080000	1082000	with the traditional lithium-ion electrode
1082000	1084000	to form a full electrode
1084000	1086000	to do
1086000	1088000	the analysis of CV
1088000	1090000	and GC.
1090000	1092000	In terms of CV,
1092000	1094000	we can get
1094000	1096000	the characteristics of the lithium-ion
1096000	1098000	we just talked about,
1098000	1100000	which is that it is a rectangular CV.
1100000	1102000	In terms of GC,
1102000	1104000	we also get
1104000	1106000	a oblique GC.
1106000	1108000	At the same time,
1108000	1110000	due to the combination of NIOBIA,
1110000	1112000	we not only
1112000	1114000	increase the energy density
1114000	1116000	at low power,
1116000	1118000	but also increase the energy density
1118000	1120000	at high power.
1120000	1122000	At the power of
1122000	1124000	3000W per kg,
1124000	1126000	we can store
1126000	1128000	up to 23W
1128000	1130000	per kg of energy density.
1134000	1136000	Next,
1136000	1138000	I will briefly summarize the figure on the right.
1138000	1140000	The first part
1140000	1142000	is that we use the amount of Cdc
1142000	1144000	to adjust the airtightness and
1144000	1146000	conductivity of the NRC composite material.
1146000	1148000	At the same time,
1148000	1150000	it has high energy and
1150000	1152000	fast charging characteristics.
1152000	1154000	In other words,
1154000	1156000	we use Cdc as the starting point
1156000	1158000	to mix different NIOBIA
1158000	1160000	to increase its energy density.
1160000	1162000	By maximizing the airtightness and conductivity,
1162000	1164000	we can increase
1164000	1166000	the overall
1166000	1168000	energy density of the NRC
1168000	1170000	and preserve
1170000	1172000	the high power characteristics of Cdc.
1178000	1180000	The second part
1180000	1182000	I want to share is
1182000	1184000	the LNVOPF material
1184000	1186000	as a medical equipment energy supply application.
1188000	1190000	Speaking of medical equipment energy supply,
1190000	1192000	I will use
1192000	1194000	an implantable
1194000	1196000	cardioverter
1196000	1198000	defibrillator
1198000	1200000	ICD
1200000	1202000	as an example.
1202000	1204000	Its Chinese name is
1204000	1206000	implantable defibrillator.
1208000	1210000	It basically
1210000	1212000	detects your heart beat.
1212000	1214000	When your heart beats abnormally,
1214000	1216000	it will use
1216000	1218000	high current to stimulate your heart beat.
1218000	1220000	For example,
1220000	1222000	when your heart stops beating,
1222000	1224000	it will stimulate your heart beat.
1226000	1228000	I am not a medical background,
1228000	1230000	so I only understand
1230000	1232000	the basic concept of this device.
1232000	1234000	The main usage method
1234000	1236000	is still left to the doctor.
1238000	1240000	ICD
1240000	1242000	mainly uses
1242000	1244000	high current and low current output.
1244000	1246000	The low current part
1246000	1248000	is mainly responsible for the battery.
1250000	1252000	The high current part
1252000	1254000	is responsible for the circuit board.
1258000	1260000	There is also a device size
1260000	1262000	at the bottom.
1262000	1264000	The size is about one-fourth of the heart.
1264000	1266000	Most of the area
1266000	1268000	is actually from the low-voltage circuit.
1272000	1274000	Another
1274000	1276000	medical device
1278000	1280000	is
1280000	1282000	DBS
1282000	1284000	Deep Brain Stimulator.
1284000	1286000	Deep Brain Stimulator.
1288000	1290000	This type of device
1290000	1292000	has the same principle,
1292000	1294000	but the current demand
1294000	1296000	is smaller than ICD.
1298000	1300000	DBS mainly stimulates
1300000	1302000	the brain nerve.
1302000	1304000	DBS mainly stimulates
1304000	1306000	the brain nerve.
1306000	1308000	DBS mainly stimulates
1308000	1310000	the brain nerve.
1312000	1314000	The power supply
1314000	1316000	is also made up of
1316000	1318000	a battery and a circuit.
1318000	1320000	When we want to
1320000	1322000	put this medical device
1322000	1324000	in the body,
1324000	1326000	we hope that
1326000	1328000	its size can be smaller and better
1328000	1330000	to save more space.
1330000	1332000	For example,
1332000	1334000	we want to find a material
1334000	1336000	that has the characteristics of a battery and a circuit.
1338000	1340000	We need to make a device
1340000	1342000	either a circuit
1342000	1344000	or a battery.
1344000	1346000	We want to make a device
1346000	1348000	that prefers a battery
1348000	1350000	because the size of the battery is smaller.
1350000	1352000	We use a single storage device
1352000	1354000	to provide these two currents.
1354000	1356000	This way we can save a lot of
1356000	1358000	the power supply
1358000	1360000	and medical equipment space.
1364000	1366000	This material
1366000	1368000	is
1368000	1370000	LNVOPF.
1372000	1374000	LNVOPF
1374000	1376000	mainly comes from
1376000	1378000	the transformation of
1378000	1380000	the structure of
1380000	1382000	the nascon-nucleotide conductor.
1382000	1384000	After being mixed,
1384000	1386000	the voltage of the
1386000	1388000	LNVOPF
1388000	1390000	increases,
1390000	1392000	which means it can
1392000	1394000	store more energy.
1394000	1396000	When I
1396000	1398000	put this
1398000	1400000	in the body,
1400000	1402000	the change in
1402000	1404000	the size of the
1404000	1406000	LNVOPF
1406000	1408000	also decreases.
1408000	1410000	This means that
1410000	1412000	the size of the
1412000	1414000	LNVOPF
1414000	1416000	is similar to
1416000	1418000	the lithium carbon dioxide
1418000	1420000	in the battery.
1420000	1422000	The most important thing is
1422000	1424000	that this material
1424000	1426000	has the characteristics of
1426000	1428000	battery and current.
1428000	1430000	Next we will introduce
1430000	1432000	another way to
1432000	1434000	distinguish the battery
1434000	1436000	from the current,
1436000	1438000	which is to use
1438000	1440000	X-ray diffraction
1440000	1442000	XRD analysis
1442000	1444000	to find out
1444000	1446000	if there is a change
1446000	1448000	in the structure of the
1448000	1450000	metal body,
1450000	1452000	which is the
1452000	1454000	x-ray diffraction
1454000	1456000	in the material.
1456000	1458000	In general, the charge of the
1458000	1460000	battery follows the
1460000	1462000	x-ray diffraction,
1462000	1464000	while the charge of the
1464000	1466000	nucleotide is
1466000	1468000	stored in the
1468000	1470000	solid.
1470000	1472000	In low voltage peak,
1472000	1474000	it follows the x-ray diffraction,
1474000	1476000	while in high voltage peak,
1476000	1478000	there is no x-ray diffraction.
1478000	1480000	This means that this material
1480000	1482000	can be used as a battery
1482000	1484000	in low voltage,
1484000	1486000	and can be used as a current
1486000	1488000	in high voltage.
1488000	1490000	But this
1490000	1492000	thing is not as simple as you think.
1492000	1494000	This material
1494000	1496000	is charged twice
1496000	1498000	every hour
1498000	1500000	Here,
1500000	1502000	let me introduce a little bit.
1502000	1504000	When we talk about charging,
1504000	1506000	we use a unit called C-ray.
1506000	1508000	This unit
1508000	1510000	C-ray
1510000	1512000	Everyone says a few Cs,
1512000	1514000	which means it can charge several times
1514000	1516000	in an hour.
1516000	1518000	So in this material,
1518000	1520000	it charges twice
1520000	1522000	every hour,
1522000	1524000	which is the part of 2C.
1524000	1526000	Basically, it can also store
1526000	1528000	80-90% of the charge.
1528000	1530000	But when you
1530000	1532000	shorten the charging time to
1532000	1534000	3 minutes, it can only charge
1534000	1536000	8%.
1536000	1538000	The reason is that during the charging process,
1538000	1540000	it will charge the battery first.
1540000	1542000	Then it
1542000	1544000	goes through the capacitor part.
1544000	1546000	But because the charging speed of the battery part
1546000	1548000	is too slow today,
1548000	1550000	I can't even charge the capacitor.
1550000	1552000	So
1552000	1554000	it's a bit like this.
1554000	1556000	Mainly because the charging speed of the battery
1556000	1558000	is too slow,
1558000	1560000	the overall charging speed
1560000	1562000	will decrease.
1562000	1564000	Next,
1564000	1566000	this study
1566000	1568000	is to use
1568000	1570000	the material nanometrization
1570000	1572000	to shorten the time
1572000	1574000	and distance
1574000	1576000	of the particles in the material
1576000	1578000	to increase the
1578000	1580000	charging speed of the material.
1580000	1582000	Next,
1582000	1584000	we are going to synthesize
1584000	1586000	this nanometer NVOPF
1586000	1588000	and discuss
1588000	1590000	the size of the size
1590000	1592000	for fast charging.
1592000	1594000	First, the way we make it is
1594000	1596000	to put all our
1596000	1598000	materials into
1598000	1600000	this solvent thermal
1600000	1602000	method to synthesize. We also put it
1602000	1604000	into the pressure suit.
1604000	1606000	After
1606000	1608000	12 hours,
1608000	1610000	after 185°C,
1610000	1612000	we take out the material and
1612000	1614000	clean it.
1614000	1616000	We will dry it.
1616000	1618000	Next, we use
1618000	1620000	XRD, X-ray diffraction, to confirm the material.
1620000	1622000	After confirming that the material
1622000	1624000	has no problems and no impurities
1624000	1626000	in it, we will make it
1626000	1628000	an electrode for electromagnetic testing.
1632000	1634000	Here,
1634000	1636000	we use
1636000	1638000	the ratio of the material
1638000	1640000	and the temperature of the
1640000	1642000	synthesis to get different
1642000	1644000	shapes of NVOPF.
1644000	1646000	Basically, this NVOPF is a
1646000	1648000	rectangular body.
1648000	1650000	We usually get a brick
1650000	1652000	shape.
1652000	1654000	If it is longer,
1654000	1656000	it becomes a rod.
1656000	1658000	If it is shorter, it becomes a pellet.
1658000	1660000	If the pellet is small, it becomes a particle.
1660000	1662000	We are going to
1662000	1664000	discuss the shape
1664000	1666000	of the NVOPF
1666000	1668000	and the size of it.
1668000	1670000	We will also discuss the impact of its
1670000	1672000	reaction speed.
1672000	1674000	Next, we
1674000	1676000	use the b-value method
1676000	1678000	to analyze
1678000	1680000	the properties of the fast charge.
1682000	1684000	In the first step, we
1684000	1686000	make a different number of
1686000	1688000	CVs for the material.
1688000	1690000	From these four peaks,
1690000	1692000	we can get
1692000	1694000	individual b-values.
1696000	1698000	Then, we make
1698000	1700000	b-values with different
1700000	1702000	aspect ratios,
1702000	1704000	different widths,
1704000	1706000	and its size
1706000	1708000	to see
1708000	1710000	how it changes.
1712000	1714000	On the left,
1714000	1716000	this is the NVOPF
1716000	1718000	pellet.
1718000	1720000	On the right,
1720000	1722000	we use the rod
1722000	1724000	to make changes.
1724000	1726000	The aspect ratio
1726000	1728000	gradually decreases to
1728000	1730000	the brick shape,
1730000	1732000	and finally to the pellet shape.
1732000	1734000	The b-value
1734000	1736000	decreases as the aspect ratio
1736000	1738000	decreases.
1738000	1740000	When we decrease the aspect ratio
1740000	1742000	of the material,
1742000	1744000	the characteristics of the fast charge
1744000	1746000	will be more and more like a capacitor.
1746000	1748000	It can be used
1748000	1750000	as a material for high-speed charge.
1752000	1754000	On the other hand,
1754000	1756000	we also
1756000	1758000	compare
1758000	1760000	the particle size
1760000	1762000	to the b-value.
1762000	1764000	We combine
1764000	1766000	microns
1766000	1768000	and microns.
1768000	1770000	Then, we reduce to nanometers.
1770000	1772000	From hundreds of nanometers
1772000	1774000	to dozens of nanometers.
1774000	1776000	We can see that
1776000	1778000	when the size decreases,
1778000	1780000	the b-value also increases.
1780000	1782000	The increase in b-value
1782000	1784000	means that the smaller the particle,
1784000	1786000	the more suitable it is
1786000	1788000	to be used
1788000	1790000	as a capacitor.
1796000	1798000	The focus here
1798000	1800000	is on the microbrick.
1800000	1802000	Its peak b-value
1802000	1804000	is close to 0.5.
1804000	1806000	0.5 means
1806000	1808000	the same reaction as a battery.
1808000	1810000	When we make a nanoparticle,
1810000	1812000	all the reactions
1812000	1814000	of the oxidation reaction
1814000	1816000	have a b-value
1816000	1818000	of 0.7 or higher.
1822000	1824000	Next,
1824000	1826000	we do the charge-resistance test.
1826000	1828000	The nanoparticle
1828000	1830000	of NVOPF
1830000	1832000	can charge up to 90%
1832000	1834000	in 2 hours
1834000	1836000	in 3 minutes.
1836000	1838000	This means that
1838000	1840000	after the nanoparticle
1840000	1842000	of NVOPF
1842000	1844000	has been nanoparticulated,
1844000	1846000	the reaction rate
1846000	1848000	of the battery
1848000	1850000	has increased significantly.
1850000	1852000	This also leads to an increase
1852000	1854000	in the reaction rate of our capacitors.
1854000	1856000	The NVOPF
1856000	1858000	and nanoparticles
1858000	1860000	of NVOPF
1860000	1862000	can charge up to 80%
1862000	1864000	in 100 seconds.
1868000	1870000	We mainly test
1870000	1872000	two temperatures.
1872000	1874000	The first is room temperature.
1874000	1876000	The second is 37 degrees,
1876000	1878000	which is our human body temperature.
1878000	1880000	The main reason for this test
1880000	1882000	is that we want to put this material
1882000	1884000	into the human body.
1884000	1886000	In this environment,
1886000	1888000	the NVOPF
1888000	1890000	can charge up to 80%
1890000	1892000	in 100 seconds
1892000	1894000	in the human body
1894000	1896000	temperature.
1896000	1898000	The energy
1898000	1900000	of the NVOPF
1900000	1902000	can reach
1902000	1904000	100 watts
1904000	1906000	per kilogram
1906000	1908000	in 4000 watts
1908000	1910000	per kilogram.
1910000	1912000	This means that
1912000	1914000	the energy density
1914000	1916000	of the NVOPF
1916000	1918000	can reach 100 watts
1918000	1920000	per kilogram.
1922000	1924000	Finally, we apply
1924000	1926000	this material
1926000	1928000	to the
1928000	1930000	Deep Brain Stimulator
1930000	1932000	DBS application.
1932000	1934000	We all know that
1936000	1938000	this device
1938000	1940000	must have
1940000	1942000	a soldering mode
1942000	1944000	and a battery mode.
1944000	1946000	We charge it
1946000	1948000	with a fixed current.
1948000	1950000	Then the current
1950000	1952000	will convert the energy
1952000	1954000	to output
1954000	1956000	in the form of a capacitor.
1956000	1958000	So we designed
1958000	1960000	two different modes.
1960000	1962000	The first is the capacitor mode,
1962000	1964000	which means that both charging and discharging
1964000	1966000	are soldering.
1966000	1968000	The capacitor mode
1968000	1970000	allows us to
1970000	1972000	detect
1972000	1974000	the overall
1974000	1976000	amount of current
1976000	1978000	in the body.
1978000	1980000	The discharging mode
1980000	1982000	allows us to
1982000	1984000	give feedback to the body
1984000	1986000	and use the current
1986000	1988000	to perform different
1988000	1990000	treatments.
1990000	1992000	So there are these two modes.
1994000	1996000	The battery mode
1996000	1998000	uses the soldering mode
1998000	2000000	to charge the battery.
2000000	2002000	The capacitor mode
2002000	2004000	uses the
2004000	2006000	discharging mode
2006000	2008000	to discharge.
2008000	2010000	So the capacitor mode is
2010000	2012000	discharging.
2012000	2014000	The battery mode
2014000	2016000	uses the discharging mode
2016000	2018000	to discharge.
2018000	2020000	So basically,
2020000	2022000	we use these two modes
2022000	2024000	to operate the battery.
2024000	2026000	The battery
2026000	2028000	can discharge
2028000	2030000	up to 1,000 rounds
2030000	2032000	in this mode
2032000	2034000	with the
2034000	2036000	electric current
2036000	2038000	and the high-speed
2038000	2040000	discharging current
2040000	2042000	of the soldering current.
2042000	2044000	In each round,
2044000	2046000	it can provide
2046000	2048000	at least 3,000 soldering
2048000	2050000	to measure
2050000	2052000	and give feedback.
2052000	2054000	The battery can also
2054000	2056000	provide 60% electric current.
2056000	2058000	Let's compare
2058000	2060000	our battery
2060000	2062000	with the current
2062000	2064000	DBS specifications.
2064000	2066000	Basically,
2066000	2068000	our output current
2068000	2070000	is from 4,000
2070000	2072000	microampere,
2072000	2074000	which is 4 mA
2074000	2076000	to 12 mA.
2076000	2078000	Compared to the current specifications,
2078000	2080000	our current
2080000	2082000	output current
2082000	2084000	is greater than
2084000	2086000	these specifications.
2086000	2088000	In terms of frequency,
2088000	2090000	we can only measure
2090000	2092000	a few microseconds
2092000	2094000	on the device
2094000	2096000	because
2096000	2098000	the device
2098000	2100000	only measures 50Hz.
2100000	2102000	This 50Hz
2102000	2104000	also covers
2104000	2106000	the frequency required
2106000	2108000	for some of these functions.
2110000	2112000	Next,
2112000	2114000	I will use this graph
2114000	2116000	to make a brief summary.
2116000	2118000	In the second part,
2118000	2120000	we use nanoparticle
2120000	2122000	to convert the
2122000	2124000	NBOPF, which cannot be
2124000	2126000	fast charged,
2126000	2128000	into fast charge.
2128000	2130000	In addition,
2130000	2132000	we also proved the
2132000	2134000	feasibility of the
2134000	2136000	soldering current
2136000	2138000	in DBS.
2138000	2140000	Let me make a brief summary.
2140000	2142000	What is
2142000	2144000	the so-called
2144000	2146000	take-home message?
2146000	2148000	First, I hope everyone
2148000	2150000	knows what a soldering current is.
2150000	2152000	A soldering current is
2152000	2154000	actually a storage mechanism
2154000	2156000	that has the power of the
2156000	2158000	soldering current and the
2158000	2160000	density of the battery.
2162000	2164000	The second point is
2164000	2166000	how we can judge the soldering current.
2166000	2168000	Of course, it is through
2168000	2170000	the method of electromagnetic mechanics.
2170000	2172000	We have such a CV,
2172000	2174000	a oblique GC,
2174000	2176000	and no change
2176000	2178000	in the material during
2178000	2180000	the oxidation process.
2182000	2184000	Finally,
2184000	2186000	how do we design a soldering current?
2186000	2188000	Mainly,
2188000	2190000	there are three points in my demo.
2190000	2192000	The first is
2192000	2194000	the conductivity and
2194000	2196000	airtightness.
2196000	2198000	The conductivity and
2198000	2200000	airtightness of my electrode
2200000	2202000	can optimize my soldering current.
2202000	2204000	The second point is
2204000	2206000	to nanomaterialize the material
2206000	2208000	and adjust its phase change
2208000	2210000	so that the material of our
2210000	2212000	general battery
2212000	2214000	is not
2214000	2216000	too slow
2216000	2218000	in the transfer of ions.
2218000	2220000	In the part of the battery,
2220000	2222000	it can
2222000	2224000	reach the high speed
2224000	2226000	charging point.
2234000	2236000	Thank you for your attention.
2236000	2238000	If you have any questions,
2240000	2242000	please feel free to ask.
2242000	2244000	Thank you.
2244000	2246000	Thank you, Matt.
2246000	2248000	Now we can
2248000	2250000	start the Q&A.
2250000	2252000	In the chat box,
2252000	2254000	Gavin has some questions.
2254000	2256000	Do you want to unmute
2256000	2258000	and ask your question?
2264000	2266000	I would like to ask
2266000	2268000	what is the electrolyte used
2268000	2270000	when you start soldering?
2270000	2272000	It should be an organic electrolyte.
2272000	2274000	Because your reference electrode
2274000	2276000	is for aluminum.
2276000	2278000	That's right.
2278000	2280000	I use
2280000	2282000	LiPF6
2282000	2284000	ECDMC.
2284000	2286000	It is an electrolyte
2286000	2288000	for lithium battery.
2288000	2290000	So we can understand
2290000	2292000	why your lowest voltage
2292000	2294000	is around 1.2V.
2294000	2296000	Another question is
2296000	2298000	what is the distribution
2298000	2300000	of the oxygen-oxide
2300000	2302000	in the electrode?
2302000	2304000	Because recently,
2304000	2306000	there is no supercapacitor.
2306000	2308000	I believe the distribution
2308000	2310000	of oxygen-oxide
2310000	2312000	should be an interesting
2312000	2314000	or important question.
2314000	2316000	Basically,
2316000	2318000	the distribution
2318000	2320000	is between
2320000	2322000	1.2V and
2322000	2324000	1.2V to 3V.
2328000	2330000	Here.
2330000	2332000	The distribution
2332000	2334000	is from 1.2V
2334000	2336000	to 2.5V.
2336000	2338000	Here.
2338000	2340000	The capacity
2340000	2342000	of niobium oxide
2342000	2344000	should be
2344000	2346000	200mA.
2346000	2348000	When it is full, it is 200mA.
2348000	2350000	From 1.2V to 2.5V
2350000	2352000	means 90% of the voltage
2352000	2354000	comes from here.
2354000	2356000	Does it mean that
2356000	2358000	when it is less than 1.2V,
2358000	2360000	it will be more than 2.5V?
2360000	2362000	When it is less than 1.2V,
2362000	2364000	the electrolyte will be dissociated.
2364000	2366000	The material won't be dissociated.
2366000	2368000	When it is more than 2.5V,
2368000	2370000	you can't see
2370000	2372000	the value of the current.
2372000	2374000	The current will be
2374000	2376000	close to zero.
2376000	2378000	It is the same as
2378000	2380000	this picture.
2380000	2382000	The CV is the same.
2382000	2384000	It will be less than
2384000	2386000	3V.
2386000	2388000	Basically, it is less than 3V.
2388000	2390000	OK.
2390000	2392000	You showed this slide,
2392000	2394000	so I want to ask you
2394000	2396000	the following question.
2396000	2398000	How do you calculate
2398000	2400000	the B-value and the electrolyte?
2400000	2402000	We scan different CVs.
2402000	2404000	Each CV
2404000	2406000	has a current
2406000	2408000	at each voltage.
2408000	2410000	We analyze
2410000	2412000	each current
2412000	2414000	for the change of the minority.
2414000	2416000	B-value should be
2416000	2418000	less than 3V,
2418000	2420000	or it doesn't matter
2420000	2422000	even if it is any current.
2422000	2424000	In pseudo-capacitor,
2424000	2426000	basically,
2426000	2428000	there are
2428000	2430000	consecutive
2430000	2432000	redox reactions.
2432000	2434000	When you produce
2434000	2436000	a box,
2436000	2438000	you only analyze
2438000	2440000	the current at the peak.
2440000	2442000	You are not fair
2442000	2444000	to the electrons
2444000	2446000	Basically,
2446000	2448000	in pseudo-capacitor,
2448000	2450000	you can use this formula
2450000	2452000	on all CVs
2452000	2454000	to draw the continuous curve.
2454000	2456000	Another story
2456000	2458000	behind this is
2458000	2460000	the redox happens
2460000	2462000	below 2V.
2462000	2464000	It is less than 2V.
2464000	2466000	What do you see without redox?
2466000	2468000	You see EDLC.
2468000	2470000	What does EDLC mean?
2470000	2472000	EDLC means
2472000	2474000	the reaction
2474000	2476000	of the electron.
2476000	2478000	For example,
2478000	2480000	the electron travels
2480000	2482000	from far away
2482000	2484000	to the surface of the electrode.
2484000	2486000	What do you mean by diffusion control?
2486000	2488000	Yes.
2488000	2490000	In addition,
2490000	2492000	we increase
2492000	2494000	the density of Cdc,
2494000	2496000	which increases the vacuum of the electrode.
2496000	2498000	Without redox,
2498000	2500000	the kinetic
2500000	2502000	energy of the electrode
2502000	2504000	increases.
2504000	2506000	With redox,
2506000	2508000	the kinetic energy of the electrode
2508000	2510000	also increases.
2510000	2512000	Any other questions?
2512000	2514000	Thank you.
2514000	2516000	The last question
2516000	2518000	is the last one.
2518000	2520000	Any other questions?
2520000	2522000	I will ask later.
2522000	2524000	Any other
2524000	2526000	questions?
2526000	2528000	Hello.
2528000	2530000	I would like to ask Matt
2530000	2532000	some questions.
2534000	2536000	Matt, thank you for your speech.
2536000	2538000	My main question is
2538000	2540000	about your first project.
2540000	2542000	At that time,
2542000	2544000	I would like to know
2544000	2546000	the particle size of
2546000	2548000	Nairobia.
2548000	2550000	The particle size
2550000	2552000	is about
2552000	2554000	here.
2554000	2556000	You can see it in the upper right corner.
2556000	2558000	The particle size is
2558000	2560000	about 20-30 nm.
2560000	2562000	20-30 nm.
2562000	2564000	So,
2564000	2566000	you will combine
2566000	2568000	reduced graphene oxide and Cdc
2568000	2570000	to increase
2570000	2572000	the conductivity of the electrode.
2572000	2574000	That's right.
2574000	2576000	Cdc also provides vacuum.
2576000	2578000	OK.
2578000	2580000	I am doing research on
2580000	2582000	hierarchical porous carbons.
2582000	2584000	There are
2584000	2586000	small micropores
2586000	2588000	and large macropores.
2588000	2590000	So,
2590000	2592000	I am thinking
2592000	2594000	that if we combine
2594000	2596000	other vacuum materials,
2596000	2598000	will it increase
2598000	2600000	the conductivity of the electrode?
2600000	2602000	Yes.
2602000	2604000	Because
2604000	2606000	I have enough vacuum,
2606000	2608000	I can
2608000	2610000	absorb more
2610000	2612000	electrolytes
2612000	2614000	into the electrode.
2616000	2618000	There is a slide
2618000	2620000	that I did not show.
2620000	2622000	We still have some time.
2622000	2624000	You can see
2624000	2626000	why Nairobia requires
2626000	2628000	a large vacuum.
2628000	2630000	Basically,
2630000	2632000	it comes from
2632000	2634000	OK.
2634000	2636000	This slide
2636000	2638000	shows the result
2638000	2640000	calculated by
2640000	2642000	Nernst
2642000	2644000	equation
2644000	2646000	and Poisson equation.
2646000	2648000	Poisson equation
2648000	2650000	represents the
2650000	2652000	dielectric constant
2652000	2654000	of the material.
2654000	2656000	So, under different voltages,
2656000	2658000	how many electrons
2658000	2660000	are on the surface.
2660000	2662000	When the voltage
2662000	2664000	moves to
2664000	2666000	the middle of the graph,
2666000	2668000	the capacitive part
2668000	2670000	shows how many electrons
2670000	2672000	are on the surface of the material.
2672000	2674000	But when the voltage
2674000	2676000	moves to a certain level,
2676000	2678000	Nairobia starts to react.
2678000	2680000	I need a large amount of
2680000	2682000	electrons to enter the material.
2682000	2684000	So, when it needs a large amount of electrons
2684000	2686000	to enter the material,
2686000	2688000	it will cause a surface vacuum.
2688000	2690000	The surface vacuum
2690000	2692000	is the reason
2692000	2694000	why Nairobia's
2694000	2696000	connectivity drops.
2696000	2698000	That's why
2698000	2700000	the material needs
2700000	2702000	higher concavity
2702000	2704000	to maintain
2704000	2706000	the characteristics of
2706000	2708000	the capacitive part
2708000	2710000	at high speed
2710000	2712000	or at high voltage.
2714000	2716000	I have a follow-up question.
2716000	2718000	How did you come up with
2718000	2720000	reducing graphene oxide
2720000	2722000	with Cdc?
2722000	2724000	Reducing graphene oxide
2724000	2726000	has another advantage
2726000	2728000	in the synthesis.
2728000	2730000	Basically,
2730000	2732000	if you want to grow oxide,
2732000	2734000	the oxygen ligand
2734000	2736000	of graphene oxide
2736000	2738000	can be the nucleation site
2738000	2740000	of these oxides.
2740000	2742000	Whether you want to grow metal particles
2742000	2744000	or oxide particles,
2744000	2746000	they are easy to grow on top.
2746000	2748000	Since there are many sites,
2748000	2750000	the particles can grow
2750000	2752000	very small.
2754000	2756000	Graphene oxide
2756000	2758000	is like an additive.
2758000	2760000	It can make your particle size very small.
2760000	2762000	Second, it also increases
2762000	2764000	the conductivity.
2764000	2766000	In the case of graphene oxide,
2766000	2768000	there are several ways to produce electricity.
2768000	2770000	For example, when you do filtration,
2770000	2772000	you use filtration to make it stack together.
2772000	2774000	Because it is
2774000	2776000	a two-dimensional structure,
2776000	2778000	so when you do filtration,
2778000	2780000	it will naturally
2780000	2782000	become a very dense electrode.
2782000	2784000	If it is a very dense electrode,
2784000	2786000	basically,
2786000	2788000	the electrolyte cannot penetrate.
2788000	2790000	So we want to find
2790000	2792000	a special structure,
2792000	2794000	which is Cdc.
2796000	2798000	This kind of
2798000	2800000	structure of graphene oxide
2800000	2802000	is mixed inside.
2802000	2804000	But we don't want to mix too much,
2804000	2806000	because if we mix too much,
2806000	2808000	the density of the energy
2808000	2810000	will be relatively reduced.
2810000	2812000	Got it.
2812000	2814000	Thank you.
2816000	2818000	Are there any other questions?
2824000	2826000	If not,
2826000	2828000	I will ask my last question.
2828000	2830000	After talking about ZMath,
2830000	2832000	you mentioned
2832000	2834000	how to distinguish the battery,
2834000	2836000	but now
2836000	2838000	in the telecom industry,
2838000	2840000	there is a more popular topic,
2840000	2842000	which is solid-state electrolyte or solid-state electrolyte.
2842000	2844000	I want to know
2844000	2846000	the difference between
2846000	2848000	solid-state electrolyte
2848000	2850000	and the other two,
2850000	2852000	or how to distinguish them.
2854000	2856000	Actually,
2856000	2858000	I haven't done the study electrolyte part.
2858000	2860000	You want to ask
2860000	2862000	the study electrolyte part, right?
2862000	2864000	Because I mentioned that
2864000	2866000	the second topic,
2866000	2868000	solid-state electrolyte,
2868000	2870000	is also a popular topic.
2870000	2872000	Yes, it used to be
2872000	2874000	solid-state electrolyte,
2874000	2876000	but we changed
2876000	2878000	its structure,
2878000	2880000	and used it as an electrolyte.
2882000	2884000	Basically,
2884000	2886000	solid-state electrolyte,
2888000	2890000	I don't know much about it.
2890000	2892000	What I know about solid-state electrolyte
2892000	2894000	is that
2894000	2896000	its conductivity
2896000	2898000	must be very thin.
2898000	2900000	Because its conductivity is not as fast as liquid.
2900000	2902000	Although it is a solid-state electrolyte,
2902000	2904000	it is not as fast as liquid.
2904000	2906000	Another thing is that
2906000	2908000	everyone says that
2908000	2910000	solid-state electrolyte
2912000	2914000	can avoid
2914000	2916000	SEI reaction.
2916000	2918000	But in fact,
2918000	2920000	this is a mistake.
2920000	2922000	In fact, solid-state electrolyte
2922000	2924000	will have a big effect
2924000	2926000	on its SEI
2926000	2928000	in its first cycle.
2928000	2930000	In our group,
2930000	2932000	in addition to doing high-speed charge,
2932000	2934000	another part is
2934000	2936000	3D battery.
2936000	2938000	3D battery is to make some
2938000	2940000	electrical structure to make it a satellite battery.
2940000	2942000	In that part,
2944000	2946000	for solid-state electrolyte,
2946000	2948000	we hope to use solid-state electrolyte.
2948000	2950000	Because solid-state electrolyte
2950000	2952000	has a higher density
2952000	2954000	than liquid.
2954000	2956000	So we can save a lot of liquid
2956000	2958000	needed volume.
2958000	2960000	But they found that in the first cycle,
2960000	2962000	this SEI
2962000	2964000	will still occur.
2964000	2966000	And after it occurs,
2966000	2968000	because it is a solid-state electrolyte,
2968000	2970000	it is very difficult to solve.
2970000	2972000	Basically, your material is closely connected at the beginning.
2972000	2974000	But after the first cycle,
2974000	2976000	it will separate.
2980000	2982000	Thank you for your answer.
2986000	2988000	Are there any other questions?
2994000	2996000	If there are no questions,
2996000	2998000	Max,
2998000	3000000	did you leave your email?
3000000	3002000	Yes,
3002000	3004000	I put it in the last slide.
3008000	3010000	If you have any questions,
3010000	3012000	you can
3014000	3016000	send me an email.
3020000	3022000	Thank you for your participation.
3022000	3024000	Thank you, Max,
3024000	3026000	for giving us such a wonderful speech.
3028000	3030000	This recording
3030000	3032000	will be available online
3032000	3034000	in about a week.
3034000	3036000	You can continue
3036000	3038000	to discuss
3038000	3040000	with Max
3040000	3042000	related research.
3042000	3044000	Thank you.
