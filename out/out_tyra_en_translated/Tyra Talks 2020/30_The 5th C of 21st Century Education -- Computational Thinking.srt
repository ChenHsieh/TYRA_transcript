1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome everyone to today's presentation.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today's speaker is Joey Huang.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are very honored to invite him to give this presentation.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let me briefly introduce today's speaker.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Joey Huang is currently a postdoc in the School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
She received her Ph.D. in Learning and Developmental Sciences from Indiana University, Bloomington.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Coming from a background of educational psychology and computing, her research focuses on computational thinking, collaboration, and STEM learning.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:59,000
As a learning scientist by training, she aims to create more interesting and inspiring learning environments to promote equity and collaboration.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Today's topic is the 5th C of 21st Century Education, Computational Thinking.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Without further ado, I will hand over to Joey Huang.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the chat area.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will forward the questions to him.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now I will ask him to start his presentation.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you for your introduction, Haoran.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Has everyone seen my screen?

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the chat area.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't see most of you right now.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Most of you didn't turn on the video.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's okay.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
As long as you can see me.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the chat area.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you have any questions, please leave a comment in the chat area.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
As I mentioned, I am a PhD student at UCI.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have three main purposes for this presentation.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I hope you can take this with you when you listen to it.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
First, this presentation will provide you with a basic idea of computational thinking.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What is computational thinking?

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why do we need to care about it?

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Second, I hope you can take this with you when you listen to this presentation.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You will experience the process of computational thinking.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You will interact with each other.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Not interacting with each other.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will give you a little experience.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lastly, I hope you can take it easy.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Whether it's morning, afternoon, or evening.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No matter where you are.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you for coming today.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I am happy to share this topic with you.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is my first time presenting my research in Chinese.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's a new experience for me.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't think there are many people studying education or learning sciences in this group.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I hope you can take this with you when you listen to this presentation.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can also interact with each other.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
First, I will talk about computational thinking.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's called computational thinking in English.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is the 25th century education's 5th C.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What is the 5th C?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It means that there are 4 Cs in front of me.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The 4 Cs in front of me come from a partnership for 21st century learning.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a P21, a non-profit organization in the US.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a collaborative research organization with a research team.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There are 4 Cs in front of me.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can you guess what the other 4 Cs are?

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, and Creativity.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why is computational thinking the 5th C?

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Next slide.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's talk about why we talk about computational thinking.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The so-called question is often used in our research.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
People will say that it sounds good.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So what?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So why do we talk about it?

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's talk about AI first.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Artificial Intelligence.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know if you have seen the Westworld documentary.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a documentary about how humans interact with AI.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hello, I can see the chat.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If you don't have any questions, just type them in the chat.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I can see them.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
On the left, you can see a robot's hand.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
On the right, you can see a human's hand.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This documentary is a bit exaggerated.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you look at it realistically,

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you may have heard that

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
some jobs will be replaced in the next few years.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Or some jobs will no longer exist.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The professor is being discussed.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
My opinion is that

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
it's hard to replace the professor.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He has a meaning.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But teaching is dangerous.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So in the future,

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
there may be robots in classrooms

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
from K-12 to kindergarten.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There may be robots in classrooms from 4 to 18.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They will assist teachers and students.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This development is not only a global trend.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will use the United States as an example.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is a comment from the Wall Street Journal.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is a report from NSF this year.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In August this year,

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
NSF was the first round of AI institutes.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There are more than 20 million institutes.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In the next five years,

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
they will use this fund to develop different AI projects.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Some of these projects are related to the future of work.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Some of them are related to education.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Most of them are discussing

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
how to make AI more advanced.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
On the other hand,

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
it's a bit like a turning point in education.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How do we better prepare our next generation

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to face this world?

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you are interested,

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I will share all the resources at the end of the slide.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now I have answered the question about digitalization.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
After all,

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I want to talk about

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the relationship between AI and technology.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
When I was young,

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I may have revealed my age.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
When I was young,

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the first day of computer class,

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the teacher taught me how to turn on and off.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Nowadays,

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
every child has an iPad.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
In class,

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
everyone uses an iPad with a computer,

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
or the iPad is directly integrated into the class.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is very common.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In fact,

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
we have never experienced

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
such a technology-heavy age.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
In fact,

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
this turning point,

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
knowledge loss,

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and experience

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
are all important in education.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So it's not just about the development of AI.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What is computational thinking?

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If we all agree that

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
computational thinking is an important concept,

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
let's talk about the history of computational thinking.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The history of computation

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
can be traced back to the 19th century.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In the 20th century,

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in 1962,

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Alan Perlis, a computer scientist,

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
said that

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
programming is not just a skill.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It can be seen as a theory of computation.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This skill can be applied to other subjects

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
through a way of practicing and thinking.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So he started programming

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
beyond just a keyboard search.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It connects to the thinking of human beings.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's a breakthrough.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But he didn't talk about it later.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then it continued to develop

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
until Pepper and Harrell in 1991,

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
which is about 20 centuries later.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Their first term,

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
this researcher,

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
if you are in education,

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you are familiar with it.

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There is a theory called constructionism.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's Simon Pepper.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Based on MIT Media Lab,

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
they invented a program

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
called Logo Computation

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
for children to learn.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a language for learning programming.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Looking back,

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you might think

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
it's a very low-resolution,

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and it's just a turtle

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that teaches you how to draw shapes.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But in 1991,

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
it was a breakthrough.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So Simon Pepper

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
was the pioneer of constructionism.

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He emphasized learning from doing,

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
gaining knowledge from doing.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So he was the first to

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
combine the terms

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
computation and thinking.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He published this article.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
As for computational thinking,

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
in his research in 1991,

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
he didn't discuss it in depth.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He just mentioned

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
this is computational thinking.

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Computational thinking

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
became very popular

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
in 2006.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
A woman named Jeanette Wing,

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
a computer scientist.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
She published a...

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Here's a screenshot.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If you're interested,

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you can read it.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is what she said.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
She said computational thinking involves

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
solving problems,

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
defining systems,

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and understanding human behavior

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
by drawing on the concepts

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
of fundamental to computer science.

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So she emphasized

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
what computational thinking is.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
She started to define it.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She said it involves

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
defining systems,

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
understanding human behavior,

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and using computational thinking

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
as a foundation

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
in computer science

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to look at the world.

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This research

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
now has over 6,000 citations.

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Almost 7,000.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
From 2006 to now,

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
she was the first

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to promote computational thinking

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
beyond just computation.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It became a way of thinking

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
to look at the world.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
She also said

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
this skill becomes

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the foundation

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
of reading,

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
computing, and writing.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In the 21st century,

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
we're still pushing this concept.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What is computational thinking

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and how do we implement it?

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In general,

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
computational thinking

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
can be divided into

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
logic,

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
inference,

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
calculation,

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and pattern recognition.

235
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know if you've

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
ever done that kind of

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
intelligence test.

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It usually has no words.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It has a series of

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
logic for you to

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
infer what the answer is.

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is just

243
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
one part of computational thinking.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
At the same time,

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
you need to know how to

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
break down the problem

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
into different parts.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
How to solve the problem,

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
guess, and then re-do it.

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Abstraction is a more abstract concept.

251
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's also called abstract.

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's a more abstract concept.

253
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's about how to think

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
in a higher level.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Before you solve the problem,

256
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you need to think

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
in a higher level.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's a bit like

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
if I want to design

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
a system today,

261
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
what do I suppose it will

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
encounter?

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What do I need to solve?

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
These are all important concepts

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
in computational thinking.

266
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Currently,

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
there are a few steps

268
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
in computational thinking.

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
These are all actions.

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You can see it from

271
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
tinkering,

272
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
or designing something,

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
or solving a problem,

274
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
or cooperating with others.

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
These are all

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the ways you can see

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
how computational thinking

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
occurs.

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When you are doing these

280
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
things,

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you may apply these

282
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
actions in computational thinking.

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Today, I will use my research

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
as an example.

285
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My research focuses on

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
collaborating.

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I will talk more

288
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
about this later.

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
To sum up,

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
computational thinking

291
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
includes a series of

292
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
problem-solving processes,

293
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
such as recognizing patterns,

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
systematically breaking down

295
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the problem,

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
or composing an algorithmic

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
solution.

298
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
These are all part of

299
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
computational thinking.

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You can see that

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
this definition is very broad.

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's like,

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
do I know how to program?

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Do I know how to do computational thinking?

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
For example,

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I go to the supermarket

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and list my food list.

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Which side is which session?

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If I can do this

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
grocery shopping

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
in the fastest way,

312
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
do I know how to do

313
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
computational thinking?

314
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
For example,

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
if I need to buy all these

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
in 10 minutes,

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
do I know how to do

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
computational thinking

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
in the shortest way?

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
These are all part of

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
computational thinking.

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's been 14 years

323
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
since 2006.

324
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This field is not

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
well defined yet.

326
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is our Bible.

327
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Computational thinking

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
is still being discussed

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and challenged.

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So, if you know

331
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
what computational thinking is,

332
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and analyze it with your expertise,

333
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I think it will be very helpful

334
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
in this field.

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Now, I will talk about

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
some organizations

337
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
with high credibility

338
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and start

339
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to define computational thinking.

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There are three of them.

341
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
One is

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
CSTA,

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
which stands for

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Center for Teaching Education

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
in the United States.

346
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Another one is

347
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
ISTE,

348
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
which stands for

349
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
International Society for

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Technology in Education.

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's a big organization

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that not only deals with

353
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
computational thinking,

354
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
but also all the applications

355
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
of technology in education.

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This framework is relatively new

357
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
compared to the other two.

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But these three organizations

359
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
have their own standards

360
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and applications

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
for computational thinking.

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The curriculum and skills

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
they need

364
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
are already solid

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and are being

366
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
implemented in education.

367
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I will talk more about

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
how I study

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
computational thinking

370
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
in a moment.

371
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The framework I use

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
is from Brandon and Resnick.

373
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Brandon is a professor

374
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
at Harvard Education.

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Resnick is a professor

376
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
at MIT Media Lab.

377
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
My advisor and my lab

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
have cooperated with them.

379
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This framework is

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
highly credible

381
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and is a group of people

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
who study and explain

383
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
computational thinking.

384
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You are welcome to discuss

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
this framework.

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you have other

387
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
credible frameworks,

388
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you are welcome to talk about it.

389
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Let me talk about

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
the definition of computational thinking.

391
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I will give you

392
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
a clearer picture.

393
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you look at the left side of the picture,

394
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you will see the definition of

395
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
the wide field.

396
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The right side is the definition of the narrow field.

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You can divide

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
computational thinking into

399
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
a group of people who believe

400
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
humans and computers

401
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
can be computational agents.

402
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This means they believe

403
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
computational thinking

404
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
can exist outside of programming.

405
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
For example,

406
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
the example of grocery shopping.

407
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If you are in this group,

408
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
you will think this is true.

409
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The example below is a weaving example.

410
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't know if you like

411
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
weaving or knitting.

412
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Whether it is a sweater,

413
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
a sock, or a basket.

414
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There is a group of people

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
who are studying

416
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
the process of weaving.

417
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I have a lot of logical thinking to look at.

418
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If you look at

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
some of the original works,

420
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
you can see that their patterns

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
are very complicated.

422
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If you want to make these patterns by hand,

423
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
there is a lot of complicated thinking

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
involved.

425
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There is a group of people

426
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
who believe that computational thinking

427
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
can be found in these places

428
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and can be applied.

429
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They will do this series of research.

430
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The middle group of people

431
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
believe that computers

432
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
are computational agents.

433
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They did not completely exclude humans,

434
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
but they did not completely agree.

435
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
They basically believe

436
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that computational systems

437
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
can be applied

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
outside of

439
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
programming and CS.

440
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It can also be benefited

441
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
by other subjects.

442
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
They are more neutral.

443
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
On the far right is a more narrow definition.

444
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They believe that humans

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
are not computational agents.

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
More importantly,

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
below this,

448
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
we can't

449
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
do it.

450
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Computational thinking is completely CS.

451
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If I am not a CS person,

452
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will not be benefited

453
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
by this.

454
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We can say that they are conservative.

455
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Not everyone needs it.

456
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Most people are discussing

457
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
these three groups.

458
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You can choose which group you are

459
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
or which one you think is right.

460
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There is no right or wrong.

461
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It depends on your field

462
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and your training and background

463
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
to train your method.

464
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
My research is more

465
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
towards the middle and left

466
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
wide definition.

467
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I will talk more about

468
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
my research in the future.

469
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Before I talk about my research,

470
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I want to provide you

471
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
a summary of

472
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
K-12 education

473
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
from kindergarten to

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
high school,

475
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
from 4 to 18 years old.

476
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
If you are in Taiwan,

477
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
you are welcome to tell me

478
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
what CS education is like

479
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
in Taiwan.

480
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I have done some research.

481
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I want to know

482
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
if you are in Taiwan

483
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
or you have friends in Taiwan

484
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
who are doing this.

485
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
In the US,

486
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
this report is very new.

487
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It was just released

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
this month.

489
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It is from Coda.org,

490
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
CSTA, ECEP,

491
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Alliance.

492
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I will not go into details.

493
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It is a report with credibility.

494
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It is related to CS education

495
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
every year.

496
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This report was just released this month.

497
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You can see on the upper left,

498
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
CS standards

499
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
from 2017 to 2020,

500
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
from 6 states to

501
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
37 states,

502
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
all have K-12 CS standards.

503
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
If we have standards,

504
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
we need a teacher.

505
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Teachers need to have the ability

506
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
to teach students.

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You may find that

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
in the classroom,

509
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
teachers become

510
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
a weak point of knowledge.

511
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Students use technology

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
too fast.

513
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
They already know these things.

514
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Teachers can't keep up

515
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
with students.

516
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This is like another topic.

517
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We can discuss the relationship

518
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
between teachers and students.

519
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If we go back to

520
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the main topic,

521
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
CS teacher certification

522
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
has been implemented

523
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
in 40 states.

524
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It means that

525
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
if you graduate from a university,

526
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
or get another degree,

527
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
you can get the certification.

528
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Then you can start teaching

529
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
CS in K-12.

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The last chart

531
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
shows the percentage

532
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
of students

533
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
who start teaching CS

534
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
in public schools.

535
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Each state is different.

536
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This chart shows

537
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
47 states.

538
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
This is all public schools,

539
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
not all high schools.

540
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
All public schools teach computer science.

541
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's go back to the chart.

542
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You can see that

543
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
more than 50%

544
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
of students

545
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
are still in development.

546
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Haoran introduced me

547
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
to Indiana.

548
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm in California now.

549
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
In addition to Indiana,

550
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
California also has

551
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
more than 50% of students.

552
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You can see

553
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
where you are.

554
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
This information

555
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
explains

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
that

557
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
less than half of

558
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
public schools

559
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
teach computer science

560
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
in the U.S.

561
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
In addition,

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
less than 50%

563
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
of students

564
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
are from

565
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
rural areas,

566
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
low social status,

567
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and underrepresented groups.

568
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
These people

569
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
are less likely

570
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
to take CS classes.

571
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
CS underrepresented groups

572
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
are not Asian.

573
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Asians and whites

574
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
are in CS dominant groups.

575
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
CS underrepresented groups

576
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
are not Asian

577
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and white.

578
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How can we

579
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
keep this community

580
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
more diverse?

581
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is a very important

582
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
topic in CS education.

583
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Many educators

584
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
support this.

585
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
For example,

586
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
if we want to define

587
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
gender as a traditional term,

588
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
women are also

589
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
an underrepresented group.

590
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
How can we attract

591
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
these underrepresented groups?

592
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This is a very important

593
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
topic in CS education in the U.S.

594
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
How do we

595
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
start to use

596
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
these tools?

597
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
K-12

598
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
has

599
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
thousands of

600
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
tools.

601
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I will share

602
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
some of them with you.

603
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Later,

604
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I will share

605
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
some of them with you.

606
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If you have

607
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
kids at home,

608
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
teachers,

609
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
or researchers,

610
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
you can download

611
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
these tools

612
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and play with them.

613
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
They are all free.

614
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The first category

615
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
is block-based programming.

616
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It is

617
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
a low-floor,

618
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
high-ceiling tool.

619
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Low-floor, high-ceiling

620
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
means

621
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
this tool

622
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
is easy to use.

623
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
There is no

624
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
prior knowledge restriction.

625
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
If I don't have

626
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
programming experience,

627
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I can also

628
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
use it.

629
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It is easy to use.

630
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It is for kids.

631
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
No.

632
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
High-ceiling means

633
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it can be very complicated.

634
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
How to design

635
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
this tool?

636
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It depends on

637
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
researchers' skills.

638
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I listed a few

639
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
that are

640
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
related to

641
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
my research.

642
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Lego is expensive.

643
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I will talk about Lego later.

644
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I am talking about free

645
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
block-based programming.

646
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Blocky is

647
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Google-designed.

648
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Tinker is

649
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
a combination of

650
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
blocks.

651
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You can

652
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
use colors

653
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and squares

654
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
to make a simple

655
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
program.

656
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Later...

657
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Thank you, David.

658
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Later, I will

659
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
talk about Scratch.

660
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Scratch is a tool

661
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
designed by MIT Media Lab

662
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
in 2007.

663
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I will talk about Scratch later.

664
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Taiwan has

665
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
a lot of

666
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
elementary education using Scratch.

667
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
CodeCombat

668
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
is more like a game.

669
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You can use block-based

670
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
programming to

671
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
set your character's skills.

672
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You can...

673
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I haven't played it, but

674
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I saw the video.

675
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You can set your character's skills.

676
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And you can...

677
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You need to use coding

678
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
to build things in the world.

679
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's like an indirect way

680
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
to build a world.

681
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Robotics...

682
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Robotics is another big direction.

683
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You can build

684
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
robots

685
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and introduce robots

686
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
to children.

687
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Some people said

688
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Lego is expensive.

689
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
These three

690
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
blocks are free.

691
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But these are

692
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
commercial products.

693
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's not

694
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
very expensive.

695
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
These two are

696
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
more than $100.

697
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I forgot about Lego.

698
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But

699
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
it's not very expensive.

700
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You can see

701
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
it's in Lego.

702
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's like a flowchart.

703
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You can play.

704
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It has motion sensor

705
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and color sensor.

706
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
After you build the robot,

707
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
you can

708
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
use wheels

709
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
to recognize different colors

710
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and get different commands.

711
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Sephiroth is

712
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
block-based.

713
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's like a ball.

714
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
After you program it,

715
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
it can spin on the ground.

716
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Tinkering,

717
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
hand-made,

718
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and coding

719
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
are good

720
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to introduce

721
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
to children.

722
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Why does it move?

723
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You can use it

724
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
to introduce

725
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
programming concepts.

726
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You can stick

727
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
these routes on the ground.

728
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You can program on the iPad.

729
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You can simulate how it runs.

730
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
When it's programmed,

731
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
it can run.

732
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You can see

733
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
how to solve

734
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the problem

735
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and implement

736
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
the plan.

737
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Data science and

738
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
3D printing

739
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
are also

740
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
a field.

741
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
These two are

742
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
commonly used

743
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
in research and education.

744
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Thank you for your comments.

745
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I will answer

746
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
later for

747
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
time.

748
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Please feel free to comment.

749
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I promised

750
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to introduce Scratch in detail.

751
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Scratch

752
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
was first

753
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
introduced in

754
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
MIT Media Lab.

755
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Mitch Resnick

756
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and Karen Brennan

757
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
were first

758
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
introduced in

759
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
2007.

760
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The first beta version

761
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
was released.

762
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's been 13 years.

763
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
There are more than

764
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
70 languages,

765
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
more than 61 million

766
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
project shares,

767
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and more than

768
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
2 million people registered.

769
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The goal is

770
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
as I said,

771
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
low-floor, high-ceiling.

772
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You can jump in

773
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
if you don't have

774
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
a programming background.

775
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You can play

776
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and make different

777
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
interactive stories,

778
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
games,

779
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
animations,

780
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and music.

781
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Some people may

782
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
make it a Mother's Day gift.

783
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You can share it

784
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
online.

785
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You can share it

786
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
with your friends.

787
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
There may be

788
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
different animations

789
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and music.

790
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
For kids,

791
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
application is their goal.

792
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
They may think it's cool.

793
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I want to know how to do it.

794
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Scratch was designed

795
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
in this direction.

796
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It doesn't mean

797
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
every kid

798
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
is a computer scientist.

799
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
On the contrary,

800
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
programming is designed

801
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
as a design tool.

802
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
A piece of paper

803
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is a design tool.

804
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
How do I fold it?

805
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You can think of programming

806
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
as a tool.

807
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
With this tool,

808
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
you can do different things.

809
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The core audience

810
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is 8 to 16 years old.

811
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The maximum age is 12.

812
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I've seen many

813
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
college students' projects

814
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
or complex projects.

815
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You can try it later.

816
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The environment

817
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
is at the bottom right.

818
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's

819
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
block-based.

820
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Different colors

821
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
represent different functions.

822
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
What you need to do

823
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
is to drag from here

824
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
to this window.

825
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Then you can start to build.

826
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You can see

827
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
what you just coded.

828
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You can click the play button

829
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
to see what you just programmed.

830
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
As I said,

831
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
you may be confused

832
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
if you don't have

833
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
experience with Scratch.

834
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I have an example.

835
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Let's play together

836
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
for 2 to 3 minutes.

837
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It doesn't matter if you don't have an account.

838
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'll post the link

839
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
on the chat.

840
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll give you

841
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
some time

842
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
to open it.

843
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm working with you now.

844
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
If you open it,

845
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
it should look like this.

846
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
If you've already started,

847
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
you can feel free to start.

848
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's a...

849
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I think it's a theme

850
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
related game.

851
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So I chose a game

852
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
with a girl as the theme.

853
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'll start

854
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
to play with you now.

855
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
If you open the window,

856
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
feel free to click the play button.

857
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't know if you can hear the music.

858
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But my headphones can hear it.

859
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Sorry.

860
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I really don't know how to play games.

861
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
If I die,

862
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
don't laugh at me.

863
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Thank you, Yan Yong.

864
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think you can start playing now.

865
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'll give you some time.

866
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I think I can't get past 5 minutes.

867
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'll just keep dying.

868
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay, anyway.

869
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If I get past 2 minutes

870
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
or 5 minutes later, you can tell me.

871
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Because I really think this game is a bit hard.

872
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Okay, pause for a moment.

873
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Did you? How did you play?

874
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Because I'm really bad at this.

875
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So you know,

876
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
calculating doesn't mean you know how to play.

877
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Right?

878
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So...

879
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Okay.

880
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Does anyone want to share their score?

881
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Okay, if you...

882
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
If you're almost done,

883
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
you can click on this project.

884
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It has a button called See Inside.

885
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
This button.

886
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm sure you're all in front of the computer.

887
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
If you can watch it with me,

888
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
you'll have a deeper experience.

889
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So there's a See Inside here.

890
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You can take a look at

891
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
what the project looks like.

892
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
If you're a programmer,

893
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
a programmer,

894
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
you may need to spend some time

895
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
getting used to the interface.

896
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Because it's different from

897
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
most text spaces.

898
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
For example,

899
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
C++ or Python

900
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
or JavaScript.

901
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's very different.

902
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Because you can see what I just said.

903
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
The motion, look, sound,

904
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
these events.

905
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm going to pick one to introduce to you.

906
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
For example,

907
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
If I create a new project here,

908
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I drag

909
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
an event.

910
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
For example, when green flags click.

911
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's this green flag.

912
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's very intuitive.

913
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
What you see is what it is.

914
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm going to help this cat

915
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
do a 10-step forward.

916
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
At the same time,

917
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I want it to be able to say hello

918
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
in two minutes.

919
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It has a feature

920
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
that can insert sound.

921
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It has a different meow sound.

922
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You can also record your own voice.

923
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So you've added a lot of

924
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
creativity to see what you want to do.

925
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'm going to use

926
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
what it defaults to do.

927
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What happens when I press this?

928
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Do you hear that meow sound?

929
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It will go 10 steps forward.

930
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
The so-called 10 is x going 10.

931
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It was just at 0.

932
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It will say hello.

933
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'll run it again.

934
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It goes another 10 steps forward.

935
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It will say hello in two seconds.

936
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It will make a meow sound.

937
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
If you want to repeat

938
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
this action,

939
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
the very important concept in programming

940
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
is called looped.

941
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You can insert a repeat here.

942
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
If I just repeat

943
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
say hello and play sound,

944
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
let's just repeat it twice.

945
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It will

946
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
go another 10 steps forward.

947
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You'll see

948
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
that after it's done

949
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
with these two commands,

950
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
it will go back to say hello.

951
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Say hello again.

952
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It just made a meow sound twice.

953
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You can play this at home.

954
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You can also

955
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
custom this cat.

956
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You can also

957
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
define or download.

958
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
If you have some photos,

959
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
you can download it.

960
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
There are some backgrounds here

961
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
that can provide you with choices.

962
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
There are different sprites here.

963
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Our code sprite is called this object.

964
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It has different objects.

965
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You can also insert here.

966
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So when I click this

967
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
object,

968
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm here now.

969
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Sorry, I cut this cat.

970
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You know.

971
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You can do

972
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
coding for this sprite.

973
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I was coding under this cat.

974
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Now I'm under Andy.

975
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
This extends to

976
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
the project I just shared with you.

977
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You might think it's simple.

978
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But if you

979
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
take a closer look at

980
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
the project I just shared with you,

981
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
it's very complicated.

982
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So under each sprite,

983
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I can

984
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
command it to do something.

985
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
After all, it's a game.

986
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So I need to do a lot of things

987
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
at the same time.

988
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
For example, under this cat sprite,

989
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I can see this green flag click.

990
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It will start doing the following action.

991
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It will demo it to you.

992
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
In other sprites,

993
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I can also see

994
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
when green flag click,

995
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
there are other variables

996
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
running.

997
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So this project

998
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
can be extended from

999
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
the project I just shared with you.

1000
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It can extend to

1001
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
such a complex game.

1002
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
This is

1003
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
a low-floor-high-ceiling

1004
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
tool I just talked about.

1005
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
OK.

1006
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Do you want to play a little longer?

1007
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
OK.

1008
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Because I can't see you.

1009
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'll wait a minute.

1010
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'll take a sip of water.

1011
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
OK.

1012
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So this tool

1013
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
is what I'm going to talk about

1014
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
in my research today.

1015
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's a very important tool.

1016
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Children are co-designed

1017
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
in this context.

1018
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
They have co-design, game, story,

1019
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
music, and animation.

1020
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
How much time

1021
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
do I have left?

1022
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
OK.

1023
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'll quickly

1024
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
introduce my research

1025
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
and current

1026
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
computational thinking.

1027
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
From my perspective,

1028
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
how is computational thinking studied?

1029
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I just mentioned

1030
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
computational thinking and cooperative learning.

1031
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
My research

1032
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and dissertation is mainly about

1033
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
how computational thinking

1034
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
is learned and used in a team.

1035
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I've brought some

1036
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
most of the

1037
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
literature and what people

1038
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
say now.

1039
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
At present, computational thinking is still

1040
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
identified as a very

1041
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
individual thinking.

1042
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
If you take programming as an example,

1043
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm actually doing things

1044
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
there myself.

1045
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I may not ask others sometimes,

1046
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
but I'm doing it with others.

1047
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Most of the research

1048
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
direction is actually

1049
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
an independent individual.

1050
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
For example, if this student

1051
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
is exposed to this curriculum

1052
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
or this tool,

1053
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
what is my learning process?

1054
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
What is my ability?

1055
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What is my result?

1056
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Some researchers have begun to discuss

1057
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
that if the computational participation

1058
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
is in a face-to-face environment,

1059
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
if I'm online,

1060
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
for example, the place I just scratched

1061
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
has a lot of opportunities to

1062
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
collaborate on the Internet.

1063
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What will it look like?

1064
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
How will the child extend this project?

1065
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Some researchers have begun to

1066
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
do computational thinking.

1067
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
This cooperative computational thinking is not

1068
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
a digital game.

1069
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
When I'm playing games,

1070
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
how can we solve this problem

1071
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
together?

1072
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
How do we play

1073
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
what role together?

1074
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Current research

1075
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
is focused on

1076
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
first, individual,

1077
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
second, online community,

1078
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
or under

1079
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
desktop and non-programming.

1080
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
These researches are very few,

1081
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
especially cooperative computational thinking.

1082
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
This concept is actually

1083
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
very limited now.

1084
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
No one is doing this.

1085
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Even though the standard

1086
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
mentioned that cooperative learning

1087
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
is very important,

1088
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the current research direction

1089
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
does not go in that direction.

1090
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
My research argues

1091
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
that cooperative learning

1092
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
is not only cooperative learning,

1093
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
but also an activity and process of

1094
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
cooperative design.

1095
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
In fact, in the field of

1096
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
learning or psychology,

1097
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
it has been found that students

1098
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
actually know what to do.

1099
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
If I am in a cooperative environment,

1100
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I can deepen

1101
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
the knowledge I have learned

1102
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and I can advance

1103
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
my problem-solving skills.

1104
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
On the other hand,

1105
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
cooperation

1106
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
has shown

1107
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
a good way

1108
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
to close the gender gap

1109
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
in CS.

1110
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
For example,

1111
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
you may think that

1112
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
computer science is more

1113
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
independent,

1114
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
everyone is hiding in the dungeon.

1115
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's dark in the basement,

1116
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and everyone is coding

1117
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
at night.

1118
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Cooperative learning

1119
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
shows that

1120
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
it can attract more women

1121
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
to join this industry.

1122
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
They may feel that

1123
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
this is not a very isolated

1124
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
job or

1125
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
a programming thing.

1126
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
They may feel

1127
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
that it is more welcoming.

1128
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
They may feel that

1129
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
they can get some support

1130
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
from their colleagues.

1131
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
My research goal is to

1132
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
hope to learn

1133
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
computational thinking

1134
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
through the cooperation

1135
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
between students.

1136
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's like bridging the research gap

1137
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
that everyone has been doing

1138
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
individually.

1139
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Oh, a good question.

1140
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Hong Yi-Chi asked

1141
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
whether the closed gender gap

1142
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
is effective at all ages.

1143
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
The study I quoted

1144
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
was done by adults

1145
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
only.

1146
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
She asked

1147
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
some women

1148
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and their environment.

1149
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The result was that

1150
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
adults felt that

1151
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
it was easier for women

1152
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
to join the cooperation.

1153
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
This research is also a good point.

1154
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
This is what I want to do

1155
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
in the future.

1156
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
If it's a collaboration,

1157
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
the younger students

1158
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
will have the same result.

1159
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
This is a good research direction.

1160
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Finally, I want to extend

1161
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
the current

1162
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
computational thinking framework.

1163
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
As you can see,

1164
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
CS standards are

1165
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
focused on individuals.

1166
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
How do you reach this level?

1167
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I want to push it into

1168
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
a team effort.

1169
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
This is my

1170
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
research perspective.

1171
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I have a computational thinking

1172
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
framework,

1173
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
K-12 CS education,

1174
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and collaborative design activity.

1175
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
These are

1176
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
the pieces

1177
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
that I stand in the middle.

1178
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
This is me.

1179
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It seems like I'm a little over time.

1180
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'll try to finish

1181
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
in 10 minutes.

1182
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can ask questions.

1183
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
My framework

1184
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
is based on

1185
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
the computational thinking

1186
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
that I just explained.

1187
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You might want to know

1188
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
how to measure

1189
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and do research.

1190
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
This framework provides

1191
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
a big direction.

1192
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
There are three types of

1193
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
computational thinking.

1194
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
One is concept,

1195
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
which is the so-called loops

1196
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
or events.

1197
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
There is also parallelism,

1198
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
which means

1199
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
you can observe

1200
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
what you are doing.

1201
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
For example,

1202
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm doing testing

1203
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
or debugging.

1204
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Perspective is more like

1205
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
how you interpret

1206
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
computational thinking.

1207
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
How do you interpret

1208
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
computational thinking?

1209
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
For example,

1210
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
what do you think of CS?

1211
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
What do you think of programming?

1212
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
This is the direction.

1213
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
My research focuses on

1214
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
the first two.

1215
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
How do children

1216
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
in the team

1217
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
apply these concepts?

1218
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
How do they

1219
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
observe

1220
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
what they are doing?

1221
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
These practices

1222
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I just mentioned

1223
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
can be observed.

1224
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Computational thinking

1225
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
consists of four types.

1226
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Experimenting or iterating.

1227
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Testing or debugging.

1228
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Algorithm building

1229
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Abstracting or modulizing.

1230
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Why do I have a

1231
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
quote on the right?

1232
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
These are

1233
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
high-level practices.

1234
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
For example,

1235
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
how do children

1236
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
experiment or iterate?

1237
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
How do they test

1238
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
what they are doing?

1239
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Algorithm building

1240
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
is a high-level practice.

1241
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's the same as

1242
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
abstracting or modulizing.

1243
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It's hard to observe.

1244
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
This is just a heads-up.

1245
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Next,

1246
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'll provide

1247
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
my research direction

1248
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
and context.

1249
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
My overarching question

1250
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
is how do students

1251
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
learn computational thinking

1252
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
in the team?

1253
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Collaborative design activity

1254
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
refers to

1255
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
how they

1256
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
co-design their projects

1257
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
on this platform.

1258
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
My setting is

1259
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
a public school in Indiana.

1260
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I designed

1261
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
a five-week course invitation

1262
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
with the teacher.

1263
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I went to the school

1264
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and collected five-week data

1265
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
in an intro

1266
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
of programming course.

1267
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
There were 12 students.

1268
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
This is a training course,

1269
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
so there were not many students.

1270
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
There were 14 students in total,

1271
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
but 12 students were my focus group.

1272
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I collected the data of these 12 students.

1273
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
There were three people in one group.

1274
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
There were four groups in total.

1275
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
My context tool is

1276
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Scratch, which I just introduced.

1277
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I collected the data

1278
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
of these four groups of students

1279
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
in each group.

1280
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
There were five different Scratch projects,

1281
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
so I collected them all.

1282
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I also recorded

1283
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
how they did it.

1284
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I will explain

1285
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
what the video looks like in the next chapter.

1286
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
There was also an intermittent

1287
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
screen recording.

1288
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Because of school restrictions,

1289
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I could not record their screen all the time.

1290
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But I had an iPad,

1291
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
so several undergrad students

1292
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
helped me collect the data.

1293
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I collected the screen of

1294
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
their front and back.

1295
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
The direction of my analysis

1296
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
is from the front and back,

1297
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
as well as the video of

1298
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
my qualitative code.

1299
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I recorded what they did

1300
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
every 10 seconds

1301
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and whether they were engaged

1302
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
in this computational thinking.

1303
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
This is

1304
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
what my classroom looks like.

1305
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
This is the blackboard.

1306
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
There are two groups here,

1307
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
two people in each group.

1308
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The rest are three people in each group.

1309
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
The red line represents

1310
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
the number of girls.

1311
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Gender is spread out,

1312
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
so there is a girl in each group.

1313
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
There is a 360-degree camera

1314
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
in the classroom.

1315
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I made the camera stick

1316
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
by myself.

1317
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It looks like this.

1318
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You may not be used to it at first,

1319
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
but this is the view of the camera.

1320
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
There are three students here.

1321
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There are three people in each group.

1322
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
This is the teacher.

1323
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
There are three people in each group.

1324
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The way I analyze

1325
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
is that

1326
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
these are all students.

1327
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I have renamed them.

1328
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
These are Meg, Lucas, and Ted.

1329
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Because of the time,

1330
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I will not explain much.

1331
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
However,

1332
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
every 10 seconds,

1333
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I will capture what they said

1334
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and transcribe it.

1335
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Then identify

1336
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
if they did this practice.

1337
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Practice is what I just said.

1338
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
E is experimenting or iterating.

1339
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
They may be

1340
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
from this time

1341
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
to this time,

1342
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
about 9 minutes.

1343
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
They have been thinking

1344
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
about whether to add this

1345
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
sprite.

1346
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
After I add it,

1347
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
what should I change?

1348
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
They have been discussing

1349
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and there is no complete answer.

1350
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
They don't know what to do.

1351
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So they are all

1352
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
at the forefront.

1353
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
They are not very deep into this problem.

1354
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Until about 2 minutes later,

1355
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
they found that

1356
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
something was missing.

1357
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Then they started to test and debug this problem.

1358
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Then this thing moved to

1359
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
algorithm building and modularizing.

1360
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
This thinking.

1361
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So I will show you

1362
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
what my data looks like.

1363
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So every 10 seconds,

1364
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I will capture what they did.

1365
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
This is in practice.

1366
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So next,

1367
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I will use performance

1368
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and practice.

1369
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
In education,

1370
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
we usually do research

1371
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
in learning sciences.

1372
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
How do we know if students really learned

1373
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
algorithmic thinking?

1374
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I give them a pre-test and a post-test.

1375
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So I gave them a test

1376
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
before 5 weeks.

1377
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
See if they have grown.

1378
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That means they have improved.

1379
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So in learning,

1380
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
the result is very important.

1381
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But the process is also very important.

1382
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The process is very tricky.

1383
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's hard to capture.

1384
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
But in my dissertation,

1385
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I tried to use

1386
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
the result and the process

1387
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
to explain algorithmic thinking.

1388
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
What is it?

1389
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
How do students learn?

1390
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So in performance,

1391
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I gave them a pre-test and a post-test.

1392
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Basically,

1393
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
they have improved.

1394
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
In team learning,

1395
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
in these 5 weeks,

1396
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
they have improved statistically.

1397
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
That means

1398
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
in this learning,

1399
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
their algorithmic thinking

1400
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
has improved.

1401
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
This is one example.

1402
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
This is the same group.

1403
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
They are in pre-test and post-test.

1404
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
One of the projects.

1405
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
One of the problems.

1406
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
In the beginning,

1407
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
the way to solve the problem is very straightforward.

1408
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You can see

1409
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
what they did in the beginning.

1410
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
There are many bugs.

1411
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I won't talk about it.

1412
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Many of them can't reach

1413
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
the goal of this test.

1414
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But after the post-test,

1415
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I didn't give them any hints.

1416
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I just gave them questions.

1417
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Let them finish this small project.

1418
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You can see

1419
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
the trigger.

1420
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It means

1421
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
parallelism.

1422
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Other things will happen at the same time.

1423
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
This is very important

1424
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
in CT.

1425
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It can show

1426
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
the player

1427
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or learner can receive

1428
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
a higher level of thinking.

1429
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
A proof.

1430
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
As for the process,

1431
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
it's very tricky.

1432
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You may think

1433
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
it's easy.

1434
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But it's not.

1435
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I focused on

1436
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
one group.

1437
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
This is

1438
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
the result of pre-test and post-test.

1439
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
There are 4 groups.

1440
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You can see them.

1441
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
How can I prove

1442
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
they learned

1443
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
or applied?

1444
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You can imagine

1445
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
a timeline.

1446
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
From left to right.

1447
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
You can see

1448
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Lion

1449
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
took the longest time

1450
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
to finish.

1451
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
10 seconds for each group.

1452
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
1330 seconds for this group.

1453
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
16 minutes.

1454
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
20 minutes.

1455
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Lion took

1456
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
the longest time.

1457
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
20 minutes.

1458
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
This is the pre-test.

1459
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You can see

1460
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
each group

1461
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
has different practice.

1462
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Blue represents

1463
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
experimenting or iterating.

1464
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Green, yellow, pink

1465
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
represent different practice.

1466
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
If this group

1467
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
doesn't do practice,

1468
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
it can't do

1469
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
every second.

1470
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It can't do

1471
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
nothing.

1472
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's black.

1473
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
If it did

1474
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
more than 2 practice

1475
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
it's red.

1476
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
This picture

1477
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
looks complicated.

1478
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But you can see

1479
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
the length of black

1480
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and its weight.

1481
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
You can see

1482
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
most groups

1483
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
have a lot of black.

1484
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
They didn't do practice.

1485
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
If they didn't do practice,

1486
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
you can see

1487
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
it's off-text.

1488
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But they usually

1489
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
didn't do

1490
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
deep computation.

1491
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
In post-test,

1492
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
there's a lot of black.

1493
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
They

1494
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
did the same practice

1495
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
consecutively.

1496
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
They didn't do

1497
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
blue, yellow, green,

1498
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
or red.

1499
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They did experimenting.

1500
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I did abstracting

1501
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
for 30 seconds.

1502
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But I did experimenting.

1503
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You can see pink.

1504
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I said algorithm building

1505
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
is a high-level

1506
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
computational thinking.

1507
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
In post-test,

1508
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
you can see they used

1509
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
a lot of algorithm building.

1510
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
OK.

1511
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
In addition to

1512
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
learning process and result,

1513
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I want to talk about

1514
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
5-week class implementation.

1515
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
In class design,

1516
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
what can

1517
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I do?

1518
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I switch to

1519
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
the teacher's role.

1520
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
There are 4 practices.

1521
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
This is 5-week data.

1522
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I followed

1523
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
one group.

1524
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Lion, Tiger,

1525
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Bear, Cat.

1526
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Tiger.

1527
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You can see

1528
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
what practices

1529
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and when they used

1530
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
in 5-week class.

1531
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
The main practices

1532
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
are these 4.

1533
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
In this class,

1534
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
students get a working sheet.

1535
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
They start planning

1536
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
what they want to do.

1537
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
They move on to coding.

1538
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
You can see planning and coding

1539
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
are intertwined.

1540
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It's hard to tell.

1541
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I give you a piece of paper.

1542
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You draw on it.

1543
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's not reasonable.

1544
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Planning and coding

1545
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
are in the same group.

1546
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
They do the project together.

1547
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
They need to discuss

1548
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
what the project should look like.

1549
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
What should I do?

1550
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
After this stage,

1551
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
there is a peer review.

1552
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
They have a feedback sheet.

1553
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
These 4 groups

1554
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
give feedback to each other.

1555
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
After getting feedback,

1556
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
they revise the project.

1557
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
The whole process

1558
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
is 5-week project.

1559
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
There are 5 projects

1560
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
in a week.

1561
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
They went through this process 5 times.

1562
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Planning, coding, revising.

1563
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
It's repeated.

1564
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
The total time

1565
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
is here.

1566
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The data I analyzed

1567
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
is 6.3 hours.

1568
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
They are working together.

1569
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Sometimes,

1570
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
they are not focusing.

1571
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I don't count these.

1572
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
The data is 6.3 hours.

1573
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
The graph on the right

1574
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
shows the ratio

1575
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
of these 4 practices

1576
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
in 6.3 hours.

1577
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
The blue and green

1578
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
are common practices.

1579
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
They spend a lot of time

1580
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
discussing

1581
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
what to put

1582
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
and what to do.

1583
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
The red is

1584
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
the second time

1585
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
debugging and testing.

1586
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
These are the others.

1587
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
You may ask

1588
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
it's obvious.

1589
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Why do this?

1590
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
When do they do

1591
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
testing and experimenting?

1592
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This can be

1593
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
connected with teaching.

1594
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
When do you

1595
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
give feedback to students?

1596
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
When do you know

1597
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
they are doing this?

1598
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
This is

1599
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
a time series example.

1600
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Planning and coding

1601
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
are revising.

1602
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
This is a segment.

1603
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It's 60 minutes per class.

1604
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I use 20 minutes

1605
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
to explain.

1606
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
There are 6 segments

1607
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
in 1 minute.

1608
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
A segment is 10 seconds.

1609
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
A bigger one

1610
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
is 30 seconds in a row.

1611
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
There are 6 segments

1612
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
in total.

1613
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
The blue one

1614
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
is from start to finish.

1615
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
The 20-minute segment

1616
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
spends a lot of time

1617
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
experimenting and iterating

1618
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
their ideas.

1619
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
There are abstracting

1620
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and modularizing.

1621
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Algorithm building

1622
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
doesn't happen completely.

1623
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It happens a little bit,

1624
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
but not at the beginning.

1625
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It happens a lot

1626
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
when revising.

1627
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
This tells us

1628
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
students need to spend

1629
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
more time

1630
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
to learn

1631
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
at a higher level.

1632
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
If you are a teacher

1633
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
who is in a hurry,

1634
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
for example,

1635
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
it's hard to

1636
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
reach the level

1637
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
students want

1638
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
in a team.

1639
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
The stage of revising

1640
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
is testing or debugging.

1641
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Students spend a lot of time

1642
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
on this green bar.

1643
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
They spend a lot of time

1644
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
on testing or debugging.

1645
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
As a teacher,

1646
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
you can know

1647
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
how to emphasize

1648
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
the deeper level

1649
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
when revising.

1650
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Do I have some

1651
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
deep insights?

1652
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I can see

1653
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
when they overlap.

1654
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Why do they overlap?

1655
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
What did they do?

1656
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
These are the

1657
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
things you can discuss

1658
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
in depth.

1659
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
You can provide

1660
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
a pattern to the teacher.

1661
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
How do you apply

1662
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
this pattern

1663
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
to your teaching

1664
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
and teaching plan?

1665
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
There are too many things

1666
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
to talk about.

1667
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I'm already over time.

1668
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Next,

1669
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I'd like to talk about

1670
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
the main

1671
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
elements and results.

1672
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
As you can see,

1673
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
it's a bit

1674
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
complicated.

1675
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
There are two main concepts.

1676
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I'd like to explain

1677
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
the concept of

1678
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
computational thinking

1679
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
and the behavior

1680
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
that can be observed.

1681
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
How to assess

1682
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
students' learning

1683
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
is still a concept.

1684
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Do students learn

1685
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
from this concept?

1686
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I'd like to start

1687
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
from the perspective of practice.

1688
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
What students do

1689
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
can reflect

1690
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
the concept of

1691
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
computational thinking.

1692
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
No one has

1693
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
combined these concepts yet.

1694
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But what you think

1695
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and what you do

1696
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
is not new in education.

1697
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Computational thinking

1698
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
can be a breakthrough

1699
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
in the future.

1700
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Next,

1701
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'd like to talk about

1702
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
the assessment

1703
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and how to improve

1704
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
students' learning.

1705
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I'd like to

1706
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
talk about

1707
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
how to assess

1708
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
students' learning

1709
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
and practice

1710
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
instead of

1711
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
just giving them

1712
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
a bunch of choices.

1713
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Finally,

1714
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I'd like to talk about

1715
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
the ability of

1716
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
computational thinking

1717
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
not only for one person.

1718
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
When you study in a group,

1719
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
you can see

1720
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
what I said

1721
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and who gave me

1722
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
which opinion.

1723
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
They are co-constructing

1724
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
the experience and ability

1725
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
of computational thinking.

1726
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
They learn as a group

1727
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Next,

1728
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I'd like to talk about

1729
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
the role of each student

1730
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
in the learning

1731
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and cooperation.

1732
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
What's the role of

1733
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
each student

1734
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
in the learning

1735
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
of computational thinking?

1736
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
For example,

1737
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
one of the students

1738
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
is the leader of the group.

1739
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
How does he lead

1740
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
and how does he do

1741
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
computational thinking?

1742
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And how does

1743
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
social behavior

1744
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
intertwine with

1745
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
computational thinking?

1746
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
These are

1747
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
the general direction

1748
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I'd like to focus on.

1749
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I'd like to focus on

1750
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
the role of each student

1751
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
in the group

1752
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and then discuss it

1753
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
as a group.

1754
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Thank you.

1755
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Over time,

1756
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I won't talk too much.

1757
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Thank you for listening.

1758
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
If you have any questions,

1759
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
feel free to ask.

1760
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Thank you,

1761
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Joey, for sharing

1762
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
your research.

1763
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Let's start

1764
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
the Q&A.

1765
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I see a question.

1766
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Lin Hui has a question.

1767
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
She'd like to ask

1768
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
about Scratch

1769
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
in Taiwan

1770
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
and the students'

1771
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and teachers' reactions.

1772
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Is there a teacher

1773
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
from Taiwan?

1774
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Personally,

1775
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I went to Taiwan last year

1776
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
to attend a conference

1777
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
on computer science education

1778
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
in Kenting.

1779
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
What I learned

1780
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
was that Scratch

1781
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
was widely used

1782
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
in elementary school

1783
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
in Taiwan

1784
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
when I was

1785
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
in the 6th grade.

1786
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
You can start

1787
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
the Q&A.

1788
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
The way I see it,

1789
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
it's very much

1790
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
about programming.

1791
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I want kids to learn

1792
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
programming.

1793
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Besides programming,

1794
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I don't care

1795
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
about their artistic development

1796
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
or creativity.

1797
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
It's a little bit

1798
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
against Scratch Team's

1799
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
original intention.

1800
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Scratch Design Team

1801
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
is one of

1802
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
my current advisors.

1803
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I'm one of

1804
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
the students

1805
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
of our advisor.

1806
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So I continued

1807
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
his original design.

1808
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That's what I heard.

1809
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I'm not sure if there are

1810
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Taiwanese students here.

1811
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
What I know is that

1812
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
the Ministry of Education

1813
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
came up with a budget planning

1814
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
in 2016.

1815
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
This year,

1816
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
they've been pushing

1817
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
the budget planning

1818
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
to the middle school level.

1819
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
You can start

1820
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
the Q&A.

1821
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Welcome to listen to your voice.

1822
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Another question is

1823
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
if there is any difference

1824
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
between individual project

1825
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
and team learning

1826
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
and the effect.

1827
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I think I need

1828
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
to talk to

1829
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Ms. Hong.

1830
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I think this is a good question.

1831
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Why didn't I

1832
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
do the research

1833
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
on team learning?

1834
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
The reason is

1835
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
you don't need to compare.

1836
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
No matter

1837
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
whether it's programming,

1838
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
individual learning

1839
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
is always better than

1840
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
team learning.

1841
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
If I want to teach

1842
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
a science concept today,

1843
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
if I teach science

1844
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
in a team,

1845
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
if I test the results,

1846
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
individual learning is always better.

1847
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You may find that

1848
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
you need to focus

1849
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
on learning.

1850
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
The test is

1851
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
your unique ability.

1852
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It saves time

1853
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
if you learn by yourself.

1854
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Why is team learning important?

1855
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It can discuss

1856
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
the application of

1857
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
social skills

1858
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
and learning.

1859
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
The content knowledge

1860
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
of the subject

1861
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
will save time.

1862
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
But the idea

1863
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
is deeper

1864
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and broader

1865
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
than learning by yourself.

1866
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I think the learning effect

1867
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
can be seen

1868
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
in 5 weeks

1869
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
or in a short time.

1870
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Individual learning

1871
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
is better.

1872
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
But education depends on the long run.

1873
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
In the long run,

1874
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
what impact

1875
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
individual learning has

1876
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
has a lot to do with

1877
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
new experience.

1878
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I argue that

1879
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
in a team,

1880
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
they can learn

1881
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
what individuals can't.

1882
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
To prove the value

1883
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
of teamwork.

1884
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Thank you for your question.

1885
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I think it's important.

1886
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Is there any research?

1887
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Yes.

1888
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I can forward it to you.

1889
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Individual, indirect,

1890
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and complete cooperation.

1891
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
The result is

1892
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
what I just said.

1893
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Individual is better.

1894
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But in the long run,

1895
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
team is better.

1896
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Hi, Joy. I'm Yoga.

1897
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Hi.

1898
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I can continue.

1899
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
My question is a bit long.

1900
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I can type.

1901
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
My main question is

1902
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
to sum up

1903
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
your computational thinking.

1904
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
It's like

1905
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
teaching students.

1906
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
We cooperate

1907
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
and use the same language

1908
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
to solve a specific problem.

1909
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Is this

1910
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
a process of

1911
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
helping students

1912
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
to socialize?

1913
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I have this question.

1914
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
This is my main question.

1915
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I have this question.

1916
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It's like

1917
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
your computational thinking

1918
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
is different from

1919
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
those of

1920
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
computer science majors

1921
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
or

1922
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
seniors.

1923
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I guess

1924
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
it's quite different.

1925
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I guess

1926
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
it's quite different.

1927
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
For K-12

1928
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
or

1929
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
junior high school students,

1930
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
for K-12 or junior high school students,

1931
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
we have an open course.

1932
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
It's called

1933
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Computer Science Anyway.

1934
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's a brand new course.

1935
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Although computer science has been developed

1936
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
for 60 or 70 years,

1937
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
it's a brand new course

1938
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
for medical education.

1939
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
it's a brand new course for medical education.

1940
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Although we have

1941
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
a lot of materials,

1942
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
a lot of materials,

1943
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
such as textbooks,

1944
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
such as textbooks,

1945
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
these teaching methods

1946
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
may not be suitable

1947
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
for junior high school students.

1948
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
So you want to

1949
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
develop a set of

1950
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
teaching methods suitable for junior high school students,

1951
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
and a set of

1952
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
ways to test

1953
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
whether they really

1954
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
learn something from it.

1955
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So this is

1956
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
what your computational thinking

1957
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
aims at.

1958
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Am I right?

1959
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Yes, to answer

1960
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
your definition of CT.

1961
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
The researchers

1962
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
in this framework are all

1963
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
from CS.

1964
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
But you know,

1965
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
they may have different opinions

1966
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
in the same discipline.

1967
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I just showed you the round one.

1968
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I'm in the middle

1969
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and broad.

1970
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Computational thinking

1971
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
needs to be completed under programming.

1972
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
It only has a

1973
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
beneficial definition for CS.

1974
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So I'm happy

1975
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
if you have different opinions,

1976
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I'd like to hear

1977
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
what your research

1978
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
is doing.

1979
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
If you are an educator,

1980
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
how would you interpret it?

1981
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
The second question,

1982
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I think it's right,

1983
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
but there are too many developments.

1984
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
We are still discussing

1985
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
what computational thinking is.

1986
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
The assessment

1987
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
is a very

1988
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
big topic.

1989
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
A lot of NSF funding

1990
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
focuses on the assessment.

1991
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
So I dare not say

1992
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
my research has reached the assessment.

1993
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Because I'm not

1994
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
studying students'

1995
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
ability to learn in the end.

1996
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
In the process,

1997
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
how can we reflect the current evaluation?

1998
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
In the current evaluation,

1999
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
most of the tests

2000
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
are choice questions.

2001
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It's not a project-based

2002
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
test.

2003
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
This is a

2004
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
very different field.

2005
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
My theme

2006
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
is to provide

2007
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
a different idea

2008
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
to the current field.

2009
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I've been emphasizing

2010
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
collaboration is very important in CS.

2011
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
But as for

2012
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
how to apply

2013
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
collaboration

2014
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
in K-12,

2015
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
this is a completely

2016
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
different topic.

2017
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I've been saying this is very important,

2018
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
but there is no research

2019
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
or teacher who wants to try.

2020
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
But I have to say,

2021
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
it's a bit like digging a hole for yourself to jump.

2022
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
In research,

2023
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
we dig a hole for ourselves to jump

2024
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
or get along with

2025
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
ourselves in the hole.

2026
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It's very complicated.

2027
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
What I've done so far

2028
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
is just the beginning.

2029
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
As for the question

2030
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
you just mentioned,

2031
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
is it really better to

2032
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
learn in collaboration?

2033
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Is it really good for the student's

2034
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
content knowledge?

2035
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Or is it better for the student's

2036
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
other skills and

2037
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
interpretation of the field?

2038
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
These are all things that can be

2039
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
studied and discussed in depth.

2040
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
What I hope to provide is

2041
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
a process of

2042
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
looking at their

2043
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
computational thinking

2044
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
to reflect on

2045
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
how I can improve

2046
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
the design of

2047
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
this course

2048
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
to facilitate

2049
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
collaborative learning.

2050
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I'm still studying

2051
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
student learning,

2052
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
but I hope to provide

2053
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
some practical

2054
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
help in the design of the course.

2055
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
As for the assessment,

2056
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I can provide you

2057
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
a paper that is

2058
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
specifically for CT

2059
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
assessment research.

2060
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
You just mentioned

2061
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
the so-called

2062
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
collaborative learning.

2063
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I have a question.

2064
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
What I heard

2065
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
when I was listening

2066
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
is that

2067
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
we need to train students

2068
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
to learn how to collaborate.

2069
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Collaborative learning is like

2070
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
three or five people

2071
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
studying a problem

2072
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and discussing it together.

2073
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
This is collaborative learning.

2074
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
The meaning of

2075
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
collaborative learning is

2076
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
that the three of us

2077
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
learn a language together.

2078
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
When someone writes a plan,

2079
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I can write it down

2080
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
in this language.

2081
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
This language can be

2082
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
used by three or four people.

2083
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It can also be used by

2084
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
a computer or other people

2085
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
who have learned this language.

2086
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
In the process,

2087
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
three or five people

2088
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
need to collaborate.

2089
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
They just need to read the script

2090
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
and know how to play the role.

2091
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
This is the first question

2092
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
about the process of

2093
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
socialization.

2094
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Socialization is also

2095
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
a process of learning

2096
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
that provides a set of

2097
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
basic languages,

2098
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
such as sequence, loop,

2099
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
and judgement.

2100
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
This language structure

2101
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
allows everyone

2102
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
to complete a task

2103
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
according to a script.

2104
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I said that

2105
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
this is a process of

2106
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
socialization.

2107
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Is this what you mean?

2108
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think what you said

2109
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
is a bit like what ESPAN

2110
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
is talking about now.

2111
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
What I see now is

2112
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
how I learn

2113
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
computational thinking

2114
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
in the process of

2115
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
team cooperation.

2116
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Just like what you said,

2117
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
how do I learn

2118
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
the concept of sequence?

2119
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I'm not just learning

2120
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
by myself,

2121
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I'm learning

2122
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
the concept of

2123
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
the use of sequence

2124
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
in a team.

2125
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I think it can be added

2126
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
to a layer.

2127
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Collaborative

2128
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
computational thinking

2129
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
means that

2130
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
you can design

2131
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
a task

2132
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
according to

2133
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
your team.

2134
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
This is a way of

2135
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
cooperation,

2136
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
not computational thinking.

2137
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Does this make sense?

2138
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Okay, thank you.

2139
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I got it.

2140
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Got it.

2141
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Stephen, can you

2142
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
turn on the microphone?

2143
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It's okay if you don't.

2144
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Oh, hi.

2145
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I'd like to ask

2146
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
when do you

2147
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
recommend

2148
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
elementary school students

2149
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
to start learning

2150
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
computational thinking?

2151
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Oh,

2152
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
that's a good question.

2153
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
When?

2154
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I think

2155
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I can go back to

2156
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
the tour I just introduced.

2157
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
For example,

2158
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Blocky and Scratch

2159
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
were designed for

2160
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
6-year-olds.

2161
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
When you can start

2162
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
learning,

2163
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
you can start

2164
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
developing

2165
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
tangible programming.

2166
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
It's especially for

2167
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
2-3-year-olds.

2168
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
When you're still

2169
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
holding and exploring

2170
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
the world,

2171
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
you can

2172
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
design a soft

2173
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
thing.

2174
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
When you connect

2175
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
two things,

2176
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
one of them will light up.

2177
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'd say

2178
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
most of my research is

2179
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
on how to

2180
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
promote

2181
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
computational thinking

2182
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
and programming.

2183
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I think

2184
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
computational thinking

2185
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
is beyond programming.

2186
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
You can think

2187
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
like a computer scientist

2188
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
instead of

2189
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
become a computer scientist.

2190
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Computational thinking

2191
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
is based on CS.

2192
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
When you connect

2193
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
two things,

2194
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
it looks like a hand,

2195
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
but you can think

2196
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
about the logic of coding.

2197
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
If I connect

2198
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
these two things,

2199
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
the light bulb will light up.

2200
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
For children,

2201
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
many things

2202
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
are developed

2203
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
through

2204
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
touching.

2205
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
For example,

2206
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
we train children

2207
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
to react

2208
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
to stimulations.

2209
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
There are more and more

2210
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
early-stage tools

2211
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
to do this.

2212
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It's not just pressing

2213
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
to sing.

2214
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
When you

2215
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
combine two things

2216
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
into a complex pattern,

2217
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
it will move

2218
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
or sing a song.

2219
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
When

2220
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
you have

2221
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
this resource,

2222
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
it's free.

2223
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You can

2224
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
let children

2225
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
touch these things.

2226
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I don't think

2227
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
it's a perfect age.

2228
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
If you want to know more,

2229
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
do you suggest

2230
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
students

2231
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
to learn this at school

2232
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
or parents

2233
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
to let children

2234
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
learn this at school?

2235
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
At school,

2236
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
the US system

2237
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
is based on

2238
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
the state-by-state.

2239
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Indiana must have

2240
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
CS this year.

2241
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I don't have

2242
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
a complete opinion.

2243
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I think everyone is pushing

2244
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
to get better as soon as possible.

2245
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I just mentioned

2246
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
the world of AI.

2247
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I think everyone

2248
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
will start to learn CS.

2249
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
In Taiwan,

2250
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
some primary schools

2251
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
have already started to teach CS.

2252
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Thank you.

2253
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Thank you for your

2254
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
questions.

2255
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
We have two more

2256
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
questions.

2257
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Thank you.

2258
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It's already 11.30

2259
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
now.

2260
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I want to ask

2261
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
a question.

2262
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Does computing

2263
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
thinking

2264
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
have anything

2265
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
to do with math?

2266
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
For example,

2267
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
is it because

2268
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
primary schools

2269
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
are starting to teach

2270
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
math?

2271
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Or does it have

2272
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
nothing to do with math?

2273
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Are you talking about

2274
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
the US or Taiwan?

2275
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I think

2276
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
the US and Taiwan

2277
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
are not limited to

2278
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
general teaching.

2279
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Math and

2280
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
computing thinking

2281
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
are

2282
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
a good

2283
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
direction.

2284
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I don't think

2285
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
math and

2286
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
computing thinking

2287
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
have anything to do

2288
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
with science.

2289
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I just mentioned

2290
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
that CS teachers

2291
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
are very short.

2292
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Very few people

2293
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
become a teacher

2294
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
because of

2295
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
CS.

2296
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
In professional training,

2297
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
CS teachers are

2298
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
very short.

2299
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I haven't heard

2300
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
this concept

2301
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
being incorporated

2302
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
into math.

2303
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
But I think

2304
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
we can find

2305
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
a pattern.

2306
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
For example,

2307
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
we have to see

2308
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
how computation

2309
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
develops.

2310
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I don't see

2311
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
anyone

2312
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
doing overlap

2313
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
between math and

2314
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
computing thinking.

2315
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It depends on how

2316
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
computing thinking

2317
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
is applied in

2318
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
different subjects

2319
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and contexts.

2320
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
So far,

2321
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
no one has

2322
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
discussed

2323
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
the overlap

2324
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
between math and

2325
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
computing thinking.

2326
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Are you in math?

2327
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yes, if you're interested,

2328
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I think it's worth

2329
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
doing.

2330
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
If you can think of

2331
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
a way to overlap

2332
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
math and computing

2333
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
thinking,

2334
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
it would be a good

2335
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
transition.

2336
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I see people

2337
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
combining math and

2338
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
computing thinking.

2339
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
But if we can

2340
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
find a way to

2341
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
combine math and

2342
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
computing thinking,

2343
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
it would be a good

2344
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
transition.

2345
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Thank you.

2346
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
You're welcome.

2347
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Let's open

2348
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
the last question.

2349
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Anyone?

2350
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
If not,

2351
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
please stay on

2352
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
the platform

2353
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
after the presentation.

2354
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I will

2355
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
stop the recording

2356
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
now.

2357
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Thank you.
