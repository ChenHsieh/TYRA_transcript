0	8000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tarot Talk. I am the host today, Zhang Yanyong.
8000	18000	We are very honored to invite Dr. Zeng Sihao, a colleague at my school, to tell us about the topic of his research on the Internet today.
18000	28000	His research focuses on the parallel and variable traffic engineering of re-adjusting latency.
28000	32000	Let me introduce Dr. Sihao.
32000	41000	Dr. Sihao majored in Electrical Engineering at NTU.
41000	47000	He then went to Cornell to study ECE, Electrical Engineering.
47000	56000	He then came to Caltech to study Computer and Mathematical Science.
56000	63000	He then studied Engineering and Applied Science.
63000	69000	Let's give the floor to Dr. Sihao.
69000	74000	Thank you, Yanyong, for the introduction.
74000	79000	This topic is actually a bit long and difficult to understand.
79000	84000	However, when Yanyong invited me to give a talk, I thought that since it is a talk,
84000	88000	why not talk about a topic that is actually related to my research?
88000	93000	So I took the ICMP paper that I submitted last year.
93000	98000	Today I will try to make it as simple as possible.
98000	102000	Although this topic looks very difficult, you don't have to worry too much.
102000	109000	Its English title is Perseverance-Aware Traffic Engineering in Rate-Adaptive Networks with Reconfiguration Delay.
109000	114000	So I just translated the English title into Chinese.
114000	119000	As for what each term means, we will see later.
119000	124000	If you have any questions in the middle, please feel free to interrupt me at any time and ask me questions.
125000	130000	In addition, Caltech has a special system called Computing and Mathematical Science.
130000	135000	This system is actually under Engineering.
135000	140000	Although C stands for Engineering, the department seems to be under it.
140000	145000	It seems that the relationship between division and department is not quite the same,
145000	150000	but it is actually not very important.
150000	153000	So why do we want to study this topic?
153000	156000	My research topic is mainly about the Internet.
156000	159000	What is the Internet? The Internet is actually a bunch of things connected together.
159000	161000	Why do we want to connect a bunch of things together?
161000	164000	Basically, we want to communicate with each other.
164000	167000	We send some things, some information from one end of the Internet,
167000	170000	and we hope to get this information on the other end.
170000	173000	Or we want to send some goods, such as a logistics network.
173000	178000	For example, we want to transport fruits from Chiayi to Taipei.
178000	180000	This is also a network.
180000	183000	In fact, most of my research is on the Internet of information,
183000	190000	that is, the Internet of communication between some electronic products or electronic devices using electronic signals.
190000	195000	How are these networks usually transmitted?
195000	198000	That is to say, how is this information transmitted on the Internet?
198000	202000	Usually, for example, we will have our own personal equipment.
202000	205000	For example, today's lecture is the same.
205000	209000	We may use a computer or a tablet or a mobile phone.
209000	211000	We will connect to the Internet.
211000	213000	What does it mean to connect to the Internet?
213000	220000	In fact, we are sending a piece of information to a place called an exchanger, a router.
220000	224000	Sometimes this router also has a wireless exchanger,
224000	227000	such as AP, Access Point.
227000	230000	This is for wireless networks.
230000	233000	Sometimes you will also use a base station to receive these things.
233000	236000	After these terminals receive the message,
236000	241000	they will send it through an exchanger to a space.
241000	244000	Then we will be on the other side of the space.
244000	249000	Maybe someone else uses another device to get this information.
249000	252000	This is basically how the whole network works.
252000	254000	In this case,
254000	259000	because we use an exchanger to connect a lot of different devices,
259000	263000	we may put our information into an exchanger
263000	267000	and then go to another place to get something else.
267000	272000	In order to get a specific thing,
272000	275000	we have to establish a point-to-point connection with it.
275000	277000	This is actually quite important.
277000	280000	In the early days, the Internet was a bit like a telephone line.
280000	282000	At that time, there was a connection god.
282000	284000	When the two of us wanted to communicate,
284000	287000	there must be a line in the middle to communicate with us.
287000	289000	But today, the Internet is not necessary.
289000	293000	Today, the Internet actually sends a lot of different traffic
293000	296000	in various ways, using this kind of exchanger,
296000	302000	one by one to our target destination.
302000	305000	These terminals can be various things.
305000	308000	For example, you can be a so-called cloud terminal,
308000	310000	a server at the far end.
310000	313000	Or when we play games with others,
313000	315000	we may have a server.
315000	318000	We may also receive messages from others.
318000	320000	For example, the 5G network, which is very popular recently,
320000	325000	is actually talking about the communication at the wireless terminal.
325000	330000	Obviously, no matter how we get the information at the far end,
330000	333000	we have to go through these exchangers in the middle
333000	335000	or through the network in the middle
335000	338000	to help us pass the information from one end to the other.
338000	341000	So even if we have 5G now,
341000	343000	5G means that
343000	348000	5G is very fast from our wireless device to our base station.
348000	349000	But after it gets to the base station,
349000	350000	no matter what you do,
350000	353000	you still have to go through the network in the middle to help you.
353000	360000	So this network is the main focus of my network research.
360000	362000	This is called the broadband network.
362000	363000	Broadband network means that
363000	370000	there is a great distance between the two terminals.
370000	373000	Relatively speaking, if we are only in a local area,
373000	376000	this is called LAN,
376000	382000	which stands for Local Area Network.
382000	383000	Actually, I don't know how to say it in Chinese,
383000	386000	but it's a local network.
386000	389000	So what's the problem with broadband networks?
389000	392000	Because these broadband networks are connected to very far places,
392000	394000	we know that
394000	396000	when we use telecommunications to send things,
396000	399000	electricity is actually very easy to consume.
399000	404000	So how do we send them?
404000	406000	We have to use a very special kind of wire.
406000	409000	We definitely can't use the kind of wire that we usually use to plug breadboards.
409000	413000	We must use a very special kind of wire to send.
413000	416000	So how do we send these things?
416000	418000	We will send them from one terminal to the other.
418000	420000	There must be a very special wire in the middle.
420000	421000	This actually requires cost.
421000	428000	But this cost is sometimes justifiable.
428000	430000	It can be accepted.
430000	432000	If the service I want to provide can make me earn more money,
432000	435000	then of course I am willing to spend a lot of money
435000	441000	to build this kind of expensive link.
441000	444000	You can think of it as these lines in the middle
444000	446000	to connect to two very far places.
446000	449000	For example, many big companies do this.
449000	453000	For example, Microsoft or Google.
453000	456000	Because they usually provide some cloud services.
456000	458000	For example, you may sometimes use
458000	460000	Google Sheets, Google Gmail,
460000	463000	or Microsoft Hotmail,
463000	464000	like this kind of thing,
464000	467000	or all kinds of different services,
467000	469000	such as YouTube.
469000	472000	They just store the data all over the world.
472000	475000	They will let you get the data very quickly.
476000	480000	For example, they will build their own broadband network.
480000	481000	What are the benefits of this?
481000	483000	If you have this broadband network,
483000	486000	I can effectively adjust
486000	489000	how I want to use these lines.
489000	492000	If I can effectively use these lines,
492000	494000	I have a better chance of reducing my costs
494000	496000	and making more money.
496000	497000	Basically like this.
497000	500000	So now most companies
500000	503000	are investing a lot in building their own network.
503000	508000	Instead of purely using some more traditional Internet.
508000	511000	For example, we may sign a contract with AT&T
511000	513000	or we sign a contract with Taiwan Cable.
513000	515000	They actually provide the network,
515000	518000	but the network is not under the control of these companies.
518000	522000	Sometimes you can't adjust
522000	525000	how to use your connection in the middle.
525000	527000	So these big companies usually
527000	529000	will build their own network,
529000	532000	and then they will operate these networks themselves
532000	534000	to achieve higher performance.
535000	537000	We just mentioned that
537000	540000	the network is so far away.
540000	542000	These lines in the middle are actually quite special.
542000	544000	What kind of lines are these lines?
544000	546000	They are not ordinary blue lines.
546000	548000	Of course there are ordinary blue lines,
548000	551000	but the amount of blue lines that can be passed is limited.
551000	552000	And it's more expensive.
552000	554000	So most of the time we use
554000	558000	cheaper blue lines with higher economic value.
558000	560000	This is actually not a blue line.
560000	563000	This is a blue line that uses optical technology
563000	566000	to transmit signals through this light wire.
566000	568000	This light wire is actually cheaper.
568000	571000	And then there is a lot of information that can be transmitted by the light wire.
571000	572000	Because you use light.
572000	573000	Compared to electrical signals,
573000	577000	you have all kinds of different frequencies.
577000	578000	It can also be used.
578000	579000	And the speed of light is also quite fast.
579000	582000	It doesn't need to use electronic signals
582000	584000	to receive it first and then transmit it.
584000	587000	They just enhance the strength of light
587000	588000	and then continue to transmit.
588000	590000	So it actually has a lot of benefits.
590000	591000	That is to say,
591000	596000	most of these big companies
596000	598000	will use some light wires
598000	600000	to transmit signals far away,
600000	602000	and then turn it into electrical signals
602000	603000	at the end point.
603000	605000	Then we communicate with electrical signals.
605000	607000	These light wires are actually
607000	612000	better than ordinary blue lines.
612000	614000	That is to say, it has a higher economic value.
614000	617000	But how do you say on this broadband network,
617000	619000	no matter how cheap it is,
619000	620000	you have to pull a few hundred kilometers,
620000	622000	it will be expensive right away.
622000	623000	So no matter,
623000	625000	and you are in maintenance,
625000	626000	or in operation,
626000	627000	it's actually not cheap.
627000	630000	So these light wires on the broadband network
630000	634000	are actually a kind of expensive equipment.
634000	637000	Usually we don't want to say
637000	640000	that our light wires can't be used.
640000	642000	What does it mean not to be used?
642000	645000	That is to say, light wires are actually usable.
645000	646000	That is to say,
646000	648000	my signal can go through this light wire.
648000	650000	That is to say, after I go through this light wire,
650000	652000	I can get my signal.
652000	654000	Let's use a simple example here.
654000	655000	How do we send a signal
655000	657000	from one end to the other?
657000	658000	You can imagine that
658000	660000	we are on both ends of the light wire.
660000	663000	We can actually send it,
663000	665000	we can send it at its frequency.
665000	666000	If we think of a white paper,
666000	668000	we can draw a dot on the white paper.
668000	670000	Then we put this paper through the light wire.
670000	672000	The light wire will pass this paper to the other side.
672000	673000	Then I look at this paper.
673000	675000	Ah, what is your signal?
675000	678000	If the other person can interpret your signal,
678000	681000	that means your signal has been successfully passed.
681000	683000	So let's use this simple example to see.
683000	685000	Suppose I have a big white paper now.
685000	687000	I can send this white paper to the other side.
687000	689000	Then I can tell the other person
689000	690000	a similar code.
690000	692000	Say, if you see me
692000	694000	put a dot on the left, it's 0.
694000	697000	Put a dot on the right, it's 1.
697000	698000	In this case,
698000	701000	we can use this code to send information.
701000	702000	As long as you have 0 and 1,
702000	706000	you can generate a lot of different information
706000	709000	in this sequence.
709000	710000	The problem is,
710000	712000	this actually sounds pretty good.
712000	714000	Then we keep sending this.
714000	715000	For example, my left, right,
715000	716000	right, left, left, right, right.
716000	718000	Then we can quickly send out the signal.
718000	719000	Isn't that great?
719000	720000	But what is reality?
720000	723000	Reality is that all signals follow the message.
723000	725000	That is to say, everyone is sending something.
725000	727000	In the past, it was not so beautiful
727000	729000	in the middle of the opposite.
729000	731000	In the middle, there must be some
731000	734000	battery signal or light signal interference.
734000	736000	Let's take a simple example today.
736000	737000	Suppose we have a message.
737000	740000	It will draw this thing on the paper.
740000	742000	For example, I draw this dot.
742000	745000	Shake it left and right.
745000	746000	When we get to the other side,
746000	747000	we look like
747000	749000	For example, I received a signal of shake.
749000	750000	For example, like this.
750000	752000	It's a little bit off.
752000	754000	But it's still roughly on the left.
754000	756000	So in the middle of this case,
756000	759000	we can say that this is still zero.
759000	760000	I probably know it's zero.
760000	762000	Anyway, although there is a little bit of noise,
762000	764000	but it's roughly the signal on the left.
764000	768000	So I know it's zero from my code.
768000	770000	Then it is possible that noise
770000	771000	may also put your signal
771000	773000	a little bit in a different direction.
773000	774000	In this case,
774000	777000	you are probably also quite confident that
777000	779000	this signal is actually on the left.
779000	781000	So it's zero.
781000	783000	But if I give you a signal like this today,
784000	787000	Is it on the left or on the right?
787000	788000	It seems to be a little bit on the left
788000	789000	and a little bit on the right, right?
789000	791000	So it's not easy to judge.
791000	792000	If we draw a line,
792000	793000	that is to say,
793000	795000	we separate the original left and right
795000	797000	and draw the line out a little bit.
797000	799000	It's actually still on the left.
799000	800000	So I know this signal
800000	802000	is probably still zero.
802000	804000	But sometimes it's just not so lucky.
804000	806000	For example, this noise is actually very big.
806000	809000	It pushed my signal to the very right.
809000	810000	How do you know
810000	812000	it's zero or one at this time?
812000	813000	Then we might say
813000	815000	your original signal is one.
815000	816000	But in fact,
816000	818000	the original signal I sent was zero.
818000	820000	So in this situation,
820000	822000	my signal is actually
822000	824000	unable to successfully send to the opposite side.
824000	825000	That is to say,
825000	826000	in this case,
826000	828000	if the noise is very big,
828000	830000	I can't actually successfully
830000	832000	send the message I want to send
832000	834000	through the light to the opposite side.
834000	836000	So in this case,
836000	837000	we can say that
837000	839000	this light can't be used.
839000	840000	Because you can't successfully
840000	842000	send the signal to the opposite side.
844000	846000	Let's use an example to see
846000	848000	if this kind of situation
848000	850000	is actually very rare,
850000	851000	then it doesn't matter.
851000	852000	For example, I might have
852000	853000	a million times, ten million times,
853000	854000	a hundred million times,
854000	855000	I only happen to have
855000	856000	a very unfortunate
856000	858000	case of my signal being intercepted.
858000	859000	Then I just throw it away.
859000	860000	I might just ask the other side
860000	861000	to re-send it again or something.
861000	862000	There's probably no problem.
862000	864000	If we take these two,
864000	865000	for example,
865000	866000	I either send zero
866000	867000	or send one,
867000	869000	the signal that is disturbed by the noise
869000	871000	will be drawn out to take a look.
871000	872000	For example,
872000	874000	it might look like this.
874000	875000	That is to say,
875000	877000	if I send zero,
877000	878000	we use red to show
878000	879000	the situation when I send zero.
879000	880000	After sending zero,
880000	882000	it may be disturbed by the noise.
882000	883000	The signal I see
883000	884000	at the receiving end
884000	885000	may look like this,
885000	887000	scattered everywhere.
887000	888000	Similarly,
888000	889000	if I originally send one,
889000	891000	it is the green signal one
891000	892000	that I originally sent,
892000	893000	it may also be disturbed by the noise
893000	895000	and scatter like this.
895000	897000	But even in this situation,
897000	898000	although we can see
898000	900000	that some signals
900000	903000	may be misjudged,
903000	904000	but generally speaking,
904000	905000	most of the signals
905000	907000	are still distinguishable.
907000	908000	In this situation,
908000	909000	this light wire
909000	910000	can still be used
910000	912000	because most of the signals
912000	913000	are actually fine.
913000	916000	There is no problem in judgment.
916000	917000	But if today's situation
917000	918000	is like this,
918000	919000	in today's situation,
919000	920000	the noise
920000	921000	scatters my signal
921000	922000	to such an extent
922000	923000	that most of the red
923000	924000	and green signals
924000	925000	are actually mixed together.
925000	926000	In this case,
926000	928000	it is easy for me to make a misjudgment.
928000	930000	Even if I send one at the beginning,
930000	931000	I may have a big chance
931000	933000	to be judged as zero.
933000	934000	Even if I send zero,
934000	935000	I have a lot of chances
935000	936000	to be judged as one.
936000	938000	In this situation,
938000	939000	it is difficult for you
939000	940000	to say that
940000	941000	you can't use this light wire
941000	943000	because its noise
943000	944000	is far greater than
944000	949000	the signal energy of your signal.
949000	950000	In this situation,
950000	951000	we have to separate
951000	952000	these two
952000	954000	original zeros and ones.
954000	955000	If we separate them,
955000	956000	we have a chance
956000	959000	to be judged as one.
959000	960000	At that time,
960000	961000	you will consume
961000	962000	more energy.
962000	963000	Or,
963000	964000	in this situation,
964000	965000	you may reach
965000	966000	the level of energy
966000	967000	your machine can send
967000	968000	every time
968000	969000	you lower the width
969000	970000	of the white paper.
970000	971000	Then you may say
971000	973000	that this thing cannot be used.
973000	974000	So this is the signal
974000	975000	that will be affected
975000	976000	by the intensity
976000	978000	of the noise signal
978000	979000	to cause
979000	981000	whether this light wire
981000	982000	can be used
982000	983000	or not.
983000	984000	Of course,
984000	985000	sometimes it is
985000	987000	a more unfortunate situation.
987000	988000	But,
988000	989000	in fact,
989000	990000	sometimes we are
990000	991000	very lucky.
991000	992000	Because when we
992000	993000	operate the light wire,
993000	994000	we usually
994000	995000	separate these two signals
995000	996000	very widely.
996000	997000	This is the so-called
997000	998000	conservative operation.
998000	999000	In this situation,
999000	1000000	there are not so many
1000000	1001000	noise signals.
1001000	1003000	Even if there are noise signals,
1003000	1004000	we will see that
1004000	1005000	these two groups
1005000	1006000	are actually
1006000	1007000	quite widely separated.
1007000	1008000	That is to say,
1008000	1009000	if I give you
1009000	1010000	zero at the beginning,
1010000	1012000	then I will
1012000	1013000	probably
1013000	1014000	have no problem
1014000	1015000	to easily
1015000	1016000	determine that
1016000	1017000	this is zero.
1017000	1018000	Similarly,
1018000	1019000	I can easily
1019000	1020000	know that
1020000	1021000	the group on the right
1021000	1022000	is probably one.
1022000	1023000	In this situation,
1023000	1024000	in fact,
1024000	1025000	we will now say
1025000	1026000	that this light wire
1026000	1027000	can be used.
1027000	1028000	It's really good.
1028000	1029000	But in fact,
1029000	1030000	at the same time,
1030000	1031000	we can find that
1031000	1033000	there are still a lot of blanks here.
1033000	1034000	In fact,
1034000	1035000	we can
1035000	1036000	make this white paper
1036000	1038000	more efficient.
1038000	1039000	What should we do?
1039000	1041000	We not only give zero,
1041000	1042000	but we can also
1042000	1043000	give some other...
1043000	1044000	We can also
1044000	1045000	subdivide this
1045000	1046000	white paper
1046000	1047000	into four equal parts.
1047000	1048000	Let's say
1048000	1049000	if I see
1049000	1050000	this dot on the far left,
1050000	1051000	then I actually
1051000	1052000	want to tell you that it's zero.
1052000	1053000	I want to
1053000	1054000	say one zero
1054000	1055000	on the far right.
1055000	1056000	Similarly,
1056000	1057000	we can see
1057000	1058000	these dots in the middle.
1058000	1059000	I just say zero one.
1059000	1060000	If this signal
1060000	1061000	is actually not
1061000	1062000	disturbed by noise,
1062000	1063000	then in fact,
1063000	1064000	we can still
1064000	1065000	successfully
1065000	1066000	receive these signals.
1066000	1067000	Because
1067000	1068000	these signals
1068000	1069000	are still
1069000	1070000	roughly in
1070000	1071000	their original positions.
1071000	1072000	Since they are
1072000	1073000	roughly in
1073000	1074000	their original positions,
1074000	1075000	we can still
1075000	1076000	easily judge that
1076000	1077000	if I see
1077000	1078000	a signal here today,
1078000	1079000	then I probably know
1079000	1080000	that there is no problem.
1080000	1081000	Its original signal
1081000	1082000	is actually
1082000	1083000	zero.
1083000	1084000	Its original signal
1084000	1085000	is zero.
1085000	1086000	Like this.
1086000	1087000	So,
1087000	1088000	at the same time,
1088000	1089000	how many signals
1089000	1090000	can we send
1090000	1091000	with a piece of white paper?
1091000	1092000	It's not just
1092000	1093000	related to
1093000	1094000	the size of this piece of white paper.
1094000	1095000	It's also related
1095000	1096000	to the noise
1096000	1097000	it receives.
1097000	1098000	So this is
1098000	1099000	the so-called
1099000	1100000	noise ratio,
1100000	1101000	SNR.
1101000	1102000	So,
1102000	1103000	the bigger my piece of white paper is,
1103000	1104000	the more
1104000	1105000	I can send
1105000	1106000	messages.
1106000	1107000	At the same time,
1107000	1108000	I can not only say
1108000	1109000	zero or one,
1109000	1110000	I can also say
1110000	1111000	zero zero,
1111000	1112000	zero one,
1112000	1113000	one zero one.
1113000	1114000	That means
1114000	1115000	the messages I can send
1115000	1116000	at the same time
1116000	1117000	are more.
1117000	1118000	The more,
1118000	1119000	that means
1119000	1120000	my frequency is higher.
1120000	1121000	What about SNR?
1121000	1122000	Of course,
1122000	1123000	at the same time,
1123000	1124000	if you have a lot of noise,
1124000	1125000	then you can
1125000	1126000	do less things.
1126000	1127000	Because although
1127000	1128000	your piece of white paper is big,
1128000	1129000	at the same time,
1129000	1130000	the amount of messages
1130000	1131000	you can receive
1131000	1132000	is not that much.
1132000	1133000	The messages you can successfully
1133000	1134000	see on the other side
1134000	1135000	are not that much.
1135000	1136000	Now,
1136000	1137000	if we consider
1137000	1138000	the transmission of
1138000	1139000	signals,
1139000	1140000	it's like this.
1140000	1141000	If we want to
1141000	1142000	send a signal
1142000	1143000	from the left
1143000	1144000	to the right
1144000	1145000	via a light
1145000	1146000	to the right,
1146000	1147000	we can think that
1147000	1148000	our signal
1148000	1149000	is a bit like
1149000	1150000	a piece of white paper.
1150000	1151000	Then we
1151000	1152000	decide
1152000	1153000	the code
1153000	1154000	between each other.
1154000	1155000	For example,
1155000	1156000	if I see on the left,
1156000	1157000	this is zero zero,
1157000	1158000	zero zero,
1158000	1159000	zero one,
1159000	1160000	one one,
1160000	1161000	one one zero,
1161000	1162000	like this,
1162000	1163000	this is called
1163000	1164000	modulation.
1164000	1165000	Modulation
1165000	1166000	means
1166000	1167000	adjusting
1167000	1168000	the relationship
1168000	1169000	between
1169000	1170000	your changes
1170000	1171000	and your
1171000	1172000	signal.
1172000	1173000	What is this
1173000	1174000	modulation?
1174000	1175000	If the other side
1175000	1176000	also knows
1176000	1177000	this modulation,
1177000	1178000	after you send
1178000	1179000	the signal,
1179000	1180000	the other side
1180000	1181000	can interpret
1181000	1182000	your signal.
1182000	1183000	It's a bit like
1183000	1184000	if I say
1184000	1185000	the leftmost point
1185000	1186000	is zero zero,
1186000	1187000	zero zero,
1187000	1188000	like this.
1188000	1189000	Then we can
1189000	1190000	send the signal
1190000	1191000	from one side
1191000	1192000	of the light
1192000	1193000	to the other side.
1193000	1194000	Of course,
1194000	1195000	it's not that good.
1195000	1196000	If there is no
1196000	1197000	modulation interference,
1197000	1198000	of course it's good.
1198000	1199000	In fact,
1199000	1200000	we can
1200000	1201000	put a lot of points,
1201000	1202000	but because of
1202000	1203000	the modulation,
1203000	1204000	like the example
1204000	1205000	we just saw,
1205000	1206000	because of the modulation,
1206000	1207000	so we actually
1207000	1208000	see the signal
1208000	1209000	at the receiving end
1209000	1210000	here,
1210000	1211000	the signal
1211000	1212000	is a bit
1212000	1213000	not the original position,
1213000	1214000	it may be a little bit
1214000	1215000	off,
1215000	1216000	but if it's not
1216000	1217000	off a lot,
1217000	1218000	we can still
1218000	1219000	successfully know
1219000	1220000	what the original
1220000	1221000	signal looks like.
1221000	1222000	If you see
1222000	1223000	the signal is probably
1223000	1224000	in this area,
1224000	1225000	then we know
1225000	1226000	it was originally
1226000	1227000	this point.
1227000	1228000	Then we can
1228000	1229000	check our meter
1229000	1230000	and say
1230000	1231000	this is zero zero.
1231000	1232000	After this,
1232000	1233000	we can actually
1233000	1234000	not need
1234000	1235000	these colors
1235000	1236000	to mark them,
1236000	1237000	right?
1237000	1238000	That is to say,
1238000	1239000	what is my
1239000	1240000	modulation?
1240000	1241000	How do I
1241000	1242000	divide this white paper
1242000	1243000	into several
1243000	1244000	different areas
1245000	1246000	and then I use
1246000	1247000	each point
1247000	1248000	to represent
1248000	1249000	a signal.
1249000	1250000	If I say
1250000	1251000	there is not
1251000	1252000	much noise
1252000	1253000	on the other side,
1253000	1254000	I can say
1254000	1255000	it's probably
1255000	1256000	in this area
1256000	1257000	and it corresponds
1257000	1258000	to this point.
1258000	1259000	This point
1259000	1260000	represents a signal.
1260000	1261000	So this is
1261000	1262000	what we
1262000	1263000	generally call
1263000	1264000	constellation,
1264000	1265000	that is,
1265000	1266000	if I see
1266000	1267000	this point,
1267000	1268000	what is
1268000	1269000	the signal?
1269000	1270000	Usually,
1270000	1271000	at the receiving end,
1271000	1272000	we will
1272000	1273000	make a judgment
1273000	1274000	based on
1274000	1275000	the message
1275000	1276000	to see
1276000	1277000	which signal
1277000	1278000	is more similar
1278000	1279000	to the original one.
1279000	1280000	Then we will
1280000	1281000	interpret the
1281000	1282000	original signal.
1282000	1283000	So we can
1283000	1284000	also see that
1284000	1285000	this noise
1285000	1286000	actually
1286000	1287000	depends on
1287000	1288000	the strength of
1288000	1289000	the noise
1289000	1290000	is related to
1290000	1291000	the frequency of
1291000	1292000	our signal.
1292000	1293000	Sometimes we
1293000	1294000	say
1294000	1295000	why we can
1295000	1296000	say
1296000	1297000	we buy a line today
1297000	1298000	and we say
1298000	1299000	its frequency is
1299000	1300000	10 GB
1300000	1301000	or we say
1301000	1302000	it is 100 GB.
1302000	1303000	In fact,
1303000	1304000	the frequency of
1304000	1305000	this line
1305000	1306000	is related to
1306000	1307000	noise.
1307000	1308000	The reason is
1308000	1309000	because
1309000	1310000	we generally
1310000	1311000	operate these lines
1311000	1312000	in a conservative way.
1312000	1313000	For example,
1313000	1314000	these lines
1314000	1315000	may have
1315000	1316000	expected
1316000	1317000	noise
1317000	1318000	in the natural world
1318000	1319000	which is
1319000	1320000	something like
1320000	1321000	this.
1321000	1322000	Then we will
1322000	1323000	give a very strong
1323000	1324000	signal
1324000	1325000	to separate it.
1325000	1326000	In this way,
1326000	1327000	we can
1327000	1328000	ensure that
1328000	1329000	we can
1329000	1330000	always
1330000	1331000	restore
1331000	1332000	the
1332000	1333000	original
1333000	1334000	signal.
1334000	1335000	Then we say
1335000	1336000	this line
1336000	1337000	probably has
1337000	1338000	capacity.
1338000	1339000	In fact,
1339000	1340000	when we actually
1340000	1341000	send a signal,
1341000	1342000	we are not
1342000	1343000	only
1343000	1344000	a blank sheet.
1344000	1345000	We are not
1345000	1346000	only one-dimensional.
1346000	1347000	Sometimes we
1347000	1348000	use multiple dimensions
1348000	1349000	or in this case
1349000	1350000	we use two-dimensional
1350000	1351000	to show.
1351000	1352000	For example,
1352000	1353000	I have a
1353000	1354000	two-dimensional signal
1354000	1355000	and we will
1355000	1356000	also be
1356000	1357000	disturbed by
1357000	1358000	noise.
1358000	1359000	These signals
1359000	1360000	scatter
1360000	1361000	and we
1361000	1362000	can see that
1362000	1363000	the degree of
1363000	1364000	scattering is
1364000	1365000	not much.
1365000	1366000	So we can
1366000	1367000	still clearly
1367000	1368000	tell if
1368000	1369000	this signal
1369000	1370000	is in this area
1370000	1371000	and its
1371000	1372000	original signal
1372000	1373000	is here.
1373000	1374000	So it
1374000	1375000	can still
1375000	1376000	successfully
1376000	1377000	pull our
1377000	1378000	signal from
1378000	1379000	one side
1379000	1380000	to the other.
1380000	1381000	The advantage of
1381000	1382000	two-dimensional,
1382000	1383000	three-dimensional
1383000	1384000	or multiple dimensions
1384000	1385000	is that
1385000	1386000	we can
1386000	1387000	expand this
1387000	1388000	blank sheet
1388000	1389000	so we
1389000	1390000	can see that
1390000	1391000	the width of
1391000	1392000	this line
1392000	1393000	is actually
1393000	1394000	the ratio
1394000	1395000	of the signal
1395000	1396000	to its
1396000	1397000	noise.
1397000	1398000	The noise
1398000	1399000	ratio
1399000	1400000	has a
1400000	1401000	very strong
1401000	1402000	relationship.
1402000	1403000	Generally speaking,
1403000	1404000	most of
1404000	1405000	the time,
1405000	1406000	as we
1406000	1407000	just said,
1407000	1408000	although
1408000	1409000	this line
1409000	1410000	is 50
1410000	1411000	Gbps,
1411000	1412000	which is
1412000	1413000	50 x
1413000	1414000	10
1414000	1415000	9
1415000	1416000	square
1416000	1417000	bits,
1417000	1418000	we can
1418000	1419000	still
1419000	1420000	clearly
1420000	1421000	tell
1421000	1422000	if
1422000	1423000	this
1423000	1424000	noise
1424000	1425000	is
1425000	1426000	in
1426000	1427000	this area
1427000	1428000	and
1428000	1429000	its
1429000	1430000	original
1430000	1431000	signal
1431000	1432000	is here
1432000	1433000	and
1433000	1434000	its
1434000	1435000	noise
1435000	1436000	ratio
1436000	1437000	is here.
1437000	1438000	So
1438000	1439000	this
1439000	1440000	noise
1440000	1441000	ratio
1441000	1442000	is
1442000	1443000	about
1443000	1444000	this much.
1444000	1445000	So
1445000	1446000	we can
1446000	1447000	clearly
1447000	1448000	tell
1448000	1449000	if
1449000	1450000	this
1450000	1451000	noise
1451000	1452000	is
1452000	1453000	in
1453000	1454000	this
1454000	1455000	area
1455000	1456000	and
1456000	1457000	its
1457000	1458000	original
1458000	1459000	signal
1459000	1460000	is here
1460000	1461000	and
1461000	1462000	its
1462000	1463000	original
1463000	1464000	noise
1464000	1465000	ratio
1465000	1466000	is here
1466000	1467000	and
1467000	1468000	its
1468000	1469000	original
1469000	1470000	signal
1470000	1471000	is here
1471000	1472000	and
1472000	1473000	its
1473000	1474000	original
1474000	1475000	signal
1475000	1476000	is here.
1476000	1477000	So
1477000	1478000	I can
1478000	1479000	modify
1479000	1480000	the
1480000	1481000	modulation
1481000	1482000	code.
1482000	1483000	If I
1483000	1484000	modify
1484000	1485000	the
1485000	1486000	modulation,
1486000	1487000	I can
1487000	1488000	send more
1488000	1489000	messages
1489000	1490000	to the
1490000	1491000	other side
1491000	1492000	at the
1492000	1493000	same time.
1493000	1494000	So
1494000	1495000	this
1495000	1496000	effectively
1496000	1497000	improves
1497000	1498000	my frequency.
1498000	1499000	So
1499000	1500000	even though
1500000	1501000	we still
1501000	1502000	receive the
1502000	1503000	same
1503000	1504000	signal,
1504000	1505000	I can
1505000	1506000	still
1506000	1507000	modify
1507000	1508000	the
1508000	1509000	modulation
1509000	1510000	code.
1510000	1511000	So
1511000	1512000	I can
1512000	1513000	modify
1513000	1514000	the
1514000	1515000	modulation
1515000	1516000	code
1516000	1517000	and
1517000	1518000	send
1518000	1519000	more
1519000	1520000	messages
1520000	1521000	to the
1521000	1522000	other side
1522000	1523000	at the
1523000	1524000	same
1524000	1525000	time.
1525000	1526000	So
1526000	1527000	I can
1527000	1528000	modify
1528000	1529000	the
1529000	1530000	modulation
1530000	1531000	code
1531000	1532000	and
1532000	1533000	send
1533000	1534000	more
1534000	1535000	messages
1535000	1536000	to the
1536000	1537000	other side
1537000	1538000	at the
1538000	1539000	same
1539000	1540000	time.
1540000	1541000	So
1541000	1542000	I can
1542000	1543000	modify
1543000	1544000	the
1544000	1545000	modulation
1545000	1546000	code
1546000	1547000	and
1547000	1548000	send
1548000	1549000	more
1549000	1550000	messages
1550000	1551000	to the
1551000	1552000	other side
1552000	1553000	at the
1553000	1554000	same
1554000	1555000	time.
1555000	1556000	So
1556000	1557000	I can
1557000	1558000	modify
1558000	1559000	the
1559000	1560000	modulation
1560000	1561000	code
1561000	1562000	and
1562000	1563000	send

1566000	1567000	other side
1567000	1568000	at the
1568000	1569000	same
1569000	1570000	time.
1570000	1571000	So
1571000	1572000	I can
1572000	1573000	modify
1573000	1574000	the
1574000	1575000	modulation

1585000	1586000	So

1587000	1588000	modify
1588000	1589000	the
1589000	1590000	modulation

1659000	1660000	time.
1660000	1661000	So
1661000	1662000	I can
1662000	1663000	modify
1663000	1664000	the
1664000	1665000	modulation
1665000	1666000	code
1666000	1667000	and
1667000	1668000	send

1672000	1673000	at the
1673000	1674000	same
1674000	1675000	time.
1675000	1676000	So
1676000	1677000	I can
1677000	1678000	modify
1678000	1679000	the
1679000	1680000	modulation
1680000	1681000	code
1681000	1682000	and

1687000	1688000	at the
1688000	1689000	same
1689000	1690000	time.
1690000	1691000	So
1691000	1692000	I can
1692000	1693000	modify
1693000	1694000	the
1694000	1695000	modulation
1695000	1696000	code
1696000	1697000	and
1697000	1698000	send
1698000	1699000	more

1703000	1704000	same
1704000	1705000	time.
1705000	1706000	So
1706000	1707000	I can
1707000	1708000	modify
1708000	1709000	the
1709000	1710000	modulation
1710000	1711000	code
1711000	1712000	and
1712000	1713000	send

1717000	1718000	at the
1718000	1719000	same
1719000	1720000	time.
1720000	1721000	So
1721000	1722000	I can
1722000	1723000	modify
1723000	1724000	the
1724000	1725000	modulation
1725000	1726000	code
1726000	1727000	and

1732000	1733000	at the
1733000	1734000	same
1734000	1735000	time.
1735000	1736000	So
1736000	1737000	I can
1737000	1738000	modify
1738000	1739000	the
1739000	1740000	modulation
1740000	1741000	code
1741000	1742000	and
1742000	1743000	send
1743000	1744000	more
1744000	1745000	messages
1745000	1746000	to the
1746000	1747000	other side
1747000	1748000	at the
1748000	1749000	same
1749000	1750000	time.
1750000	1751000	So
1751000	1752000	I can
1752000	1753000	modify
1753000	1754000	the
1754000	1755000	modulation
1755000	1756000	code
1756000	1757000	and
1757000	1758000	send
1758000	1759000	more
1759000	1760000	messages
1760000	1761000	to the
1761000	1762000	other side
1762000	1763000	at the
1763000	1764000	same
1764000	1765000	time.
1765000	1766000	So
1766000	1767000	if
1767000	1768000	we have
1768000	1769000	the
1769000	1770000	light source
1770000	1771000	now,
1771000	1772000	we can
1772000	1773000	modify
1773000	1774000	the
1774000	1775000	code
1775000	1776000	to
1776000	1777000	increase
1777000	1778000	the
1778000	1779000	frequency.
1779000	1780000	But
1780000	1781000	the
1781000	1782000	signal
1782000	1783000	can't
1783000	1784000	be
1784000	1785000	very
1785000	1786000	noisy.
1786000	1787000	So
1787000	1788000	this is
1788000	1789000	the
1789000	1790000	architecture
1790000	1791000	that
1791000	1792000	Microsoft
1792000	1793000	has
1793000	1794000	proposed.
1794000	1795000	Or
1795000	1796000	there
1796000	1797000	is a
1797000	1798000	drawback.
1798000	1799000	It's not a
1799000	1800000	drawback.
1800000	1801000	It's a
1801000	1802000	trade-off.
1802000	1803000	Yes,
1803000	1804000	what we
1804000	1805000	just said
1805000	1806000	was
1806000	1807000	great.
1807000	1808000	If
1808000	1809000	we
1809000	1810000	can
1810000	1811000	use
1811000	1812000	different
1812000	1813000	constellation
1813000	1814000	maps
1814000	1815000	to
1815000	1816000	achieve
1816000	1817000	better
1817000	1818000	frequency.
1818000	1819000	But
1819000	1820000	the
1820000	1821000	problem is
1821000	1822000	that
1822000	1823000	you
1823000	1824000	need to
1824000	1825000	reconfigure
1825000	1826000	the
1826000	1827000	map
1827000	1828000	to
1828000	1829000	achieve
1829000	1830000	good
1830000	1831000	frequency.
1831000	1832000	If
1832000	1833000	you
1833000	1834000	have
1834000	1835000	a
1835000	1836000	new
1836000	1837000	map,
1837000	1838000	you
1838000	1839000	need to
1839000	1840000	reconfigure
1840000	1841000	it.
1841000	1842000	You
1842000	1843000	need to
1843000	1844000	reconfigure
1844000	1845000	it.
1845000	1846000	So
1846000	1847000	I
1847000	1848000	need to
1848000	1849000	reconfigure
1849000	1850000	it.
1850000	1851000	So
1851000	1852000	we
1852000	1853000	need to
1853000	1854000	reconfigure
1854000	1855000	the
1855000	1856000	map
1856000	1857000	to
1857000	1858000	achieve
1858000	1859000	good
1859000	1860000	frequency.
1860000	1861000	So
1861000	1862000	I
1862000	1863000	need to
1863000	1864000	reconfigure
1864000	1865000	it.
1865000	1866000	So
1866000	1867000	I
1867000	1868000	need to
1868000	1869000	reconfigure
1869000	1870000	it.
1870000	1871000	So
1871000	1872000	I
1872000	1873000	need to
1873000	1874000	reconfigure
1874000	1875000	it.
1875000	1876000	So
1876000	1877000	I
1877000	1878000	need to
1878000	1879000	reconfigure
1879000	1880000	it.
1880000	1881000	So
1881000	1882000	I
1882000	1883000	need to
1883000	1884000	reconfigure
1884000	1885000	it.
1885000	1886000	So
1886000	1887000	if we
1887000	1888000	suddenly
1888000	1889000	reconfigure
1889000	1890000	the
1890000	1891000	map,
1891000	1892000	the
1892000	1893000	map
1893000	1894000	will
1894000	1895000	suddenly
1895000	1896000	break.
1896000	1897000	The
1897000	1898000	broken
1898000	1899000	map
1899000	1900000	will
1900000	1901000	cause
1901000	1902000	the
1902000	1903000	traffic
1903000	1904000	disturbance
1904000	1905000	caused
1905000	1906000	by
1906000	1907000	the
1907000	1908000	network
1908000	1909000	sending
1909000	1910000	signals to
1910000	1911000	the
1911000	1912000	network.
1912000	1913000	So
1913000	1914000	the
1914000	1915000	traffic
1915000	1916000	will
1916000	1917000	be
1917000	1918000	disrupted
1918000	1919000	or
1919000	1920000	thrown away.
1920000	1921000	So
1921000	1922000	the
1922000	1923000	users
1923000	1924000	will
1924000	1925000	protest.
1925000	1926000	For
1926000	1927000	example,
1927000	1928000	if you
1928000	1929000	call
1929000	1930000	the
1930000	1931000	network
1931000	1932000	to
1932000	1933000	slow
1933000	1934000	down
1934000	1935000	or
1935000	1936000	break
1936000	1937000	the
1937000	1938000	network,
1938000	1939000	it
1939000	1940000	will
1940000	1941000	cause
1941000	1942000	the
1942000	1943000	network
1943000	1944000	to
1944000	1945000	slow
1945000	1946000	down
1946000	1947000	or
1947000	1948000	break
1948000	1949000	the
1949000	1950000	network.
1950000	1951000	So
1951000	1952000	the
1952000	1953000	traffic
1953000	1954000	will
1954000	1955000	be
1955000	1956000	disrupted
1956000	1957000	or
1957000	1958000	thrown away.
1958000	1959000	So
1959000	1960000	the
1960000	1961000	traffic
1961000	1962000	will
1962000	1963000	be
1963000	1964000	disrupted
1964000	1965000	or
1965000	1966000	broken.
1966000	1967000	So
1967000	1968000	the
1968000	1969000	traffic
1999000	2000000	will
2000000	2001000	be
2001000	2002000	disrupted
2002000	2003000	or
2003000	2004000	broken.
2004000	2005000	So
2005000	2006000	the
2006000	2007000	network
2007000	2008000	will
2008000	2009000	be
2009000	2010000	disrupted
2010000	2011000	or
2011000	2012000	broken.
2012000	2013000	The
2013000	2014000	traffic
2014000	2015000	will
2015000	2016000	be
2016000	2017000	broken or
2017000	2018000	broken.
2018000	2019000	The
2019000	2020000	traffic
2020000	2021000	will
2021000	2022000	be
2022000	2023000	disrupted
2023000	2024000	or
2024000	2025000	broken.
2025000	2026000	So
2026000	2027000	the
2027000	2028000	traffic
2028000	2029000	will
2029000	2030000	be
2030000	2031000	disrupted
2031000	2032000	or
2032000	2033000	broken
2033000	2034000	or
2034000	2035000	damaged
2035000	2036000	or
2036000	2037000	so.
2037000	2038000	So
2038000	2039000	the
2039000	2040000	traffic
2040000	2041000	will
2041000	2042000	be
2042000	2043000	disrupted
2043000	2044000	or
2044000	2045000	broken.
2045000	2046000	So
2046000	2047000	the
2047000	2048000	traffic
2048000	2049000	will
2049000	2050000	be
2050000	2051000	disrupted
2051000	2052000	or
2052000	2053000	damaged
2053000	2054000	or
2054000	2055000	so.
2055000	2056000	So
2056000	2057000	the
2087000	2089000	network
2089000	2090000	will
2090000	2091000	be

2123000	2129000	controlled
2129000	2130000	traffic
2130000	2131000	by
2131000	2132000	walking
2132000	2133000	or
2133000	2134000	biking
2134000	2135000	or
2135000	2137000	traveling
2137000	2138000	by
2138000	2139000	running
2139000	2140000	or
2140000	2142000	traveling
2142000	2143000	express
2143000	2147000	The traffic may be slightly affected by the movement of the network,
2147000	2152000	but it is not directly affected by the movement of the network.
2152000	2154000	This is similar to
2154000	2156000	what the paper said
2156000	2158000	in the past.
2158000	2160000	If we want to
2160000	2162000	change the
2162000	2163000	traffic,
2163000	2166000	we should change the concept in stages.
2166000	2171000	This is the update of the multi-step.
2171000	2173000	So,
2173000	2175000	we can see the difference.
2175000	2177000	If we use the original proposal,
2177000	2178000	which is to cut it off directly,
2178000	2180000	and then restore it,
2180000	2182000	we may cause a huge
2182000	2185000	churn.
2185000	2188000	But if we have several steps now,
2188000	2191000	what should we do?
2191000	2194000	What should we do
2194000	2196000	in each step?
2196000	2199000	This is what we want to do.
2199000	2202000	In this paper,
2202000	2204000	what kind of update
2204000	2206000	do we want to do?
2206000	2207000	In fact,
2207000	2209000	I try not to interfere with
2209000	2210000	so much
2210000	2211000	network traffic
2211000	2212000	in each step.
2212000	2213000	This sounds quite intuitive.
2213000	2215000	If I can
2215000	2217000	get to my
2217000	2219000	final destination today,
2219000	2221000	and in each step,
2221000	2222000	I will not
2222000	2223000	let my
2223000	2225000	original network traffic
2225000	2227000	be cut off.
2227000	2228000	It may only lose a little,
2228000	2229000	but not too much.
2229000	2230000	For me,
2230000	2231000	the less loss,
2231000	2233000	the better.
2233000	2235000	If the best situation is that
2235000	2237000	I do not lose any traffic at all,
2237000	2238000	I can get to the end.
2238000	2240000	But because you have to adjust,
2240000	2241000	you have to
2241000	2242000	have some lines that cannot be used.
2242000	2243000	So, you will definitely lose a little,
2243000	2245000	but you do not lose too much.
2245000	2247000	This should be
2247000	2249000	a conceptually
2249000	2251000	better
2251000	2253000	adjustment plan.
2253000	2254000	The concept of
2254000	2256000	not losing too much
2256000	2257000	is called perseverance.
2257000	2258000	Perseverance
2258000	2259000	is the so-called
2259000	2260000	consistency.
2260000	2261000	That is,
2261000	2262000	this traffic,
2262000	2263000	originally,
2263000	2264000	for example,
2264000	2265000	if it is 1,
2265000	2266000	it can be conservative.
2266000	2267000	It can not
2267000	2268000	lose much.
2268000	2269000	Its loss
2269000	2270000	may be less than
2270000	2271000	how much.
2271000	2272000	We call it
2272000	2273000	perseverance level.
2273000	2274000	Of course,
2274000	2275000	we hope that
2275000	2276000	this perseverance level
2276000	2277000	is
2277000	2278000	the higher,
2278000	2279000	the better.
2279000	2280000	Perseverance
2280000	2281000	is originally
2281000	2282000	1.
2282000	2283000	How much
2283000	2284000	do I need
2284000	2285000	for the rest?
2285000	2286000	For example,
2286000	2287000	0.9,
2287000	2288000	0.8,
2288000	2289000	like this.
2289000	2290000	Like this.
2290000	2291000	So,
2291000	2292000	what is
2292000	2293000	our final
2293000	2294000	plan?
2294000	2295000	Our plan
2295000	2296000	becomes that
2296000	2297000	we want to
2297000	2298000	get to the end
2298000	2299000	as soon as possible,
2299000	2300000	but we do not want
2300000	2301000	to lose too much
2301000	2302000	traffic
2302000	2303000	in each step
2303000	2304000	in the middle.
2304000	2305000	It becomes that
2305000	2306000	we look for
2306000	2307000	the so-called
2307000	2308000	perseverance way,
2308000	2309000	which is
2309000	2310000	to consider
2310000	2311000	the consistency of
2311000	2312000	traffic engineering.
2312000	2313000	The consistency of
2313000	2314000	traffic engineering
2314000	2315000	means that
2315000	2316000	we want to
2316000	2317000	get to the end
2317000	2318000	as soon as possible,
2318000	2319000	but we do not want to
2319000	2320000	lose too much
2320000	2321000	traffic
2321000	2322000	in each step
2322000	2323000	in the middle.
2323000	2324000	This is
2324000	2325000	what we
2325000	2326000	proposed
2326000	2327000	in the middle
2327000	2328000	of this paper.
2328000	2329000	We want to
2329000	2330000	do this
2330000	2331000	new proposal.
2331000	2332000	We think
2332000	2333000	this is
2333000	2334000	actually better
2334000	2335000	than the
2335000	2336000	original
2336000	2337000	churn-based
2337000	2338000	proposal.
2338000	2339000	Why?
2339000	2340000	Because
2340000	2341000	in the churn-based
2341000	2342000	proposal,
2342000	2343000	you cut off
2343000	2344000	most of the
2344000	2345000	traffic,
2345000	2346000	so you will
2346000	2347000	get a
2347000	2348000	very serious
2348000	2349000	network interference.
2349000	2350000	This is
2350000	2351000	actually the
2351000	2352000	so-called
2352000	2353000	perseverance level
2353000	2354000	zero.
2354000	2355000	Between
2355000	2356000	the two
2356000	2357000	steps,
2357000	2358000	what can
2358000	2359000	I lose the most?
2359000	2360000	I can lose
2360000	2361000	all my traffic.
2361000	2362000	All traffic
2362000	2363000	can be cut off,
2363000	2364000	which is
2364000	2365000	perseverance level
2365000	2366000	zero.
2366000	2367000	However,
2367000	2368000	if we
2368000	2369000	keep a
2369000	2370000	higher
2370000	2371000	perseverance level,
2371000	2372000	for example,
2372000	2373000	0.5,
2373000	2374000	there are
2374000	2375000	two middle
2375000	2376000	steps in
2376000	2377000	the update
2377000	2378000	plan.
2378000	2379000	In each
2379000	2380000	plan,
2380000	2381000	I lose
2381000	2382000	at most
2382000	2383000	half of the
2383000	2384000	traffic.
2384000	2385000	For example,
2385000	2386000	if my
2386000	2387000	traffic was
2387000	2388000	from the
2388000	2389000	left to the
2389000	2390000	right,
2390000	2391000	all my
2391000	2392000	lines were
2392000	2393000	used up.
2393000	2394000	In the first
2394000	2395000	step,
2395000	2396000	I pulled
2396000	2397000	the traffic
2397000	2398000	from the
2398000	2399000	top line
2399000	2400000	down
2400000	2401000	and cut
2401000	2402000	them
2402000	2403000	off.
2403000	2404000	In this way,
2404000	2405000	I keep
2405000	2406000	at least
2406000	2407000	half of
2407000	2408000	my
2408000	2409000	traffic.
2409000	2410000	In the
2410000	2411000	entire
2411000	2412000	update process,
2412000	2413000	Can you
2413000	2414000	go back
2414000	2415000	to the
2415000	2416000	last page?
2416000	2417000	Yes,
2417000	2418000	it's in the
2418000	2419000	last page.
2419000	2420000	It's in the
2420000	2421000	last page.
2421000	2422000	There are
2422000	2423000	several pages
2423000	2424000	in the
2424000	2425000	last page.
2425000	2426000	This one?
2426000	2427000	Yes.
2427000	2428000	It's a bit
2428000	2429000	laggy.
2429000	2430000	Yes,
2430000	2431000	this page.
2431000	2432000	I don't know
2432000	2433000	if this is
2433000	2434000	practical.
2434000	2435000	For example,
2435000	2436000	you show
2436000	2437000	a step,
2437000	2438000	the first
2438000	2439000	version,
2439000	2440000	and then you
2440000	2441000	propose
2441000	2442000	unstep.
2442000	2443000	The next
2443000	2444000	thing I think of
2444000	2445000	is why
2445000	2446000	don't you
2446000	2447000	make it
2447000	2448000	infinite?
2448000	2449000	This
2449000	2450000	line becomes
2450000	2451000	a smooth
2451000	2452000	function.
2452000	2453000	A very
2453000	2454000	good question.
2454000	2455000	Your
2455000	2456000	limitation
2456000	2457000	is not
2457000	2458000	how big
2458000	2459000	a step
2459000	2460000	is,
2460000	2461000	right?
2461000	2462000	But what
2462000	2463000	does every step
2463000	2464000	mean?
2464000	2465000	Every step
2465000	2466000	needs at
2466000	2467000	least one
2467000	2468000	line,
2468000	2469000	right?
2469000	2470000	But the
2470000	2471000	network is
2471000	2472000	made up
2472000	2473000	of limited
2473000	2474000	lines,
2474000	2475000	so you
2475000	2476000	can't have
2476000	2477000	infinite steps
2477000	2478000	because you
2478000	2479000	need at
2479000	2480000	least one
2480000	2481000	line every
2481000	2482000	time.
2482000	2483000	So you
2483000	2484000	can only
2484000	2485000	have n
2485000	2486000	lines,
2486000	2487000	so you
2487000	2488000	can only
2488000	2489000	have
2489000	2490000	one
2490000	2491000	line every
2491000	2492000	time.
2492000	2493000	For
2493000	2494000	example,
2494000	2495000	if I
2495000	2496000	want to
2496000	2497000	make a
2497000	2498000	better
2498000	2499000	step,
2499000	2500000	but
2500000	2501000	it
2501000	2502000	gets
2502000	2503000	bigger
2503000	2504000	in the
2504000	2505000	middle,
2505000	2506000	I
2506000	2507000	don't
2507000	2508000	enjoy
2508000	2509000	anything.
2509000	2510000	I
2510000	2511000	lose
2511000	2512000	some
2512000	2513000	frequency.
2513000	2514000	So
2514000	2515000	we want
2515000	2516000	the process
2516000	2517000	to be
2517000	2518000	as short
2518000	2519000	as
2519000	2520000	possible.
2520000	2521000	We
2521000	2522000	can't do
2522000	2523000	that in
2523000	2524000	reality.
2524000	2525000	The
2525000	2526000	second
2526000	2527000	thing is
2527000	2528000	that even
2528000	2529000	if we
2529000	2530000	consider
2530000	2531000	an infinite
2531000	2532000	network,
2532000	2533000	we
2533000	2534000	don't want
2534000	2535000	to do
2535000	2536000	that because
2536000	2537000	we want
2537000	2538000	to get
2538000	2539000	to the
2539000	2540000	new
2540000	2541000	state as
2541000	2542000	soon as
2542000	2543000	possible
2543000	2544000	so that
2544000	2545000	we
2545000	2546000	can have
2546000	2547000	more
2547000	2548000	flexibility.
2548000	2549000	For
2549000	2550000	example,
2550000	2551000	we can
2551000	2552000	ask a
2552000	2553000	few
2553000	2554000	questions.
2554000	2555000	We
2555000	2556000	call this
2556000	2557000	a
2557000	2558000	re-adaptation
2558000	2559000	planning
2559000	2560000	problem.
2560000	2561000	How
2561000	2562000	do I
2562000	2563000	adjust
2563000	2564000	this
2564000	2565000	variable
2565000	2566000	network
2566000	2567000	plan?
2567000	2568000	How
2568000	2569000	many
2569000	2570000	steps
2570000	2571000	do I
2571000	2572000	need to
2572000	2573000	do?
2573000	2574000	The
2574000	2575000	first
2575000	2576000	question is
2576000	2577000	how
2577000	2578000	do I
2578000	2579000	solve this
2579000	2580000	problem?
2580000	2581000	Is
2581000	2582000	there
2582000	2583000	a way
2583000	2584000	to
2584000	2585000	solve it?
2585000	2586000	Unfortunately,
2586000	2587000	this is
2587000	2588000	a very
2588000	2589000	difficult
2589000	2590000	problem
2590000	2591000	called
2591000	2592000	NP-hard.
2592000	2593000	This
2593000	2594000	is a
2594000	2595000	very
2595000	2596000	difficult
2596000	2597000	problem
2597000	2598000	in
2598000	2599000	computer
2599000	2600000	science.
2600000	2601000	It's
2601000	2602000	basically
2602000	2603000	very difficult
2603000	2604000	to
2604000	2605000	solve
2605000	2606000	this
2606000	2607000	problem.
2607000	2608000	If
2608000	2609000	I
2609000	2610000	didn't
2610000	2611000	calculate it
2611000	2612000	accurately,
2612000	2613000	it's
2613000	2614000	basically
2614000	2615000	the same
2615000	2616000	as
2616000	2617000	the
2617000	2618000	NP-hard
2618000	2619000	problem.
2619000	2620000	The

2621000	2622000	is
2622000	2623000	too

2865060	2866060	王
2866080	2872080	So, did our proposal really cut off the traffic?
2872080	2877080	Did we really avoid this from happening?
2877080	2879080	And then,
2879080	2882080	we said that we have heuristics.
2882080	2885080	Is this heuristic easy to calculate?
2885080	2887080	Or is it actually difficult to calculate?
2887080	2889080	If it's also difficult to calculate,
2889080	2890080	we didn't mention one thing,
2890080	2892080	and then we have to calculate for a long time,
2892080	2893080	for example, for ten minutes,
2893080	2894080	we can only update our link.
2894100	2896100	If we update our link,
2896100	2898100	and then the traffic changes,
2898100	2900100	then we won't have enough time.
2900100	2903100	So, we hope that it can be calculated soon.
2903100	2905100	So, we did some experiments.
2905100	2907100	We first used
2907100	2911100	Microsoft's Microsoft Swan
2911100	2913100	and Google's Beeple
2913100	2915100	to do the experiment.
2915100	2917100	And then our
2917100	2918100	Skynet design heuristic,
2918100	2920100	we call it ALG.
2920120	2921120	And OPT,
2921120	2925120	we call it the best solution.
2925120	2928120	So, let's answer the first question.
2928120	2930120	After we add this
2930120	2932120	heuristic condition,
2932120	2935120	can we get
2935120	2937120	a better rating?
2937120	2939120	The conclusion is yes.
2939120	2944120	This row equal to one,
2944120	2946120	if we call this heuristic
2946120	2947120	as 1,
2947120	2948120	we can never
2948120	2949120	lose any rating.
2949140	2950140	That means we basically
2950140	2952140	don't update our links.
2952140	2954140	We can never
2954140	2956140	lose any network traffic.
2956140	2958140	The simplest way is
2958140	2959140	we don't move,
2959140	2961140	and we will never lose any traffic.
2961140	2963140	The original overall rating
2963140	2964140	is like this,
2964140	2966140	the column on the far left.
2966140	2967140	The column on the far right
2967140	2969140	is the solution
2969140	2971140	proposed by Microsoft.
2971140	2972140	If we lose in the middle,
2972140	2974140	how much can we get in the end?
2974140	2975140	We can see that
2975140	2977140	even if we add
2977160	2979160	this perseverance limitation,
2979160	2980160	we still,
2980160	2982160	whether it's the best solution
2982160	2984160	or our heuristic,
2984160	2985160	in the end,
2985160	2988160	they can be the same
2988160	2990160	as the solution
2990160	2993160	proposed by Microsoft.
2993160	2995160	Basically the same.
2995160	2996160	That is to say,
2996160	2997160	although we have perseverance limitation,
2997160	2999160	we are more smooth
2999160	3000160	than the original proposal
3000160	3001160	proposed by Microsoft.
3001160	3003160	But we can't get
3003160	3004160	the best rating
3004160	3005160	because of that.
3005160	3006160	In fact,
3006180	3007180	we can't get
3007180	3008180	the same rating
3008180	3009180	as Microsoft.
3009180	3010180	So,
3010180	3011180	this is the answer
3011180	3013180	to the first question.
3013180	3015180	The second question is
3015180	3017180	what kind of number
3017180	3019180	should we set
3019180	3020180	as our perseverance level?
3020180	3021180	That is,
3021180	3022180	what kind of loss
3022180	3023180	can we accept?
3023180	3024180	We can see
3024180	3026180	what the second picture
3026180	3027180	is about.
3027180	3028180	That is,
3028180	3029180	the process of update,
3029180	3030180	the process of overall rating increase.
3030180	3032180	If we start with
3032180	3034180	a 0.5 perseverance,
3034200	3035200	0.5 perseverance,
3035200	3036200	that is to say,
3036200	3037200	I can accept
3037200	3039200	that I only have 0.5 left.
3039200	3040200	Of course,
3040200	3042200	we give the system operator
3042200	3043200	a lot of space
3043200	3045200	to adjust these lines.
3045200	3046200	So we can reach
3046200	3048200	our final level very quickly.
3048200	3049200	Of course,
3049200	3051200	the less loss I am willing to accept,
3051200	3052200	that is to say,
3052200	3054200	the higher the perseverance limitation I require,
3054200	3056200	the less links
3056200	3057200	I can update every time.
3057200	3058200	Because if I cut off a lot of links,
3058200	3060200	I can't ensure
3060200	3062200	that the original
3062220	3064220	load flow
3064220	3066220	can still reach
3066220	3068220	the original 0.9 level.
3068220	3069220	That is to say,
3069220	3070220	it will be slower.
3070220	3072220	This requires more steps
3072220	3076220	to reach the final level.
3076220	3078220	So the higher the perseverance limitation,
3078220	3079220	of course,
3079220	3081220	the slower you will be.
3081220	3082220	Then we will ask,
3082220	3086220	if there is a perseverance limitation,
3086240	3088240	what is the relationship
3088240	3090240	with my
3090240	3093240	converge time?
3093240	3094240	Of course,
3094240	3097240	if you are willing to
3097240	3099240	accept more interference,
3099240	3100240	that is to say,
3100240	3101240	if you are willing to accept more disturbance,
3101240	3102240	the faster you will
3102240	3104240	get to your final state.
3104240	3105240	This is the same as the picture just now.
3105240	3107240	This is a more detailed picture.
3107240	3108240	That is to say,
3108240	3111240	we ran 1000 random cases,
3111240	3112240	and we found that
3112240	3113240	of course,
3113240	3114240	the higher the perseverance level,
3114260	3116260	the more time it takes to converge.
3118260	3119260	We can find that
3119260	3120260	most of the time,
3120260	3122260	your perseverance level
3122260	3125260	is between 0.5 and 0.7.
3125260	3126260	That is to say,
3126260	3128260	it will converge pretty fast.
3128260	3131260	It will converge pretty fast.
3131260	3132260	It won't converge
3132260	3134260	when it is set to a very high level.
3134260	3136260	So our best choice is this.
3136260	3137260	That is to say,
3137260	3139260	we can converge
3139260	3140260	in 3 to 5 steps.
3140260	3141260	At the same time,
3141260	3142260	we keep the original
3142280	3144280	flow rate between 0.5 and 0.7.
3144280	3145280	That's actually not bad.
3145280	3146280	At least 7 steps.
3146280	3147280	Compared to the original
3147280	3148280	that we threw away directly,
3148280	3150280	we still have 5 to 7 steps
3150280	3151280	to throw away.
3153280	3155280	We originally
3155280	3156280	argued that
3156280	3157280	this perseverance level
3157280	3159280	can make the whole process
3159280	3160280	smoother.
3160280	3161280	That is to say,
3161280	3162280	we won't throw away a lot of traffic.
3162280	3163280	Is that so?
3163280	3165280	Let's take a look at
3165280	3167280	the degree of vibration
3167280	3170280	in the update process.
3170300	3171300	The more vibration,
3171300	3172300	the more to the right.
3172300	3173300	The less vibration,
3173300	3174300	the more to the left.
3174300	3175300	Can you see
3175300	3176300	that we have introduced
3176300	3177300	these two methods
3177300	3179300	of perseverance limitation?
3179300	3181300	Its vibrations are very few.
3181300	3182300	It's not very few.
3182300	3183300	Its vibrations are smaller
3183300	3184300	than the original
3184300	3186300	Microsoft Red1 method.
3186300	3187300	That is to say,
3187300	3188300	our perseverance limitation
3188300	3190300	does help
3190300	3192300	the whole update process
3192300	3193300	to be smoother.
3195300	3196300	The last question
3196300	3197300	we want to answer is that
3197320	3199320	this is great.
3199320	3200320	We are very smooth.
3200320	3201320	But how long
3201320	3202320	does it take to get it?
3202320	3203320	If it takes a long time,
3203320	3204320	it will be lost.
3205320	3206320	Let's take a look at
3206320	3207320	the computation time.
3207320	3208320	The computation time
3208320	3209320	is how long
3209320	3210320	it takes
3210320	3211320	to find
3211320	3213320	a solution.
3214320	3215320	The time on our watch
3215320	3216320	is millisecond.
3216320	3217320	That is to say,
3217320	3218320	millisecond.
3222320	3224320	If we want to find the best solution,
3224320	3225320	it can't be calculated
3225320	3226320	in a very short time.
3226340	3227340	But in fact,
3227340	3229340	if your network is very small,
3229340	3231340	this thing can be solved by force.
3231340	3232340	You just force
3232340	3234340	to find all the possible solutions.
3234340	3235340	In fact,
3235340	3236340	it can be calculated quite quickly.
3236340	3237340	For example,
3237340	3238340	if you want to find the best solution,
3238340	3241340	it takes 67 milliseconds.
3241340	3243340	If you have a bigger network,
3243340	3245340	a bigger network,
3245340	3246340	it takes more seconds.
3246340	3248340	Until you have this,
3248340	3249340	for example,
3249340	3251340	this is a Google network.
3251340	3252340	Google network,
3252340	3253340	you have to spend
3253340	3255340	1.2 times 16 times
3255360	3256360	milliseconds to find one.
3256360	3257360	How much is that?
3257360	3258360	This is about
3258360	3259360	more than 1,000 seconds
3259360	3260360	to calculate
3260360	3262360	the process of updating once.
3262360	3263360	After you finish the calculation,
3263360	3264360	after 1,000 seconds,
3264360	3265360	you may have changed the message again.
3265360	3266360	Then you just
3266360	3268360	wasted your time.
3268360	3269360	In contrast,
3269360	3270360	our algorithm,
3270360	3271360	our heuristic,
3271360	3273360	only takes more than 300 milliseconds
3273360	3274360	to calculate.
3274360	3275360	That is to say,
3275360	3276360	in less than a second,
3276360	3279360	we can tell the entire network
3279360	3281360	how to adjust.
3281360	3283360	This efficiency is very high.
3283380	3285380	The speed of our calculation
3285380	3286380	is very fast.
3286380	3287380	And we can also
3287380	3288380	let this
3288380	3289380	be found in the previous
3289380	3290380	few experiments.
3290380	3292380	In fact, the algorithm we proposed
3292380	3294380	is not much different from the best solution.
3294380	3296380	Although we can't prove
3296380	3298380	that they are always close to each other,
3298380	3300380	because we just said
3300380	3302380	that this thing can't be
3302380	3305380	done on this mirror.
3305380	3306380	But in fact,
3306380	3308380	in terms of real things,
3308380	3309380	the solution we calculated
3309380	3311380	is not much different from the best solution.
3311400	3313400	And our algorithm
3313400	3314400	is very fast.
3314400	3315400	This is the benefit
3315400	3317400	of our new solution.
3318400	3319400	To sum up,
3319400	3321400	what is this paper
3321400	3322400	talking about?
3322400	3323400	This paper says
3323400	3325400	that instead of cutting
3325400	3326400	all the lines directly
3326400	3327400	and then update them,
3327400	3328400	and then we use
3328400	3329400	a higher frequency
3329400	3331400	to send new traffic,
3331400	3333400	we should consider
3333400	3334400	consistency.
3334400	3335400	That is, we need to make sure
3335400	3337400	that the network traffic
3337400	3339400	is not lost too much
3339420	3341420	in the process of traffic.
3341420	3344420	Considering this consistency,
3344420	3346420	it won't cause too much burden.
3346420	3347420	Because we have
3347420	3348420	a very good algorithm.
3348420	3350420	It can quickly
3350420	3351420	solve this problem.
3351420	3352420	It can quickly approach this problem.
3352420	3353420	It's not a solution,
3353420	3354420	but it can quickly
3354420	3355420	find a solution.
3355420	3356420	And this solution
3356420	3359420	is actually pretty good.
3359420	3360420	It's not much different
3360420	3361420	from the best solution.
3361420	3363420	It's not much different
3363420	3364420	from the performance
3364420	3365420	of cutting directly.
3365420	3366420	But it's very
3366420	3368420	smoother than
3368440	3370440	cutting directly.
3372440	3373440	Of course, we also admit that
3373440	3377440	in addition to consistency,
3377440	3379440	system operators
3379440	3380440	can also consider
3380440	3381440	more different aspects.
3381440	3382440	For example,
3382440	3383440	in the middle of the network,
3383440	3384440	in the middle of the update,
3384440	3385440	we hope that
3385440	3386440	these traffic
3386440	3388440	are not lost too much.
3388440	3390440	We may also hope that
3390440	3392440	they have some other
3392440	3394440	characteristics.
3394440	3395440	For example,
3395440	3396440	each traffic
3396460	3398460	cannot be less than
3398460	3401460	the absolute traffic.
3401460	3402460	For example,
3402460	3404460	I must be greater than 10Mbps,
3404460	3405460	I must be greater than 20Mbps.
3405460	3407460	It may not be a percentage,
3407460	3408460	but an absolute traffic.
3408460	3409460	We must maintain
3409460	3410460	how much traffic.
3410460	3411460	Otherwise,
3411460	3412460	I won't,
3412460	3413460	for example,
3413460	3414460	I won't feel a lot of delay
3414460	3415460	in the middle of playing video games.
3415460	3417460	How much traffic do I need at least?
3417460	3418460	For example, like this.
3418460	3419460	So this system operator
3419460	3420460	can actually adjust
3420460	3421460	their requirements
3421460	3423460	for the network.
3423480	3424480	And then,
3424480	3425480	let this network
3425480	3427480	operate more effectively,
3427480	3428480	more efficiently.
3428480	3429480	And they can,
3429480	3430480	in the end,
3430480	3432480	get a better balance.
3432480	3433480	That's all
3433480	3435480	for my speech today.
3435480	3437480	If you have any questions,
3437480	3438480	please feel free to ask.
3438480	3440480	Thank you for listening.
3440480	3441480	This topic,
3441480	3442480	this topic
3442480	3444480	is a little bit harder.
3444480	3445480	So,
3445480	3446480	if you have any questions,
3446480	3447480	please feel free to ask.
3449480	3450480	Let me welcome,
3450480	3451480	let me give a round of applause
3451480	3452480	on behalf of everyone.
3453480	3454480	Yeah.
3454480	3455480	Okay,
3455480	3456480	do you have any questions?
3456480	3457480	Do you have any questions?
3457480	3459480	Let me ask.
3459480	3460480	Yes.
3460480	3461480	For example,
3461480	3462480	if you are now
3462480	3463480	changing
3463480	3464480	their,
3464480	3465480	for example,
3465480	3467480	the two ends of the fiber.
3467480	3468480	For example,
3468480	3469480	the way they receive
3469480	3471480	modulation.
3471480	3472480	Yes.
3472480	3473480	So,
3473480	3474480	on the hardware,
3474480	3475480	will this thing need to be changed for a long time?
3475480	3476480	For example,
3476480	3477480	you were,
3478480	3479480	for example,
3479480	3480480	you said green light, red light, blue light.
3480480	3481480	Maybe it was only red and yellow.
3481480	3482480	Then you added
3482500	3483500	green light into it.
3483500	3484500	Yes.
3484500	3485500	Will it work
3485500	3487500	on the hardware?
3487500	3488500	This is a very good question.
3488500	3489500	Yes,
3489500	3490500	it works.
3490500	3491500	Then how long does it take?
3491500	3493500	At the time of RedOne,
3493500	3494500	in 2018,
3494500	3495500	it took
3496500	3498500	a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds.
3499500	3500500	Every step,
3500500	3501500	a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds.
3501500	3502500	Of course,
3502500	3503500	we can consider,
3503500	3504500	if you say
3504500	3505500	a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds,
3505500	3506500	there is no difference, right?
3506500	3507500	But if you consider
3507500	3508500	these are broadband networks,
3508500	3509500	these broadband networks
3509500	3511500	carry a lot of traffic.
3511520	3513520	It may have a few terabytes of traffic
3513520	3516520	or a few thousand terabytes.
3516520	3518520	Multiplied by a few hundred milliseconds,
3518520	3520520	that is a very objective
3520520	3521520	traffic loss.
3523520	3524520	But,
3524520	3525520	how did it work before?
3525520	3526520	It used to be like
3526520	3527520	you said,
3527520	3528520	what if you want to add red light,
3528520	3529520	add blue light?
3529520	3530520	It is to turn off both sides first.
3531520	3533520	Because your laser needs to be adjusted again.
3533520	3534520	After you adjust the laser again,
3534520	3536520	you let it send out the laser again.
3537520	3538520	So,
3538520	3539520	turning it off and restarting
3539540	3541540	is actually very slow.
3541540	3542540	Now,
3542540	3543540	why does it need a few hundred milliseconds?
3543540	3544540	It was mentioned
3544540	3545540	in the original RedOne paper.
3545540	3546540	They said,
3546540	3547540	if we say
3547540	3549540	turning it off and restarting
3549540	3550540	is a major factor
3550540	3552540	in causing this delay,
3552540	3554540	we can try not to turn it off and restart.
3554540	3556540	If you don't turn it off and restart,
3556540	3558540	they can't make it work
3558540	3560540	at that time.
3560540	3562540	But they estimate that
3562540	3564540	if you don't turn it off and restart,
3564540	3566540	it may only take
3566540	3568540	a microsecond
3568560	3570560	to reach
3570560	3572560	the goal of re-adjustment.
3573560	3574560	If we say
3574560	3575560	our future network
3575560	3576560	can be seamless,
3576560	3577560	that is,
3577560	3578560	if I want to re-adjust,
3578560	3579560	I can re-adjust immediately.
3579560	3580560	Then,
3580560	3581560	of course,
3581560	3582560	our research
3582560	3583560	has nothing
3583560	3584560	to do with
3584560	3587560	their original research.
3587560	3588560	Because we basically
3588560	3589560	don't lose anything.
3590560	3591560	So,
3591560	3592560	I think this question is very important.
3592560	3593560	In the end,
3593560	3594560	how is it done on hardware?
3594560	3595560	Can it be done?
3595560	3596560	Yes, it can be done.
3596580	3597580	Is there any other
3597580	3598580	research requirement on hardware?
3598580	3599580	Yes,
3599580	3600580	that is,
3600580	3601580	how do we adjust
3601580	3602580	this modulation
3602580	3603580	dynamically?
3604580	3605580	In fact,
3605580	3606580	there are many ways
3606580	3607580	that can be thought of.
3607580	3608580	For example,
3608580	3609580	we can send the modulation
3609580	3610580	in advance,
3610580	3611580	right?
3611580	3612580	Then I will tell the other person
3612580	3614580	when I start
3614580	3616580	to use this new modulation.
3617580	3618580	In the middle,
3618580	3619580	it may need
3619580	3620580	some ways
3620580	3621580	to let the two sides communicate.
3621580	3622580	For example,
3622580	3623580	you want to use a clock.
3623580	3624580	That is,
3624580	3625580	you want to make
3625600	3626600	the timing
3626600	3627600	good enough.
3627600	3628600	For example,
3628600	3629600	I will immediately switch
3629600	3630600	both sides at 7 o'clock.
3630600	3631600	This is actually quite difficult
3631600	3632600	because you have to
3632600	3633600	synchronize both sides.
3633600	3634600	That is to say,
3634600	3635600	your time is consistent.
3635600	3636600	In fact,
3636600	3637600	sometimes it's not that easy.
3637600	3638600	Another way is
3638600	3639600	you send some
3639600	3641600	this packet,
3641600	3642600	send some information.
3642600	3643600	That is,
3643600	3644600	in addition to your
3644600	3645600	information,
3645600	3646600	send some
3646600	3647600	control messages
3647600	3648600	to the other side
3648600	3649600	and tell him
3649600	3650600	I want to start using it.
3650600	3651600	Then,
3651600	3652600	which packet
3652600	3653600	do I start using?
3653600	3654600	For example,
3654620	3655620	it's a little more complicated.
3655620	3656620	Because the current
3656620	3658620	system is not designed like this.
3658620	3659620	Their original system
3659620	3660620	may have imagined
3660620	3661620	that once you turn it on,
3661620	3662620	what is the modulation?
3662620	3663620	Just keep using it.
3664620	3665620	So, in the middle,
3665620	3666620	there are actually
3666620	3668620	a lot of research that can be done.
3670620	3672620	Does this answer your question?
3672620	3673620	Yes.
3674620	3675620	So, you said
3675620	3676620	Microsoft
3677620	3679620	changed
3679620	3680620	the modulation method like this.
3680620	3682620	How many times can it be improved?
3682620	3683620	Or how many percent?
3683640	3684640	How many times can it be improved?
3684640	3685640	Its improvement
3685640	3688640	is actually pretty good.
3688640	3689640	Let me find
3689640	3691640	its original paper.
3697640	3698640	I don't know if you can see
3698640	3699640	the original.
3699640	3700640	It's not good for me to show the paper directly.
3700640	3701640	But it doesn't matter.
3703640	3704640	Let's take a look.
3704640	3705640	When you show it,
3705640	3707640	before you finish,
3707640	3708640	you swipe to its title page
3708640	3710640	and show the author.
3711640	3712640	The author.
3712660	3713660	Do you know why?
3713660	3714660	Does it mean you can see the author?
3714660	3715660	Yes.
3717660	3719660	If you look at its original paper,
3719660	3720660	it's actually...
3720660	3721660	Let me see.
3725660	3726660	It can actually improve
3726660	3728660	a lot of traffic.
3729660	3730660	Or it can
3730660	3732660	avoid traffic drop.
3732660	3734660	But because their original
3735660	3736660	paper
3736660	3737660	talks about
3737660	3739660	a pretty simple
3739660	3740660	network.
3740660	3741660	It only has four points.
3742660	3743660	These four points
3743660	3744660	are in California.
3745660	3746660	So this
3746660	3748660	is just a prototype.
3748660	3749660	So
3749660	3751660	when it's actually used,
3752660	3753660	we can only say
3753660	3754660	it has a lot of potential.
3754660	3755660	But in the end,
3755660	3756660	when it's actually used,
3757660	3758660	it's not sure
3758660	3759660	if it's good or not.
3759660	3760660	But this idea
3760660	3761660	has a lot of potential.
3762660	3763660	This is the paper.
3764660	3765660	Whatsoever published this paper.
3765680	3766680	Whatsoever published this paper.
3770680	3771680	The purpose of this paper
3771680	3772680	is to say
3772680	3773680	this idea is pretty good.
3773680	3774680	But
3774680	3775680	our update
3775680	3776680	doesn't need to be so crude.
3776680	3777680	It can be more detailed.
3777680	3778680	This concept.
3781680	3782680	Of course, if we have better
3782680	3784680	hardware in the future,
3784680	3785680	then...
3785680	3786680	Go ahead.
3786680	3787680	My question is this.
3787680	3788680	When you're doing
3788680	3789680	your simulation,
3789680	3790680	basically,
3790680	3792680	you have to have some assumptions
3792680	3793680	about disturbance.
3793700	3794700	Yes.
3794700	3796700	What kind of
3796700	3798700	situation are you in
3798700	3799700	to compare?
3799700	3800700	So your disturbance
3800700	3801700	is like,
3801700	3802700	Google,
3802700	3803700	what do they do?
3803700	3804700	Or how do you
3804700	3805700	generate
3805700	3806700	the disturbance
3806700	3807700	in your simulation?
3808700	3809700	This is a good question.
3809700	3810700	So
3810700	3811700	what I actually generate
3811700	3812700	is not disturbance.
3812700	3813700	What I generate is
3814700	3815700	this link
3815700	3816700	the current state
3816700	3817700	and the next state.
3818700	3819700	So I actually
3819700	3820700	added a layer
3820700	3821700	of assumption.
3821700	3822700	That is to say,
3822720	3823720	let's assume that
3823720	3824720	my current link
3824720	3825720	can only send
3825720	3826720	50 gigabytes per second.
3826720	3828720	50 Gbps.
3828720	3829720	And then
3829720	3830720	because
3830720	3832720	the noise has dropped
3832720	3833720	I can send 100 Gbps now.
3833720	3835720	How should I update?
3836720	3837720	So
3837720	3838720	in the middle
3838720	3839720	I put the
3839720	3840720	relationship between
3840720	3841720	noise and signal
3841720	3842720	in there.
3842720	3843720	In fact,
3843720	3844720	in operation,
3844720	3845720	of course,
3845720	3846720	there are
3846720	3848720	other restrictions.
3850720	3851720	In fact,
3851740	3852740	there is also in the paper.
3852740	3853740	But I don't want to
3853740	3854740	show this paper again.
3854740	3855740	That is to say,
3855740	3856740	the adjustment of our screen width
3856740	3857740	is actually
3857740	3858740	not continuous.
3858740	3859740	That is to say,
3859740	3860740	the screen width
3860740	3861740	we can use
3861740	3862740	is not continuous.
3862740	3863740	For example,
3863740	3864740	25 Mbps,
3864740	3865740	50 Mbps,
3865740	3866740	100 Mbps,
3866740	3867740	150,
3867740	3868740	like this.
3868740	3869740	So,
3869740	3870740	you are actually
3870740	3871740	choosing these kinds.
3871740	3872740	No matter how much noise you have,
3872740	3873740	when it reaches
3873740	3874740	a certain point
3874740	3875740	you can probably
3875740	3876740	adjust it up.
3876740	3877740	You can adjust it
3877740	3878740	from 100 to 150
3878740	3879740	or 150 to 200.
3879760	3881760	But in fact,
3881760	3882760	why can you adjust
3882760	3883760	the principle
3883760	3884760	is what I just said
3884760	3885760	about the noise.
3885760	3886760	So, in fact,
3886760	3888760	how is it measured?
3888760	3889760	I don't have
3889760	3891760	this information.
3891760	3892760	I just
3892760	3893760	make an assumption
3893760	3894760	based on the range
3894760	3895760	it can adjust.
3897760	3898760	So, my assumption
3898760	3899760	is that
3899760	3900760	the original link
3900760	3901760	may be
3901760	3902760	in this
3902760	3903760	100 Gbps
3903760	3904760	mode.
3904760	3905760	Because
3905760	3906760	my
3906760	3907760	noise
3907760	3908760	may be reduced,
3908780	3909780	so now
3909780	3910780	suddenly this link
3910780	3911780	can reach 200 Gbps.
3911780	3912780	If it is
3912780	3913780	in this situation,
3913780	3914780	how do we
3914780	3915780	go from 100 to 200 Gbps?
3917780	3918780	So, a better way
3918780	3919780	is
3919780	3920780	you have already
3920780	3921780	assumed
3921780	3922780	your work goal
3922780	3923780	is to adjust like this.
3923780	3924780	But you tell it
3924780	3925780	how to be smarter.
3925780	3926780	Not that
3926780	3927780	it's not
3927780	3928780	that
3928780	3929780	it's not like
3929780	3930780	at the analog level
3930780	3931780	that
3931780	3932780	the noise pattern is like this,
3932780	3933780	so we should
3933780	3934780	decide
3934780	3935780	what state to adjust.
3935780	3936780	That is already
3936780	3937780	a given
3937800	3938800	assumption.
3938800	3939800	Yes, a given.
3939800	3940800	So, let's say
3940800	3941800	my device tells me
3941800	3942800	this thing.
3942800	3943800	I see.
3943800	3944800	My research
3944800	3945800	is usually
3945800	3946800	at a higher level.
3946800	3947800	So, let's say
3947800	3948800	the device tells me
3948800	3949800	these things,
3949800	3950800	how do I plan
3950800	3951800	this thing?
3954800	3955800	Okay, anyone else
3955800	3956800	have any questions?
3959800	3960800	Okay, if not,
3960800	3961800	let's
3961800	3962800	give another round of applause
3962800	3963800	to Shihai.
3963800	3964800	Thank you, everyone.
3964820	3965820	Thank you.
3966820	3967820	Okay, that's all
3967820	3969820	for today's lecture.
3969820	3970820	I'll...
