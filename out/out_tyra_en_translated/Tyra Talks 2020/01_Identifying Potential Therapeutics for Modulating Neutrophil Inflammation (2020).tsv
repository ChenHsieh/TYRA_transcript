0	3000	The recording has started.
3000	7000	Good evening, everyone.
7000	9000	Sorry, let me talk first.
9000	13000	Welcome everyone to the Taira Talk on March 28th.
13000	21000	We are honored to invite Alan Xu to give a speech for us today.
21000	26000	Alan Xu was a medical student at Chenggong University when he was in college.
26000	31000	He majored in dengue and other blood-related diseases.
31000	37000	He is now a Ph.D. student at Purdue University.
37000	40000	Today's topic is
40000	47000	Identifying Potential Therapeutics for Modulating Neutrophil Inflammation.
47000	53000	Before the speech, let's give Alan a round of applause.
53000	58000	Remember to turn on your microphones when you applaud.
58000	60000	Please turn on your microphones.
60000	63000	Thank you.
63000	67000	Let's give Alan some time.
67000	68000	Thank you.
68000	72000	Today, I would like to share something different with everyone.
72000	74000	As Jason mentioned,
74000	83000	our research focuses on how to use new methods to get immune cells to control our immune system
83000	86000	in order to reach a low level of inflammation,
86000	89000	but at the same time, to fight against diseases.
89000	96000	First, I will divide my talk into a brief background introduction.
96000	100000	Then, I will talk about the so-called gene selection.
100000	105000	Finally, I will share with you what we found.
105000	109000	First, I would like to introduce Neutrophil.
109000	114000	Neutrophil is commonly known as neutrophil.
114000	118000	You may have seen it on Facebook or YouTube.
118000	124000	In 1953, David Rodgers photographed a neutrophil running after bacteria.
124000	127000	Next to it are red blood cells.
127000	132000	This is the most common neutrophil in our blood.
132000	138000	40% to 60% of the white blood cells in our blood are neutrophil.
138000	142000	Neutrophil is the fastest-moving cell in our body.
142000	144000	It can be seen in real time.
144000	148000	Neutrophil can be followed by bacteria.
148000	156000	Neutrophil is the first cell to reach the infection site.
157000	162000	Neutrophil is no longer divided or separated.
162000	168000	Neutrophil often has these lobes.
168000	172000	How does Neutrophil reach the infection site?
172000	175000	Neutrophil circulates in the bloodstream.
175000	182000	There are some adhesive receptors on the outside of our blood vessels.
183000	187000	Neutrophil will roll on the outside of the blood vessels and stick to the adhesive receptors.
187000	193000	Finally, the adhesive receptors are attached to the adhesive receptors.
193000	197000	The adhesive receptors are extrapolated or transmigrated.
197000	199000	The adhesive receptors enter the stem cell.
199000	205000	After entering the stem cell, we will feel the so-called red hot pain.
205000	209000	These are the adhesive cells.
209000	215000	When Neutrophil reaches the infection site, it will perform many functions.
215000	222000	It will release a lot of cytokines.
222000	227000	These cytokines can let more Neutrophil in.
227000	239000	These cytokines can also let other immune cells, such as macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, etc.
239000	246000	However, cytokines are very important for the transmission of information and speech.
246000	257000	However, too much cytokines can cause hemorrhage and shock.
257000	265000	Neutrophil can also perform phagocytosis.
265000	268000	Neutrophil can directly swallow microorganisms.
268000	275000	After swallowing, Neutrophil will release some free radicals, ROS, to break them down.
275000	284000	ROS can also be placed outside the cell to cause the whole organ to develop and attract more immune cells and a reaction to develop.
284000	287000	However, too many free radicals will cause oxidation.
287000	292000	So, we often say that we should avoid drinking tea, reduce free radicals, and reduce aging.
292000	296000	This is because these free radicals will cause organ damage, which is not good for too many people.
296000	303000	Neutrophil's most famous function is called Net Formation, or Neutrophil Accelerator Trap.
304000	312000	When Neutrophil finds that its own immune response is too strong or too many bacteria are around it, it can't do anything by itself.
312000	315000	When we watch movies, we see this hero or male supporting role.
315000	324000	When Neutrophil finds that there are too many enemies, it will usually hold a hand grenade and directly return to these bacteria, or return to the enemy.
324000	333000	At this time, Neutrophil will release its DNA, which is the DNA in this box, outside the cell to form a sticky web-like thing called Net.
333000	335000	This name is very similar.
335000	342000	It can trap these bacteria or viruses there.
342000	346000	There are also some enzymes on this Net that can help break them down.
346000	352000	This Net itself can also be used as a function to attract immune cells.
352000	357000	However, too many of these Nets will actually cause body immunity.
357000	364000	Because our body's immune system does not recognize DNA as a substance by training, so sometimes it will cause body immunity.
364000	371000	Generally, in the ideal case, Neutrophil does not have excessive inflammation.
371000	377000	When Neutrophil plays its role, Neutrophil will have apoptosis and die.
377000	382000	These impurities will be devoured by macrophages, which is another type of cell.
382000	385000	Then the inflammation will slow down.
385000	391000	Otherwise, Neutrophil can climb back to its blood vessels and continue to circulate.
391000	399000	I hope that through these functions, we can make it easier for everyone to understand.
399000	404000	The first cell to reach the inflammation site, how does it do it?
404000	405000	How does it decide?
405000	409000	Often it will decide the outcome of our inflammation.
409000	411000	Will it kill?
411000	416000	Will it successfully eliminate our foreign bacteria or viruses?
416000	423000	So we have to find a way to study if there is a new way to control the reaction of inflammation.
423000	428000	Why do we need to control the reaction of inflammation?
428000	433000	As I said four times, it is a balance.
433000	437000	It is like the cover of a science magazine.
437000	442000	We need it, but too much is not good.
442000	453000	Because of the recent COVID-19 epidemic, I just took this example to tell you why people die from COVID-19.
453000	457000	This is a lung cancer of our lungs, aviola.
457000	460000	Usually this aviola has air.
460000	467000	At this time, the SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, will infect the epidermal cells of our aviola.
468000	470000	The epidermal cells will die.
470000	474000	The cells will also send out some life-saving signals.
474000	480000	The neutrophils will run from the aviola to the lung tissue.
480000	486000	At the same time, the inflammation of the aviola will also cause a rise in blood vessels.
486000	490000	Then the aviola will have a hemorrhage.
490000	495000	So a lot of immune cells will eliminate bacteria and kill viruses here.
495000	497000	At the same time, the aviola will have a hemorrhage.
497000	501000	The inflammation of the aviola will cause a positive feedback.
501000	504000	This will cause a lot of bystander effects.
504000	505000	What is a bystander effect?
505000	510000	In addition to killing viruses, it kills the virus-infected cells.
510000	513000	So the tissue of our lungs will be injured.
513000	516000	Injured, there will be a stronger inflammation.
516000	518000	Then there will be more immune cells.
518000	521000	So it will slowly make our lungs water.
521000	526000	At the same time, we can't have enough oxygen.
526000	530000	When there is not enough oxygen, there will be shortness of breath.
530000	532000	It's breathing difficulty.
532000	537000	In the end, lack of oxygen will also cause our organs to lose oxygen.
537000	539000	If you don't get oxygen, you will die from organ failure.
539000	541000	People who die from organ failure will die.
541000	549000	So basically 90% of people who die from COVID-19 are ARDS.
549000	557000	ARDS is an over-infection-induced disease.
557000	562000	But we need it to eliminate the infection of our virus.
562000	564000	So how to balance this is very important.
567000	571000	In our lab, the model we use is an aviola model.
571000	574000	Let me introduce this aviola to you first.
574000	576000	If you are not familiar with it,
576000	581000	What you see in this video is a three-day aviola.
581000	586000	Its neutral field is marked with GFP, a fluorescent protein.
586000	590000	It is found that its neutral field is divided into two groups.
590000	594000	One is in CHT, which is equivalent to our bone marrow.
594000	595000	So it doesn't move much.
595000	599000	The other is in the head.
599000	601000	It will perform some random migration.
601000	603000	It will move randomly.
604000	610000	Why is aviola a good reason to study neutral field?
610000	614000	First, because the whole animal is transparent.
614000	615000	So it's easy to shoot.
615000	621000	So you can see if you make some genetic or pharmacological changes.
621000	625000	You can see the behavior of these cells.
625000	627000	You can see it in real time.
627000	631000	Second, because this aviola lives in the water.
631000	633000	It is a organ.
633000	638000	Because our organs, whether lungs or stomach, are basically soaked in our mucosa.
638000	639000	It is mucosal immunity.
639000	641000	Because it also lives in the water.
641000	645000	So its outer skin is equivalent to the inner skin of our lungs.
645000	649000	So it is also a good reason to study immune cells.
649000	653000	Some important reasons are that its immune system,
653000	655000	Especially the adenovirus immune system.
655000	657000	Neutral field is a member of the adenovirus immune system.
657000	662000	It is very similar to mammals, such as mice or humans.
662000	665000	So its shape, or its evolution,
665000	670000	And some of its functions are actually very similar to our neutral field.
670000	673000	Finally, a more practical reason is that
673000	675000	Because this fish is very small.
675000	677000	Like this whole fish is only about three centimeters.
677000	679000	It's 0.3 centimeters.
679000	681000	So it's very small.
681000	685000	You can raise a lot of fish at the same time.
685000	687000	There is not much space to stand.
687000	693000	And a pair of male and female fish can give birth to more than 100 small fish.
693000	696000	So it's good to do some medical research.
700000	702000	This is just a brief introduction to everyone.
702000	706000	This zebrafish is a neutral field.
706000	708000	This is a zebrafish, a neutral field,
708000	711000	H.E. stain is the color of the blood.
711000	712000	This is a mouse.
712000	713000	This is our human.
713000	714000	So it's actually about the same size.
714000	716000	There is also this so-called cell box.
716000	720000	This is a form of compartmentalization.
720000	727000	This is just a few videos to tell you about the function of this zebrafish's neutral field.
727000	730000	So this red one is the big intestine.
730000	731000	It's in the zebrafish.
731000	736000	This green one is the zebrafish's neutral field.
736000	739000	So he just saw that the green one would come and swallow the red one.
739000	741000	That's what we just talked about.
742000	745000	This is a free machine assay.
745000	749000	So this MPO myoperoxidase is a free machine.
749000	751000	It is marked as green.
751000	755000	And then we have this zebrafish's neutral field marked as red.
755000	757000	So you see that this red and green are intertwined like this.
757000	763000	In fact, it shows that the zebrafish's neutral field is going to release the free machine.
765000	768000	The last example is to talk about this neptosis.
768000	771000	So we just said that we can release the net value of this neutral field.
771000	774000	So this DAPI is a cell box.
774000	777000	This cell box has DNA.
777000	779000	DNA is scattered out of the package.
779000	782000	So at the same time, you can also see the effects on it.
782000	783000	MPO elastase.
783000	789000	So it means that this zebrafish's neutral field is actually quite similar to the functions of humans.
789000	797000	So it's just to introduce to you that it can be used to study a good model or model of neutral field biology.
798000	802000	Let me give you a little bit of a change of flavor.
802000	804000	Let me introduce another thing that we are interested in.
804000	806000	It's called microRNA.
806000	816000	MicroRNA is a very short 20 to 22-digit nucleotide.
816000	818000	It's DNA.
818000	820000	It can exist from DNA.
820000	822000	It exists in exon and intron.
822000	824000	It can exist anywhere in our gene.
825000	834000	When it is transferred by our polymerase transcription to RNA, it will have this hairpin structure.
834000	841000	From this hairpin structure, it will be processed and transported to the outside of our cell box.
841000	845000	After it is transported to the outside of the cell box, it will be processed again.
845000	851000	Then it becomes a single 20 to 22-digit RNA complex.
852000	862000	It will identify the target mRNA, which is our messenger RNA, with its other machinery, which is called Ritz complex.
862000	865000	This messenger RNA is usually used to make protein.
865000	867000	To suppress it.
867000	870000	Either the whole mRNA will be broken down.
870000	877000	Otherwise, it will stop its transfer and prevent it from becoming protein.
877000	880000	So these microRNAs are like a small key.
880000	884000	Instead of controlling whether this gene is expressed or not.
884000	886000	It says it doesn't matter if you express it.
886000	893000	But I can use this microRNA to suppress and adjust the amount of protein it expresses.
893000	896000	Adjust it on the level of RNA.
896000	901000	Because this microRNA adjustment method is often not a one-off.
901000	903000	Because the expression of your gene is a one-off.
903000	905000	Either it's open or it's closed.
905000	907000	Of course, you can adjust how much it is.
907000	909000	But this is still a more absolute.
909000	916000	This microRNA suppression phenomenon can often be adjusted.
916000	922000	For example, 100 mRNAs can only inhibit or suppress half.
922000	924000	So it becomes a fine tuning.
924000	928000	Because we just said that we have to adjust the expression.
928000	930000	We can't turn off the whole expression.
930000	932000	Otherwise, people will die.
932000	934000	So we have to adjust it.
934000	938000	This microRNA actually has another feature.
938000	942000	Because it's a 22-nucleotide.
942000	948000	A single microRNA can become a target for many mRNAs.
948000	951000	In other words, a single key can open many locks.
951000	955000	Or match many transcripts.
955000	964000	In evolution, these microRNAs will often target a pathway.
964000	971000	There are many related genes on a pathway.
971000	976000	It means that I can inhibit you walking today.
976000	978000	It can also inhibit you from eating.
978000	980000	It can also inhibit you from sleeping.
980000	982000	All of these functions can be done by a single microRNA.
982000	984000	To make a person feel uncomfortable.
984000	989000	This microRNA is evolutionary conserved.
989000	994000	It is found in small insects and fruits.
994000	997000	It is found in all biological phenomena.
997000	1003000	From cancer to plant growth to cell division.
1003000	1005000	There are probably microRNAs involved.
1005000	1008000	Because they have this feature.
1008000	1012000	It has been reported as the next generation of medicine.
1013000	1019000	We are also trying to identify some microRNAs.
1019000	1026000	To adjust or balance the development of neutrophils.
1026000	1032000	Sorry, I have a question.
1032000	1034000	Can I go back to the last page?
1034000	1039000	This may be a very basic question.
1039000	1042000	But mRNA is messenger RNA.
1042000	1046000	Is it converted to protein outside the cell?
1046000	1048000	Yes.
1048000	1052000	I thought RNA is inside the cell.
1052000	1055000	Let me explain.
1055000	1060000	Our DNA is in the nucleus.
1060000	1064000	It will be converted into the nucleus.
1064000	1068000	All RNAs are converted into the nucleus.
1068000	1072000	Some of them will be on the nucleus.
1072000	1077000	Ribosome will be made into protein.
1077000	1080000	Some of them will be transported to the nucleus.
1080000	1083000	There are many ribosomes there.
1083000	1085000	Most of them are in the ER.
1085000	1087000	The so-called intracellular network.
1087000	1092000	It is actually inside another cell.
1092000	1096000	Can mRNA be transmitted between cells?
1096000	1099000	No, between the nucleus and the nucleus.
1099000	1102000	Our nucleus has two layers.
1102000	1104000	I see.
1104000	1106000	I understand.
1106000	1108000	Sorry.
1108000	1112000	I have a question.
1112000	1115000	About the next generation of medicine.
1115000	1121000	How can we avoid the off-target of microRNA?
1121000	1123000	That's a great question.
1124000	1129000	I will talk about the next generation of medicine.
1129000	1131000	There are two strategies.
1131000	1136000	One is to treat microRNA as our friend.
1136000	1142000	For example, microRNA34 can be used to suppress cell proliferation.
1142000	1144000	MicroRNA29 can be used to treat lung cancer.
1144000	1146000	That's right.
1146000	1149000	There are two levels of off-target.
1149000	1151000	One is the off-target of human organs.
1151000	1158000	MicroRNA can be stored in liposomes or carriers.
1158000	1162000	It can be used to treat liver cancer.
1162000	1163000	Liver cancer is easy to treat.
1163000	1169000	Liver and kidneys are the organs of human organs.
1169000	1171000	There are many special markers in the lungs.
1171000	1173000	MicroRNA can be linked to these markers.
1173000	1176000	It will be enriched in the lungs.
1177000	1179000	MicroRNA can be stored in other organs.
1179000	1182000	However, the amount of microRNA will be less than the target.
1182000	1185000	The question you asked is very good.
1185000	1188000	MicroRNA therapy in the blood is difficult to do.
1188000	1190000	Because the blood cells are too complicated.
1190000	1193000	We can't overcome this.
1193000	1197000	In other aspects, such as mRNA122.
1197000	1199000	You can inhibit microRNA122.
1199000	1201000	You can avoid the infection of HCV.
1201000	1203000	It's the same as liver cancer.
1203000	1204000	Inhibition 155.
1204000	1205000	Inflammation.
1205000	1207000	Inflammation of the whole body.
1207000	1210000	Inflammation of the whole body.
1210000	1214000	Another level of microRNA off-targeting is
1214000	1220000	whether the hairpin recognizes what you want to recognize.
1220000	1224000	This can only be confirmed by experiment.
1224000	1229000	Because each cell expresses a different gene profile.
1229000	1231000	That's why we have different cells.
1231000	1233000	Because our dye cells are all the same.
1233000	1238000	We can only verify and exclude the different gene profiles.
1238000	1240000	Did I answer your question?
1240000	1241000	Yes, thank you.
1241000	1242000	You made it very clear.
1242000	1243000	Thank you.
1245000	1247000	This is the part of microRNA therapy.
1247000	1250000	We can inhibit it.
1250000	1252000	How do we inhibit it?
1252000	1253000	It's easy.
1253000	1255000	If we go back here, we can see that
1255000	1258000	the microRNA itself comes from a hairpin.
1258000	1260000	It's a hairpin.
1260000	1265000	We can give it a complementary strand.
1265000	1268000	We can absorb it like a sponge.
1268000	1270000	Then it won't be able to work.
1270000	1272000	This is a way to inhibit it.
1272000	1274000	What we are more interested in is
1274000	1276000	directly using this microRNA to off-target.
1280000	1282000	Before I start, let me summarize for everyone.
1282000	1285000	We are going to talk about this research today.
1285000	1289000	Basically, we are going to identify which microRNA
1289000	1292000	and its downstream mRNA
1292000	1295000	can be used for translational inhibition.
1295000	1296000	That is to inhibit it or
1296000	1299000	to separate the messenger RNA.
1299000	1302000	To inhibit Neutrophil migration.
1302000	1304000	Why do we want to choose Neutrophil migration
1304000	1306000	as our readout?
1306000	1307000	First, because
1307000	1309000	we just introduced that
1309000	1311000	Neutrophil has too many functions.
1311000	1313000	It has a free machine, a package, and a net.
1313000	1316000	So it's too difficult for you to look at it first.
1316000	1318000	Why don't we
1318000	1322000	flatten the curve?
1322000	1323000	It's the same thing.
1323000	1326000	But on a more human level.
1326000	1328000	We don't want Neutrophil to enter
1328000	1330000	as soon as possible.
1330000	1332000	We want it to enter slowly.
1332000	1335000	So it's easier for your body to adjust.
1335000	1337000	Your hair is easier to adjust.
1337000	1339000	This is our strategy.
1339000	1341000	So we hope that
1341000	1343000	at the Neutrophil recruitment level,
1343000	1345000	we can flatten the curve
1345000	1347000	to prevent over-inflammation.
1347000	1349000	Whether it's asthma,
1349000	1351000	joint inflammation,
1351000	1353000	or multiple sclerosis.
1353000	1357000	Including ARDS,
1357000	1359000	which is also an over-inflammation.
1359000	1360000	But at the same time,
1360000	1362000	we still have to keep a function.
1362000	1364000	Because now on the market,
1364000	1366000	all the treatments for this immune disease
1366000	1368000	are like our endocrine
1368000	1370000	or some corticosteroids.
1370000	1372000	Or some specific immune suppressors.
1372000	1374000	But the problem is that
1374000	1376000	these things will bring
1376000	1378000	the defect of your immune system.
1378000	1380000	Then you may have a very serious cold.
1380000	1382000	So what we are going to answer today is
1382000	1384000	which microRNA can do this.
1384000	1386000	Can prevent Neutrophil migration
1386000	1388000	from being so much.
1388000	1390000	But at the same time,
1390000	1392000	it can keep our immune system.
1392000	1394000	What are its MRNAs?
1394000	1396000	Maybe we can go and study
1396000	1398000	which of its lower genes
1398000	1400000	can control Neutrophil.
1400000	1402000	So this is the second part.
1402000	1404000	We are going to start discussing this screen.
1404000	1406000	Does anyone have any questions here?
1410000	1412000	So the method we use
1412000	1414000	is an overexpression screen.
1414000	1416000	So we are going to sequence
1416000	1418000	all the two types of cells.
1418000	1420000	Neutrophil and epidermal cells.
1420000	1422000	Why do we use this type of cell?
1422000	1424000	Because I just mentioned
1424000	1426000	Neutrophil is a type of cell
1426000	1428000	that has a very large number of
1428000	1430000	active or unactive proteins.
1430000	1432000	Or its turnover is very fast.
1432000	1434000	It is very active.
1434000	1436000	Compared to our epidermal cells,
1436000	1438000	like you and me,
1438000	1440000	the epidermal cells are basically
1440000	1442000	not very active.
1442000	1444000	So its cytoskeleton,
1444000	1446000	the cell skeleton,
1446000	1448000	is relatively stable.
1448000	1450000	So we went to see
1450000	1452000	the microRNAs
1452000	1454000	between these two cells.
1454000	1456000	And we found that
1456000	1458000	there is a difference
1458000	1460000	in the amount of microRNAs
1460000	1462000	in the epidermal cells.
1462000	1464000	So there are
1464000	1466000	340 microRNAs
1466000	1468000	in the epidermal cells.
1468000	1470000	We found that
1470000	1472000	90 microRNAs are lower in Neutrophil.
1472000	1474000	Let me explain to you here.
1476000	1478000	Neutrophil cells
1478000	1480000	because we know that
1480000	1482000	in most cases,
1482000	1484000	microRNAs suppress certain mRNAs
1484000	1486000	or suppress a certain
1486000	1488000	biological reaction.
1488000	1490000	So what we want to take today
1490000	1492000	is to put it back
1492000	1494000	so that it can do its function
1494000	1496000	and slow it down.
1496000	1498000	So we let it
1498000	1500000	put something in a faster cell
1500000	1502000	to slow it down.
1502000	1504000	So we choose this lower
1504000	1506000	Neutrophil.
1506000	1508000	In these 90 targets,
1508000	1510000	after we classify it a little bit,
1510000	1512000	we have 50 candidates.
1512000	1514000	So these 50
1514000	1516000	microRNA families
1516000	1518000	are relatively low
1518000	1520000	in Neutrophil
1520000	1522000	compared to the epidermal cells.
1522000	1524000	So now we're going to put it back
1524000	1526000	and see if we can
1526000	1528000	slow down the Neutrophil
1528000	1530000	recruitment.
1530000	1532000	This is a little bit
1532000	1534000	more complicated,
1534000	1536000	but this is our over-expression construct.
1536000	1538000	How do we
1538000	1540000	express this thing?
1540000	1542000	We can't express it in Neutrophil.
1542000	1544000	So we have to use
1544000	1546000	a thing called Neutrophil-specific promotion.
1546000	1548000	This kind of start
1548000	1550000	will only open and express
1550000	1552000	in Neutrophil.
1552000	1554000	This is called Lysine.
1554000	1556000	We put our
1556000	1558000	microRNA hairpin
1558000	1560000	in an intron,
1560000	1562000	so it won't affect the gene expression.
1562000	1564000	So it's like Neutrophil
1564000	1566000	expressing a microRNA.
1566000	1568000	At the same time, how do we know
1568000	1570000	this gene?
1570000	1572000	We designed the exon 1
1572000	1574000	to splice the dendrite 2 protein.
1574000	1576000	This is very complicated,
1576000	1578000	but this dendrite 2 protein is basically
1578000	1580000	a green protein.
1580000	1582000	Because it's all
1582000	1584000	a construct,
1584000	1586000	it's all a gene
1586000	1588000	that turns down.
1588000	1590000	So if there is a microRNA,
1590000	1592000	this cell will be green
1592000	1594000	and only occurs in Neutrophil.
1594000	1596000	This is more complicated.
1596000	1598000	Then we put
1598000	1600000	all 50 targets here
1600000	1602000	into the structure of the hairpin
1602000	1604000	and replace them one by one.
1604000	1606000	And then one by one,
1606000	1608000	this is a single cell
1608000	1610000	of the hematoma.
1610000	1612000	This is the hematoma.
1612000	1614000	This is its egg yolk.
1614000	1616000	This is its cell.
1616000	1618000	Then three days later,
1618000	1620000	we will select
1620000	1622000	which hematoma
1622000	1624000	has Neutrophil
1624000	1626000	and which hematoma has dendrite 2 protein.
1626000	1628000	After the selection,
1628000	1630000	we will
1630000	1632000	inject
1632000	1634000	pseudomonas
1634000	1636000	directly into the
1636000	1638000	hematoma's ears.
1638000	1640000	This will make it
1640000	1642000	look at the
1642000	1644000	green Neutrophil recruitment.
1644000	1646000	So the phenomenon we see
1646000	1648000	is like this.
1648000	1650000	This is the hematoma's ears.
1650000	1652000	You can see the red bacteria here.
1652000	1654000	They will come to the ears
1654000	1656000	to do their immune response.
1656000	1658000	If we find
1658000	1660000	a microRNA over-expression,
1660000	1662000	which is to express this microRNA
1662000	1664000	by this construct,
1664000	1666000	you will see that
1666000	1668000	these Neutrophil
1668000	1670000	either haven't gotten here
1670000	1672000	or don't want to get here.
1672000	1674000	So they didn't
1674000	1676000	get the successful recruitment.
1676000	1678000	So from
1678000	1680000	our 50 candidates,
1680000	1682000	we sifted out
1682000	1684000	9 microRNAs
1684000	1686000	with similar phenomena.
1686000	1688000	They will have less
1688000	1690000	to the ears.
1690000	1692000	So this is
1692000	1694000	how we
1694000	1696000	raise these 9 microRNAs
1696000	1698000	into the so-called
1698000	1700000	stable line.
1700000	1702000	Every cell
1702000	1704000	of this fish
1704000	1706000	has this construct
1706000	1708000	at the DNA level.
1708000	1710000	But only in Neutrophil
1710000	1712000	will it be expressed.
1712000	1714000	So these 9
1714000	1716000	are our microRNAs.
1716000	1718000	After we have
1718000	1720000	this stable transgenic line,
1720000	1722000	we verify again
1722000	1724000	to infect its ears
1724000	1726000	or use another
1726000	1728000	so-called sterile inflammation,
1728000	1730000	which is
1730000	1732000	non-infective
1732000	1734000	inflammation.
1734000	1736000	So we cut it off
1736000	1738000	and look at Neutrophil's
1738000	1740000	recruitment.
1740000	1742000	You will find that
1742000	1744000	in general,
1744000	1746000	it is consistent
1746000	1748000	with our transgenic screen.
1748000	1750000	This is the screen
1750000	1752000	on the page above.
1752000	1754000	This microRNA199-3
1754000	1756000	has two models.
1756000	1758000	Whether it's infection
1758000	1760000	or tail wounding,
1760000	1762000	the ratio of recruitment
1762000	1764000	is this gray bar,
1764000	1766000	the contrast group.
1766000	1768000	After expressing this microRNA,
1768000	1770000	you will find that
1770000	1772000	it drops the most.
1772000	1774000	So we want to study
1774000	1776000	some biological functions of
1776000	1778000	this microRNA199.
1778000	1780000	First of all,
1780000	1782000	we need to determine
1782000	1784000	the expression of
1784000	1786000	this microRNA199
1786000	1788000	compared to the baseline
1788000	1790000	in Neutrophil.
1790000	1792000	Because it may only
1792000	1794000	cause this phenomenon
1794000	1796000	when the computer crashes.
1796000	1798000	So we did a
1798000	1800000	microRNA QRT
1800000	1802000	to measure
1802000	1804000	how much microRNA199
1804000	1806000	will affect other microRNAs.
1806000	1808000	We found that
1808000	1810000	microRNA223 and microRNA227
1810000	1812000	are high microRNAs
1812000	1814000	in Neutrophil.
1814000	1816000	But microRNA199,
1816000	1818000	because we have overexpressed it,
1818000	1820000	is about 1,000 times higher.
1820000	1822000	So it means that
1822000	1824000	it is 1,000 times higher
1824000	1826000	than other microRNAs.
1826000	1828000	So we are safe to assume that
1828000	1830000	the phenomenon of microRNA199
1830000	1832000	is really caused by
1832000	1834000	the overexpression of microRNA199,
1834000	1836000	not because other microRNAs
1836000	1838000	are all dropped.
1838000	1840000	At the same time,
1840000	1842000	we need to see
1842000	1844000	whether the reduction of
1844000	1846000	recruitment is caused by
1846000	1848000	the overexpression of microRNA199
1848000	1850000	or its own
1850000	1852000	inability to develop
1852000	1854000	or functional differences.
1854000	1856000	So we went to see
1856000	1858000	that the number of Neutrophils
1858000	1860000	in each fish
1860000	1862000	is similar to that of vectors,
1862000	1864000	which means that
1864000	1866000	it is not caused by
1866000	1868000	a total reduction of Neutrophils.
1868000	1870000	Because the reduction of recruitment
1870000	1872000	you see today may be
1872000	1874000	because Neutrophils are less
1874000	1876000	so you can't see this phenomenon.
1876000	1878000	So we need to see
1878000	1880000	whether the Neutrophils
1880000	1882000	are going to develop
1882000	1884000	or not.
1884000	1886000	So this is a zebrafish.
1886000	1888000	This is what we call a stable line.
1888000	1890000	Each Neutrophil is green.
1890000	1892000	This is a vector.
1892000	1894000	So you can see that
1894000	1896000	Neutrophils are moving very,
1896000	1898000	very fast.
1898000	1900000	You can see that
1900000	1902000	Neutrophils are moving very,
1902000	1904000	very fast.
1904000	1906000	So the question is
1906000	1908000	when the Neutrophils
1908000	1910000	are overexpressed,
1910000	1912000	the Neutrophils will still move.
1912000	1914000	It's just that
1914000	1916000	it will still move,
1916000	1918000	but it will move slower than others.
1918000	1920000	So it's possible that
1920000	1922000	it really doesn't want to go
1922000	1924000	or it just walks slowly.
1924000	1926000	At least we know that
1926000	1928000	the zebrafish walks slowly.
1928000	1930000	As for whether it doesn't want to go,
1930000	1932000	we will study it later.
1932000	1934000	What I want to introduce to you
1934000	1936000	is the zebrafish Neutrophil.
1936000	1938000	No matter how similar it is to humans,
1938000	1940000	it is still
1940000	1942000	not a human Neutrophil.
1942000	1944000	But in our field,
1944000	1946000	the biggest problem
1946000	1948000	of Neutrophil research is
1948000	1950000	that this human Neutrophil
1950000	1952000	is no longer fragmented,
1952000	1954000	so it is difficult
1954000	1956000	to make any genetic
1956000	1958000	modifications or mutations.
1958000	1960000	So in our field,
1960000	1962000	the zebrafish Neutrophil is a
1962000	1964000	cell type called HL60.
1964000	1966000	This cell type
1966000	1968000	is a Neutrophil's
1968000	1970000	anterior cell.
1970000	1972000	In this anterior cell,
1972000	1974000	it will be fragmented and split.
1974000	1976000	We can make some genetic
1976000	1978000	modifications to it,
1978000	1980000	and then divide it into Neutrophils.
1980000	1982000	But it won't be a complete Neutrophil.
1982000	1984000	It's just a Neutrophil similar to humans.
1984000	1986000	At least it's human.
1986000	1988000	Because this is a microRNA,
1988000	1990000	we don't want this microRNA
1990000	1992000	to be affected
1992000	1994000	in the process of splitting.
1994000	1996000	So we had to adopt
1996000	1998000	an inducible system,
1998000	2000000	that is, we can use a switch.
2000000	2002000	What does this switch mean?
2002000	2004000	It means that we first put this
2004000	2006000	new construct
2006000	2008000	into our HL60
2008000	2010000	cell,
2010000	2012000	and then make a antigen,
2012000	2014000	puromycin, to select it.
2014000	2016000	So as long as there is
2016000	2018000	an HL60
2018000	2020000	in its gene,
2020000	2022000	it can be immune to this antigen.
2022000	2024000	When we need
2024000	2026000	this microRNA to be expressed,
2026000	2028000	we give it a doxycycline,
2028000	2030000	a chemical substance,
2030000	2032000	a four-ring type,
2032000	2034000	which is also an antigen
2034000	2036000	and an antibiotic.
2036000	2038000	This stimulates the
2038000	2040000	hairpin in the middle
2040000	2042000	and the green one will be expressed.
2042000	2044000	This is a bit complicated.
2044000	2046000	Anyway, because we don't want
2046000	2048000	this microRNA to be expressed at any time,
2048000	2050000	it will affect its splitting.
2050000	2052000	So we use such an inducible system.
2056000	2058000	We can share a few photos with you.
2058000	2060000	So the normal cell is
2060000	2062000	dense, and then after splitting,
2062000	2064000	some of it will die,
2064000	2066000	but basically it is still splitting.
2066000	2068000	You can see that this little bit of green
2068000	2070000	is the doxycycline
2070000	2072000	to turn it on.
2072000	2074000	Of course, the degree of green
2074000	2076000	is different,
2076000	2078000	but these green cells successfully
2078000	2080000	split and express the microRNA we want.
2082000	2084000	This microRNA199
2084000	2086000	is very important,
2086000	2088000	and it is very lucky
2088000	2090000	that its Bermuda microRNA199
2090000	2092000	is exactly the same as the
2092000	2094000	human microRNA199 series,
2094000	2096000	which is the series of 20 to 22
2096000	2098000	editing we mentioned earlier.
2098000	2100000	The part I circled
2100000	2102000	is the 2nd to 8th editing
2102000	2104000	in the microRNA,
2104000	2106000	which is called the seed sequence,
2106000	2108000	which is its core binding.
2108000	2110000	It mainly relies on this seed sequence
2110000	2112000	to identify its target.
2112000	2114000	So if you think about it,
2114000	2116000	it is actually a series of 6 to 7 edits.
2116000	2118000	Because we have 4 types of edits,
2118000	2120000	A, T, C, G,
2120000	2122000	so it's 4 to 6 to 7 squares.
2122000	2124000	This is actually quite specific.
2124000	2126000	So the first thing we saw
2126000	2128000	was that we chose
2128000	2130000	this microRNA199 cell expression.
2130000	2132000	We found that
2132000	2134000	it was only
2134000	2136000	when the switch was turned on,
2136000	2138000	it was only the top line of
2138000	2140000	microRNA199,
2140000	2142000	and the other two microRNAs,
2142000	2144000	the microRNA in the neutral field,
2144000	2146000	had no effect.
2146000	2148000	At the same time,
2148000	2150000	we also used another random microRNA,
2150000	2152000	microRNA100.
2152000	2154000	This is not something we are interested in.
2154000	2156000	It's just because I'm afraid
2156000	2158000	that this construct itself
2158000	2160000	will cause a sequelae.
2162000	2164000	So we put these cells
2164000	2166000	in a thing called a transwell.
2166000	2168000	This transwell,
2168000	2170000	I'll explain it to you.
2170000	2172000	It's a kind of
2172000	2174000	nipple groove.
2174000	2176000	The groove above
2176000	2178000	is where we put our cells.
2178000	2180000	At the bottom of this groove
2180000	2182000	is a small hole.
2182000	2184000	This small hole is not big enough
2184000	2186000	for the cells to fall in,
2186000	2188000	but the cells can squeeze in.
2188000	2190000	It's a bit like the neutral field
2190000	2192000	that we introduced earlier.
2192000	2194000	It can squeeze the transwell
2194000	2196000	into the tissue.
2196000	2198000	At the bottom,
2198000	2200000	we put something that can attract them.
2200000	2202000	In this case,
2202000	2204000	we put something called FMLP.
2204000	2206000	It's a small peptide
2206000	2208000	that the bacteria release.
2208000	2210000	We found that
2210000	2212000	if we
2212000	2214000	use FMLP
2214000	2216000	to attract it,
2216000	2218000	and if we don't activate it,
2218000	2220000	these three cells
2220000	2222000	will go down
2222000	2224000	in the same way.
2224000	2226000	You can see that the white bars are the same.
2226000	2228000	Similarly,
2228000	2230000	if you give it a construct,
2230000	2232000	whether it's an empty vector,
2232000	2234000	199 or 100,
2234000	2236000	but you don't give it
2236000	2238000	anything that can attract it,
2238000	2240000	they won't go over.
2240000	2242000	You have to squeeze this hole
2242000	2244000	to consume energy,
2244000	2246000	so it won't do anything meaningful.
2246000	2248000	However,
2248000	2250000	if you give it
2250000	2252000	FMLP again,
2252000	2254000	you will find that
2254000	2256000	this random microRNA
2256000	2258000	is similar to our empty vector,
2258000	2260000	but only when you express 199,
2260000	2262000	its penetrability
2262000	2264000	will decrease.
2264000	2266000	It's exactly the same as what we saw
2266000	2268000	in the Bermuda Triangle.
2268000	2270000	It can't recruit
2270000	2272000	to the place we want.
2272000	2274000	This proves that this microRNA 199
2274000	2276000	is useful in both
2276000	2278000	human and Bermuda Triangle systems.
2280000	2282000	Next, we want to ask
2282000	2284000	what is the target of this 199
2284000	2286000	to make it useful.
2286000	2288000	We need to
2288000	2290000	identify the mechanism below it.
2290000	2292000	This is a
2292000	2294000	adult Bermuda triangle.
2294000	2296000	Bermuda triangle
2296000	2298000	is different from humans.
2298000	2300000	Its structure is not in the bones,
2300000	2302000	but in its growth.
2302000	2304000	This Bermuda triangle is called kidney marrow.
2304000	2306000	Let's take this kidney marrow out.
2306000	2308000	You can see that these green cells
2308000	2310000	are the neutrophils we saw earlier.
2310000	2312000	Let's use the method of
2312000	2314000	eukaryotic cells
2314000	2316000	to separate the cells.
2316000	2318000	Because it's green,
2318000	2320000	it has green light,
2320000	2322000	let's use RNA
2322000	2324000	to measure its RNA level.
2324000	2326000	Let's see
2326000	2328000	the expression of each RNA.
2328000	2330000	Do you remember
2330000	2332000	what I said earlier?
2332000	2334000	This microRNA will target
2334000	2336000	the target mRNA.
2336000	2338000	If it successfully targets,
2338000	2340000	the mRNA may be reduced.
2340000	2342000	So the level of expression
2342000	2344000	will decrease.
2344000	2346000	Surprisingly,
2346000	2348000	as I mentioned earlier,
2348000	2350000	the neutrophils are not
2350000	2352000	separated.
2352000	2354000	However,
2354000	2356000	we can see from the
2356000	2358000	profile of the RNA
2358000	2360000	that some cells are
2360000	2362000	separated.
2362000	2364000	Some cells
2364000	2366000	are
2366000	2368000	separated.
2368000	2370000	This is very illogical.
2370000	2372000	These cells are not
2372000	2374000	separated.
2374000	2376000	Why are these
2376000	2378000	cells separated?
2378000	2380000	First, let's see
2380000	2382000	if this is true.
2382000	2384000	Let's verify
2384000	2386000	its expression
2386000	2388000	by using RNA.
2388000	2390000	We found that
2390000	2392000	CDK1 is a cell cycle gene.
2392000	2394000	It is not on our
2394000	2396000	reduction list.
2396000	2398000	CDK2 and CDK5
2398000	2400000	are all cell cycle genes.
2400000	2402000	Indeed, when you express
2402000	2404000	microRNA199,
2404000	2406000	the sequence is true.
2406000	2408000	However, there is no explanation.
2410000	2412000	Let me explain to you
2412000	2414000	the cell cycle.
2414000	2416000	In the case of cell splitting,
2416000	2418000	there are two
2418000	2420000	same colored cells.
2420000	2422000	The DNA replication
2422000	2424000	will be copied
2424000	2426000	into the so-called double cell.
2426000	2428000	The mitosis
2428000	2430000	will be captured by the
2430000	2432000	microtubule and split into two cells.
2432000	2434000	In general,
2434000	2436000	when we use
2436000	2438000	HL60,
2438000	2440000	we will find that
2440000	2442000	it depends on the amount of DNA.
2442000	2444000	There is a green peak.
2444000	2446000	This is the amount of DNA
2446000	2448000	in a single cell.
2448000	2450000	The S phase
2450000	2452000	is the replication.
2452000	2454000	When we go to the G2 phase,
2454000	2456000	it is already determined that
2456000	2458000	it is a double cell.
2458000	2460000	Therefore, the amount of DNA
2460000	2462000	in a single cell
2462000	2464000	is the same.
2464000	2466000	Let's take a look at
2466000	2468000	the neutrophil
2468000	2470000	represented by
2470000	2472000	the light-C promoter.
2472000	2474000	Indeed,
2474000	2476000	the neutrophil is not
2476000	2478000	replicated.
2478000	2480000	It is in the case of
2480000	2482000	G0 and G1.
2482000	2484000	Before we start
2484000	2486000	to study CDK2,
2486000	2488000	we need to understand
2488000	2490000	the microRNA199 sequence.
2490000	2492000	This is the seed sequence.
2492000	2494000	It is the binding sequence
2494000	2496000	at the core.
2496000	2498000	In the human CDK2 gene
2498000	2500000	and the Danish CDK2 gene,
2500000	2502000	there are places
2502000	2504000	that can bind directly.
2504000	2506000	G will bind to C,
2506000	2508000	A will bind to T, etc.
2508000	2510000	They are divided into 6-mer sites
2510000	2512000	and 7-mer sites.
2512000	2514000	They are
2514000	2516000	predicted to bind.
2516000	2518000	We can use
2518000	2520000	computer algorithms
2520000	2522000	to predict that G0 and G1
2522000	2524000	can bind directly to CDK2.
2524000	2526000	Is it true?
2526000	2528000	We need to verify it.
2528000	2530000	Therefore,
2530000	2532000	we created
2532000	2534000	two versions
2534000	2536000	of CDK2.
2536000	2538000	One is that
2538000	2540000	the predicted binding site
2540000	2542000	can be
2542000	2544000	replicated.
2544000	2546000	If
2546000	2548000	G0 and G1
2548000	2550000	can be replicated,
2550000	2552000	then the predicted binding site
2552000	2554000	can be replaced.
2554000	2556000	If G0 and G1
2556000	2558000	can be replaced,
2558000	2560000	then the predicted binding site
2560000	2562000	can be replaced.
2562000	2564000	We created
2564000	2566000	a Luciferase assay.
2566000	2568000	Let me introduce it to you.
2568000	2570000	There are two constructs.
2570000	2572000	First,
2572000	2574000	the CDK2
2574000	2576000	3'-UTR
2576000	2578000	is placed here.
2578000	2580000	Next,
2580000	2582000	the R
2582000	2584000	is placed here.
2584000	2586000	Finally,
2586000	2588000	the F
2588000	2590000	is placed here.
2590000	2592000	These are the two constructs.
2592000	2594000	They do not change.
2594000	2596000	If
2596000	2598000	the CDK2
2598000	2600000	3'-UTR
2600000	2602000	is replaced,
2602000	2604000	then the R
2604000	2606000	Luciferase
2606000	2608000	will be degraded.
2608000	2610000	If
2610000	2612000	the CDK2
2612000	2614000	3'-UTR
2614000	2616000	is replaced,
2616000	2618000	then the R
2618000	2620000	Luciferase
2620000	2622000	will be degraded.
2622000	2624000	If
2624000	2626000	the CDK2
2626000	2628000	3'-UTR
2628000	2630000	is replaced,
2630000	2632000	then the R
2632000	2634000	Luciferase
2634000	2636000	will be degraded.
2636000	2638000	If the CDK2
2638000	2640000	3'-UTR
2640000	2642000	is replaced,
2642000	2644000	then the R
2644000	2646000	Luciferase
2646000	2648000	will be degraded.
2648000	2650000	If the CDK2
2650000	2652000	3'-UTR
2652000	2654000	is replaced,
2654000	2656000	then the R
2656000	2658000	Luciferase
2658000	2660000	will be degraded.
2660000	2662000	The reason why the CDK2
2662000	2664000	3'-UTR
2664000	2666000	is degraded is that
2666000	2668000	the CDK2
2668000	2670000	3'-UTR
2670000	2672000	is replaced.
2672000	2674000	The CDK2
2674000	2676000	3'-UTR
2676000	2678000	is replaced.
2678000	2680000	The CDK2
2680000	2682000	3'-UTR
2682000	2684000	is replaced.
2684000	2686000	When you express
2686000	2688000	the vector,
2688000	2690000	we set it as the baseline,
2690000	2692000	because the vector is empty.
2692000	2694000	However, when you express
2694000	2696000	the 199,
2696000	2698000	the CDK2
2698000	2700000	3'-UTR
2700000	2702000	will be degraded.
2702000	2704000	If you change the position
2704000	2706000	of the CDK2,
2706000	2708000	the CDK2
2708000	2710000	3'-UTR
2710000	2712000	will be degraded.
2712000	2714000	The microRNA 199
2714000	2716000	can suppress
2716000	2718000	the mRNA of CDK2.
2728000	2730000	An important experiment
2730000	2732000	is to see
2732000	2734000	if the 199 can suppress
2734000	2736000	the CDK2,
2736000	2738000	if I put the CDK2
2738000	2740000	in a version
2740000	2742000	that suppresses the CDK2,
2742000	2744000	can I save
2744000	2746000	or rescue
2746000	2748000	or restore the CDK2?
2748000	2750000	So,
2750000	2752000	we put the CDK2
2752000	2754000	in the 199
2754000	2756000	and marked it
2756000	2758000	with a red mark.
2758000	2760000	The CDK2
2760000	2762000	cannot be suppressed
2762000	2764000	by the 199,
2764000	2766000	because we changed
2766000	2768000	the suppression point.
2768000	2770000	This is
2770000	2772000	the result.
2772000	2774000	As you can see in this video,
2774000	2776000	red or white,
2776000	2778000	because red plus green is white,
2778000	2780000	the cells move faster
2780000	2782000	than the green cells.
2782000	2784000	The statistics show
2784000	2786000	that the CDK2
2786000	2788000	can restore the CDK2.
2788000	2790000	The CDK2
2790000	2792000	is not the only
2792000	2794000	CDK2,
2794000	2796000	but it is an important
2796000	2798000	CDK2.
2798000	2800000	As you can see,
2800000	2802000	the CDK2
2802000	2804000	is not the only
2804000	2806000	CDK2,
2806000	2808000	but it is an important
2808000	2810000	CDK2.
2810000	2812000	As you can see,
2812000	2814000	the CDK2
2814000	2816000	is not the only
2816000	2818000	CDK2,
2818000	2820000	but it is an important
2820000	2822000	CDK2.
2822000	2824000	As you can see,
2854000	2856000	the CDK2
2856000	2858000	is not the only
2858000	2860000	CDK2.
2860000	2862000	As you can see,
2862000	2864000	the CDK2
2864000	2866000	is not the only
2866000	2868000	CDK2.
2868000	2870000	As you can see,
2870000	2872000	the CDK2
2872000	2874000	is not the only
2874000	2876000	CDK2.
2876000	2878000	There is another,
2878000	2880000	CDK2
2880000	2882000	elinfo.
2882000	2884000	The CDK2
2884000	2886000	is not the only
2886000	2888000	CDK2.
2888000	2890000	The CDK2
2890000	2892000	is not the only
2892000	2894000	CDK2.
2894000	2896000	As you can see,
2896000	2898000	the CDK2
2898000	2900000	is not the only
2900000	2902000	CDK2.
2902000	2904000	There is another
2904000	2906000	CDK2
2906000	2908000	that is
2908000	2910000	not the only
2910000	2912000	CDK2.
2912000	2914000	There is another
2914000	2916000	CDK2
2916000	2918000	that is
2918000	2920000	not the only
2920000	2922000	CDK2.
2922000	2924000	There is another
2924000	2926000	CDK2
2926000	2928000	that is
2928000	2930000	not the only
2930000	2932000	CDK2.
2932000	2934000	There is another
2934000	2936000	CDK2
2936000	2938000	that is
2968000	2970000	not the only
2970000	2972000	CDK2.
2972000	2974000	There is another
2974000	2976000	CDK2
2976000	2978000	that is
2978000	2980000	not the only
2980000	2982000	CDK2.
2982000	2984000	There is another
2984000	2986000	CDK2
2986000	2988000	that is
2988000	2990000	not the only
2990000	2992000	CDK2.
2992000	2994000	The last one
2994000	2996000	is
2996000	2998000	basically
2998000	3000000	the research of CDK2
3000000	3002000	because it is a very important protein
3002000	3004000	for cell cycle
3004000	3006000	or cell division.
3006000	3008000	So most of the research is on cancer
3008000	3010000	or cell division
3010000	3012000	or cell division.
3012000	3014000	In fact, other aspects
3014000	3016000	have not been studied at all.
3016000	3018000	So
3018000	3020000	the first thing we need to do is to make sure
3020000	3022000	whether the CDK2
3022000	3024000	is expressed in the cell of
3024000	3026000	the protein.
3026000	3028000	This is a previous study.
3028000	3030000	They found that CDK2
3030000	3032000	is not only expressed, but also
3032000	3034000	if you do LPS, which is the stimulation of the endocrine,
3034000	3036000	it will still rise.
3036000	3038000	This means that it is not only functional,
3038000	3040000	but also
3040000	3042000	has a reaction
3042000	3044000	to neutrophil stimulation.
3044000	3046000	This is the
3046000	3048000	level of RNA.
3048000	3050000	If you look at the level of protein,
3050000	3052000	you will find that most of the CDK2
3052000	3054000	C is the cytosol, N is the nucleus.
3054000	3056000	Most of them are in the cell.
3056000	3058000	Although you may say that
3058000	3060000	it will be a little bit after eating,
3060000	3062000	most of them are still in the cell.
3062000	3064000	In our system,
3064000	3066000	we
3066000	3068000	draw blood and then separate
3068000	3070000	human neutrophils,
3070000	3072000	such as the neutrophils on you and me.
3072000	3074000	What we are talking about now is
3074000	3076000	the cell skeleton of its actin.
3076000	3078000	It is found that after the cell skeleton
3078000	3080000	has been stimulated,
3080000	3082000	there is a single
3082000	3084000	polarization.
3084000	3086000	This depi is its nucleus.
3086000	3088000	You will find that CDK2
3088000	3090000	is like the previous report.
3090000	3092000	Regardless of the fact that
3092000	3094000	there is no CDK2 in the nucleus,
3094000	3096000	most of the green part and the blue part
3096000	3098000	are actually a little bit apart.
3098000	3100000	Most of them are actually in the cell tissue,
3100000	3102000	not in the nucleus.
3102000	3104000	This is also confirmed by the previous research.
3104000	3106000	It also proves that
3106000	3108000	the CDK2 we see in our system
3108000	3110000	is actually in the nucleus.
3112000	3114000	As mentioned earlier...
3114000	3116000	Sorry.
3116000	3118000	The time is almost up.
3118000	3120000	Sorry.
3120000	3122000	I don't know how many pages you have left,
3122000	3124000	but you may need to speed up later.
3124000	3126000	Okay, I got it.
3126000	3128000	In order to separate
3128000	3130000	the functions of the traditional CDK2,
3130000	3132000	because the traditional CDK2 is studied
3132000	3134000	and replicated in DNA,
3134000	3136000	we use NU6140 today.
3136000	3138000	This is the replication of the
3138000	3140000	replicated CDK2,
3140000	3142000	and this is the replication of the
3142000	3144000	replicated DNA.
3144000	3146000	We found that only when you
3146000	3148000	replicate the CDK2,
3148000	3150000	but you replicate the DNA,
3150000	3152000	there is an effect.
3152000	3154000	So the role of CDK2 today
3154000	3156000	is beyond the function of
3156000	3158000	DNA replication
3158000	3160000	that we traditionally recognize.
3160000	3162000	In both of our
3162000	3164000	research models,
3164000	3166000	we found that only when you
3166000	3168000	replicate the CDK2,
3168000	3170000	there is such a replication recruitment,
3170000	3172000	which is to replicate its
3172000	3174000	path to the original place,
3174000	3176000	and then when you replicate the DNA
3176000	3178000	replication, there is no effect.
3178000	3180000	In order to be afraid that
3180000	3182000	if we replicate the CDK2,
3182000	3184000	it will directly kill the cell,
3184000	3186000	we chose two inhibitors
3186000	3188000	to replicate the CDK2.
3188000	3190000	It can be
3190000	3192000	washed away.
3192000	3194000	As you can see,
3194000	3196000	the speed of the cell
3196000	3198000	is still normal.
3198000	3200000	Once we give it this drug,
3200000	3202000	it will slow down.
3202000	3204000	Once we wash
3204000	3206000	this drug away,
3206000	3208000	it will return to normal in 1-2 hours.
3208000	3210000	It means that we just
3210000	3212000	brake it a little bit,
3212000	3214000	we don't kill it,
3214000	3216000	but do some irreversible reactions.
3216000	3218000	This may be very helpful
3218000	3220000	in terms of treatment,
3220000	3222000	we can suppress it
3222000	3224000	and wash it away.
3224000	3226000	It can solve
3226000	3228000	such a problem.
3230000	3232000	In addition, we need to see
3232000	3234000	what the function of CDK2 is.
3234000	3236000	It is a gene model.
3236000	3238000	If you look at it from the point of view of medicine,
3238000	3240000	it will often have off-targeting,
3240000	3242000	which is some non-specific functions.
3242000	3244000	So we just put the CDK2,
3244000	3246000	this is CDK2 and its
3246000	3248000	binding part 2,
3248000	3250000	on the CDK2.
3250000	3252000	After the CDK2 is off-targeted,
3252000	3254000	it will not be able
3254000	3256000	to neutralize
3256000	3258000	its target.
3262000	3264000	The result of this
3264000	3266000	is that it will
3266000	3268000	occupy all of its
3268000	3270000	targets,
3270000	3272000	because it occupies
3272000	3274000	the macromolecule.
3274000	3276000	Second, all the cyclins will also be occupied
3276000	3278000	by the macromolecule.
3278000	3280000	So we call this strategy
3280000	3282000	dominant-negative.
3282000	3284000	Then we put it in the bimolecule.
3284000	3286000	You will find that if you express
3286000	3288000	such a red CDK2 normally,
3288000	3290000	it will be very happy.
3290000	3292000	On the other hand, if you express
3292000	3294000	this dominant-negative,
3294000	3296000	this CDK2,
3296000	3298000	you will find that the cells will not move at all.
3298000	3300000	But the interesting thing is that
3300000	3302000	when you soak
3302000	3304000	this whole fish in
3304000	3306000	a chemical substance
3306000	3308000	to attract these neutrophils,
3308000	3310000	you will find that
3310000	3312000	they will still move.
3312000	3314000	They will still go to
3314000	3316000	this macromolecule.
3316000	3318000	It's just that it's going slower,
3318000	3320000	and the directionality seems to be lost.
3320000	3322000	If you compare it to what you saw earlier,
3322000	3324000	this is normal.
3324000	3326000	In the absence of speech,
3326000	3328000	they are lazy and don't move much.
3328000	3330000	On the other hand,
3330000	3332000	when they speak,
3332000	3334000	they are still lazy.
3334000	3336000	It's just that they move slowly,
3336000	3338000	and the trajectory is not so straight.
3340000	3342000	Let's look at this thing
3342000	3344000	with a higher degree of detection.
3344000	3346000	Let's look at their cell skeleton.
3346000	3348000	Generally speaking, in a moving neutrophil,
3348000	3350000	you will find that its stable actin,
3350000	3352000	which is a mark
3352000	3354000	of its actin,
3354000	3356000	will be behind its cell.
3356000	3358000	So this green will follow the purple.
3358000	3360000	So this green is always a mark
3360000	3362000	of the cell.
3362000	3364000	But when you express
3364000	3366000	the dominant and negative constructs
3366000	3368000	of CDK2,
3368000	3370000	you will find that the cell is not dead or not moving.
3370000	3372000	It's just that the green doesn't know where to go.
3372000	3374000	It's like walking left and right.
3374000	3376000	It doesn't know where to move.
3378000	3380000	So this also tells us
3380000	3382000	that there may be some problems with thresholding.
3384000	3386000	In order to make sure
3386000	3388000	that what we see is
3388000	3390000	caused by
3390000	3392000	CDK2,
3392000	3394000	we used
3394000	3396000	a new cell
3396000	3398000	to knock off
3398000	3400000	this gene.
3400000	3402000	So we found that
3402000	3404000	when we removed CDK2,
3404000	3406000	our neutrophils
3406000	3408000	didn't move much.
3408000	3410000	At the same time,
3410000	3412000	in order to make sure that this removal is a deliberate removal,
3412000	3414000	if we put CDK2 back,
3414000	3416000	you will find that
3416000	3418000	there is a rescue
3418000	3420000	to restore its movement speed.
3420000	3422000	So when you put
3422000	3424000	this DNA back,
3424000	3426000	of course, it has no effect.
3426000	3428000	So the phenomenon we see
3428000	3430000	is specifically caused by CDK2.
3432000	3434000	So what we just mentioned
3434000	3436000	is that the cell looks drunk
3436000	3438000	and walks left and right.
3438000	3440000	So let me introduce to you
3440000	3442000	this neutrophil.
3442000	3444000	In order to make it move,
3444000	3446000	we need to activate
3446000	3448000	the leading edge
3448000	3450000	and the trailing edge.
3450000	3452000	The signaling in the front
3452000	3454000	uses two proteins
3454000	3456000	as the readout.
3456000	3458000	We found that
3458000	3460000	in a human cell,
3460000	3462000	if you knock off
3462000	3464000	CDK2,
3464000	3466000	not really knock it off,
3466000	3468000	but just suppress
3468000	3470000	its expression,
3470000	3472000	the signal in the front
3472000	3474000	will decrease.
3474000	3476000	In contrast,
3476000	3478000	the signal in the back,
3478000	3480000	the myosin,
3480000	3482000	is usually behind the cell,
3482000	3484000	and the fluoride
3484000	3486000	will mark the leading edge of the cell.
3486000	3488000	The leading edge and the trailing edge
3488000	3490000	are separated,
3490000	3492000	so we know that the cell is upward polarizing.
3492000	3494000	But when you take CDK2 off,
3494000	3496000	the polarization disappears.
3496000	3498000	This means that this cell
3498000	3500000	is like what we see in the fish.
3500000	3502000	Finally,
3502000	3504000	let's switch to
3504000	3506000	a mouse model.
3506000	3508000	After CDK2 is taken off,
3508000	3510000	the mouse is only relatively small,
3510000	3512000	and it can't reproduce.
3512000	3514000	But the problem is that
3514000	3516000	some of its functions are unknown.
3516000	3518000	So we did a
3518000	3520000	post-mortem on this mouse.
3520000	3522000	We took a post-mortem on it
3522000	3524000	and then collected its saliva
3524000	3526000	to see what happened.
3526000	3528000	Let's skip
3528000	3530000	the graph first.
3530000	3532000	As you can see,
3532000	3534000	in this circle,
3534000	3536000	when CDK2 is taken off,
3536000	3538000	there are fewer dots
3538000	3540000	compared to
3540000	3542000	the dots here.
3542000	3544000	This means that
3544000	3546000	there are fewer neutrophils
3546000	3548000	entering the germ.
3548000	3550000	While there are fewer neutrophils
3550000	3552000	entering the germ,
3552000	3554000	we found that
3554000	3556000	in a normal situation,
3556000	3558000	the neutrophil
3558000	3560000	in the germ
3560000	3562000	has a higher proportion.
3562000	3564000	The neutrophil
3564000	3566000	in the germ
3566000	3568000	has a higher proportion than
3568000	3570000	in a normal mouse.
3570000	3572000	When it is taken off,
3572000	3574000	the neutrophil
3574000	3576000	will move to the surrounding blood
3576000	3578000	and go to the circulatory system.
3578000	3580000	That's why you see
3580000	3582000	this decrease.
3582000	3584000	However, if there is a problem
3584000	3586000	with the neutrophil,
3586000	3588000	the neutrophil will stay in the blood
3588000	3590000	with a higher proportion.
3590000	3592000	At the same time,
3592000	3594000	the neutrophil will be
3594000	3596000	less likely to be infected.
3596000	3598000	To summarize,
3598000	3600000	neutrophils move in
3600000	3602000	2D and 3D.
3602000	3604000	One of them moves
3604000	3606000	on the surface,
3606000	3608000	while the other
3608000	3610000	moves on the leading edge
3610000	3612000	and trailing edge.
3612000	3614000	We found that
3614000	3616000	in human cells,
3616000	3618000	if you suppress the CDK2,
3618000	3620000	which is a 2D migration,
3620000	3622000	the CDK2 will move
3622000	3624000	on the leading edge
3624000	3626000	and trailing edge.
3626000	3628000	When you suppress the CDK2,
3628000	3630000	it will move on the leading edge
3630000	3632000	and trailing edge.
3632000	3634000	However, the CDK2
3634000	3636000	will move on the leading edge
3636000	3638000	and trailing edge.
3638000	3640000	This means that
3640000	3642000	in the 3D ring,
3642000	3644000	the CDK2 will move on the leading edge
3644000	3646000	and trailing edge.
3646000	3648000	This means that
3648000	3650000	in the 3D ring,
3650000	3652000	the CDK2 will move on the leading edge
3652000	3654000	and trailing edge.
3654000	3656000	However, if you suppress the CDK2,
3656000	3658000	the CDK2 will move
3658000	3660000	on the leading edge
3660000	3662000	and trailing edge.
3662000	3664000	This is the summary of
3664000	3666000	the CDK2 migration in the
3666000	3668000	Bermuda Triangle.
3668000	3670000	It is a very useful
3670000	3672000	in human and mouse systems.
3672000	3674000	It is a conserved feature.
3674000	3676000	It is a conserved feature.
3676000	3678000	It is a conserved feature.
3678000	3680000	The last data
3680000	3682000	is the model of
3682000	3684000	Bermuda Triangle.
3684000	3686000	It is a model of
3686000	3688000	a bacteria-type
3688000	3690000	all-body infection
3690000	3692000	that will kill itself.
3692000	3694000	It is a model of
3694000	3696000	a bacteria-type
3726000	3728000	all-body infection
3728000	3730000	that will kill itself.
3730000	3732000	It also increases
3732000	3734000	the dose of the infection.
3734000	3736000	It also increases
3736000	3738000	the dose of the infection.
3738000	3740000	It also increases
3740000	3742000	the dose of the infection.
3748000	3750000	It also increases
3750000	3752000	the survival rate
3752000	3754000	of Bermuda Triangle.
3754000	3757000	It also increases
3757000	3760000	the survival rate
3760000	3762000	of Bermuda Triangle.
3763000	3766000	It also increases
3766000	3769000	the survival rate
3769000	3771000	of Bermuda Triangle.
3773000	3773300	Before wards
3773700	3776000	followed by
3776000	3780000	the hospital ward.
3780000	3781000	All Wards
3781000	3783000	™
3783000	3786000	are related to
3786000	3791000	cell migration.
3791000	3793000	The CDK2
3793000	3796000	is also needed
3796000	3799000	by the neutral field.
3799000	3801000	The CDK2
3801000	3803000	and its downstream
3803000	3806000	can improve
3806000	3809000	the survival rate
3809000	3811000	of Bermuda Triangle.
3811000	3813000	We are working on
3813000	3815000	the CDK2's
3815000	3817000	downstream substrate,
3817000	3819000	its target
3819000	3821000	and its binding factor.
3821000	3823000	This is our lab.
3823000	3825000	This is my boss,
3825000	3826000	Deng Qin,
3826000	3827000	and my committee.
3827000	3829000	I have an excellent undergraduate
3829000	3831000	who has been helping me with experiments.
3831000	3833000	Thank you.
3833000	3843000	Let's give him a round of applause.
3843000	3845000	Remember to turn on the microphone.
3853000	3855000	Do you have any questions
3855000	3857000	for Yihui?
3864000	3866000	I have a question.
3866000	3869000	It's more detailed.
3869000	3871000	I don't have much knowledge
3871000	3873000	about flow cytometry.
3873000	3875000	You used flow cytometry
3875000	3877000	to quantify
3877000	3879000	the amount of RNA.
3879000	3881000	Is it possible to
3881000	3883000	label the RNA
3883000	3885000	using FISH
3885000	3887000	and then run the flow
3887000	3889000	to compare
3889000	3892000	the changes in the amount?
3892000	3894000	I'm sorry.
3894000	3896000	I might be talking too fast.
3896000	3898000	Our RNA levels
3898000	3900000	are all quantified
3900000	3902000	using PCR.
3902000	3904000	We don't use flow
3904000	3906000	to quantify RNA.
3906000	3908000	So, in this slide,
3908000	3910000	you don't use flow cytometry,
3910000	3912000	but...
3912000	3914000	We use flow
3914000	3916000	to separate
3916000	3918000	the neutral field
3918000	3920000	from the entire substrate
3920000	3922000	to do sequencing.
3922000	3924000	Each red dot
3924000	3926000	is a cell.
3926000	3928000	This is a flow chart.
3928000	3930000	We separate the cells
3930000	3932000	and extract the RNA
3932000	3934000	to compare
3934000	3936000	the amount of mRNA
3936000	3938000	in each cell.
3938000	3940000	In this chart,
3940000	3942000	we only use PCR
3942000	3944000	to verify
3944000	3946000	whether the sequencing is correct.
3946000	3948000	I see.
3948000	3950000	Thank you.
3960000	3962000	Do you have
3962000	3964000	any other questions?
3964000	3966000	I'm sorry.
3966000	3968000	I might be talking too fast.
3968000	3970000	Okay.
3970000	3972000	If you don't have any questions,
3972000	3974000	I'll stop the recording.
3974000	3976000	You can continue
3976000	3978000	to chat here.
3978000	3980000	You can email me if you have any questions.
