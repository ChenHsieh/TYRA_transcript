00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's 9.19 Taira Talk. I am the host today, Hong Shi-an.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
We are very honored to invite Liao Kun-yan to speak for us today.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
Liao Kun-yan is currently a Ph.D. student in the Materials Engineering Department at Tokyo University.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Previously, he obtained a master's and master's degree from the German University of Munich.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
He is mainly interested in electronic microscope and neutron scattering material analysis technology.

00:38.000 --> 00:53.000
He is mainly interested in the structure of inorganic glass, the high-angle crystal, and the origin-density spectrum.

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
Today, he is going to talk about EELS, Electron Energy Low Spectroscopy.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Let's give him a round of applause to welcome him to give us today's talk.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Everyone, please turn on your microphones.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
We'll leave the time to you.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I'll start now.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
The topic of my talk today is EELS.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
I want to talk about why it is thought to be a synchrotron in electronic microscopes.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
In addition to the introduction just now, let me introduce the department I am in now.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Our department is a department that attaches great importance to electronic microscopes.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
We have about 20 electronic microscopes in our department.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
We have about four or more electronic microscopes.

01:51.000 --> 02:02.000
Our field includes instrument development, ceramic interface, crystal defects, and quasicrystal crystal.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Our department specializes in EELS and DFT calculation.

02:08.000 --> 02:17.000
In order not to be the same as them, we specialize in non-static, liquid, and gas.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
In the past, we have done a lot of liquid and gas EELS.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
But this is a special instrument, so I won't talk about it in this talk.

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
My own research is that I am very interested in glass.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
In addition to the fact that most of the glass you see on this screen is transparent and well-balanced material,

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
if you look at the inside of the glass from a nanometer perspective,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
it may have a very small domain.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
This is because of the domain caused by its phase separation.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
It will also cause it to have different shapes and colors.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
It will have different structures and textures.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
My first year is mainly to study this.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Today's talk will also talk about some.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
This year, my own theme is to adjust to the dopan in the glass.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Is the dopan in the glass a cluster or a particle?

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Or is it a dopan that is separated from one atom by one atom?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
What impact does it have on the quality of the glass?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
This is my own theme.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I won't talk about this today.

03:39.000 --> 03:49.000
Another thing I will mention is that I have measured the thermal expansion coefficient of some crystal surfaces.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I may have a chance to mention it today.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
This is related to optical characteristics and PLASMO.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I will mention it later.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
Basically, this is the outline of today's speech.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
I will first tell you why we want to make electronic microscope.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
How do we see the origin?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Finally, I will talk about EOS.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
It may take a lot of time in the first half.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
After all, I'm not sure what the audience's background is.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
So I will talk about what the electronic microscope is doing.

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
Basically, all microscopes, no matter what particle you use,

04:40.000 --> 04:49.000
The earliest microscope should be the optical microscope invented by Hucke in 1665.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
Hucke is the most familiar with its spring, Huckelo.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
But in fact, he also did a lot of things.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
One of them is the optical microscope.

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
Then he went through a very simple observation of what the cells and insects look like.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
Then he drew it down and got some new knowledge from it.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
But this is in 1665.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Of course, for the people at the time, this may be a very incredible research.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Then he really told us a lot of things.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But if you only have optical microscopes,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
In fact, it is not enough today.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
The reason is that if you only have optical microscopes,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
You won't know what happened to us this year.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
That is, if you don't have an electronic microscope,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
In fact, you can't see the virus.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Then you can't see the coronavirus.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
You won't know what happened this year.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
This photo is from the Institute of Health in the United States.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Photos of the coronavirus, electronic microscope photos.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Then the one on the right is the structure of the virus.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Photos of the electronic microscope.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
It was also published this year.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
The electronic microscope seems to have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
It is also a very popular field.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
But I won't mention it because I'm doing it completely.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
So we won't discuss the electronic microscope today.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But it is also a powerful tool.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So seeing this kind of small-scale thing,

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
It is an advantage that makes electronic microscopes unique.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
So if you look at it from the perspective of a microscope,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Because what I learned myself is material science.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
Material science is a very complicated subject.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
The reason is that it is a cross-level problem.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
For example, I used to do metal materials.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Suppose you want to design a metal material.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You have to consider a lot of things.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
You have to consider what happens to its surface at the level of a microscope.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Is there a crack?

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
You have to find out how many phases are there in the material.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
What is its texture?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Is there any adsorption?

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
Finally, return to the characteristics of the metal material.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
To deal with such a problem,

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
In fact, we need a lot of different tools in different systems.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
For example, if we need EBSD for the level of a microscope,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
We need some mechanical tools to measure.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
At the level of a microscope, we need high-resolution TEM.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
Even if you need a very high-resolution spectrum like AtomPROP

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
To confirm your chemical composition.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
On the other hand, if you are doing simulation,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You will find that the people of mechanics

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
The most important simulation they do is called Finite Element Method.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Finite Element Method simulates some of the characteristics of mechanics.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
But in the Finite Element Method,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
You still have to have physical properties.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
So you have to do some molecular mechanics,

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Modicaro, and even DFT, Programme Mechanics.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So simply put,

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
If you really want to fully understand material science,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
You have to have all of these things.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
In comparison, the level of a microscope

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
In fact, the knowledge we currently have in technology

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
In fact, it is already very sufficient.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Basically, there is nothing you don't know.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Most of the problems on the level of a microscope can be solved.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
But at the level of a microscope,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
We will have a lot of difficulties just measuring.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
That's why I want to talk about this today.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
In particular,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
If you look at it from a physical point of view,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
In fact, we deal with these problems.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
There is a tool called Large-Scale Facility.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
That just happens to be STEM, Singleton Radiation, and Neutron Source.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I have done these three experiments.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I also want to briefly talk about their differences.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
In general, Taiwan currently has the middle one and the left one.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Some universities in Taiwan have the left one.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
The middle one is Neutron Radiation.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Taiwan's Neutron Source.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
It is the third generation of Neutron Radiation.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
It is also a very powerful method.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
There is a big difference between them.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
In addition to the type of radiation you use,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
This one uses electrons, this one uses light, and this one uses neutrons.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Their sample duration is actually very different.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
For example, if you look at a microscope,

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
The property you get, the amount you get,

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Or the area you observe,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
It's actually a very small range.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Simply put, there is a saying,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
See the tree but not the forest.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
You can only see the tree, but you ignore the forest.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
A microscope is a bit like looking at a tree.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
So your resolution is around nanometers.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's great.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
But if you want to go to a higher resolution,

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
In fact, Neutron Radiation is a more suitable tool.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Because what you see in your Neutron,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
The size of your crystal sample is about micrometers.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
If you want to study more industrial problems,

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
To the size of millimeters, centimeters, or even meters,

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Neutron Radiation is a very good choice.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Because you can put a centimeter sample in.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
When I was at Muniher,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
At that time, there were some BinLine.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Muniher is the headquarters of BMW.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
They can put a whole car engine

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Put it in the BinLine of Neutron Radiation.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
To see some images of its engine.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
In addition to the sample size,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Its interaction with matter is also very different.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Neutron, whether you are magnetic radiation or nuclear scattering,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It's all very weak.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
It doesn't destroy your sample.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
But electrons are easy to destroy.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Or change your sample.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
This is also something we need to pay attention to.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
If you say so,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
There is a big difference.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
The middle and the far right,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
They are all user facilities.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
That is, you don't need to know anyone in there.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
You just need to apply for your project.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
If your project passes, you can do the experiment.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Even if you have nothing to do with it.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
But it's a pity that in the electronic microscope,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
In fact, there are not so many user facilities.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
So most electronic microscopes are still owned by a small number of people.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
If you want to do a similar experiment,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
You have to know someone.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
There are some user facilities.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
At the end of the speech, we will tell everyone.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
If you want to do it, you don't know anyone.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You can go there and do it.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It will be put at the end of the speech.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
What kind of user facilities can be used?

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
In fact, people in the past have never thought about

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
To turn electronic microscopes into

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
Such a public instrument such as neodymium magnets or copper radiation.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
One of the reasons is because

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
Electronic microscopes were not so powerful at the time.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
It can't do so many things.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
But recently, it can really do a lot of things.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
If you are interested, you can look at this paper.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
Why neodymium magnets in electronic microscopes

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
It really causes electronic microscopes to become a single-chrome radiation.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
If you are interested, you can refer to it.

13:36.000 --> 13:43.000
The biggest problem I want to talk about today is

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Between me and the audience

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
Maybe a lot of people have different views on electronic microscopes.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Of course, some people have similar views.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
If you are from the Microscopic Society, you may have a closer view.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
The first thing I want to talk about is

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
How do we see atoms?

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
In fact, this topic has won awards in 2011 and 2020.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Wolf Prize, Cavalier Prize, and Nano Prize

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I showed a picture here.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
It is a high-resolution TEM image.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Its material is iron.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
Iron is a popular topic.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
If you don't know much about electronic microscopes,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I think you can ask three questions.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
I want to answer these three questions in the next section.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
The first thing is how to see such an image.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
If you have the opportunity to use an electronic microscope,

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
Is it easy or difficult to see such an image?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
This is the first question.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
The second question is if you observe this image

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
If you look at its atoms, it will have yellow, orange, and blue atoms.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
If you look at the left and right, you will find that the orange atom is at the top of the blue atom.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
The orange atom is at the bottom of the blue atom on the right.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
You will find that we can observe the deviation of several atoms.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
The second question is how do I know which atom represents which element?

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
What kind of atom is the image it sees?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
How do we distinguish the atoms?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
This is the second question.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
The third question is what is not in such an image.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
The information in such an image is the electrical field and magnetic field.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
If there is an electronic microscope,

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
I can't see the electrical field and magnetic field with the latest electronic microscope.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
This is the third question I want to answer.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Let me give you a brief introduction.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Electronic microscopes are very different from optical microscopes.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
But the structure is basically the same.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
You have a light source.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
This is an electron.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
You have a condenser lens.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
The only difference is that the optical microscope on the left is a glass lens.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
The electron on the right is a conductive electron.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
So you use a magnetic lens to focus on the electron.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
There is also a sample.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
There is also a fog lens.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
There is also a projection lens.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
So the simplest way to understand is that the electronic microscope is an optical microscope.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Just use the electron as a light source.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
If you understand this way,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
In fact, most things can be solved.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Because most people should have encountered optical microscopes.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
The only difference is that you need a large electronic microscope.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It needs high vacuum.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
But in addition, you can really use it as an optical microscope.

17:12.000 --> 17:19.000
Of course, electrons and substances have different effects.

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
The biggest reason why I use electronic microscopes is

17:25.000 --> 17:32.000
In fact, the wavelength of electrons is much smaller than that of normal visible light.

17:32.000 --> 17:41.000
If you have studied physics and are familiar with light, you may know that there is a formula called Abbey Diffraction Limit.

17:42.000 --> 18:00.000
Basically, what he is talking about is that no matter how small the light is, the resolution will still be limited to the wavelength.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
This is a physical limit.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
The maximum resolution is your wavelength divided by 2.

18:09.000 --> 18:18.000
Of course, this limit was broken in 2011 by the Super Resolution Optical Microscope.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
But in general, this is the limit of optical microscopes.

18:22.000 --> 18:31.000
If you look at this formula, you can intuitively see that if you want to improve your Abbey Diffraction Limit,

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
You have to find a way to make your wavelength smaller.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
The reason why I use electrons is actually because of the resources.

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
Because when you apply a very strong electric field, the wavelength of electrons can be very small.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
For example, if you apply 300 kV, your electronic wavelength can be up to 1 picometer.

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
In principle, you should be able to see the resolution of 1 picometer.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
But this is actually wrong.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Then I will explain why this is wrong.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
But the basic concept is that the reason you use electrons is because the electromagnetic wavelength is very short.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Then it can help you see things more clearly.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Why is it wrong?

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
It's because our lens is actually not perfect.

19:26.000 --> 19:33.000
There is something called Spherical Aberration Curve.

19:33.000 --> 19:41.000
To put it simply, you start from the same point from different angles.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
You can't actually focus on the same point through different angles.

19:49.000 --> 19:57.000
Of course, if you read a high school textbook, it will tell you that no matter which angle you start from, it will focus on a focus point.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
But in fact, you can't actually focus on a point.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
To be more specific, what is Spherical Aberration Curve in real life?

20:06.000 --> 20:14.000
It's a bit like you take a glass cup and put it on a floor with patterns or sandpaper.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
You will find that the part you see clearly is only a small area in the middle.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
But the sides are all curved.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
This is the reason for Spherical Aberration Curve.

20:25.000 --> 20:32.000
The more you move away from the center of the light, the more you can't actually focus on the same point.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
So what you see is curved.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
In fact, in the electronic microscope...

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Can you hear me?

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Sorry, I'm not sure what happened just now.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
But there is also this problem in the electronic microscope.

21:08.000 --> 21:15.000
So the first thing you see is how to fix this problem.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
In fact, this story can be recited for a very long time.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
But simply put, there are four people who contribute in this field respectively.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
The story began in the early 1940s.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
After 40 or 50 years of hard work,

21:35.000 --> 21:44.000
people found this problem and solved it.

21:44.000 --> 21:52.000
The method they used was to use a lot of electronic probes to try to correct this difference.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Of course, this electronic probe is a very complicated result.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
According to my research, in the latest electronic microscope,

21:59.000 --> 22:11.000
you need to have 20 layers of this kind of electronic probe to achieve a good resolution.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
But in short, this is a success.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
So now we can see the origin through this Spherical Aberration Curve.

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
Most users don't really need to know how to control it.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
Basically, the maintenance staff will help you adjust it.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
So if you use an electronic microscope now,

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
how much resolution can you get?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
I have a picture here.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
On one side is TEM, and on the other is STEM.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
The one in the middle is the resolution before correction,

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
and the one in the back is the resolution after correction.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Of course, you can't see how well it has changed in this picture.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
But it's obvious that it's clear.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
For most people, this is enough.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
If you look at the picture on the right,

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
it's actually a silicon.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
There's a certain angle in the middle.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
If you do a Fourier Transform,

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
you'll see this kind of Diffraction Pattern.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
It's obvious that if you don't have a corrected picture,

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
the Diffraction Pattern limit you see is about 1.92 Angstrom.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
If you go through the correction,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
you can see that the limit is about 0.76 Angstrom.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
That's 76 picometers.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
This resolution is probably in 2002.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
The data I found,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
if you are a modern electronic microscope,

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
it should be able to reach more than 50 picometers.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
As mentioned earlier,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
the Cornell DMV group,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
if they do Tycography,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
it can reach 40 picometers.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
That's the current record.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
Your resolution is higher than 40 picometers.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
If you hear this,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I think some people may have a question.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Why do I need such a high resolution?

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I'll give you two examples.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Why do we need this resolution?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
The first example is a carbon nanotube.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
If you look at this picture,

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
the picture on the left,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
if you don't do analysis,

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
you can't see any difference.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
This is a very beautiful

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
atomic resolution carbon nanotube.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
But if you do analysis,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
every point,

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
intensity,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
if you do Gaussian fitting,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
you will find that you can analyze

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
one atom, one atom,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
how many positions it deviates.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
You can see this value.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
This color represents the distance it deviates.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
All units are picometers.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
That is, through modern electronic microscope,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
you can see from the position of the atom,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
you can know its

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
carbon nanotube

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
the distribution of gravity.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Then you can know which atom is deviating.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Do this kind of very

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
high-precision measurement.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
This is very important for imaging.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It is also important for EOS,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
for light sampling.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
The reason is because

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
if you want to see

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
the light sample of a single atom,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
you must look at it very clearly

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
to understand which atom is what.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
This work is

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Suenaga,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
he is Japanese,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
a Japanese broadcaster.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
The main idea of this work is

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
he wants to look at

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
the green one,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
the common graphene carbon,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
and the two-handed carbon

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
on the edge of the graphene,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
to this one-handed carbon.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
What is the difference in its light sample?

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
What is its impact on the quality of graphene?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
He really went to do it.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I have a question.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Sorry,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm not an electronic microscope,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
so I might ask a very out-of-the-way question.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
You said that your displacement

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
is probably at

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
dozens of picometers,

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
this level.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
You can probably say

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
how much of this displacement

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
comes from the incident particle,

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
which is your electron,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
plus the displacement.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
What is the percentage,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
or what is the percentage?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I don't know.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
The first thing I want to say is

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
this is

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
how to say it,

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
that is,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
modern,

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
you can,

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
because electronic microscopes

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
are actually quite long-standing

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
studies,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
so a lot of information,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
like how much energy

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
your electron emits

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
to a single atom,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
you can use calculations,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
and you can also calculate

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
how much it heats up

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
to a single atom.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
But what you said,

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
that is,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
in the end,

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
for example,

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
how much impact

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
it has on carbon nanotubes,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
this is a very good question.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
You have to,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
for each different material,

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
you have to discuss this matter.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
I can't tell you directly

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
that it probably stands to reason,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
but I can tell you very clearly

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
that you do today,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
like this carbon nanotube,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
the impact of electrons on a single atom

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
is definitely higher than

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
you take it to look at

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
metal or ceramics.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Maybe ceramics,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
you don't even,

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
electrons,

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
that is,

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
your atoms

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
don't cause any change at all.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
But in this kind of carbon nanotube,

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
indeed,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
electrons may

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
have an impact on the position of the atom.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
But I can't tell you

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
exactly how much

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
it accounts for.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Sorry.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Yes, I understand.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Thank you.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Yes,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
simply put,

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
of course,

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
the question you just asked

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
is also a very practical question.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
You have to

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
study this matter.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
But simply put,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
because there is a spherical refractor,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
we can see the atom very accurately.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
That is,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
people who do EOS

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
can go to

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
each atom,

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
each single atom,

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
to see what is the difference

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
between its light waves,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
such as green,

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
blue,

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
and red.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
There are some differences.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Of course,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
green and blue

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
may be very different,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
and blue and red

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
may not be so different.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
But if you do the calculation,

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
you can know

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
why they are different,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
and what the difference

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
means.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
This can be interpreted.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Sorry,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I have a question.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
OK.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Yes,

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
can you hear me?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Yes,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I can hear you.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
You can hear me.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
How do you look at

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
the energy loss

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
in the 2D

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
part?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
In theory

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
or in practice,

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
how do you look at

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
this thing?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
What kind of energy loss

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
does it have?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
I will put it

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
in the second session.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
I will put EOS's structure 2.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
But simply put,

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
you see this image.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
In fact,

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
it is

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
EOS's structure 2.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
It is

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
EOS's structure 2.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
It is

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
EOS's structure 2.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
It is

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
EOS's structure 2.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
It is

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
EOS's structure 2.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
In fact,

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
because you

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
have a

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
regressed electron,

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
you

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
are

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
detecting

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
the energy

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
loss

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
of the

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
regressed electron.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
So EOS

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
is usually

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
placed at the

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
bottom of

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
the electron microscope

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
A

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
general

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
instrument

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
is placed

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
at the

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
bottom.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
You

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
put the

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
light

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
spectrum

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
like this

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
and

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
analyze the

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
energy loss

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
of the

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
same electron.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Then you can

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
see the

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
light spectrum

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
like this.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
I will

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
talk about

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
the specific

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
structure

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
in the

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
next

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
section.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Okay,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
the part

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
I just

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
talked about

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
is about

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
how we

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
can see

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
an electron

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
very precisely

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
This matter

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
is very

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
important.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Because

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
if you can't see

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
the electron,

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
you can't

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
study the

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
light spectrum

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
of the

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
electron.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
The

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
red frame

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
here

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
is the

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
element

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
that

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
ordinary

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
people

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
will

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
encounter.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
The

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
element that

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
is not listed

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
below

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
may not

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
be an

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
element

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
that

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
ordinary

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
people

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
will

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
encounter.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Let me

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
give you an

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
example.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
You can

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
think about

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
what you

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
expect to

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
see in

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
the electron

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
The

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
answer is

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
that all

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
the elements

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
in this

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
frame can

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
be seen,

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
including

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
light and

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
light.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
I have

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
a picture

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
here.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
The

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
most important

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
element

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
I just

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
talked about

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
is the

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
light

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
element.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
This is

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
my

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
recent experiment.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
You can

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
see the

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
white

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
bismuth

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
forming

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
particles

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
or

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
single

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
atoms.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
In the

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
glass,

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
bismuth

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
is definitely

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
something

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
that

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
is easy

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
to see.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
The

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
light element

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
is special

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
because it

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
has only

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
one

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
light

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
element.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
The

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
first time

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
it was

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
seen was

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
in 2011

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
in the

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
YH

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
crystal.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
You

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
can see

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
the

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
faint

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
intensity,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
but

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
basically

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
you can

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
see the

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
light

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
element.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
This

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
method,

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
in fact,

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
the first

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
method to

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
do this

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
is the

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
method

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
that

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
you can

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
see the

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
light

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
element.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Of

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
course,

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
it's not

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
that simple,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
but

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
theoretically

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
you can

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
see the

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
light

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
element.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
The

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
first

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
question

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
I'm

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
going to

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
talk about

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
today is

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
that

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
many people

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
seem to

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
be doing

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
STEM,

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
but

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
no one

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
knows

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
why.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
This is

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
not a

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
traditional

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
electron microscope.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
It's a

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
technology

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
called

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
STEM.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
It's

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
very different

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
from a

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
optical

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
microscope.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
STEM

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
actually

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
focuses

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
the

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
electron

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
into a

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
very small

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
probe

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
and then

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
does

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
scanning.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
The

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
traditional

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
optical

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
microscope

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
will

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
look

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
very

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
different.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
To

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
put it

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
simply,

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
because

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
it does

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
this

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
scanning,

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
it can

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
put

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
detectors

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
at different

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
angles

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
in different

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
places.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
These

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
detectors

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
can

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
tell you

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
different

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
information

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
in

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
different

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
places.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
The

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
electron

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
microscope

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
is

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
very

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
sensitive

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
to

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
the

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
intensity

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
of the

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
electron.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
You

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
can

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
tell

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
the

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
intensity

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
of the

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
electron

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
by

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
looking at

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
the

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
intensity

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
of the

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
electron.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
The

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
other

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
technology

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
is

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
the

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
brightfield

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
microscope.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
It

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
is

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
similar to

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
the

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
TEM

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
microscope.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
The

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
last

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
technology is

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
the

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
detector.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
It

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
is

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
very

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
sensitive

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
to

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
light

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
particles.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
In

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
other

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
words,

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
if

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
you

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
have

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
a

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
small

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
electron

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
in

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
the

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
microscope,

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
you

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
can

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
detect

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
light

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
particles

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
in

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
a

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
small

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
electron.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
You

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
can

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
detect

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
light

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
particles

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
in

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
a

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
small

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
electron.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
You

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
can

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
detect

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
light

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
particles

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
in

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
a

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
small

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
electron.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
You

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
can

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
detect

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
light

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
particles

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
in

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
a

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
small

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
electron.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
It

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
is

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
a

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
very

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
sensitive

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
technology.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
It

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
is

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
a

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
very

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
sensitive

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
technology.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
It

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
is

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
a

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
very

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
sensitive

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
technology.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.140
For

35:33.140 --> 35:34.020
this

35:34.020 --> 35:35.140
case,

35:35.140 --> 35:36.140
let me

35:36.140 --> 35:37.140
show

35:37.140 --> 35:38.140
you

35:38.140 --> 35:39.140
how

35:39.140 --> 35:40.140
important

35:40.140 --> 35:41.140
this

35:41.140 --> 35:42.140
thing in

35:42.140 --> 35:43.140
science

35:43.140 --> 35:44.140
is.

35:44.140 --> 35:44.940
This

35:44.940 --> 35:46.180
is an

35:46.180 --> 35:47.140
experiment

35:47.140 --> 35:48.140
tailor-made

35:48.140 --> 35:49.140
project

35:49.140 --> 35:50.140
that

35:50.140 --> 35:51.140
studies

35:51.140 --> 35:52.140
Gold

35:52.140 --> 35:55.640
in

35:55.640 --> 35:56.500
liquid

35:56.500 --> 35:58.500
ions.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.500
This

35:59.500 --> 36:00.400
is their

36:00.400 --> 36:01.400
an original

36:01.400 --> 36:02.400
image,

36:02.400 --> 36:03.400
but

36:03.400 --> 36:04.400
I don't know

36:04.400 --> 36:05.400
if there is

36:05.400 --> 36:06.400
any contrast

36:06.400 --> 36:07.400
in this

36:07.400 --> 36:08.400
picture,

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
that is,

36:09.400 --> 36:10.400
there are some

36:10.400 --> 36:11.400
lines,

36:11.400 --> 36:12.400
but

36:12.400 --> 36:13.400
you can't

36:13.400 --> 36:14.400
see anything.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.400
But

36:15.400 --> 36:16.400
if you go

36:16.400 --> 36:17.400
to the

36:17.400 --> 36:18.400
hard

36:18.400 --> 36:19.400
depth

36:19.400 --> 36:20.400
image,

36:20.400 --> 36:21.400
you will

36:21.400 --> 36:22.400
find that

36:22.400 --> 36:23.400
there are

36:23.400 --> 36:24.400
actually

36:24.400 --> 36:25.400
a lot of

36:25.400 --> 36:26.400
gold ions

36:26.400 --> 36:27.400
in

36:27.400 --> 36:28.400
this

36:28.400 --> 36:29.400
picture.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.400
It

36:30.400 --> 36:31.400
turns out

36:31.400 --> 36:32.400
that

36:32.400 --> 36:33.400
if you

36:33.400 --> 36:34.400
do

36:34.400 --> 36:35.400
such

36:35.400 --> 36:36.400
research,

36:36.400 --> 36:37.400
gold ions

36:37.400 --> 36:38.400
can be

36:38.400 --> 36:39.400
distinguished from

36:39.400 --> 36:40.400
gold ions

36:40.400 --> 36:41.400
and

36:41.400 --> 36:42.400
it

36:42.400 --> 36:43.400
becomes

36:43.400 --> 36:44.400
a very

36:44.400 --> 36:45.400
important

36:45.400 --> 36:46.400
thing.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.400
From

36:47.400 --> 36:48.400
this

36:48.400 --> 36:49.400
point of

36:49.400 --> 36:50.400
view,

36:50.400 --> 36:51.400
you

36:51.400 --> 36:52.400
can't

36:52.400 --> 36:53.400
see

36:53.400 --> 36:54.400
anything

36:54.400 --> 36:55.400
at

36:55.400 --> 36:56.400
all.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.400
On

36:57.400 --> 36:58.400
the other

36:58.400 --> 36:59.400
hand,

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
there

37:00.400 --> 37:01.400
are several

37:01.400 --> 37:02.400
ways.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.400
The first

37:03.400 --> 37:04.400
thing is that

37:04.400 --> 37:05.400
this picture

37:05.400 --> 37:06.400
is actually a

37:06.400 --> 37:07.400
lithium-ion

37:07.400 --> 37:08.400
liquid.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.400
I forgot

37:09.400 --> 37:10.400
whether it

37:10.400 --> 37:11.400
was steam

37:11.400 --> 37:12.400
or something,

37:12.400 --> 37:13.400
but there is

37:13.400 --> 37:14.400
a low

37:14.400 --> 37:15.400
physical

37:15.400 --> 37:16.400
mass,

37:16.400 --> 37:17.400
so it

37:17.400 --> 37:18.400
will not

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
become

37:19.400 --> 37:20.400
gas in

37:20.400 --> 37:21.400
vacuum.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
You can

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
put it

37:23.400 --> 37:24.400
in.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.400
This is

37:25.400 --> 37:26.400
a general

37:26.400 --> 37:27.400
electronic

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
microscope.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
If you

37:29.400 --> 37:30.400
allow it,

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
you can put it

37:31.400 --> 37:32.400
in.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.400
In fact,

37:33.400 --> 37:34.400
many people

37:34.400 --> 37:35.400
don't like

37:35.400 --> 37:36.400
doing this,

37:36.400 --> 37:37.400
but in

37:37.400 --> 37:38.400
principle,

37:38.400 --> 37:39.400
it is physically

37:39.400 --> 37:40.400
safe.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.400
Another

37:41.400 --> 37:42.400
method

37:42.400 --> 37:43.400
is

37:43.400 --> 37:44.400
called

37:44.400 --> 37:45.400
a

37:45.400 --> 37:46.400
liquid

37:46.400 --> 37:47.400
holder.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.400
It

37:48.400 --> 37:49.400
has a

37:49.400 --> 37:50.400
special

37:50.400 --> 37:51.400
holder

37:51.400 --> 37:52.400
that you

37:52.400 --> 37:53.400
can put

37:53.400 --> 37:54.400
liquid

37:54.400 --> 37:55.400
in.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.400
These

37:56.400 --> 37:57.400
things

37:57.400 --> 37:58.400
are

37:58.400 --> 37:59.400
very thin.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.400
My

38:00.400 --> 38:01.400
understanding

38:01.400 --> 38:02.400
is that

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
EM

38:03.400 --> 38:04.400
has to be

38:04.400 --> 38:05.400
cut very

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
thin.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.400
Yes,

38:07.400 --> 38:08.400
this

38:08.400 --> 38:09.400
situation is

38:09.400 --> 38:10.400
a bit like

38:10.400 --> 38:11.400
a

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
lithium-ion

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
liquid.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.400
There

38:14.400 --> 38:15.400
should be

38:15.400 --> 38:16.400
a

38:16.400 --> 38:17.400
molybdenum

38:17.400 --> 38:18.400
or copper

38:18.400 --> 38:19.400
grid

38:19.400 --> 38:20.400
on the

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
outside

38:21.400 --> 38:22.400
.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
At

38:23.400 --> 38:24.400
the

38:24.400 --> 38:25.400
beginning,

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
it

38:26.400 --> 38:27.400
is

38:27.400 --> 38:28.400
very

38:28.400 --> 38:29.400
thin,

38:29.400 --> 38:30.400
but

38:30.400 --> 38:31.400
if you

38:31.400 --> 38:32.400
heat it

38:32.400 --> 38:33.400
a little

38:33.400 --> 38:34.400
in the

38:34.400 --> 38:35.400
vacuum

38:35.400 --> 38:36.400
furnace,

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
it

38:37.400 --> 38:38.400
will

38:38.400 --> 38:39.400
actually

38:39.400 --> 38:40.400
become

38:40.400 --> 38:41.400
a film

38:41.400 --> 38:42.400
like this

38:42.400 --> 38:43.400
and

38:43.400 --> 38:44.400
its

38:44.400 --> 38:45.400
thickness

38:45.400 --> 38:46.400
is

38:46.400 --> 38:47.400
about

38:47.400 --> 38:48.400
10 nanometers

38:48.400 --> 38:49.400
.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.400
This

38:50.400 --> 38:51.400
material

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
can do

38:52.400 --> 38:53.400
this.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.400
This

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
material

38:55.400 --> 38:56.400
is

38:56.400 --> 38:57.400
very

38:57.400 --> 38:58.400
thin

38:58.400 --> 38:59.400
and

38:59.400 --> 39:00.400
quite

39:00.400 --> 39:01.400
mature.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.400
The

39:02.400 --> 39:03.400
most famous

39:03.400 --> 39:04.400
is

39:04.400 --> 39:05.400
Berkeley

39:05.400 --> 39:06.400
Lawrence

39:06.400 --> 39:07.400
Lab.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.400
He

39:08.400 --> 39:09.400
has done

39:09.400 --> 39:10.400
a lot of

39:10.400 --> 39:11.400
liquid experiments.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.400
Didn't

39:12.400 --> 39:13.400
they say

39:13.400 --> 39:14.400
to wrap

39:14.400 --> 39:15.400
things up

39:15.400 --> 39:16.400
with

39:16.400 --> 39:17.400
graphene?

39:17.400 --> 39:18.400
That's

39:18.400 --> 39:19.400
also a

39:19.400 --> 39:20.400
method,

39:20.400 --> 39:21.400
but

39:21.400 --> 39:22.400
you

39:22.400 --> 39:23.400
think about it

39:23.400 --> 39:24.400
yourself,

39:24.400 --> 39:25.400
it's

39:25.400 --> 39:26.400
really in the

39:26.400 --> 39:27.400
liquid environment.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.400
The graphene

39:28.400 --> 39:29.400
you just

39:29.400 --> 39:30.400
talked about is

39:30.400 --> 39:31.400
also a method,

39:31.400 --> 39:32.400
but the

39:32.400 --> 39:33.400
current mainstream

39:33.400 --> 39:34.400
is to

39:34.400 --> 39:35.400
use a

39:35.400 --> 39:36.400
special

39:36.400 --> 39:37.400
microwave holder

39:37.400 --> 39:38.400
.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.400
You can

39:39.400 --> 39:40.400
really put

39:40.400 --> 39:41.400
liquid in

39:41.400 --> 39:42.400
.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.400
Generally

39:43.400 --> 39:44.400
it is

39:44.400 --> 39:45.400
silicon nitride.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.400
OK,

39:46.400 --> 39:47.400
so it

39:47.400 --> 39:48.400
is also

39:48.400 --> 39:49.400
silicon nitride.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.400
Thank

39:50.400 --> 39:51.400
you.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
The

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
other one

39:53.400 --> 39:54.400
is

39:54.400 --> 39:55.400
lithium

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
atom.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.400
Everyone

39:57.400 --> 39:58.400
is studying

39:58.400 --> 39:59.400
lithium

39:59.400 --> 40:00.400
atoms.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.400
Our

40:01.400 --> 40:02.400
department

40:02.400 --> 40:03.400
originally

40:03.400 --> 40:04.400
studied

40:04.400 --> 40:05.400
ceramics.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.400
He just

40:06.400 --> 40:07.400
thought

40:07.400 --> 40:08.400
lithium

40:08.400 --> 40:09.400
atoms were

40:09.400 --> 40:10.400
quite

40:10.400 --> 40:11.400
interesting,

40:11.400 --> 40:12.400
so he

40:12.400 --> 40:13.400
used

40:13.400 --> 40:14.400
ABF

40:14.400 --> 40:15.400
as I

40:15.400 --> 40:16.400
just

40:16.400 --> 40:17.400
said.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.400
We

40:18.400 --> 40:19.400
developed a

40:19.400 --> 40:20.400
method

40:20.400 --> 40:21.400
to look at

40:21.400 --> 40:22.400
lithium

40:22.400 --> 40:23.400
atoms.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.400
But

40:24.400 --> 40:25.400
if you

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
charge it,

40:26.400 --> 40:27.400
it will

40:27.400 --> 40:28.400
run out

40:28.400 --> 40:29.400
if you

40:29.400 --> 40:30.400
don't

40:30.400 --> 40:31.400
see it.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.400
Then

40:32.400 --> 40:33.400
you can

40:33.400 --> 40:34.400
come in

40:34.400 --> 40:35.400
by

40:35.400 --> 40:36.400
health

40:36.400 --> 40:37.400
charging.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.400
Then

40:38.400 --> 40:39.400
you can

40:39.400 --> 40:40.400
judge

40:40.400 --> 40:41.400
it by

40:41.400 --> 40:42.400
intensity

40:42.400 --> 40:43.400
.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.400
If

40:44.400 --> 40:45.400
you are

40:45.400 --> 40:46.400
studying

40:46.400 --> 40:47.400
lithium

40:47.400 --> 40:48.400
atoms,

40:48.400 --> 40:49.400
the

40:49.400 --> 40:50.400
current

40:50.400 --> 40:51.400
microwave

40:51.400 --> 40:52.400
will

40:52.400 --> 40:53.400
run out

40:53.400 --> 40:54.400
if you

40:54.400 --> 40:55.400
don't

40:55.400 --> 40:56.400
charge

40:56.400 --> 40:57.400
it.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.400
So

40:58.400 --> 40:59.400
that's

40:59.400 --> 41:00.400
why we

41:00.400 --> 41:01.400
don't

41:01.400 --> 41:02.400
need

41:02.400 --> 41:03.400
lithium

41:03.400 --> 41:04.400
atom

41:04.400 --> 41:05.400
technology.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.400
Yes.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.400
Finally,

41:07.400 --> 41:08.400
I'm not

41:08.400 --> 41:09.400
sure how

41:09.400 --> 41:10.400
many people

41:10.400 --> 41:11.400
are

41:11.400 --> 41:12.400
interested

41:12.400 --> 41:13.400
in

41:13.400 --> 41:14.400
magnetic

41:14.400 --> 41:15.400
and

41:15.400 --> 41:16.400
electrical

41:16.400 --> 41:17.400
fields.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.400
This

41:18.400 --> 41:19.400
has nothing

41:19.400 --> 41:20.400
to do

41:20.400 --> 41:21.400
with

41:21.400 --> 41:22.400
electrical

41:22.400 --> 41:23.400
or magnetic

41:23.400 --> 41:24.400
fields.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.400
Electrical

41:25.400 --> 41:26.400
fields will

41:26.400 --> 41:27.400
tell you

41:27.400 --> 41:28.400
the direction

41:28.400 --> 41:29.400
of the magnetic

41:29.400 --> 41:30.400
field.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.400
In the

41:31.400 --> 41:32.400
past,

41:32.400 --> 41:33.400
if you

41:33.400 --> 41:34.400
only had

41:34.400 --> 41:35.400
one detector

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
and

41:36.400 --> 41:37.400
didn't

41:37.400 --> 41:38.400
have a

41:38.400 --> 41:39.400
block,

41:39.400 --> 41:40.400
you

41:40.400 --> 41:41.400
couldn't

41:41.400 --> 41:42.400
tell

41:42.400 --> 41:43.400
the

41:43.400 --> 41:44.400
magnetic

41:44.400 --> 41:45.400
field

41:45.400 --> 41:46.400
or

41:46.400 --> 41:47.400
magnetic

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
field

41:48.400 --> 41:49.400
from

41:49.400 --> 41:50.400
the

41:50.400 --> 41:51.400
other

41:51.400 --> 41:52.400
detectors.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.400
So

41:53.400 --> 41:54.400
if you

41:54.400 --> 41:55.400
only had

41:55.400 --> 41:56.400
one

41:56.400 --> 41:57.400
detector and

41:57.400 --> 41:58.400
didn't

41:58.400 --> 41:59.400
have a

41:59.400 --> 42:00.400
block,

42:00.400 --> 42:01.400
you

42:01.400 --> 42:02.400
couldn't

42:02.400 --> 42:03.400
tell

42:03.400 --> 42:04.400
the

42:04.400 --> 42:05.400
magnetic

42:05.400 --> 42:06.400
field

42:06.400 --> 42:07.400
or

42:07.400 --> 42:08.400
magnetic

42:08.400 --> 42:09.400
field

42:09.400 --> 42:10.400
from

42:10.400 --> 42:11.400
the

42:11.400 --> 42:12.400
other

42:12.400 --> 42:13.400
detectors.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.400
So

42:14.400 --> 42:15.400
if you

42:15.400 --> 42:16.400
only had

42:16.400 --> 42:17.400
one

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
detector

42:18.400 --> 42:19.400
and

42:19.400 --> 42:20.400
didn't

42:20.400 --> 42:21.400
have a

42:21.400 --> 42:22.400
block,

42:22.400 --> 42:23.400
you

42:23.400 --> 42:24.400
couldn't

42:24.400 --> 42:25.400
tell

42:25.400 --> 42:26.400
the

42:26.400 --> 42:27.400
magnetic

42:27.400 --> 42:28.400
field

42:28.400 --> 42:29.400
or

42:29.400 --> 42:30.400
magnetic

42:30.400 --> 42:31.400
field

42:31.400 --> 42:32.400
from

42:32.400 --> 42:33.400
the

42:33.400 --> 42:34.400
other

42:34.400 --> 42:35.400
detectors.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.400
So

42:36.400 --> 42:37.400
if you

42:37.400 --> 42:38.400
only had

42:38.400 --> 42:39.400
one

42:39.400 --> 42:40.400
detector

42:40.400 --> 42:41.400
and

42:41.400 --> 42:42.400
didn't

42:42.400 --> 42:43.400
have a

42:43.400 --> 42:44.400
block,

42:44.400 --> 42:45.400
you

42:45.400 --> 42:46.400
couldn't

42:46.400 --> 42:47.400
tell

42:47.400 --> 42:48.400
the

42:48.400 --> 42:49.400
magnetic

42:49.400 --> 42:50.400
field

42:50.400 --> 42:51.400
from

42:51.400 --> 42:52.400
the

42:52.400 --> 42:53.400
other

42:53.400 --> 42:54.400
detectors.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.400
So

42:55.400 --> 42:56.400
if you

42:56.400 --> 42:57.400
only had

42:57.400 --> 42:58.400
one

42:58.400 --> 42:59.400
detector and

42:59.400 --> 43:00.400
didn't

43:00.400 --> 43:01.400
have a

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
block,

43:02.400 --> 43:03.400
you

43:03.400 --> 43:04.400
couldn't

43:04.400 --> 43:05.400
tell

43:05.400 --> 43:06.400
the

43:06.400 --> 43:07.400
magnetic

43:07.400 --> 43:08.400
field

43:08.400 --> 43:09.400
from

43:09.400 --> 43:10.400
the

43:10.400 --> 43:11.400
other

43:11.400 --> 43:12.400
detectors.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.400
So

43:13.400 --> 43:14.400
if you

43:14.400 --> 43:15.400
only had

43:15.400 --> 43:16.400
one

43:16.400 --> 43:17.400
detector

43:17.400 --> 43:18.400
and

43:18.400 --> 43:19.400
didn't

43:19.400 --> 43:20.400
have a

43:20.400 --> 43:21.400
block,

43:21.400 --> 43:22.400
you

43:22.400 --> 43:23.400
couldn't

43:23.400 --> 43:24.400
tell the

43:24.400 --> 43:25.400
magnetic

43:25.400 --> 43:26.400
field

43:26.400 --> 43:27.400
from

43:27.400 --> 43:28.400
the

43:28.400 --> 43:29.400
other

43:29.400 --> 43:30.400
detectors.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.400
So

43:31.400 --> 43:32.400
if you

43:32.400 --> 43:33.400
only had

43:33.400 --> 43:34.400
one

43:34.400 --> 43:35.400
detector and

43:35.400 --> 43:36.400
didn't

43:36.400 --> 43:37.400
have a

43:37.400 --> 43:38.400
block,

43:38.400 --> 43:39.400
you

43:39.400 --> 43:40.400
couldn't

43:40.400 --> 43:41.400
tell the

43:41.400 --> 43:42.400
magnetic

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
field

43:43.400 --> 43:44.400
from

43:44.400 --> 43:45.400
the

43:45.400 --> 43:46.400
other

43:46.400 --> 43:47.400
detectors.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.400
So

43:48.400 --> 43:49.400
if you

43:49.400 --> 43:50.400
only had

43:50.400 --> 43:51.400
one

43:51.400 --> 43:52.400
detector and

43:52.400 --> 43:53.400
didn't

43:55.400 --> 43:56.400
you

43:56.400 --> 43:57.400
couldn't

43:57.400 --> 43:58.400
tell the

44:00.400 --> 44:01.400
from

44:01.400 --> 44:02.400
the other

44:02.400 --> 44:03.400

44:03.400 --> 44:04.400
So

44:04.400 --> 44:05.400
if you

44:05.400 --> 44:06.400
only had

44:06.400 --> 44:07.400

from

the other

44:18.400 --> 44:19.400

44:19.400 --> 44:20.400
So

44:20.400 --> 44:21.400
if you

44:21.400 --> 44:22.400
only had

44:22.400 --> 44:23.400

44:27.400 --> 44:28.400
you

from

the other

44:34.400 --> 44:35.400

44:35.400 --> 44:36.400
So

44:36.400 --> 44:37.400
if you

44:37.400 --> 44:38.400
only had

44:38.400 --> 44:39.400

44:43.400 --> 44:44.400

from

the other

44:50.400 --> 44:51.400

44:51.400 --> 44:52.400
So

44:52.400 --> 44:53.400
if you

44:53.400 --> 44:54.400
only had

44:54.400 --> 44:55.400
one

44:59.400 --> 45:00.400

the other

45:07.400 --> 45:08.400
So

45:08.400 --> 45:09.400
if you

only had

45:10.400 --> 45:11.400

the other

45:23.400 --> 45:24.400
So

45:24.400 --> 45:25.400
if you

45:31.400 --> 45:32.400
you

couldn't

from

the other

45:38.400 --> 45:39.400

45:39.400 --> 45:40.400
So

45:40.400 --> 45:41.400
if you

only had

45:42.400 --> 45:43.400

the other

45:54.400 --> 45:55.400

45:55.400 --> 45:56.400
So

45:56.400 --> 45:57.400
if you

only had

45:58.400 --> 45:59.400

the other

46:11.400 --> 46:12.400
So

46:12.400 --> 46:13.400
if you

only had

46:14.400 --> 46:15.400

the other

46:26.400 --> 46:27.400

46:27.400 --> 46:28.400
So

46:28.400 --> 46:29.400
if you

46:29.400 --> 46:30.400
only had

46:30.400 --> 46:31.400
one

46:32.400 --> 46:33.400
didn't

have a

46:35.400 --> 46:36.400
you

couldn't

from

the other

46:42.400 --> 46:43.400

46:43.400 --> 46:44.400
So

46:44.400 --> 46:45.400
if you

46:45.400 --> 46:46.400
only had

46:46.400 --> 46:47.400
one

46:48.400 --> 46:49.400
didn't

46:49.400 --> 46:50.400
have a

46:51.400 --> 46:52.400
you

couldn't

from

the other

46:58.400 --> 46:59.400

46:59.400 --> 47:00.400
So

47:00.400 --> 47:01.400
if you

47:01.400 --> 47:02.400
only had

47:02.400 --> 47:03.400
one

47:03.400 --> 47:04.400

47:04.400 --> 47:05.400
didn't

47:05.400 --> 47:06.400
have a

47:07.400 --> 47:08.400
you

couldn't

from

the other

47:14.400 --> 47:15.400
detectors.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.400
So

47:16.400 --> 47:17.400
if you

47:17.400 --> 47:18.400
only had

47:18.400 --> 47:19.400
one

47:19.400 --> 47:20.400

47:20.400 --> 47:21.400
didn't

47:21.400 --> 47:22.400
have a

47:23.400 --> 47:24.400
you

47:24.400 --> 47:25.400
couldn't

47:25.400 --> 47:26.400
tell the

47:28.400 --> 47:29.400
from

47:29.400 --> 47:30.400
the other

47:30.400 --> 47:31.400
detectors.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.400
So

47:32.400 --> 47:33.400
if you

47:33.400 --> 47:34.400
only had

47:34.400 --> 47:35.400
one

47:35.400 --> 47:36.400
detector and

47:36.400 --> 47:37.400
didn't

47:37.400 --> 47:38.400
have a

47:38.400 --> 47:39.400
block,

47:39.400 --> 47:40.400
you

47:40.400 --> 47:41.400
couldn't

47:41.400 --> 47:42.400
tell the

47:42.400 --> 47:43.400
magnetic

47:43.400 --> 47:44.400
field

47:44.400 --> 47:45.400
from

47:45.400 --> 47:46.400
the other

47:46.400 --> 47:47.400
detectors.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.400
So

47:48.400 --> 47:49.400
if you

47:49.400 --> 47:50.400
only had

47:50.400 --> 47:51.400
one

47:51.400 --> 47:52.400
detector and

47:52.400 --> 47:53.400
didn't

47:53.400 --> 47:54.400
have a

47:54.400 --> 47:55.400
block,

47:55.400 --> 47:56.400
you

47:56.400 --> 47:57.400
couldn't

47:57.400 --> 47:58.400
tell the

47:58.400 --> 47:59.400
magnetic

47:59.400 --> 48:00.400
field

48:00.400 --> 48:01.400
from

48:01.400 --> 48:02.400
the other

48:02.400 --> 48:03.400
detectors.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.400
So

48:04.400 --> 48:05.400
if you

48:05.400 --> 48:06.400
only had

48:06.400 --> 48:07.400
one

48:07.400 --> 48:08.400
detector and

48:08.400 --> 48:09.400
didn't

48:09.400 --> 48:10.400
have a

48:10.400 --> 48:11.400
block,

48:11.400 --> 48:12.400
you

48:12.400 --> 48:13.400
couldn't

48:13.400 --> 48:14.400
tell the

48:14.400 --> 48:15.400
magnetic

48:15.400 --> 48:16.400
field

48:16.400 --> 48:17.400
from

48:17.400 --> 48:18.400
the other

48:18.400 --> 48:19.400
detectors.

48:19.400 --> 48:20.400
So

48:20.400 --> 48:21.400
spectroscopy

48:21.400 --> 48:22.400
is very

48:22.400 --> 48:23.400
important.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.400
Of course

48:24.400 --> 48:25.400
my time

48:25.400 --> 48:26.400
is very

48:26.400 --> 48:27.400
limited,

48:27.400 --> 48:28.400
but

48:28.400 --> 48:29.400
I can

48:29.400 --> 48:30.400
simply

48:30.400 --> 48:31.400
say that

48:31.400 --> 48:32.400
EOS

48:32.400 --> 48:33.400
is usually

48:33.400 --> 48:34.400
at the

48:34.400 --> 48:35.400
bottom

48:35.400 --> 48:36.400
of

48:36.400 --> 48:37.400
the

48:37.400 --> 48:38.400
sample.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.400
So

48:39.400 --> 48:40.400
EOS

48:40.400 --> 48:41.400
is

48:41.400 --> 48:42.400
basically

48:42.400 --> 48:43.400
IR

48:43.400 --> 48:44.400
plus

48:44.400 --> 48:45.400
Raman

48:45.400 --> 48:46.400
plus

48:46.400 --> 48:47.400
UPS

48:47.400 --> 48:48.400
plus

48:48.400 --> 48:49.400
angle

48:49.400 --> 48:50.400
reserve

48:50.400 --> 48:51.400
plus

48:51.400 --> 48:52.400
apex

48:52.400 --> 48:53.400
plus

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
XAS

48:54.400 --> 48:55.400
XAS

48:55.400 --> 48:56.400
XAS

48:56.400 --> 48:57.400
XAS

52:32.400 --> 52:33.400
XAS

52:33.400 --> 53:02.400
XAS

53:02.400 --> 53:10.400
In many of the blue squares, I have 5 to 6 hands.

53:10.400 --> 53:15.400
This can tell you a lot about the nature of glass.

53:15.400 --> 53:23.400
It can also tell you, for example, how many 5 or 6 hands you have on a point.

53:23.400 --> 53:28.400
It will affect the nature of glass.

53:28.400 --> 53:35.400
This is basically the information you can get from the structure map.

53:35.400 --> 53:43.400
Other than that, I don't know, maybe a lot of people are interested in Transition Metal.

53:43.400 --> 53:48.400
For example, you can have a 2-frame mesh and a 3-frame mesh.

53:48.400 --> 53:54.400
If you just look at the image or the deflection, you can't tell.

53:54.400 --> 54:00.400
But if you use EOS, you will find that the light source is in a different position.

54:00.400 --> 54:05.400
If we don't mention the calculation, this is what it looks like in practice.

54:05.400 --> 54:08.400
You have two atoms here, one is A and the other is B.

54:08.400 --> 54:12.400
Then you also look at MnL2Cag.

54:12.400 --> 54:19.400
You will find that the light source of EOS will change slightly between different atoms.

54:19.400 --> 54:33.400
If you use EOS to calculate, you will find that the light source of 2Cag is in the middle, and the light source of 3Cag is outside.

54:33.400 --> 54:37.400
This can tell you a lot of information.

54:37.400 --> 54:44.400
In addition to knowing the location of the light source, you can also know the oxidation state of the light source.

54:45.400 --> 54:50.400
Some EOS can even tell you if there is a transfer of electrons.

54:50.400 --> 54:57.400
So far, this is basically what everyone is doing.

54:57.400 --> 55:02.400
Doing this in practice is actually quite simple.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.400
If you are interested, you can try it yourself.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.400
In fact, this is not that difficult.

55:08.400 --> 55:13.400
This is basically the most common application of Coros.

55:13.400 --> 55:18.400
It's like this, 2Cag, 3Cag, 4Cag, this kind of balance state mapping.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.400
Let me make a simple comparison here.

55:23.400 --> 55:29.400
The EOS I just talked about is actually XAS, X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.400
In fact, it is very similar to the EOS function.

55:31.400 --> 55:34.400
But their energy boundaries are not quite the same.

55:34.400 --> 55:39.400
X-ray absorption is basically greater than the energy of 2KeV.

55:39.400 --> 55:43.400
EOS is basically 1mEV to 10KeV.

55:43.400 --> 55:47.400
The energy resolution is not much different now.

55:47.400 --> 55:53.400
But if you add the non-committer, the latest EOS record can be up to 3mEV.

55:53.400 --> 55:57.400
You can use it to study the body.

55:57.400 --> 56:00.400
But the spatial resolution is very different.

56:00.400 --> 56:06.400
The spatial resolution of XAS is about 50nm to micrometer.

56:06.400 --> 56:10.400
In the case of EOS, you can go to angstrom to nanometer.

56:12.400 --> 56:17.400
So if you are more interested in some nanometers,

56:17.400 --> 56:21.400
you can consider doing an EOS experiment.

56:21.400 --> 56:24.400
Then you can compare it with Bokeh.

56:25.400 --> 56:31.400
The second section I want to talk about is the VALENCE section.

56:31.400 --> 56:34.400
It is more about the transfer of light and snow.

56:34.400 --> 56:38.400
You can think of it as the energy obtained in this section.

56:38.400 --> 56:43.400
In fact, it has something to do with your relay parameters.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.400
This is a raw data.

56:45.400 --> 56:50.400
If you do fitting, you will find that there are different peaks in this fitting.

56:51.400 --> 56:58.400
Some of them come from PLASMO, some of them come from the interband transition.

56:58.400 --> 57:05.400
You may know that the VALENCE band is usually at the top and the CONDUCTION band is at the bottom.

57:05.400 --> 57:12.400
This is the definition of the band gap between LUMO and LUMO.

57:12.400 --> 57:16.400
If you use EOS, you can do the same thing.

57:17.400 --> 57:21.400
We don't have time to go through the SURFACE PLASMO.

57:21.400 --> 57:33.400
What I think is more interesting is that we can measure the band gap of some interfaces in some very special materials.

57:33.400 --> 57:37.400
For example, the material here is actually oxidized aluminum.

57:37.400 --> 57:42.400
Oxidized aluminum has different angles in the oxidized aluminum of polyethylene.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.400
This is a metal defect.

57:44.400 --> 57:51.400
If you measure its EOS, you will find that the black one is Bokeh.

57:51.400 --> 57:53.400
Bokeh is basically the same.

57:53.400 --> 57:59.400
But you will find that the red one has two band gaps in this interface.

57:59.400 --> 58:02.400
In fact, each one is different.

58:02.400 --> 58:04.400
You can analyze it.

58:04.400 --> 58:08.400
For example, in the interface, your band gap becomes 6.7.

58:08.400 --> 58:09.400
Originally it was 8.8.

58:09.400 --> 58:13.400
What impact will this matter to your material quality?

58:13.400 --> 58:18.400
You can also analyze how the interface will have a lower band gap.

58:18.400 --> 58:21.400
How do you control this?

58:21.400 --> 58:26.400
If you are a semiconductor person, this is very interesting.

58:26.400 --> 58:30.400
Because you can measure a lot of interfaces in your software.

58:30.400 --> 58:33.400
Is it good or bad for you?

58:34.400 --> 58:38.400
I also think that the band gap measurement is not that simple.

58:38.400 --> 58:43.400
But basically, EOS instruments can do this.

58:43.400 --> 58:47.400
You can try it.

58:47.400 --> 58:53.400
The last section is Valence EOS.

58:53.400 --> 58:55.400
This section is a special one.

58:55.400 --> 58:59.400
It is interesting that it can measure temperature.

58:59.400 --> 59:09.400
The principle is to use Profile Fitting to feed PLASMON's energy.

59:09.400 --> 59:12.400
Because its energy is related to the density of the electrode.

59:12.400 --> 59:15.400
So if you change the temperature, the density of the electrode will change.

59:15.400 --> 59:18.400
You can measure the temperature.

59:18.400 --> 59:27.400
This diagram is a very simple temperature mapping.

59:27.400 --> 59:30.400
This material is aluminum.

59:30.400 --> 59:35.400
I'm not sure if it's a wet electrode or a wet electrode.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.400
It should be a wet electrode.

59:37.400 --> 59:42.400
You can see the temperature change in the aluminum.

59:42.400 --> 59:45.400
Of course, it's not that simple.

59:45.400 --> 59:48.400
But it can still be done.

59:48.400 --> 59:51.400
This is the part of measuring temperature.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.400
I've been doing it recently.

59:54.400 --> 59:56.400
It's a bit like what I just said.

59:56.400 --> 01:00:02.400
I'm going to measure the EOS changes in the interface.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.400
It's not the same as the above.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
I'm going to measure thermal expansion.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.400
If you're interested, we can discuss it next.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.400
Can I ask a question?

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400
Yes.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:22.400
Can you go back to the aluminum diagram?

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400
The temperature next to you is almost normal.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.400
Can you make it a little warmer?

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.400
Can you make it very low?

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.400
You mean low temperature?

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400
Low enough that it doesn't overheat.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400
It's less than 1K.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.400
I think it should be physically possible.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.400
Because the way it gets the temperature is

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:47.400
Simply put, if you look at the peak shift of Plasmon Peak,

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:52.400
You can see how much the electronic density has changed.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.400
If you get low temperature,

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.400
You may also know how low it is.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.400
But in the electronic microscope,

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.400
It's easier to heat than to get low temperature.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.400
So most people do thermal experiments.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.400
Very few people do low temperature experiments.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.400
Can I say something?

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400
Yes.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.400
Basically, I don't think you should say this in this picture.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.400
Because I've talked to the author about this.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:28.400
This sample itself is a silicon nitride membrane.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400
To carve out these patterns.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.400
So when you're doing this experiment,

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.400
There's a big problem.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.400
You're heating it up at the same time.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.400
What you're looking at now is the shift of EOS.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.400
It's actually bound to your silicon nitride substrate.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.400
That is, you're not a freestanding aluminum wire.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.400
So it's hard to say how big it is.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.400
Back to the question just now.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.400
If you put this sample in a liquid nitrogen holder,

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.400
You can look at it after it's cooled down.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.400
So you can also put it in a heating holder.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.400
You can also heat it up.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.400
So if you want to know the temperature range,

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.400
It's possible.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.400
Yes.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.400
Thank you.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.400
I don't know much about this sample.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.400
Because he's been here before.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.400
So he was very polite.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.400
That's what his structure is like.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.400
Because all of our papers.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400
Science papers here.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.400
We all thought he was a freestanding aluminum wire.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.400
But what he said was that there was supporting underneath.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:40.400
So you go and look at the slice in front of you.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.400
The slice in front of you.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.400
Why is the temperature change so big?

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.400
That's why it shifts so little.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.400
You're not a freestanding sample.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.400
You don't know how reliable this knife is.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.400
And your error is 0.06 electron volt.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.400
Your resolution is only 0.03.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400
Then you have two pixels.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:09.400
I think this experiment is actually quite risky.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.400
Because you don't know where the error comes from.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.400
So basically, we think it's more reliable than three pixels.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.400
I see.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:26.400
Because this paper actually has a lot of citations.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.400
There are a lot of people who do something later.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.400
Or look at some things.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.400
Because if you're a freestanding sample.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400
It makes a lot of sense if you measure it.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.400
But you're supporting.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.400
Like a sandwich.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.400
If the heat expansion coefficient below is very poor.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.400
It's very different from the temperature above.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.400
Then you might have a similar effect.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.400
Then you can't measure what the real thing should be like.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.400
I see.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400
After we heard the speech that day.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.400
Why do you have to wrap that layer underneath?

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.400
But I didn't really measure the temperature myself.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.400
In my case, I always let the temperature be very warm.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.400
If it's in this situation.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400
Then what I measured is.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.400
The change in electron density comes from heat expansion.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.400
Of course, this is also a new paper recently.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.400
Then I'm also trying to see if I can.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.400
I'm actually not very clear right now.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.400
You are now.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400
You slice like this.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400
Sorry, until the next experiment.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.400
You slice this.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.400
Because of your.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.400
You are because the temperature is different.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.400
Then look at the energy of PLASMA is different.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.400
You are now.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.400
I let everything be PLASMA.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.400
Everything.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400
This sample itself.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.400
The temperature has become the same.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400
I went to see the interface.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.400
With Bulk.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.400
His.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.400
The change in heat expansion.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.400
But the two pictures below you.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.400
Is there a temperature change?

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.400
This is the temperature here.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.400
This is after you fix a temperature.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.400
After reading it, change it to the next temperature.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.400
Yes, this is a very tiring experiment.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.400
But we've been trying it lately.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.400
Because the first paper to do heat expansion.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.400
Is in the secondary material.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.400
Then we did it ourselves.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.400
A ceramic traditional material.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.400
Try it out.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.400
Can they be used in traditional materials?

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.400
Above.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.400
I can't tell you now.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.400
Is it good or bad?

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
But I can tell you.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.400
I really have two.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.400
I understand.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400
I just said you were processing this data.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.400
Have you ever done the so-called.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.400
How to say.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.400
Uh.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.400
Consider your thickness.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.400
Because thickness.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.400
You speak very well.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.400
Because.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.400
Because in fact.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.400
When you do this.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.400
You can go to one by the way.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.400
Anyway, the area you are in now.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.400
You can do the thickness.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.400
Maybe you are now.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.400
After fitting.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.400
After decoupling.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.400
You can do the analysis later.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Then a point is.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.400
I am in the thick area.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.400
The heat expansion of the two areas is different.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.400
I mean.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.400
It doesn't matter if you are thick.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.400
Because as long as you take a full score.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400
You can do decoupling.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.400
After decoupling.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.400
In fact, you are using decoupling data.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.400
To do these.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.400
Plasma energy fitting.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.400
Maybe what you see.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.400
It may be the same as now.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.400
It should be said that all the data.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.400
I have done it.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.400
It's the backlight.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.400
But my own data.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.400
In the thick area and the thin area.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.400
This.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.400
The change in the heat expansion factor.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.400
In fact, more should be related to quantum.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.400
It's the same in the past.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.400
Not necessarily.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.400
If you are thin today.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.400
The area is less than 40 nanometers.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.400
The data you make now.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.400
I don't know how thick it is.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.400
But.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.400
For you to do this experiment.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.400
I would prefer to say.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.400
You are probably 40 to 80 nanometers.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.400
The thickness is the most perfect.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.400
Because below 40 nanometers.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.400
You will be more serious.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.400
So all of you.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.400
You think the peak of Bulk Plasma.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.400
Will shift to low energy.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.400
When you have high energy.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.400
You are after multiple scattering.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.400
You may.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.400
You may have to do a lot of processing.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.400
With your average thickness.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.400
For example, 40 to 80 nanometers.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.400
Maybe a little worse.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.400
But not so much worse.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.400
So I think you can consider.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.400
You are now in these two areas.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.400
What you marked.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.400
Is the thickness.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.400
In fact, you can calculate.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.400
What is the thickness?

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.400
How many lambda?

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.400
I can tell you.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.400
This is about 80 nanometers.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.400
This is about 20 nanometers.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.400
Because you have too many surface effects.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.400
So the energy you are doing now.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.400
You have to consider the surface plasma.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.400
Not your own Bulk.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.400
If you have a vacuum area.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.400
If you have a vacuum area.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.400
You just sweep past like this.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.400
You can know your whole.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.400
You want to identify.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.400
Is the location of the Bulk Plasma shifted?

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.400
Then you know.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.400
Your thinnest place.

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.400
The location of the energy you originally expected.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.400
There is a deviation.

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.400
We can discuss this later.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.400
Thank you very much for your comment.

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.400
I really don't know.

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.400
What you said above.

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.400
I don't really know.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.400
What you just said.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.400
Basically,

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.400
Valence.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.400
I want to talk about this.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.400
Finally, I want to add.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.400
There is a new technology called Vibrational Yields.

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.400
That is also.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.400
It was probably released in 2014.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.400
It is a piece.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.400
Its paper is.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.400
Look at the optical phonon of boron nitride.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.400
We ourselves.

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.400
In 2014.

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.400
Most of the time.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.400
Look at the CH vibration of ionic liquid.

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.400
At that time, many people felt.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.400
This is a mess.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.400
But so.

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.400
We basically published it at the same time.

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.400
Then you can be sure.

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.400
The optical phonon of boron nitride.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.400
You can see the phonon and the vibration.

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.400
A more popular method now.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.400
It actually uses a model called.

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.400
You don't put the disease.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.400
On top of your sample.

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.400
But outside the sample.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.400
This mechanism.

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.400
It interprets.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.400
It's all double scattering.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.400
But they mean.

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.400
Your double scattering.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.400
It's a signal.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.400
The middle one.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.400
It's more detailed.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.400
Some people say it's virtual photon.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.400
But this part.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.400
I really don't understand.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.400
What are they talking about?

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.400
But simply put.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.400
You put the electron outside the sample.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.400
In a specific position.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.400
You can actually detect.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.400
Your vibrational signal.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.400
Through this matter.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.400
In fact, since 2015.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.400
Many people have been using this method.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.400
To study some.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.400
This should be biological.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.400
Materials.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.400
It can be.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.400
Don't destroy your sample.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.400
Detect outside.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.400
Some of your material.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.400
Vibrational mode.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.400
If you are interested.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.400
You can also look at some papers.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.400
Or do this experiment.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.400
In 2019.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.400
I think it's more.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.400
It may be a bit controversial.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.400
Quite.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.400
What people know is.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.400
Carbon-12 and carbon-13.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.400
That is, through EOS.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.400
What I just said.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.400
Since you can see.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.400
If the molecules vibrate.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400
I believe.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400
Carbon-12 and oxygen bound.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.400
Carbon-13 and oxygen bound.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.400
Their vibrational mode.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.400
In fact, it should be a bit different.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.400
That's what Oak Ridge does.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.400
You have carbon-12 particles.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.400
To do EOS.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.400
To distinguish these two.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.400
Basically, they are using profile fitting.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.400
To distinguish these two.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.400
Because now.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.400
The resolution at this time in 2019.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.400
Neon's system is about.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.400
5 mV.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400
So they can distinguish.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.400
Carbon-13 and carbon-12.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.400
If you are interested.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400
Oak Ridge has been doing this experiment.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.400
I am.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.400
I am actually.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.400
Take it to study my glass.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.400
Because in my glass.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.400
There are two-handed oxygen and three-handed oxygen.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.400
Two-handed oxygen and three-handed oxygen.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.400
General XAS.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.400
Or other.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.400
In fact, it is difficult to see the difference.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.400
My glass also has.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.400
Silicon Ridge and Aluminum Ridge.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.400
I can clearly know.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.400
What kind of structure I see.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400
So I really go to study.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.400
What is the difference.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.400
What is the difference.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.400
If you do profile fitting.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.400
You will probably find it.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.400
About 10 mV.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.400
Then you can do some more analysis.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.400
Tell you.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.400
In the end, what you see.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.400
Is it really from this oxygen coordination?

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.400
Change.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400
Or something from the hardware.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.400
This is my own recent.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.400
On Vibrational EOS.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.400
Some research results.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.400
If it is possible.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.400
More people will be interested.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.400
In fact.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.400
Is this kind of Momentum Resolve.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.400
Vibrational EOS.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.400
In 2019.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.400
Basically, some people started to study.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.400
Since I can see the rope.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.400
Then I also want to study.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.400
This kind of phonon dispersion.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.400
Is that you change the Q-vector.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.400
You put your beam.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.400
Like other.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.400
Not directly on your.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.400
Spectrometer.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.400
If you give it a Q-vector.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.400
Momentum transfer.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.400
You can see.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.400
This kind of phonon dispersion.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.400
This picture is made in Japan.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.400
To get this kind of experiment.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.400
Suenaga.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.400
They said they did it.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.400
More than 60 hours.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.400
But this year.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.400
In 2020.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.400
Two months ago.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.400
Microsociety.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.400
He studied.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.400
Is that you are.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.400
On the original spectrometer.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.400
Add a layer.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.400
You will get a lot at the same time.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.400
Different Q-point.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.400
EOS.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.400
In 2019.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.400
You have to do.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.400
60 hours of such an experiment.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.400
You use Neon's instrument.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.400
With the latest method.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.400
Can be done in 10 minutes.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.400
If you are.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.400
This kind of nanometer.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.400
If you are interested.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.400
You can check it out.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.400
In the end.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.400
It will become.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.400
Electromagnetists.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.400
Want to do atomic wave solution.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.400
In 2020.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.400
Recently.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.400
He also did something like this.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.400
Silicon on graphene.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.400
He went to see.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.400
His surrounding atoms.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.400
Spectra of each atom.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.400
Every one.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.400
Of course it is a very difficult experiment.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.400
But they are also using.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.400
Very high Q-vector.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.400
To see this kind of spectra.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400
So you can make sure.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.400
Detected signals.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.400
All come from a single atom.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.400
I'm not sure.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.400
How simple is this experiment.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.400
How complicated.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.400
Or where is its accuracy.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.400
But this is the current field.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.400
The latest research results.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.400
If you are interested.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.400
In the end.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.400
The information you really want to bring home.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.400
In fact.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.400
Electromagnetism is not just a magnifying glass.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.400
Although many people think so.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.400
Modern STEM fields.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.400
Is a very powerful tool.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.400
If you want to do.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.400
The experiments I just mentioned.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.400
You can choose some open facilities.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.400
Like Oak Ridge.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.400
Molecular foundry.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.400
Berkeley.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.400
ERC in Germany.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.400
STEM in the UK.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.400
Nanotechnology platform in Japan.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.400
You can apply for some.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.400
You can write your proposal.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.400
To apply for time.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.400
Then do such an experiment.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.400
The above is probably.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.400
Today's content.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.400
If I am also in.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.400
I want to do more glass recently.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.400
Then there are some.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.400
Is the MOF glass.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.400
Or the glass on the secondary material.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.400
If there is such a similar sample.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.400
Thank you.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.400
Thank you for the speech.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.400
Very complete.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.400
Let's applaud first.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.400
Thank you for his speech.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.400
Then.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400
Let's go straight to the question.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.400
Because the time seems to have passed.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.400
Sorry.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.400
It doesn't matter.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.400
To add.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400
This is a thing called paradigm.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.400
Also throw proposal.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.400
Then we can do the experiment for you.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.400
Cornell.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.400
You mean.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.400
You can also do this.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.400
Yes.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.400
Thank you.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.400
Yes.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.400
If.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.400
Finally, to add.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.400
If you are very interested in 4D STEM.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.400
Like I just said.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.400
Or Berkeley.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.400
Then if you are.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.400
EOS.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.400
If you are very interested.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.400
Ocarina and Super STEM.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400
At present.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.400
Basically the best in the world.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.400
Everyone can.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.400
Take it as a priority.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.400
If everyone has no questions.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.400
I actually have a question.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.400
Sorry, you ask first.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.400
OK.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.400
This EOS.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.400
Can you measure acetone?

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.400
Because the general RPEC.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.400
The reason is because it can only measure single particles.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.400
But EOS looks like.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.400
Should be able to measure.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.400
Because it looks like.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.400
And it should be.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.400
Can also measure.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.400
Then.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.400
I have seen someone.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.400
Measure.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.400
If it is vibrational.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.400
Someone is measuring.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.400
Then.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.400
This paper.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.400
It actually mentions a little.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.400
Acetone effect.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.400
But I'm not sure.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.400
Does it have anything to do with what you said?

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.400
Because I am in this field.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.400
I know nothing about acetone.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.400
But there is also a strange question here.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.400
Why does it have a selection rule?

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.400
I just can't figure it out.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.400
Electron loss.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.400
Is there any special selection rule?

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.400
You can think of it as.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.400
Its mechanism.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.400
General EOS.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.400
It is still dipole scattering.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.400
It is basically.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.400
There is no resonant.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.400
So it follows the selection rule.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.400
That is Fermi golden rule.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.400
If it is Fermi.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.400
If it is simply Fermi golden rule.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.400
You mean.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.400
Is it like the Fermi golden rule of light and snow?

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.400
Yes.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.400
It is.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.400
Fermi golden rule of light and snow.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.400
Then.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.400
That is.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.400
According to your.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.400
Angle.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.400
It is the focus angle.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.400
And the absorption angle is different.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.400
You will see your.

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.400
EOS signal will be different.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.400
But.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.400
If it is light and snow.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.400
It should be optical phonon.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.400
It can be absorbed.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.400
Wait a minute.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.400
I confirm.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.400
Optical phonon is possible.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.400
It is IR active.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.400
Yes.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.400
But.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.400
I am looking at the paper.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.400
What I see now.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.400
The situation is.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.400
The first.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.400
You.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.400
That is.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.400
Its selection rule.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.400
It is still more like IR.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.400
We all say it is.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.400
IR optical phonon under the magnitude of nanometer.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.400
But if you put your Q vector.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.400
Move to a very high Q.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.400
Then greater than your.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.400
The first non-dimensional area.

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.400
At present.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.400
Everyone's statement is that you are like this.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.400
You can see some.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.400
The selection rule that you could not see.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.400
Yes.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.400
But.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.400
The physical content should be.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.400
The current formula is already there.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.400
But I have to go.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.400
Try to understand the formula.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.400
Yes.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.400
Can I interrupt?

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.400
Yes.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.400
You see this picture.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.400
You think of it as the simplest.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.400
If you put that to L.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.400
It is called Gamma as a starting point.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.400
Gamma to N.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.400
In the crystal structure.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.400
Facing the machine.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400
You have a different one.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.400
Can run out.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.400
This will form you.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.400
Your so-called selection rule.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.400
Come out.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.400
Do you understand what I mean?

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.400
So this picture.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.400
I saw this picture.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.400
The first impression is that it is very strange.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.400
All gray lines are theoretical calculations.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.400
All red lines are experimental data.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.400
Theoretical calculation.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.400
Gamma to N.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.400
Gamma to N.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.400
Is symmetrical.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.400
But it is not symmetrical in practice.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.400
Oh, OK.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.400
So this is when I saw this picture.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.400
The first thing I feel is.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.400
The area of ​​Plasma.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.400
Is symmetrical.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.400
But this one.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.400
Is not symmetrical.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.400
I do not know at the moment.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.400
What special things happen.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.400
The first one.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.400
This picture.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.400
As far as I know.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.400
Is done for more than 60 hours.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.400
Experimental error.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.400
Must be considered.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.400
I mean.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.400
In fact, we are doing.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.400
Momentum Resolution.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.400
Gamma to N.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.400
Gamma to N.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.400
Gamma to N.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.400
This picture is very simple.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400
It should be symmetrical.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.400
Phonon is difficult to do.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.400
This energy is very low.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.400
So it takes a long time to collect.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.400
But.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.400
I think no matter how long you are.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.400
You will calculate.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.400
The position of the real loss peak.

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.400
It must be.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.400
From one point to another.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.400
Slowly collect the data.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.400
Piled up.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.400
This is what I feel.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.400
I can not understand from the beginning.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.400
This picture is supposed to be.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.400
textbook.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.400
Or something else.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400
This energy should be symmetrical.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.400
But your experiment is not symmetrical.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.400
That's what I do not understand.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.400
I can ask.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.400
Goodman is.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.400
Please say.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.400
Your name and organization.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.400
Which one is it?

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.400
My last name is Liu.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.400
Liu Bei Liu.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.400
Thought is humble.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.400
Where are you now?

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.400
I am in the United States.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.400
Maryland University.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.400
Also specializing in EOS.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.400
I am in Taiwan.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.400
EOS.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.400
I'm just a service here.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.400
Taiwan is EOS.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.400
Is a famous teacher.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.400
I used to be in that group.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.400
I understand.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.400
What you just said.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.400
In 1970.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.400
You just mentioned.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.400
David Muller.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.400
David Muller is my teacher.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.400
John Sircus.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.400
I know.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.400
The first.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.400
I was in Taiwan University.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.400
Postal boss.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.400
He is the first doctor.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.400
So you hear now.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.400
The most famous should be David Muller.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.400
David Muller is a countdown.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.400
Before the lab shut down.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.400
Doctor.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.400
But David Muller.

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.400
He did not do EOS recently.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.400
You have one in front.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.400
Silicone dumbbell.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.400
That's called Fee Bateson.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.400
I know.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.400
The second doctor.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.400
That's it.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.400
You are familiar with Fee Bateson.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.400
Because Fee Bateson used to do.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.400
Q-dependent EOS.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.400
But not vibration.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.400
Yes.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.400
I am.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.400
Because our group does not have a device.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.400
I can only use.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.400
I can't.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.400
Do such a thing.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.400
This is actually.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.400
Because Fonon has been doing it for a long time.

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.400
So this is not expected.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.400
Because if you say Plasma.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.400
About five seconds to solve.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.400
You mean like.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.400
You just this picture.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.400
Your last picture.

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.400
This is not.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.400
It is scanned with Scanning TM.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.400
So.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.400
Your whole spectrum.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.400
What are you talking about?

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.400
How long do you scan the spectrum image?

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.400
How long will it end?

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.400
It just needs to do some.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.400
This.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.400
Processing.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.400
But before.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.400
In the John Sialkas group.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.400
What they do is Q-dependent EOS.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.400
This one came out.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.400
No need to do.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.400
At most because it used to be a photo.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.400
So at most just do.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.400
Data to identify.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.400
But it's just a picture.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.400
It's the picture you see now.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.400
It is a.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.400
It used to be a photo.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.400
But because there is no.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.400
How to say.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.400
After you take a picture.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.400
You have to put the skill bar on it.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.400
Calculate energy.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.400
So the role of Fee Patterson is.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.400
The digital computer.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.400
To put the coordinates.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.400
The number of coordinates.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.400
Then my teacher is.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.400
My teacher is a watch.

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.400
He is a computer watch.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.400
So it is.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.400
But I think the future.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.400
Momentum Resolve.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.400
This year.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.400
After he used a slide.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.400
I think that way.

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.400
Copy the most primitive way.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.400
He put a slide on it.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.400
You can do it.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.400
You can get it in 10 minutes.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.400
You can get it in a minute.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.400
His slide is.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.400
The earliest David Muller.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.400
The device they use.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.400
That's right.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.400
You just change your EOS.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.400
Yes.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.400
But this is.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.400
You can do it on EOS.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.400
You can do it on EOS.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.400
But we can't do it ourselves.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.400
You can change it on EOS.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.400
Or you.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.400
In your.

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:55.400
You usually have a screen now.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.400
You can change it on your screen.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.400
You can change it on your screen.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.400
Anyway, you just use a slide.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400
That's it.

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.400
That's it.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.400
It's not hard.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.400
It's not hard.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.400
We used to change it.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.400
If you want to cooperate.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.400
If you want to cooperate.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.400
I think it's not difficult in Asia.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.400
I think it's not difficult in Asia.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.400
It's harder in America.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.400
Because you have to call the manufacturers.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.400
Because you have to call the manufacturers.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.400
That's right.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.400
It's hard for us.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.400
It's hard for us.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.400
So you guys.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.400
The whole experience of the University of Tokyo.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.400
The whole experience of the University of Tokyo.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.400
A lot of.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.400
That's what the lab does.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.400
Is that what it means?

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.400
About a dozen, at the moment.

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.400
About a dozen, at the moment.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.400
More than 10 is open to the public.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.400
That is the nanotechnology platform I mentioned at the end.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.400
The nanotechnology platform I mentioned at the end.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.400
But there's a part of the teahouse.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.400
I just said a lot.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.400
a lot of developers.

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:01.400
A lot of developers.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.400
It's their lab.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.400
It's their lab.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.400
So I want to ask you.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.400
So I want to ask you.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.400
You just mentioned 4D.

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.400
Especially the part of the power plant.

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.400
You still have to use it now.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.400
What I know is.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.400
There is no commercial software.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.400
Let's just do it.

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.400
You still have to have some of your own.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.400
Now.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.400
This kind of DPC.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.400
No, no, no.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.400
You're the one on the right.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.400
You're the one on the left.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.400
I'm on the right.

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.400
You're on the right.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.400
This is what we do.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400
This is what we do.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.400
They're doing this.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.400
So they write the code themselves.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.400
But now.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.400
I'm going to this year.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.400
If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.400
If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.400
If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.400
The latest SEMO Fisher.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.400
The latest SEMO Fisher.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.400
You can do DPC.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.400
Because I thought.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.400
We still have to use Python.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.400
We still have to use Python.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.400
If you look at it now.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.400
You can think of it.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.400
The one I went to see with the teacher.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.400
It's not even Titan's DPC.

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.400
It's not even Titan's DPC.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.400
Python code.

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.400
Python code.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.400
There are a lot of commercial software.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.400
There are a lot of commercial software.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.400
Because of our biggest gold.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.400
Because of our biggest gold.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.400
And there's a bear.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.400
And there's a bear.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.400
He has been addicted recently.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.400
He has been addicted recently.

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.400
Because it's the first time he developed it.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.400
Because it's the first time he developed it.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.400
But I.

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.400
But I.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.400
The thing that's below you.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.400
The thing that's below you.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.400
The next one I remember one day.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.400
Just this one.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.400
The first page.

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.400
The first page.

01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.400
This thing.

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.400
No, it's on the next page.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.400
Sorry.

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.400
So that's it.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.400
Right.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.400
This thing was first

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.400
made by a Japanese

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.400
named Nims.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.400
A Japanese named Nims made it.

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.400
Ah, Nims.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.400
I go there often.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.400
What's it called? Kimoto.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400
Koji Kimoto.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.400
And.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.400
I thought it was commercialized.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.400
But in fact, they said they didn't.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.400
They only

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.400
finished the 4D

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.400
process.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.400
But later,

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.400
at that time,

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.400
in 2011,

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.400
they did it manually.

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.400
But now

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.400
you don't see such a good result.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.400
Yes.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.400
Most of the 4D

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.400
that are made now are made in Europe and America.

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.400
I can assure you that

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.400
there are very few people

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.400
who do this in Japan at this stage.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.400
Very few.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.400
But I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.400
I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.400
I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.400
I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.400
I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.400
I will go to Kimoto's factory

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.400
to do the experiment next week.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.400
Because this thing.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:19.400
Sorry.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.400
We are talking too professionally.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.400
To put it simply,

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.400
when every muscle

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.400
has an order

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400
and a specific direction,

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.400
in Kimoto's theory,

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.400
I know this muscle,

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.400
I know its muscle structure.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.400
In terms of muscle structure,

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.400
you have the so-called symmetry.

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.400
The most important thing about Kimoto

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.400
is that he talked about

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.400
the symmetry of the Atomic Scale,

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.400
not the

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.400
symmetry of a large muscle.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.400
He used the

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.400
rightmost picture

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.400
called the most typical

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.400
Pythagorean Theorem.

01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.400
He can make

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.400
the so-called

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.400
4D

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.400
figure of the

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.400
Pythagorean Theorem.

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.400
After the 4D figure

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.400
comes out,

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400
based on the

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.400
inner ring and outer ring,

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.400
you can know the symmetry

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.400
of the muscle structure.

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.400
More importantly,

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.400
in addition to proving this,

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.400
Kimoto also talked about

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.400
why in electromagnetic microscope,

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.400
especially in scanning TM,

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.400
the loss of the atomic scale is larger,

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.400
the loss of the atomic state is second,

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.400
and the loss of the oxygen is the last.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.400
In his diffraction pattern,

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.400
he told you

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.400
why the image I see now

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.400
has such a big intensity change

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.400
when I circle

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.400
it.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.400
So in fact,

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.400
I read that paper for a long time,

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.400
and I found that

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.400
I thought there was a commercial software

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.400
that could do the

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.400
post-processing,

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.400
but there was no

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.400
post-processing after

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.400
the commercial software

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.400
did the 4D.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.400
I think the biggest problem

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.400
now is that,

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400
as you just said,

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.400
Kimoto himself wrote.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.400
Yes, because the first time I heard this

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.400
was also in UC Irvine.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.400
They have a group

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.400
doing this.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.400
Then when they talked about it,

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.400
I realized that

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.400
in the past,

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.400
they might have

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.400
read Kimoto's paper

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.400
as reading,

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.400
but they didn't mention it,

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.400
because the concept was the same.

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.400
It used to be called Scanning CBET.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.400
No, the word Kimoto used

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.400
was more fancy,

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.400
called Atomic Scale Symmetry.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.400
Oh, I see.

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.400
Yes, it's Atomic Scale Symmetry.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.400
Because if you really do

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.400
the calculation of CBET,

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.400
the CBET pattern

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.400
made by these three elements

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.400
is really different.

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.400
We seem to be talking too professionally.

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:09.400
Can I ask you a question?

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.400
Sure.

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.400
Sorry.

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.400
Do you have any questions?

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.400
If you have any questions

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.400
about CBET,

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.400
you can ask.

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.400
Hello.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.400
Can you hear me?

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.400
Yes, I can.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.400
I want to add

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:33.400
that UC Irvine

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.400
also has

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.400
user facilities

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.400
for training

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.400
and samples.

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.400
They also have staff

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.400
to do experiments.

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.400
Our group often

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.400
goes to UC Irvine to do TEM.

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:51.400
I have a question about

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.400
when we were doing

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.400
some low-melt point

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.400
metal TEM,

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.400
we were doing

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.400
cryo TEM,

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.400
but when we were

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.400
using cryo holder,

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.400
we couldn't get

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.400
a very good resolution

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:11.400
when we were doing

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.400
stem HEDF

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.400
mapping.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.400
I want to know

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.400
if there are

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.400
other ways

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.400
to do

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.400
low-melting materials

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.400
to get

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.400
a better

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.400
Z-contrast

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.400
or other

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400
resolutions.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.400
Thank you for your question.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.400
My understanding is

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.400
that you can't get

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.400
a very good resolution

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.400
when you are doing cryo

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.400
because your liquid nitrogen

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.400
actually flows.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.400
You have

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.400
touched liquid nitrogen

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.400
or liquid nitrogen gas,

01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.400
and you know

01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.400
that it actually flows.

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.400
I think this is

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.400
a big reason

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.400
why you can't get

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.400
a stable Z-contrast.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400
You just mentioned

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.400
if there are

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.400
other ways to

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.400
change this or get

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.400
a better resolution.

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.400
I haven't done

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.400
anything like this,

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.400
but what I want to mention

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.400
is that

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.400
for example,

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.400
when you look at

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.400
high-resolution images,

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.400
you can't get

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.400
a very good image

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.400
because your strength

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.400
is too weak.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.400
David Miller Group

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.400
used a method

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.400
called TychoGraphy

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.400
in 2018,

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.400
which is 4D stem.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.400
They used this method

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.400
to get a more blurry

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.400
graphic image

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.400
with higher resolution

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.400
and higher resolution.

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.400
That paper is also

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.400
a very famous paper

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.400
by Nature.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.400
If you have any

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.400
information about

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.400
David Miller Group,

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.400
you can add it.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.400
But as far as I know,

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.400
it is very suitable for

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.400
people who can't get

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.400
a high resolution image.

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:23.400
This 4D stem can help you.

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.400
I think that's it.

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.400
I guess

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.400
Cryo's problem is that

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.400
your sample stage

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.400
moves too fast,

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.400
so you can't get a good image.

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.400
There are several ways

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.400
about this.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:41.400
One way is to scan very fast

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.400
and scan a lot of pages.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.400
Then you fold it up

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.400
in a post-processing way

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.400
to get a good image.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.400
This method was developed

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.400
by Lena Kakoudis

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.400
Cryo Stem.

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:01.400
We can try it.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.400
Thank you.

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.400
I have a question.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.400
Before I talk about this question,

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.400
I have a small comment.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:15.400
Because I am

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.400
the speaker today,

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:19.400
Project Hera.

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.400
We are staff.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.400
I strongly recommend

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.400
you to keep in touch.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.400
If you can keep in touch

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.400
and help each other,

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.400
it is the biggest reward for us.

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.400
You feel the same, right?

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.400
Yes.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.400
This is a small comment.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.400
I suggest you

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.400
to keep in touch.

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.400
If you think Project Hera

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:45.400
is helpful to you,

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.400
you can recommend it to others.

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.400
My question is this.

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.400
This is a crazy idea.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.400
If I have a sample today,

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.400
what if I put it down

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.400
for five years?

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.400
Keep taking pictures.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.400
What is the resolution

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:03.400
you want to achieve?

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.400
A sample

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:07.400
can be placed

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.400
in the middle of your screen.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.400
Actually,

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.400
I want to measure

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.400
the distance between

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:17.400
all the atoms.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.400
But I am waiting

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.400
for something to happen.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.400
Why do I want to monitor?

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.400
Because what I expect

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.400
is not static.

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.400
The distribution of the atom

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.400
is like this,

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:33.400
but suddenly it moves.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.400
Why did I

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.400
take a picture of you

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.400
for a long time?

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.400
Because I think

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.400
what I expect

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.400
is the time scale

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.400
from 10s to 100s microseconds.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.400
So if you take a picture

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.400
for two seconds,

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.400
you will miss it easily.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.400
I just said

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.400
taking a picture for two seconds

01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.400
means a lot of pixels.

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:01.400
One pixel is

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.400
about 20 microseconds,

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.400
which I often use.

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.400
But maybe

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.400
I still can't catch

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.400
what you want.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.400
Another big problem

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:15.400
is that I'm not sure

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.400
how much electron radiation

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.400
your sample can withstand.

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.400
Because this is

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.400
a key problem

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.400
for TEM.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.400
If your sample can withstand

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.400
infinite electron radiation,

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.400
of course you can do

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.400
similar experiments.

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.400
But if your sample can only withstand

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.400
one minute,

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.400
you will have damage,

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.400
or you have some carbon damage,

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.400
or you can even

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.400
pierce your sample.

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.400
Then you won't be able to do such experiments.

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.400
I think

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:53.400
I will think

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.400
from this perspective.

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.400
Actually,

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.400
this is what I think.

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:01.400
Radiation damage.

01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.400
We are used to discussing

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.400
what is an electron,

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.400
one, two, three.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.400
We rarely discuss

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.400
what is an electron.

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.400
But basically,

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.400
this is what happens in electrons.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.400
Yes.

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:19.400
Actually, there is such a lab.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.400
In Sandia National Lab,

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.400
they have connected

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.400
a particle beam

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.400
to hit your sample,

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.400
to look at your

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.400
radiation damage.

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.400
There is such a thing.

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.400
Time resolution can barely reach millisecond.

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.400
There are

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.400
faster detectors,

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.400
about 400 frames per second,

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.400
or 2000 frames per second.

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.400
It can barely reach

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.400
millisecond.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.400
Okay, let me ask.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.400
We are actually doing

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.400
carbon-based

01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.400
spectroscopy detector

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:01.400
in Sandia.

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.400
Okay, thank you.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.400
They mainly look at

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.400
radiation.

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.400
I can comment on

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.400
the microscope in Sandia.

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.400
If they use

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.400
photoelectron,

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.400
they can make the electron pulse to nanosecond.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.400
So if your sample

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.400
is beautiful enough,

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.400
although it does not show

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.400
a sample like a sample,

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.400
but if it sounds

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.400
like a millisecond,

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.400
for example,

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.400
if you want to do it in a shorter time,

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.400
you can do it.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.400
I want to ask a question.

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.400
You just mentioned

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.400
that it can measure electric field

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:49.400
and magnetic field.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.400
How good is the sensitivity?

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.400
I can tell you that

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.400
they all say

01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.400
atomic resolution,

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.400
but I'm not sure

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.400
how good it is.

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.400
I don't know if you've heard of

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.400
something called

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.400
SCAMEL.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.400
Some people use

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.400
such a device to measure

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.400
SCAMEL.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.400
If you want to go to

01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:25.400
atomic resolution,

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.400
that is,

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.400
for example,

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.400
I think

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.400
this TEM

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.400
considers

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.400
whether the magnetic field

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.400
penetrates your sample.

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.400
This is a key question.

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.400
If you use

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.400
something without any magnetic field penetration,

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:47.400
you can really determine

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.400
if your magnetic field

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.400
really comes from a very local area.

01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.400
But if you always have

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.400
a general TEM,

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.400
that is, there is a magnetic field

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.400
that penetrates your sample,

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:01.400
I'm not sure

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.400
how good your resolution is.

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.400
Sorry, my question is

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.400
that you may have misunderstood my question.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.400
My question is not about

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.400
how good the spatial resolution is.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.400
My question is,

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.400
for example,

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.400
what is the magnetic field

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.400
or magnetic field

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:21.400
that can be measured

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.400
at a micrometer level?

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.400
I'm sorry,

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.400
I don't know how much this number is.

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.400
Because what we currently see

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.400
is that its principle

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.400
is to look at your electron,

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.400
at least the principle of DPC

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.400
is to see how much your electron beam

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.400
deviates.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.400
You can know its direction

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.400
and its strength

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.400
by doing this.

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.400
You get something like this,

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.400
for example,

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.400
a map of the direction

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.400
from the center.

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:55.400
To be honest,

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.400
I'm not sure

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.400
how strong it is.

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.400
OK, I can go back and look at these questions.

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.400
Thank you.

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:05.400
Thank you.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.400
OK,

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.400
if there are no other questions,

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.400
I will end the recording

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.400
here.
