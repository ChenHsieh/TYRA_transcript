0	2000	Recording has started.
30000	36000	In fact, he was originally a law student at NTU Law School.
36000	41000	He had studied in the Department of Law at Hokkaido University in Japan for a year.
41000	46000	Not only did he complete his law degree, he also obtained a lawyer's license.
46000	50000	He also worked at a large law firm in Taiwan and Japan.
50000	57000	To add to that, Ming-Hsi and I have known each other for a long time.
57000	59000	We were classmates in the same year at NTU Law School.
59000	63000	In our hearts, Ming-Hsi has always been a strong character like a god.
63000	67000	We thought it was difficult for him to study law.
67000	69000	We didn't expect him to be able to study history.
69000	73000	Not only that, he is also the president of NTU's Food & Beverage Association.
73000	77000	To us, he has always been a very strong god.
77000	80000	He also won countless books.
80000	81000	I think it's very impressive.
81000	87000	What's cool about Ming-Hsi is that he always follows a two-way path.
87000	89000	He studies both law and history at the same time.
89000	93000	At the moment, he is in the Department of History at NTU Law School.
93000	96000	He also combined his two-way background with his major.
96000	100000	His field of research includes modern international law history,
100000	102000	East Asian legal modernization,
102000	103000	Sino-US relations history,
103000	107000	international economic law and tax law, and so on.
107000	112000	I was thinking about today's topic, foreign law.
112000	117000	For many people, foreign law is a familiar and uncertain concept.
117000	123000	So let's talk about the rules of today's speech.
123000	126000	Today's speech is actually quite simple.
126000	129000	If you have any questions,
129000	136000	you can either turn on your microphone and ask the speaker directly.
136000	139000	Ming-Hsi likes this kind of interactive speech mode.
139000	144000	Or if you are shy or worried about affecting the speaker's flow,
144000	148000	you can also post your questions in the chat area.
148000	152000	I will find the right time to ask.
152000	156000	After Ming-Hsi finishes his speech,
156000	158000	we will also have a Q&A session.
158000	161000	If everyone is okay,
161000	163000	let's welcome Ming-Hsi.
170000	173000	Hello, everyone.
173000	175000	Can you see my PowerPoint?
175000	178000	Okay.
178000	182000	Thank you for your introduction.
182000	183000	As Yi-An said,
183000	185000	we are both university classmates.
185000	187000	But in the legal department of NTU,
187000	190000	I think Yi-An and I are quite different.
190000	196000	Yi-An left the legal department to study psychology
196000	198000	and became a lawyer.
198000	202000	I am honored to have Yi-An as my host.
202000	204000	Today's topic is
204000	208000	controlling US citizens in China.
208000	211000	This is my research plan for the first-year students
211000	214000	in the history department of NTU.
214000	217000	This plan is still in the early stages,
217000	220000	so I would like to share it with you.
220000	224000	I found that in this project,
224000	226000	there are fewer liberal arts students.
226000	228000	So I will spend a little more time
228000	230000	to introduce to you
230000	232000	the current situation of humanities
232000	239000	and legal studies in the US.
239000	242000	So today's speech will be divided into several parts.
242000	243000	One is self-introduction.
243000	245000	But I don't think I need to introduce too much,
245000	247000	because Yi-An has given me a very detailed explanation.
247000	250000	The second part is to share with you
250000	251000	what history is.
251000	254000	This is actually a common question for everyone.
254000	256000	And I am often asked by teachers
256000	259000	in different departments or classmates.
259000	260000	Because history is abstract.
260000	263000	We can say that what happened in the past is history.
263000	265000	There are so many things in history.
265000	269000	As a historian or a doctoral student in history,
269000	271000	how do we choose the topic?
271000	272000	How do we do research?
272000	274000	In other words, what are the doctoral students
274000	276000	in the history department doing?
276000	279000	Why do I want to study legal history?
279000	281000	What is the relationship between law and history?
281000	283000	In particular, why do I want to choose the topic
283000	285000	of international law as my research topic?
285000	288000	After the introduction of these major subjects
288000	289000	and the background,
289000	292000	I will talk about my initial research in the first year.
292000	296000	That is, what is the foreign law in the United States?
296000	298000	In the past, in high school textbooks,
298000	300000	we often heard that foreign law
300000	302000	is a part of an unequal treaty.
302000	305000	In the past, our country or China
305000	308000	suffered a lot of unequal treatment.
308000	310000	Then it was a matter of losing power.
310000	311000	Is it true? Is it true?
311000	313000	Did the United States benefit from this?
313000	314000	Who benefited from this?
314000	317000	The first research in the history department
317000	321000	is to clarify some facts and some institutional backgrounds.
321000	325000	The higher level is to develop theories.
325000	328000	So in the end, I want to talk about my future plan.
328000	331000	How do I develop these facts and their theoretical meanings
331000	334000	and then carry out my future research?
334000	336000	So here, actually,
336000	337000	Yi-An has already introduced it to me.
337000	338000	I'm not drunk.
338000	340000	I want to talk about the last point.
340000	343000	That is, why do I want to study history?
343000	346000	In fact, my initial goal was
346000	350000	to teach in a law school in the United States.
350000	352000	Here, I think there is something very interesting
352000	354000	that I can share with you.
354000	356000	In the United States, professional schools,
356000	359000	such as law schools,
359000	362000	their practice is very different from
362000	367000	what we usually do in history, physics, or math.
367000	370000	As a historian, I will tell you
370000	376000	what the origin and evolution of this system is.
376000	377000	As you know,
377000	380000	in the world of legal education,
380000	382000	North America is very special.
382000	386000	They do not have legal education in the university.
386000	388000	Unlike in Taiwan, Japan, Germany,
388000	390000	the United Kingdom, or France,
390000	392000	we can choose the law department
392000	394000	after graduating from high school.
394000	396000	After graduating from the law department,
396000	398000	you can take a law exam.
398000	401000	Then you can become a lawyer
401000	403000	or continue to study for a master's degree
403000	405000	and return to the law department to teach.
405000	408000	This is not the case in the United States and Canada.
408000	411000	The U.S. Department of State does not have a law department.
411000	414000	You have to graduate from the Department of State
414000	417000	before you can get your first law degree,
417000	420000	which is called JD, or Juris Doctor.
420000	421000	It's the same as MD.
421000	423000	It has the title of a doctor,
423000	427000	but it's not a Ph.D. doctor.
427000	428000	So traditionally,
428000	430000	when there was a law school in the United States,
430000	432000	they thought that
432000	434000	law was a skill,
434000	437000	not a subject.
437000	438000	So in the 19th century,
438000	440000	the teachers of the law school
440000	442000	were some senior lawyers,
442000	445000	judges, or food workers.
445000	446000	And the education of the law school
446000	448000	was to have these food workers
448000	451000	tell you how to become a good lawyer.
451000	453000	So the course of the law school
453000	455000	was very food-oriented.
455000	457000	It taught you how to sign a contract,
457000	461000	how to act or defend in front of the jury,
461000	463000	how to interact and interrogate,
463000	466000	how to get along with the judge,
466000	470000	and so on and so forth.
470000	472000	Later, everyone thought
472000	473000	that if you teach at school,
473000	476000	you still need to have a little bit of academic knowledge.
476000	480000	But there was no such thing as a law Ph.D.
480000	482000	So what should you do?
482000	483000	There is still a method
483000	485000	taught at law schools in the United States
485000	488000	called traditional track,
488000	491000	which allows you to become a teacher of the law school.
491000	493000	What is traditional track?
493000	496000	It's when you graduate from college
496000	498000	and become a JD,
498000	499000	your first law degree.
499000	500000	After that,
500000	503000	you become a lawyer for three years
503000	505000	or a judge assistant for three years
505000	508000	to gain food experience.
508000	510000	After gaining food experience,
510000	512000	you go to the law department of the university
512000	517000	to apply for the position of teacher.
517000	519000	When you're a teacher,
519000	520000	it's usually three years.
520000	521000	You have to teach on the side.
521000	523000	What you teach is to teach some legal writing,
523000	525000	mathematical writing, and so on.
525000	527000	These are related to food.
527000	528000	During the three years you teach,
528000	531000	you have to write a master's thesis.
531000	534000	If this master's thesis is well written,
534000	536000	you can go to various schools
536000	539000	and apply for the position of assistant professor.
539000	540000	Once you become an assistant professor,
540000	542000	you'll be like other departments.
542000	543000	You'll start writing thesis,
543000	546000	升等,教書, and so on.
546000	547000	But later,
547000	549000	in the 1970s or 1980s,
549000	551000	we found that
551000	554000	the failure of being a fellow
554000	556000	and not becoming an assistant professor
556000	557000	is very high.
557000	558000	This can also be seen.
558000	559000	In JD for three years,
559000	561000	you're learning how to write a book,
561000	563000	and then you become a lawyer for three years.
564000	565000	It doesn't make sense.
565000	567000	When you go back to law school,
567000	569000	you suddenly start writing a thesis.
569000	570000	Like everyone here,
570000	571000	we all study Ph.D.
571000	572000	We all know that
572000	575000	writing a thesis requires a lot of practice,
575000	577000	and then you need someone to lead.
577000	581000	You need a lot of research methods, and so on.
581000	582000	So later, the U.S. Law School
582000	585000	came up with a new way
585000	586000	to make you a teacher,
586000	590000	which is the so-called JD Ph.D. double degree.
590000	591000	In other words,
591000	594000	you get a Ph.D. in another field,
594000	597000	such as history, economics,
597000	600000	politics, language,
600000	602000	psychology, and so on.
602000	604000	Then you go to JD,
604000	606000	and then you become a lawyer for two years.
606000	607000	At this point, you don't have to be a fellow,
607000	610000	and you can take your Ph.D. thesis
610000	613000	and apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.
613000	614000	Basically,
614000	616000	all the new professors at the U.S. Law School
616000	620000	are JD Ph.D. double degrees.
621000	623000	This is my original goal.
623000	626000	I want to get a Ph.D. in history first,
626000	628000	and then I want to get a Ph.D. in JD.
628000	631000	Then I can apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.
631000	634000	There are more and more Chinese people
634000	636000	applying for a Ph.D. degree
636000	637000	at the U.S. Law School
637000	639000	through this kind of double degree.
639000	640000	But as far as I know,
640000	642000	no one in Taiwan
642000	643000	has applied for a Ph.D. degree
643000	645000	at the U.S. Law School in this way.
645000	647000	So I want to give it a try.
647000	649000	Next,
649000	650000	in the past,
650000	652000	most of the Ph.D. and JD degrees
652000	654000	were obtained at different schools.
654000	655000	For example,
655000	656000	Professor Ian Ayers,
656000	657000	who is very famous for
657000	658000	doing legal economic analysis
658000	659000	at Yale University.
659000	662000	He was MIT's Econ Ph.D.,
662000	663000	plus Yale's JD,
663000	666000	and then he taught at Yale.
666000	668000	For people in mainland China,
668000	669000	for example,
669000	672000	Professor Li Ji at UC Irvine,
672000	674000	he was a political science Ph.D.
674000	675000	at Northwestern University,
675000	676000	plus Yale's JD,
676000	680000	and then he taught law at UC Irvine.
680000	682000	So this is what I want to challenge.
682000	684000	I want to practice and hone my knowledge
684000	685000	in the history department,
685000	686000	learn the methods of history,
686000	688000	and write papers.
688000	689000	Later on,
689000	690000	in the last stage of my Ph.D. program,
690000	693000	in the 6th, 7th, or 8th year,
693000	694000	I applied for a Ph.D. degree
694000	696000	at another school.
696000	698000	I was a lawyer in the U.S. for two years,
698000	700000	and then I taught at a law school.
700000	702000	This is a brief explanation
702000	703000	of why I want to
703000	705000	apply for a Ph.D. degree in history.
705000	706000	On the one hand,
706000	709000	I always have this idea of cross-field.
709000	711000	I think this kind of training and environment in the U.S.
711000	714000	is the best fit for my research.
716000	718000	The last thing I want to add is that
718000	719000	I just said that
719000	721000	Taiwanese have not yet read Ph.D. and JD,
721000	722000	right?
722000	725000	The next question must be
725000	727000	that in Taiwan's law department,
727000	729000	there are many legal scholars
729000	732000	who claim to have obtained a Ph.D. degree in the U.S.
732000	734000	What kind of degree did they read?
734000	736000	What kind of career path did they embark on?
736000	737000	Since they are different from Americans
737000	739000	who cultivate law schools,
739000	742000	they must have a different set of things, right?
742000	745000	So I wrote LLM and JSD here later.
745000	747000	Here I would like to explain to you
747000	750000	what this is.
750000	751000	LLM is generally translated as
751000	753000	a legal master's degree.
753000	755000	It is a Latin abbreviation.
755000	761000	It means that
761000	763000	if you are not in the U.S. today,
763000	765000	for example, the U.K., France,
765000	767000	Taiwan, or Japan,
767000	769000	you have already studied law in college.
769000	771000	So it is an abbreviation
771000	773000	for a legal master's degree
773000	775000	for foreigners.
775000	777000	This is called LLM.
777000	780000	You only need to study for nine months
780000	782000	without writing a paper.
782000	785000	Then you can be qualified
785000	787000	to be a lawyer in New York.
787000	789000	So in most cases,
789000	791000	in general, in Taiwan or Japan,
791000	793000	if you have been a lawyer for three or five years
793000	794000	and you think you need to retire,
794000	795000	you can go to the U.S.
795000	798000	and study for nine months.
798000	799000	Among these LLM students,
799000	802000	some may be interested in academics.
802000	805000	So you can find a professor
805000	807000	who is willing to teach you
807000	809000	while you are studying LLM.
809000	811000	Then you can enroll
811000	812000	and become a JSD,
812000	814000	which we generally call
814000	816000	a legal master's degree.
816000	818000	This JSD is actually very different
818000	820000	from our general Ph.D.
820000	821000	Because once you enroll,
821000	822000	you are a doctoral candidate.
822000	823000	So you don't need to take classes,
823000	824000	you don't need to be a teacher,
824000	825000	you don't need to be a lecturer.
825000	827000	In principle, if you write a paper,
827000	829000	you can graduate after the exam.
829000	830000	So there are some very famous
830000	831000	LLM teachers in China.
831000	834000	They may only study JSD for a year and a half
834000	835000	or two years
835000	836000	before they graduate.
836000	837000	There are a lot of people like this.
837000	839000	Because JSD is not like
839000	840000	our Ph.D. training,
840000	841000	you have to take classes,
841000	842000	take exams,
842000	843000	be a lecturer,
843000	845000	teach, and so on.
845000	847000	So the problem with a JSD graduate
847000	848000	is that
848000	850000	their quality is not very certain.
851000	852000	Some people are JSD,
852000	854000	their boss has very high requirements for them,
854000	855000	asking them to continue to take classes,
855000	857000	continue to study methods,
857000	859000	or take the qualification exam with them.
859000	861000	Or some students are very smart.
861000	862000	I have a lot of JSD teachers
862000	864000	in the Department of Law in Canada.
864000	865000	They are very smart.
865000	867000	They watch the lecturers
867000	868000	have a seminar in the law school every day,
868000	869000	and they will kill each other.
869000	871000	They watch Huashan's paper every day
871000	873000	and become a big family.
874000	877000	After they return to China,
877000	879000	they can be a Ph.D.
879000	880000	and teach law in Taiwan.
880000	882000	But in the US Department of Law,
882000	884000	you can hardly see any teachers
884000	885000	who are JSD.
885000	886000	Because they are
886000	888000	Ph.D. for foreigners.
888000	890000	This is a brief introduction.
890000	893000	I used to think that
893000	895000	if I went to the US to study law,
895000	897000	I could just study LLM and JSD.
897000	898000	But I thought,
898000	899000	no,
899000	900000	I want to try to
900000	901000	receive the same training as Americans.
901000	903000	If Americans want to become a professor of law,
903000	905000	I will become a professor of law.
905000	907000	So I started with Ph.D.
907000	908000	Later,
908000	909000	in my senior year,
909000	911000	I will see if I can get a J.D.
911000	912000	and try to find a job
912000	914000	in the US Department of Law.
917000	919000	Next, I will answer a question.
919000	921000	What is history?
921000	922000	I am often asked this question.
922000	924000	But I think this is a disaster question.
924000	925000	It's like I want to ask,
925000	927000	what is physics?
927000	929000	What is math?
929000	931000	It is difficult to define a subject.
931000	933000	But I think I can try
933000	935000	to look at this subject
935000	937000	from a more specific perspective.
937000	939000	What is it?
939000	941000	I think from the perspective of abstract theory,
941000	943000	in the Western context,
943000	948000	history is also a method of philosophy.
948000	949000	In other words,
949000	950000	the research we do in history
950000	952000	is the same as asking a question,
952000	954000	giving it a false hypothesis,
954000	957000	and then verifying it, right?
957000	962000	It is the same as philosophy, physics, and chemistry.
962000	964000	We need to ask a question,
964000	967000	and then use some methods to answer it,
967000	971000	to verify if your hypothesis is correct.
971000	973000	Of course, this is a bit of nonsense.
973000	975000	Because anyone who studies Ph.D.
975000	977000	has to do this kind of study.
977000	979000	So I think we can look at history
979000	981000	from a different perspective.
981000	985000	Whether it is Greece or China,
985000	987000	people in ancient times
987000	989000	have a cycle of history.
989000	991000	By cycle of history,
991000	993000	I mean that
993000	995000	for them,
995000	997000	history is something that
997000	999000	happens over and over again.
999000	1001000	For example,
1001000	1003000	in the Tang Dynasty,
1003000	1005000	Emperor Taizong said that
1005000	1007000	history is the key to understanding the mind.
1007000	1009000	In other words,
1009000	1011000	as long as you study the past,
1011000	1013000	you will learn some lessons.
1014000	1016000	By cycle of history,
1016000	1018000	I mean that
1018000	1020000	there is nothing new under the sun.
1020000	1022000	So I understand the past,
1022000	1024000	and I understand the future.
1024000	1026000	Because what happened in the past
1026000	1028000	will keep happening over and over again.
1028000	1030000	So as long as I know the past,
1030000	1032000	I will know how to face the same thing in the future.
1032000	1034000	What should I do when it happens again?
1034000	1036000	But as we all know,
1036000	1038000	this is a kind of fantasy.
1038000	1040000	How is it possible that
1040000	1042000	people 200 years ago
1042000	1044000	would face the same problems
1044000	1046000	as we do now?
1046000	1048000	Of course, it is different.
1048000	1050000	In the 18th and 19th centuries,
1050000	1052000	history was taken over by the state.
1052000	1054000	There was a very
1054000	1056000	purposeful approach
1056000	1058000	to help
1058000	1060000	build a democratic country.
1060000	1062000	For example,
1062000	1064000	when Germany was about to be unified,
1064000	1066000	a group of historians came out
1066000	1068000	and wrote history of Germany.
1068000	1070000	They told us that we were different
1070000	1072000	from the Italians.
1072000	1074000	We have a glorious history.
1074000	1076000	Who is German?
1076000	1078000	We have a common memory.
1078000	1080000	This also happened
1080000	1082000	in the end of the Qing Dynasty
1082000	1084000	and the beginning of the Republic of China.
1084000	1086000	Chinese historians told you
1086000	1088000	that we are all descendants of the Yan Emperor.
1088000	1090000	So we have a common ancestor.
1090000	1092000	We must agree that we are all Chinese.
1092000	1094000	So for a while,
1094000	1096000	history was used by the state
1096000	1098000	to build the common memory of the nation.
1100000	1102000	In the 19th century,
1102000	1104000	there was another trend.
1104000	1106000	Social science,
1106000	1108000	political science,
1108000	1110000	and other social sciences
1110000	1112000	wanted to become
1112000	1114000	like natural science
1114000	1116000	and discover the common principles
1116000	1118000	of human society.
1118000	1120000	They wanted to analyze
1120000	1122000	why the French Revolution happened,
1122000	1124000	what its causal relationship was,
1124000	1126000	and what its social background conditions were.
1126000	1128000	If we can build
1128000	1130000	a abstract theory
1130000	1132000	that the French Revolution
1132000	1134000	will happen
1134000	1136000	when the four conditions
1136000	1138000	are met,
1138000	1140000	we can predict
1140000	1142000	when the next revolution will happen
1142000	1144000	or prevent it from happening.
1144000	1146000	Another famous example
1146000	1148000	is Marx.
1148000	1150000	He said that human history
1150000	1152000	has a process.
1152000	1154000	We will go from feudalism
1154000	1156000	to a small class revolution
1156000	1158000	to a large class revolution.
1158000	1160000	Many historians' work
1160000	1162000	is to prove
1162000	1164000	the theory of social science
1164000	1166000	and the process
1166000	1168000	of social science principles.
1168000	1170000	Until now,
1170000	1172000	many historians in mainland China
1172000	1174000	are still trying to prove
1174000	1176000	the process of Marxism
1176000	1178000	in China.
1178000	1180000	This is the purpose
1180000	1182000	of the third kind of history.
1182000	1184000	The fourth kind of history
1184000	1186000	is similar to the second kind of history,
1186000	1188000	but it starts to ask smaller questions.
1188000	1190000	Historians want to
1190000	1192000	understand the history of the past
1192000	1194000	and develop quantitative studies
1194000	1196000	of economics or politics.
1198000	1200000	The most famous example
1200000	1202000	is Professor Daniel Clerman
1202000	1204000	at the University of South Carolina.
1204000	1206000	He taught at the University of Chicago
1206000	1208000	because his wife was a lawyer
1208000	1210000	who was afraid of the cold.
1210000	1212000	His family moved to South Carolina.
1212000	1214000	He is a history doctor
1214000	1216000	and a law professor
1216000	1218000	at the University of Chicago.
1218000	1220000	His research is very interesting.
1220000	1222000	He uses the documents
1222000	1224000	and information
1224000	1226000	he discovered
1226000	1228000	in history training
1228000	1230000	and his strong
1230000	1232000	statistical and quantitative background
1232000	1234000	to do some
1234000	1236000	theoretical practical research.
1236000	1238000	Some questions
1238000	1240000	are difficult to answer.
1240000	1242000	Does judicial independence
1242000	1244000	help economic development?
1244000	1246000	We are not like natural science,
1246000	1248000	which can control all variables
1248000	1250000	in the laboratory.
1250000	1252000	When we want to study this topic,
1252000	1254000	we have to do some social experiment
1254000	1256000	to do the cause-and-effect theory,
1256000	1258000	and we need to find
1258000	1260000	a lot of agent variables.
1260000	1262000	Every time a country
1262000	1264000	does judicial independence reform,
1264000	1266000	it often follows
1266000	1268000	many other reforms at the same time.
1268000	1270000	This is the best way
1270000	1272000	to understand the relationship
1272000	1274000	between judicial independence
1274000	1276000	and economic development in the UK.
1276000	1278000	Professor Dan Clearman
1278000	1280000	has some very good information.
1280000	1282000	For example,
1282000	1284000	he found that
1284000	1286000	in the 18th and 19th centuries,
1286000	1288000	the UK was doing judicial independence reform.
1288000	1290000	At the same time,
1290000	1292000	East India Company
1292000	1294000	was listed
1294000	1296000	in London Stock Exchange
1296000	1298000	because
1298000	1300000	there was no
1300000	1302000	good information transmission system.
1302000	1304000	Therefore, news from London
1304000	1306000	had to wait three or five days
1306000	1308000	before it could be sent to Amsterdam.
1308000	1310000	He thought
1310000	1312000	that the agent variables
1312000	1314000	of economic development
1314000	1316000	were the high and low prices
1316000	1318000	of East India Company's shares.
1318000	1320000	Whenever a judicial independence
1320000	1322000	law or reform
1322000	1324000	occurred in the UK,
1324000	1326000	East India Company's shares
1326000	1328000	would rise or fall
1328000	1330000	when the news
1330000	1332000	was sent to Amsterdam.
1332000	1334000	He used statistics
1334000	1336000	to infer the situation in the UK.
1336000	1338000	In the end,
1338000	1340000	he concluded that
1340000	1342000	every judicial independence reform
1342000	1344000	in the UK
1344000	1346000	had something to do
1346000	1348000	with the rise of
1348000	1350000	East India Company's shares.
1350000	1352000	Without historical training,
1352000	1354000	East India Company's shares
1354000	1356000	would not have risen.
1356000	1358000	This is another theory.
1358000	1360000	In the early years,
1360000	1362000	there was a theory
1362000	1364000	that asked
1364000	1366000	why there was
1366000	1368000	no China in the West.
1368000	1370000	In the early years,
1370000	1372000	historians liked to ask
1372000	1374000	why there was no capitalism in China,
1374000	1376000	why there was no scientific revolution in China,
1376000	1378000	and why there was no
1378000	1380000	revolution in China.
1380000	1382000	The next theory is
1382000	1384000	very popular recently,
1384000	1386000	but it is a bit similar
1386000	1388000	to the idea of a national state.
1388000	1390000	Historians believe that
1390000	1392000	the people's historical memory
1392000	1394000	should not serve the country.
1394000	1396000	Therefore,
1396000	1398000	historians began to write
1398000	1400000	some important historical memories.
1400000	1402000	For example,
1402000	1404000	transitional justice should tell you
1404000	1406000	that the Nazi massacre
1406000	1408000	against the Jews
1408000	1410000	was really horrible.
1410000	1412000	We should remember this
1412000	1414000	forever.
1414000	1416000	Because it happened once,
1416000	1418000	it may happen again.
1418000	1420000	The main consciousness of Taiwan
1420000	1422000	must be awakened,
1422000	1424000	because the people of Taiwan
1424000	1426000	have been oppressed for the past 400 years.
1426000	1428000	These popular historical writings
1428000	1430000	are actually shaping historical memory.
1430000	1432000	Another group of people
1432000	1434000	believe that
1434000	1436000	history should not serve the country,
1436000	1438000	so there are a lot of historical studies
1438000	1440000	to deconstruct the national state.
1440000	1442000	For example,
1442000	1444000	tradition is invented,
1444000	1446000	and tradition does not have
1446000	1448000	a long history of 5,000 years.
1448000	1450000	The so-called descendants of the King of Japan
1450000	1452000	only appeared for 100 years.
1452000	1454000	The so-called Japanese cuisine
1454000	1456000	was invented after the Ming Dynasty.
1456000	1458000	In the Middle Ages,
1458000	1460000	the Emperor of Japan believed in Buddhism,
1460000	1462000	so he told everyone not to eat meat.
1462000	1464000	In ancient East Asia,
1464000	1466000	there were four categories of animals
1466000	1468000	in the world,
1468000	1470000	such as grass fish and birds.
1470000	1472000	At that time,
1472000	1474000	the Emperor of Japan said
1474000	1476000	that everyone was not allowed to eat meat,
1476000	1478000	grass fish and birds.
1478000	1480000	In fact,
1480000	1482000	before the Ming Dynasty,
1482000	1484000	the Japanese did not eat beef or pork,
1484000	1486000	so the so-called barbecue and fried pork chops
1486000	1488000	were far-fetched Japanese cuisine.
1488000	1490000	They appeared in the late 19th century
1490000	1492000	and even in the early 20th century.
1493000	1495000	Finally, I think history
1495000	1497000	is different from everyone else.
1497000	1499000	In politics and sociology,
1499000	1501000	they ask more objective questions,
1501000	1503000	but in history,
1503000	1505000	they also ask subjective questions.
1505000	1507000	Traditional sociology
1507000	1509000	may ask a question,
1509000	1511000	such as
1511000	1513000	whether the exam system
1513000	1515000	has promoted social movement.
1515000	1517000	So some historical sociologists
1517000	1519000	will look for a lot of past history
1519000	1521000	to see if there are some
1521000	1523000	poor and hard-working people
1523000	1525000	who became good officials
1525000	1527000	because of the imperial examination,
1527000	1529000	and then flew to Tengda
1529000	1531000	and became famous
1531000	1533000	from the Han dynasty.
1533000	1535000	But historical sociology
1535000	1537000	will ask a question.
1537000	1539000	Objectively,
1539000	1541000	even if the imperial examination
1541000	1543000	really promoted social movement,
1543000	1545000	did the people at that time
1545000	1547000	really realize that
1547000	1549000	the imperial examination
1549000	1551000	promoted social movement?
1551000	1553000	In the Han dynasty,
1553000	1555000	there were some economic works.
1555000	1557000	We can find out from economics
1557000	1559000	what is the meaning of
1559000	1561000	Chou Chou's The Theory of Economics?
1561000	1563000	What does it mean in economics?
1563000	1565000	But historians may ask
1565000	1567000	a person who has not studied
1567000	1569000	modern economics,
1569000	1571000	has not studied Adam Smith,
1571000	1573000	or has not studied economics
1573000	1575000	in NTU,
1575000	1577000	how can he write The Theory of Economics?
1577000	1579000	I think this is the difference
1579000	1581000	between historical sociology
1581000	1583000	and other subjects.
1583000	1585000	The next question is
1585000	1587000	what is legal history?
1587000	1589000	Why is legal history
1589000	1591000	a field worth studying
1591000	1593000	for me?
1593000	1595000	The first argument is,
1595000	1597000	of course,
1597000	1599000	all the legal experts in the court
1599000	1601000	are historians,
1601000	1603000	because the court can only
1603000	1605000	judge what has happened.
1605000	1607000	I am going to discuss
1607000	1609000	whether Su Jianhe killed someone
1609000	1611000	in the past or not.
1611000	1613000	Is he guilty or not?
1613000	1615000	We can only discuss
1615000	1617000	whether he killed someone in the past.
1617000	1619000	The court cannot decide
1619000	1621000	whether he will kill someone in the future.
1621000	1623000	This is a matter of fact.
1623000	1625000	The court can only deal with
1625000	1627000	what has happened.
1627000	1629000	From the legal point of view,
1629000	1631000	when we make a judgment,
1631000	1633000	the court will always
1633000	1635000	make a judgment.
1635000	1637000	In the tradition of British and American law,
1637000	1639000	there are many cases
1639000	1641000	that are not in the text,
1641000	1643000	so you have to tell everyone
1643000	1645000	whether the case in front of you
1645000	1647000	is the same as the case in the past.
1647000	1649000	If it is the same,
1649000	1651000	you should apply the same law.
1651000	1653000	If it is different,
1653000	1655000	you should make another explanation.
1655000	1657000	There are some famous cases
1657000	1659000	where, for example,
1659000	1661000	a court said that
1661000	1663000	A car must pay
1663000	1665000	$10,000.
1665000	1667000	Later,
1667000	1669000	a new case came out
1669000	1671000	where
1671000	1673000	A was hit by B car.
1673000	1675000	Then
1675000	1677000	A told the court
1677000	1679000	that the driver of B car
1679000	1681000	should pay me $10,000.
1681000	1683000	But the lawyer of B car said
1683000	1685000	no, no, no,
1685000	1687000	our case is different from A car.
1687000	1689000	Because A car is black
1689000	1691000	and B car is red.
1691000	1693000	Because humans are more alert
1693000	1695000	when they see a red car.
1695000	1697000	So
1697000	1699000	when they are hit,
1699000	1701000	they have to take more responsibility
1701000	1703000	because they see a red car.
1703000	1705000	British and American law
1705000	1707000	has been debating this kind of thing,
1707000	1709000	so you have to keep looking at
1709000	1711000	the past cases
1711000	1713000	as they are now.
1713000	1715000	Then you need a lot of
1715000	1717000	historical training
1718000	1720000	The second thing is that
1720000	1722000	there is a saying in English
1722000	1724000	that the past is like a foreign country.
1724000	1726000	So when we study
1726000	1728000	the history of law,
1728000	1730000	it's like we are studying
1730000	1732000	another country.
1732000	1734000	So it's like we are now in Taiwan,
1734000	1736000	we are going to legislate.
1736000	1738000	We will refer to what the Japanese do,
1738000	1740000	what the Germans do,
1740000	1742000	what the Americans do.
1742000	1744000	Because these comparisons
1744000	1746000	can give you some ideas.
1746000	1748000	But if you refer to other countries,
1748000	1750000	you will be surprised.
1750000	1752000	Because from a psychological point of view,
1752000	1754000	people all have this
1754000	1756000	in-domain effect.
1756000	1758000	It's not good to play big
1758000	1760000	in front of the case.
1760000	1762000	But you will think
1762000	1764000	what you have is the best.
1764000	1766000	But sometimes when you look at
1766000	1768000	foreign things,
1768000	1770000	you will know that
1770000	1772000	there are many different ways
1772000	1774000	in this world.
1774000	1776000	For example, if I want to control
1776000	1778000	cigarettes,
1778000	1780000	can I refer to
1780000	1782000	how people controlled
1782000	1784000	opium in the past?
1784000	1786000	Of course, opium and cigarettes
1786000	1788000	are different things.
1788000	1790000	But you can think about
1790000	1792000	some new ideas.
1792000	1794000	The second thing is that
1794000	1796000	we all know that
1796000	1798000	humans have a path to rely on.
1798000	1800000	There is one thing that people
1800000	1802000	have been doing for a long time,
1802000	1804000	and the legal history
1804000	1806000	can help you understand
1806000	1808000	the background of this system
1808000	1810000	and its reasons.
1810000	1812000	What did people think at that time?
1812000	1814000	After understanding the reason for
1814000	1816000	the path to rely on,
1816000	1818000	we should now verify that
1818000	1820000	this condition no longer exists
1820000	1822000	or the condition has changed,
1822000	1824000	which means that
1824000	1826000	we should do something different.
1826000	1828000	For example,
1828000	1830000	in the debate on same-sex marriage,
1830000	1832000	it is said that two people
1832000	1834000	of the same sex can get married.
1834000	1836000	If not, why?
1836000	1838000	If there is, why?
1838000	1840000	Has it really changed now?
1840000	1842000	Another common legal history
1842000	1844000	is the debate on
1844000	1846000	the structure of mainstream.
1846000	1848000	For example, we used to think
1848000	1850000	that Hitler's Nazi was terrible
1850000	1852000	because he killed Jews.
1852000	1854000	He set up a prison court
1854000	1856000	and let the judge judge
1856000	1858000	that homosexuals and Jews
1858000	1860000	are inferior species
1860000	1862000	and are not suitable for having children.
1862000	1864000	On the other hand,
1864000	1866000	the United States
1866000	1868000	is a free and democratic defender.
1868000	1870000	Through World War II,
1870000	1872000	the United States
1872000	1874000	liberated
1874000	1876000	these oppressed people.
1876000	1878000	James Whitman,
1878000	1880000	a professor at Yale University,
1880000	1882000	is also a doctor of history.
1882000	1884000	He wrote a book
1884000	1886000	called Hitler's American Model.
1886000	1888000	He said that
1888000	1890000	Hitler's
1890000	1892000	racial discrimination law
1892000	1894000	was widely referred to
1894000	1896000	in the United States
1896000	1898000	as the law of racial discrimination
1898000	1900000	that oppresses black people.
1900000	1902000	In fact, Hitler once said
1902000	1904000	that Americans were too fierce to black people.
1904000	1906000	We can't be so fierce.
1906000	1908000	So, how did Hitler
1908000	1910000	know how to use the law
1910000	1912000	to oppress minorities?
1912000	1914000	It came from the United States.
1914000	1916000	This is what I am doing now.
1916000	1918000	I am using the third world approach
1918000	1920000	to look at the international law.
1920000	1922000	In the past,
1922000	1924000	we thought that the international law
1924000	1926000	was a principle of equal interaction
1926000	1928000	between sovereign states.
1928000	1930000	But in fact, it was not.
1930000	1932000	We know that the international law
1932000	1934000	was once used to oppress
1934000	1936000	and to colonize.
1936000	1938000	The Third World Approach
1938000	1940000	to International Law
1940000	1942000	has a group of scholars.
1942000	1944000	Their goal is to tell you
1944000	1946000	how the international law
1946000	1948000	from the European international law
1948000	1950000	to the international law of the world
1950000	1952000	has contributed a lot to China,
1952000	1954000	Japan, Latin America, etc.
1954000	1956000	They want to tell you
1956000	1958000	that the international law
1958000	1960000	is a tool of oppression.
1960000	1962000	We should not allow the international law
1962000	1964000	to become a tool of oppression again.
1964000	1966000	We must preserve these historical memories.
1966000	1968000	This is what I think
1968000	1970000	the legal history is doing.
1970000	1972000	Before I share my research,
1972000	1974000	I would like to know
1974000	1976000	if you have any questions.
1976000	1978000	I can answer first.
1978000	1980000	I would like to know
1980000	1982000	what is the general history
1982000	1984000	and what is the legal history.
1986000	1988000	I think I have learned a lot.
1988000	1990000	Even if I am a lawyer,
1990000	1992000	I think I have learned a lot.
1996000	1998000	Should I continue?
1998000	2000000	It seems that
2000000	2002000	everyone is still digesting.
2002000	2004000	The information is a bit large.
2004000	2006000	I will try to speak in plain language.
2006000	2008000	I don't know if
2008000	2010000	everyone can understand.
2012000	2014000	I think I have made it clear.
2014000	2016000	I have heard a lot of concepts
2016000	2018000	for the first time.
2018000	2020000	I am not sure
2020000	2022000	but you have made it clear today.
2022000	2024000	The language is very good.
2024000	2026000	I think it has helped me
2026000	2028000	to digest so much information.
2030000	2032000	Can you hear me?
2032000	2034000	Yes.
2034000	2036000	I have a question.
2036000	2038000	I am curious
2038000	2040000	about the background
2040000	2042000	you set up
2042000	2044000	in the beginning.
2044000	2046000	What is history?
2046000	2048000	The front part
2048000	2050000	and the back part
2050000	2052000	are there any differences in views?
2052000	2054000	If so,
2054000	2056000	what do you think?
2058000	2060000	Today's speech
2060000	2062000	is mainly to
2062000	2064000	deconstruct nationalism.
2064000	2066000	In the past, foreign law
2066000	2068000	was described as
2068000	2070000	a symbol of
2070000	2072000	a third world people,
2072000	2074000	Chinese, Japanese,
2074000	2076000	or non-Western people
2076000	2078000	being oppressed.
2078000	2080000	But I will tell you
2080000	2082000	that the actual operation
2082000	2084000	of this theory
2084000	2086000	is based on two things.
2086000	2088000	The first is that
2088000	2090000	I want to improve
2090000	2092000	the meaning of the theory.
2094000	2096000	In the future,
2096000	2098000	I may want to
2098000	2100000	use other methods
2100000	2102000	of political,
2102000	2104000	economic,
2104000	2106000	and socialization
2106000	2108000	to make it more abstract
2108000	2110000	and more applicable.
2110000	2112000	I also hope you can
2112000	2114000	give me some advice.
2116000	2118000	Many people
2118000	2120000	are not familiar with
2120000	2122000	law and history,
2122000	2124000	so I hope I can
2124000	2126000	give you a brief introduction
2126000	2128000	of what I am doing in this field.
2128000	2130000	I also want to
2130000	2132000	take this opportunity
2132000	2134000	to let you know
2134000	2136000	what is the purpose
2136000	2138000	of the American Academy of Law
2138000	2140000	and what is the purpose
2140000	2142000	of the American Academy of Law.
2146000	2148000	Did I answer your question?
2148000	2150000	Yes, you did.
2150000	2152000	Thank you.
2168000	2170000	If not,
2170000	2172000	please continue.
2172000	2174000	Thank you.
2180000	2182000	I think the training
2182000	2184000	from Northwestern University
2184000	2186000	is very interesting.
2186000	2188000	Foreign students
2188000	2190000	have to take a class
2190000	2192000	in English.
2192000	2194000	The teacher will teach us
2194000	2196000	some tips.
2196000	2198000	When you don't know what to say,
2198000	2200000	just take a sip of water.
2200000	2202000	No one will ask you
2202000	2204000	why you are drinking water.
2204000	2206000	Sometimes,
2206000	2208000	you can relax
2208000	2210000	and think about
2210000	2212000	what you want to say.
2212000	2214000	Let's move on
2214000	2216000	to the topic of
2216000	2218000	extracurricular law.
2218000	2220000	Extracurricular law,
2220000	2222000	at least for me,
2222000	2224000	is a term
2224000	2226000	but we don't know
2226000	2228000	what actually happens
2228000	2230000	to it.
2230000	2232000	To put it simply,
2232000	2234000	extracurricular law
2234000	2236000	is the privilege that
2236000	2238000	foreigners are not
2238000	2240000	under the jurisdiction
2240000	2242000	of the local courts.
2242000	2244000	In other words,
2244000	2246000	in 1900,
2246000	2248000	if an American
2248000	2250000	stole or committed a crime
2250000	2252000	in China
2252000	2254000	or any other country
2254000	2256000	wanted to sue him,
2256000	2258000	the Chinese government
2258000	2260000	and the Chinese courts
2260000	2262000	couldn't do anything
2262000	2264000	because he was under the jurisdiction
2264000	2266000	of the local courts.
2266000	2268000	Only the U.S. courts
2268000	2270000	or the U.S. courts
2270000	2272000	can deal with such cases.
2272000	2274000	This is extracurricular law.
2274000	2276000	Extracurricular law still exists
2276000	2278000	in some countries.
2278000	2280000	For example,
2280000	2282000	if an American
2282000	2284000	raped a woman
2284000	2286000	or a child
2286000	2288000	in a local court,
2288000	2290000	the Japanese courts
2290000	2292000	couldn't bring him to trial
2292000	2294000	because he was under the jurisdiction
2294000	2296000	of the U.S. courts.
2296000	2298000	It's not that the U.S. courts
2298000	2300000	couldn't bring him to trial,
2300000	2302000	but the U.S. courts.
2302000	2304000	It sounds unreasonable.
2304000	2306000	Let's move on.
2306000	2308000	The first time that
2308000	2310000	the U.S. signed a treaty
2310000	2312000	was in 1842,
2312000	2314000	the Treaty of Nanjing,
2314000	2316000	China signed a treaty
2316000	2318000	after the Opium War.
2318000	2320000	In this treaty,
2320000	2322000	the U.K. required
2322000	2324000	China to provide
2324000	2326000	extracurricular law to the U.K.
2326000	2328000	The U.S. signed the treaty
2328000	2330000	in 1844,
2330000	2332000	the Treaty of Wangxia,
2332000	2334000	China.
2334000	2336000	In Chinese textbooks,
2336000	2338000	extracurricular law
2338000	2340000	is a symbol of
2340000	2342000	imperialism.
2342000	2344000	Today, our country's citizens
2344000	2346000	are being bullied.
2346000	2348000	Why doesn't our country
2348000	2350000	promote justice?
2350000	2352000	Why does the U.S. court
2352000	2354000	have to bring him to trial?
2354000	2356000	The U.S. court
2356000	2358000	must be very biased.
2358000	2360000	The U.S. court
2360000	2362000	must tolerate
2362000	2364000	the U.S. people
2364000	2366000	because the U.S. people
2366000	2368000	betrayed the sovereignty
2368000	2370000	of China.
2370000	2372000	The U.S. court must
2372000	2374000	revolutionize the U.S.
2374000	2376000	The U.S. court
2376000	2378000	must abolish extracurricular law
2378000	2380000	so that the Chinese people
2380000	2382000	will no longer be bullied.
2382000	2384000	Is it really like this?
2384000	2386000	Let's move on.
2386000	2388000	For example,
2388000	2390000	when the U.S. came to China
2390000	2392000	to negotiate the Treaty of Wangxia,
2392000	2394000	the U.S. diplomat,
2394000	2396000	William Cushing,
2396000	2398000	gave a speech
2398000	2400000	in the U.S. Congress.
2400000	2402000	He said,
2402000	2404000	his proudest moment
2404000	2406000	was when the U.S. wrote
2406000	2408000	the extracurricular law
2408000	2410000	in the Treaty of Wangxia.
2410000	2412000	Because China
2412000	2414000	is an uncivilized place.
2414000	2416000	The judges in their countries
2416000	2418000	do not have three powers.
2418000	2420000	The county magistrates
2420000	2422000	do not have three powers.
2422000	2424000	How can the county magistrates
2424000	2426000	be the judges?
2426000	2428000	In Taiwan,
2428000	2430000	can He Wen-je be a judge?
2430000	2432000	No.
2432000	2434000	Administrative and judicial
2434000	2436000	should be separated.
2436000	2438000	China is an uncivilized country.
2438000	2440000	If you commit a serious crime,
2440000	2442000	you will be imprisoned,
2442000	2444000	you will be tortured,
2444000	2446000	you will be beaten.
2446000	2448000	If our people
2448000	2450000	are the most advanced species,
2450000	2452000	how can we obey the laws of the barbarians?
2452000	2454000	Therefore,
2454000	2456000	obtaining the extracurricular law
2456000	2458000	is a civilized victory.
2458000	2460000	It sounds like a good idea.
2460000	2462000	However,
2462000	2464000	historians have found
2464000	2466000	that before 1868,
2466000	2468000	we could not find
2468000	2470000	any Chinese history
2470000	2472000	against the extracurricular law.
2472000	2474000	This is actually
2474000	2476000	a very strange thing.
2476000	2478000	If China is so powerful,
2478000	2480000	why does China never object
2480000	2482000	to all the negotiations?
2482000	2484000	China thinks it is good.
2484000	2486000	Why?
2486000	2488000	If you want to extracurricular law,
2488000	2490000	we will give it to you.
2490000	2492000	This question
2492000	2494000	is related to a very popular research topic
2494000	2496000	in recent history,
2496000	2498000	which is the multidimensionalism
2498000	2500000	of the empire and the law.
2500000	2502000	In fact,
2502000	2504000	the majority of human history
2504000	2506000	is dominated by the British
2506000	2508000	and the Germans.
2508000	2510000	In fact,
2510000	2512000	the majority of human history
2512000	2514000	is dominated by the Empire.
2514000	2516000	What is the Empire?
2516000	2518000	The simplest definition
2518000	2520000	is that
2520000	2522000	under a regime,
2522000	2524000	there are many different
2524000	2526000	ethnic groups
2526000	2528000	and activists.
2528000	2530000	For example,
2530000	2532000	the Qing Dynasty
2532000	2534000	was an empire
2534000	2536000	with Han people,
2536000	2538000	Tibetans,
2538000	2540000	Mongols,
2540000	2542000	ethnic minorities
2542000	2544000	and Xinjiang people.
2544000	2546000	The next question is
2546000	2548000	that we all know that
2548000	2550000	there is a law called the Qing Dynasty Law.
2550000	2552000	But did the Qing Dynasty Law
2552000	2554000	apply in Tibet?
2554000	2556000	Did the Qing Dynasty Law
2556000	2558000	apply in Xinjiang?
2558000	2560000	In fact, it did not.
2560000	2562000	Although the Qing Dynasty Law
2562000	2564000	applied to most empires,
2564000	2566000	the Roman Empire
2566000	2568000	also applied the law to the Jews.
2568000	2570000	In the Qing Dynasty,
2570000	2572000	the Mongols still applied
2572000	2574000	the traditional Mongolian law,
2574000	2576000	while the Tibetans still applied the Tibetan law.
2576000	2578000	Only the Han people
2578000	2580000	applied the Qing Dynasty Law.
2580000	2582000	This is understandable.
2582000	2584000	When a country is very large
2584000	2586000	and is an empire,
2586000	2588000	how could it be possible
2588000	2590000	to force a Mongolian
2590000	2592000	to marry in a Confucian way?
2594000	2596000	This is also a question of
2596000	2598000	the cost of rule.
2598000	2600000	In order to maintain the operation of an empire
2600000	2602000	and the coordination of the ethnic groups,
2602000	2604000	you must use different laws
2604000	2606000	to treat different people.
2606000	2608000	This is now called
2608000	2610000	the law pluralism.
2610000	2612000	Does Taiwan want to do the same thing?
2612000	2614000	Should the indigenous people
2614000	2616000	apply the indigenous law
2616000	2618000	or not?
2618000	2620000	From the perspective of China,
2620000	2622000	in 1842,
2622000	2624000	the British said
2624000	2626000	that they wanted to
2626000	2628000	apply the British law in China.
2628000	2630000	Think about it.
2630000	2632000	What's wrong with
2632000	2634000	the Mongolians
2634000	2636000	applying the Mongolian law
2636000	2638000	and the British applying the British law?
2638000	2640000	At that time,
2640000	2642000	foreigners could only
2642000	2644000	move around
2644000	2646000	when they came to China.
2646000	2648000	Basically,
2648000	2650000	it did not affect the original life of the Han people.
2650000	2652000	Therefore,
2652000	2654000	there is nothing wrong with
2654000	2656000	giving you a piece of land
2656000	2658000	and having your own law.
2658000	2660000	In 1842,
2660000	2662000	foreigners were limited to Guangzhou.
2662000	2664000	We call it the Guangzhou system.
2664000	2666000	Originally in Guangzhou,
2666000	2668000	in 1842,
2668000	2670000	China had already admitted
2670000	2672000	that the Americans could apply the British law
2672000	2674000	in Guangzhou.
2674000	2676000	Therefore, in 1842 and 1844,
2676000	2678000	foreigners came to China
2678000	2680000	and told the negotiators
2680000	2682000	that they wanted to apply the foreign law.
2682000	2684000	The Chinese thought it was good,
2684000	2686000	so they gave it to them.
2686000	2688000	However, in 1868,
2688000	2690000	people found that something was wrong.
2690000	2692000	At first,
2692000	2694000	there were many cases
2694000	2696000	in which
2696000	2698000	foreigners committed crimes
2698000	2700000	in China
2700000	2702000	and could not be punished.
2702000	2704000	In these cases,
2704000	2706000	too many countries had foreign law,
2706000	2708000	so the legal vacuum was created.
2708000	2710000	Finally,
2710000	2712000	in 1910,
2712000	2714000	there were 23 countries with foreign law in China.
2714000	2716000	We often see in the files
2716000	2718000	that an American
2718000	2720000	committed a crime
2720000	2722000	and was arrested in the U.S. Court.
2722000	2724000	The first defense he made was
2724000	2726000	that he was not an American,
2726000	2728000	but an Englishman.
2728000	2730000	Because he had a lot of passports,
2730000	2732000	he kept hiding.
2732000	2734000	Later, he made Shanghai the most
2734000	2736000	famous criminal heaven in the world,
2736000	2738000	because everyone would not be arrested.
2738000	2740000	This problem became more and more serious,
2740000	2742000	affecting China's security,
2742000	2744000	China's economic development,
2744000	2746000	and so on.
2746000	2748000	Later,
2748000	2750000	he began to think that
2750000	2752000	it was a matter of right to enter the country,
2752000	2754000	and we had to oppose it.
2754000	2756000	To this day,
2756000	2758000	there is a modern meaning.
2758000	2760000	For example,
2760000	2762000	every year on January 11th,
2762000	2764000	there is a Judiciary Day,
2764000	2766000	and the Judiciary Council
2766000	2768000	holds a seminar and a celebration.
2768000	2770000	Why is there a Judiciary Day
2770000	2772000	on January 11th?
2772000	2774000	Because January 11th, 1943
2774000	2776000	was the day
2776000	2778000	when China and the U.S.
2778000	2780000	signed an equal treaty
2780000	2782000	and abolished foreign law.
2782000	2784000	They thought that from that day on,
2784000	2786000	the judicial system of the Republic of China
2786000	2788000	would no longer be dominated by the West.
2788000	2790000	Since then,
2790000	2792000	the Nationalist government
2792000	2794000	moved to Taiwan in 1949,
2794000	2796000	so the Judiciary Day
2796000	2798000	is still on January 11th.
2798000	2800000	Do you still remember
2800000	2802000	the Lincoln case?
2802000	2804000	It was about a British man
2804000	2806000	who died in Taiwan.
2806000	2808000	Later, he fled the country
2808000	2810000	and returned to the U.K.
2810000	2812000	At that time,
2812000	2814000	when the U.K. Supreme Court
2814000	2816000	ruled that Lincoln
2816000	2818000	should be transferred back to Taiwan,
2818000	2820000	the representative of the U.K.
2820000	2822000	was Ambassador St. Luke.
2822000	2824000	I took his class with Ian.
2824000	2826000	Ambassador St. Luke was
2826000	2828000	the Minister of Foreign Affairs
2828000	2830000	at the time,
2830000	2832000	and I took his class with Ian.
2832000	2834000	He wrote in the newspaper
2834000	2836000	that Lincoln should have
2836000	2838000	a symbolic meaning.
2838000	2840000	Because the law of the U.K.
2840000	2842000	and its citizens
2842000	2844000	cannot be transferred to
2844000	2846000	an uncivilized country.
2846000	2848000	At that time,
2848000	2850000	Ambassador St. Luke wrote
2850000	2852000	that the Lincoln case
2852000	2854000	proved that the U.K.
2854000	2856000	had already become
2856000	2858000	a legally civilized country,
2858000	2860000	so the U.K. would be willing
2860000	2862000	to transfer people back to Taiwan.
2862000	2864000	However, when the U.K. Supreme Court
2864000	2866000	overturned the ruling,
2866000	2868000	the U.K. was defeated.
2868000	2870000	As a result,
2870000	2872000	the U.K. had to
2872000	2874000	fight against foreign law.
2874000	2876000	My question is very simple.
2876000	2878000	Is it really easier to fight against
2878000	2880000	foreign law?
2880000	2882000	We can see that
2882000	2884000	the U.S. has to maintain
2884000	2886000	a court in China,
2886000	2888000	and it has to invest a lot of money.
2888000	2890000	And we can also
2890000	2892000	intuitively find that
2892000	2894000	if a U.S. court
2894000	2896000	in China
2896000	2898000	favors U.S. citizens,
2898000	2900000	Chinese people
2900000	2902000	should not do business
2902000	2904000	with U.S. citizens.
2904000	2906000	Chinese people do not want to
2906000	2908000	get along with U.S. citizens,
2908000	2910000	which will worsen Sino-U.S. relations
2910000	2912000	and damage U.S. business interests in China.
2912000	2914000	My question is
2914000	2916000	if foreign law is really better,
2916000	2918000	how does it actually work?
2918000	2920000	Let's look for its file.
2927000	2929000	Excuse me, can I ask a question?
2929000	2931000	Yes, go ahead.
2931000	2933000	I want to ask...
2933000	2935000	You can go back to the presentation.
2935000	2937000	Okay.
2937000	2939000	I want to ask...
2939000	2941000	I want to ask...
2941000	2943000	I want to explain that
2943000	2945000	the person who asked the question
2945000	2947000	can introduce himself.
2947000	2949000	Okay.
2949000	2951000	I'm Hong Shaoming.
2951000	2953000	I'm also a post-doc at Caltech.
2953000	2955000	I graduated from the Department of Psychology at NTU.
2955000	2957000	I want to ask...
2957000	2959000	When you talk about foreign law,
2959000	2961000	you put foreign law
2961000	2963000	and multilateralism
2963000	2965000	together.
2965000	2967000	But their essence is the same.
2967000	2969000	At least on the surface,
2969000	2971000	when you talk about
2971000	2973000	multilateralism,
2973000	2975000	it feels like you're talking about
2975000	2977000	a country with different laws
2977000	2979000	for different groups.
2979000	2981000	But foreign law is about
2981000	2983000	the relationship between
2983000	2985000	countries.
2985000	2987000	You mentioned that
2987000	2989000	before 1868,
2989000	2991000	China didn't oppose foreign law.
2991000	2993000	Maybe they thought
2993000	2995000	foreign law was one form
2995000	2997000	of multilateralism.
2997000	2999000	After 25 years,
2999000	3001000	they thought it wasn't right.
3001000	3003000	It wasn't the same as we imagined.
3003000	3005000	It's about the relationship
3005000	3007000	between countries.
3007000	3009000	Do you have any opinion on this?
3009000	3011000	Do you have any opinion on this?
3011000	3013000	Thank you.
3013000	3015000	I should say that
3015000	3017000	under the pre-modern rule,
3017000	3019000	everyone can accept multilateralism.
3019000	3021000	Because it's a low-cost
3021000	3023000	method that can maintain national governance.
3023000	3025000	So most of the current research
3025000	3027000	believes that
3027000	3029000	before 1868,
3029000	3031000	Chinese central government officials
3031000	3033000	simply believed that
3033000	3035000	it was a matter of multilateralism.
3035000	3037000	It's not necessarily within a country.
3037000	3039000	For example,
3039000	3041000	when the Pope came to China,
3041000	3043000	China also respected the idea
3043000	3045000	of using its own laws to deal with
3045000	3047000	its own problems.
3047000	3049000	After 1868,
3049000	3051000	I think it was because
3051000	3053000	China wanted to modernize.
3053000	3055000	So in the process of modernization,
3055000	3057000	it hoped that the whole country
3057000	3059000	would adopt the same laws.
3059000	3061000	Because this approach
3061000	3063000	can achieve the central authority
3063000	3065000	and mobilization that modern countries want.
3065000	3067000	We can also see that
3067000	3069000	after the founding of the Republic of China,
3069000	3071000	China hoped that
3071000	3073000	Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang
3073000	3075000	would adopt the laws of the Republic of China.
3075000	3077000	China no longer respected its autonomy.
3077000	3079000	Its autonomy became very limited.
3079000	3081000	The current People's Republic of China
3081000	3083000	also hopes that
3083000	3085000	Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang
3085000	3087000	will adopt the laws of the People's Republic of China.
3087000	3089000	I think the same is true for Hong Kong.
3089000	3091000	At the beginning,
3091000	3093000	China thought that
3093000	3095000	it had adopted multilateralism,
3095000	3097000	and that Hong Kong people could continue
3097000	3099000	to use the law of the Republic of China.
3099000	3101000	However, when China wanted to
3101000	3103000	modernize the country,
3103000	3105000	it wanted to adopt
3105000	3107000	multilateralism.
3107000	3109000	After all, we are one nation,
3109000	3111000	one country.
3111000	3113000	Why can't we all
3113000	3115000	use different things?
3115000	3117000	I think this idea
3117000	3119000	is related to the nature of a nation.
3119000	3121000	If all people,
3121000	3123000	whether you are Mongolian,
3123000	3125000	or Tibetan,
3125000	3127000	are different,
3127000	3129000	it means that China
3129000	3131000	is not a single nation.
3131000	3133000	I think the real difference
3133000	3135000	between multilateralism
3135000	3137000	and unilateralism
3137000	3139000	is the effect
3139000	3141000	it brings
3141000	3143000	on the central power
3143000	3145000	and sovereignty
3145000	3147000	in the process of
3147000	3149000	transferring from the empire
3149000	3151000	to a democratic country.
3151000	3153000	I think multilateralism
3153000	3155000	and unilateralism
3155000	3157000	are different things.
3157000	3159000	Not necessarily.
3159000	3161000	Unilateralism is
3161000	3163000	a legal multilateralism.
3163000	3165000	Let me think.
3165000	3167000	Yes, they are different things.
3167000	3169000	It should be said that
3169000	3171000	under a democratic country,
3171000	3173000	it wants its people
3173000	3175000	to adopt the same set of laws.
3175000	3177000	The reason why foreigners
3177000	3179000	have adopted the same set of laws
3179000	3181000	is because
3181000	3183000	they have the potential
3183000	3185000	to show the spirit
3185000	3187000	of legal multilateralism.
3187000	3189000	In some countries,
3189000	3191000	however,
3191000	3193000	legal multilateralism
3193000	3195000	and unilateralism
3195000	3197000	are different things.
3197000	3199000	They think they are different things.
3199000	3201000	Legal multilateralism is possible,
3201000	3203000	but unilateralism is not.
3203000	3205000	They can also explain
3205000	3207000	why China did not object
3207000	3209000	to unilateralism.
3209000	3211000	In the beginning,
3211000	3213000	they thought it was the same thing.
3213000	3215000	They found that
3215000	3217000	it was a different thing.
3217000	3219000	When it interfered with
3219000	3221000	the sovereignty of our country,
3221000	3223000	they began to oppose it.
3223000	3225000	If such an attack is established,
3225000	3227000	legal multilateralism
3227000	3229000	does not seem to be able
3229000	3231000	to support whether foreign law
3231000	3233000	is good or bad.
3233000	3235000	I think I will go back to
3235000	3237000	what I said at the beginning.
3237000	3239000	Historians will ask
3239000	3241000	why they could not find
3241000	3243000	opposition in 1868.
3243000	3245000	We will think that
3245000	3247000	the subjective will of
3247000	3249000	the historical activists
3249000	3251000	mixed them with
3251000	3253000	legal multilateralism.
3253000	3255000	That's right.
3255000	3257000	The reason why
3257000	3259000	people did not object
3259000	3261000	is that
3261000	3263000	people at that time
3263000	3265000	did not think
3265000	3267000	it was the same thing.
3267000	3269000	In the beginning,
3269000	3271000	they thought it was the same thing,
3271000	3273000	so they did not object.
3273000	3275000	Later, they found that
3275000	3277000	it was not the same thing.
3277000	3279000	It seems that
3279000	3281000	the range of influence
3281000	3283000	is not the same.
3283000	3285000	Anyway,
3285000	3287000	we have spent too much time
3287000	3289000	on this topic.
3289000	3291000	Thank you.
3291000	3293000	Oh, is that so?
3293000	3295000	Does it prove that Taiwan
3295000	3297000	is a civilized country?
3297000	3299000	Well,
3299000	3301000	the main reason why
3301000	3303000	Taiwan was invited
3303000	3305000	was to ask
3305000	3307000	whether there was a significant difference
3307000	3309000	between the British and the Taiwanese
3309000	3311000	in terms of mass movement.
3311000	3313000	I see.
3313000	3315000	Please go on.
3315000	3317000	OK, I will finish it soon.
3317000	3319000	I seem to have a little bit of plagiarism.
3319000	3321000	I will finish it soon.
3321000	3323000	So,
3323000	3325000	my research mainly focuses on
3325000	3327000	the judicial reform of the United States
3327000	3329000	in Shanghai in 1906.
3329000	3331000	From 1844 to 1905,
3331000	3333000	the U.S. did not establish
3333000	3335000	a formal court in China.
3335000	3337000	Therefore,
3337000	3339000	we often hear the term
3339000	3341000	consular trial.
3341000	3343000	What is a consular trial?
3343000	3345000	It is when a diplomat
3345000	3347000	consulates as a judge.
3347000	3349000	He will be sent to the local consulate
3349000	3351000	to be tried.
3351000	3353000	Who is a judge?
3353000	3355000	It is a diplomat.
3355000	3357000	Sometimes,
3357000	3359000	this diplomat also has some legislative powers.
3359000	3361000	This is a tricky situation.
3361000	3363000	When the U.S. criticized
3363000	3365000	China's law of non-discrimination
3365000	3367000	and non-civilization,
3367000	3369000	the U.S. did not discriminate.
3369000	3371000	The diplomat is an executive,
3371000	3373000	and he has the right to be tried.
3373000	3375000	At the same time,
3375000	3377000	the diplomat is not civilized at all.
3377000	3379000	The diplomat is more like
3379000	3381000	a governor-general,
3381000	3383000	or even more like
3383000	3385000	a magistrate in China,
3385000	3387000	like Bao Qingtian,
3387000	3389000	who is both a mayor and a judge.
3389000	3391000	Furthermore,
3391000	3393000	the U.S. was not a rich country
3393000	3395000	at that time.
3395000	3397000	The U.S. did not invest
3397000	3399000	a lot of personnel,
3399000	3401000	finance,
3401000	3403000	and legal professionals in China.
3403000	3405000	For example,
3405000	3407000	the U.S. sentenced a person to prison.
3407000	3409000	At first,
3409000	3411000	the U.S. did not even have a prison.
3411000	3413000	The U.S. even rented a prison
3413000	3415000	to the British and French,
3415000	3417000	because the U.S. built a prison
3417000	3419000	in Shanghai earlier than the French.
3419000	3421000	Why did the U.S. have
3421000	3423000	a legislative reform in 1906?
3423000	3425000	For me,
3425000	3427000	this is a modern Chinese country
3427000	3429000	that has encountered
3429000	3431000	the U.S. imperialism.
3431000	3433000	In this video,
3433000	3435000	we can see two figures.
3435000	3437000	The first figure is
3437000	3439000	the date when the U.S.
3439000	3441000	acquired the colony.
3441000	3443000	We can see Hawaii,
3443000	3445000	Wake Island, Samoa,
3445000	3447000	the Philippines,
3447000	3449000	and Panama.
3449000	3451000	They were all acquired
3451000	3453000	at the end of the 19th century
3453000	3455000	or the beginning of the 20th century.
3455000	3457000	In other words,
3457000	3459000	between 1844 and 1900,
3459000	3461000	the average trade volume
3461000	3463000	between China and the U.S.
3463000	3465000	increased significantly
3465000	3467000	and even doubled.
3467000	3469000	This expansion of the U.S. imperialism
3469000	3471000	brought a lot of trade
3471000	3473000	between China and the U.S.
3473000	3475000	At that time,
3475000	3477000	the U.S. business community
3477000	3479000	began to respond
3479000	3481000	to the U.S. federal government
3481000	3483000	that the Supreme Court
3483000	3485000	was not enough
3485000	3487000	to resolve the trade dispute
3487000	3489000	between China and the U.S.
3489000	3491000	Because these judges
3491000	3493000	are not legal people.
3493000	3495000	They are just diplomats.
3495000	3497000	As we all know,
3497000	3499000	our diplomats abroad
3499000	3501000	are also responsible
3501000	3503000	for business affairs.
3503000	3505000	They do not have legal expertise
3505000	3507000	and are not able
3507000	3509000	to do a trial.
3509000	3511000	So the efficiency of the court
3511000	3513000	is very low
3513000	3515000	and it is very painful
3515000	3517000	for these people
3517000	3519000	including sex workers,
3519000	3521000	gamblers, and vagabonds.
3521000	3523000	At that time,
3523000	3525000	U.S. missionaries in China
3525000	3527000	believed that these illegal immigrants
3527000	3529000	had a serious impact on the image
3529000	3531000	of the U.S. in China.
3531000	3533000	In 1900,
3533000	3535000	there was a protest in Shanghai
3535000	3537000	against the U.S. import movement.
3537000	3539000	The U.S. consulates
3539000	3541000	were highly tolerant of sex workers.
3541000	3543000	So in 1900,
3543000	3545000	all the white prostitutes in Shanghai
3545000	3547000	said that they were American.
3547000	3549000	At that time,
3549000	3551000	the word American Girl
3551000	3553000	meant prostitutes.
3553000	3555000	When a prostitute was arrested,
3555000	3557000	she would say,
3557000	3559000	I am American.
3559000	3561000	When she was sent to the U.K.
3561000	3563000	court,
3563000	3565000	she would say,
3565000	3567000	I am American.
3567000	3569000	When she was sent to the U.S.
3569000	3571000	court,
3571000	3573000	she would say,
3573000	3575000	I am American.
3575000	3577000	So we can see that
3577000	3579000	the word extraterritoriality
3579000	3581000	and consular jurisdiction
3581000	3583000	were not important
3583000	3585000	concepts to the U.S.
3585000	3587000	until 1900.
3587000	3589000	The frequency of
3589000	3591000	extraterritoriality
3591000	3593000	and consular jurisdiction
3593000	3595000	increased significantly
3595000	3597000	after 1900.
3597000	3599000	On the other hand,
3599000	3601000	we all know that
3601000	3603000	the Eight-Nation Allied Forces
3603000	3605000	were attacked in Beijing.
3605000	3607000	After the attack,
3607000	3609000	Beijing signed the Qing Dynasty
3609000	3611000	Treaty.
3611000	3613000	After the Treaty,
3613000	3615000	the Qing Dynasty began
3615000	3617000	to reform the modern legal system.
3617000	3619000	At that time,
3619000	3621000	the reform of the modern legal system
3621000	3623000	was to transform Chinese law
3623000	3625000	into Western modern law.
3625000	3627000	Basically,
3627000	3629000	we see so-called
3629000	3631000	Legislative Codespotism
3631000	3633000	and white light law
3633000	3635000	later.
3635000	3637000	We will see some citations
3637000	3639000	of that book
3639000	3641000	referred to
3641000	3643000	the Great Qing Ming-Liu case.
3643000	3645000	This case was
3645000	3647000	published in 1906.
3647000	3649000	As a result,
3649000	3651000	in 1903,
3651000	3653000	the arms tribunals
3653000	3655000	signed an agreement
3655000	3657000	that China
3657000	3659000	should start
3659000	3661000	legal and judicial reform.
3661000	3663000	Western countries should help us.
3663000	3665000	If they help us,
3665000	3667000	we will abolish
3667000	3669000	foreign law.
3669000	3671000	At that time,
3671000	3673000	the U.S. faced two pressures.
3673000	3675000	The first was
3675000	3677000	the expansion of
3677000	3679000	the U.S. Empire
3679000	3681000	and the development of
3681000	3683000	Sino-US trade relations
3683000	3685000	and the reform of
3685000	3687000	the U.S. Constitution.
3687000	3689000	The second was
3689000	3691000	the reform of
3691000	3693000	the U.S. Constitution.
3693000	3695000	If the U.S. becomes
3695000	3697000	a modern,
3697000	3699000	civilized,
3699000	3701000	and three-party
3701000	3703000	court,
3703000	3705000	the U.S.
3705000	3707000	will not have
3707000	3709000	a place to stand.
3709000	3711000	In 1906,
3711000	3713000	the U.S. established
3713000	3715000	the United States Court for China.
3715000	3717000	It appointed a judge
3717000	3719000	who had graduated from
3719000	3721000	the University of Yale
3721000	3723000	and was the director of
3723000	3725000	the Philippine Procuratorate
3725000	3727000	and established a modern
3727000	3729000	and formal court.
3729000	3731000	After the judge came to power,
3731000	3733000	he did three things.
3733000	3735000	The first thing he did
3735000	3737000	was to declare that
3737000	3739000	he would not have any
3739000	3741000	business dealings with the U.S.
3741000	3743000	because the U.S. business community
3743000	3745000	wanted him to deal with
3745000	3747000	some business cases and disputes.
3747000	3749000	Instead, he dealt with
3749000	3751000	brothels and casinos.
3751000	3753000	He felt that there were
3753000	3755000	many U.S. lawyers
3755000	3757000	who had a bad image of the Chinese.
3757000	3759000	So he called all the U.S.
3759000	3761000	lawyers in Shanghai
3761000	3763000	for a lawyer exam.
3763000	3765000	The U.S. lawyer exam
3765000	3767000	made 80% of the people
3767000	3769000	think that U.S. lawyers
3769000	3771000	should not come to the U.S.
3771000	3773000	court.
3773000	3775000	The next thing he did
3775000	3777000	was to sue the boss
3777000	3779000	of eight brothels
3779000	3781000	and four casinos.
3781000	3783000	In the past,
3783000	3785000	the U.S. lawyers used
3785000	3787000	the same trick
3787000	3789000	to say that
3789000	3791000	they were not U.S.
3791000	3793000	lawyers,
3793000	3795000	but the judge
3795000	3797000	who asked them
3797000	3799000	if they used
3799000	3801000	U.S. consulates.
3801000	3803000	He even asked the U.S. consulate
3803000	3805000	to open their diplomatic documents
3805000	3807000	and see if they had
3807000	3809000	a passport in the U.S. consulate.
3809000	3811000	Some of the U.S. lawyers
3811000	3813000	did not give a reason
3813000	3815000	and said,
3815000	3817000	I do not care,
3817000	3819000	you are an American.
3819000	3821000	He wanted to eliminate
3821000	3823000	the legal vacuum
3823000	3825000	that caused
3825000	3827000	a fierce backlash
3827000	3829000	among the U.S. community
3829000	3831000	in Shanghai.
3831000	3833000	The U.S. judge was
3833000	3835000	impeached and resigned
3835000	3837000	a year later.
3837000	3839000	The next U.S. judge
3839000	3841000	did not care.
3841000	3843000	In the future,
3843000	3845000	I think there are several
3845000	3847000	theoretical meanings
3847000	3849000	that can be developed.
3849000	3851000	The first is
3851000	3853000	that cross-border trade
3853000	3855000	is very common.
3855000	3857000	For example,
3857000	3859000	if a Japanese
3859000	3861000	signs a trade contract
3861000	3863000	with a Singaporean,
3863000	3865000	he or she can use
3865000	3867000	the New York State Act
3867000	3869000	to settle the dispute
3869000	3871000	in Paris.
3871000	3873000	I think
3873000	3875000	the current situation
3875000	3877000	is similar to the past.
3877000	3879000	China in the 19th century
3879000	3881000	pushed the situation
3881000	3883000	to extremes.
3883000	3885000	For example,
3885000	3887000	there are nine countries
3887000	3889000	in Tianjin.
3889000	3891000	In Tianjin,
3891000	3893000	there are ten laws
3893000	3895000	in the same city.
3895000	3897000	There are some
3897000	3899000	theories that can be developed.
3899000	3901000	The next is
3901000	3903000	system competition.
3903000	3905000	We know that
3905000	3907000	in a globalized era,
3907000	3909000	many countries
3909000	3911000	will look for
3911000	3913000	low-cost institutions.
3913000	3915000	For example,
3915000	3917000	labor laws
3917000	3919000	or environmental laws
3919000	3921000	are relatively loose.
3921000	3923000	At that time,
3923000	3925000	there were more than
3925000	3927000	20 countries in China
3927000	3929000	who competed
3929000	3931000	with each other
3931000	3933000	for the greatest interests
3933000	3935000	in China.
3935000	3937000	I don't know
3937000	3939000	if there are more theories
3939000	3941000	that can be developed.
3941000	3943000	The next is
3943000	3945000	modern foreign law.
3945000	3947000	For example,
3947000	3949000	the US military
3949000	3951000	has foreign law in Chongqing.
3951000	3953000	Is there any way
3953000	3955000	to push back
3955000	3957000	or deny the existence
3957000	3959000	of foreign law
3959000	3961000	from the actual
3961000	3963000	implementation of
3963000	3965000	the United States?
3965000	3967000	At that time,
3967000	3969000	the United States had a very
3969000	3971000	intense backlash in China,
3971000	3973000	which made it believe
3973000	3975000	that the United States
3975000	3977000	should not throw
3977000	3979000	taxpayers' money
3979000	3981000	overseas for foreign law.
3981000	3983000	In fact,
3983000	3985000	Americans have been
3985000	3987000	faced with the fact
3987000	3989000	that they cannot
3989000	3991000	manage their citizens
3991000	3993000	without the support
3993000	3995000	of the United States.
3995000	3997000	Is it really beneficial?
3997000	3999000	For example,
3999000	4001000	the image of the United States
4001000	4003000	is so bad,
4003000	4005000	and if the court is not fair,
4005000	4007000	the Chinese will resist your goods.
4007000	4009000	Therefore,
4009000	4011000	foreign law
4011000	4013000	is not something
4013000	4015000	that can be implemented
4015000	4017000	indefinitely.
4017000	4019000	In addition to the law itself,
4019000	4021000	it is also necessary
4021000	4023000	to understand the context
4023000	4025000	of these systems,
4025000	4027000	and then think about
4027000	4029000	more theoretical and abstract things
4029000	4031000	according to your research.
4031000	4033000	That's all for today.
4033000	4035000	Thank you.
