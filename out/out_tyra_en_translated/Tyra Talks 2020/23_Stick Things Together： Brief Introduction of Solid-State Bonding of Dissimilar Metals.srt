1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ok, let's start.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ok, first I need to introduce myself.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Please introduce yourself, thank you.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ok, I have prepared a few videos.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I will use them to introduce myself.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today, I will talk about the simple introduction of metal solvents.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Zeyu Lin, and I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
First, I will give a brief self-introduction.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
As I mentioned, I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My department is the National Research and Development Department of the Institute of Materials and Materials Research.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My main job here is...

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sorry, let me use the laser pointer.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
My main job here is to connect the material's microstructure with its mechanical properties,

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
as well as its related performance characteristics.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
At present, I am working on the development of high-strength and high-durability ferrous alloys,

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
as well as the microstructure of permanent magnets,

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
as well as the development of some raw materials.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Today, I would like to introduce my post-doctoral research...

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No, I mean my work accumulated during my post-doctoral studies,

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and my post-doctoral research in February this year,

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
which is about four years of work.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The field of research is mainly the solid-state integration of copper,

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
which is similar in nature, as well as liquid metal.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The integration technology used is a technology called ultrasonic integration.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Its principle is to use high-pressure and high frequency vibration to achieve the deformation of the material to form the node.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It can be used in steel, high-strength steel, or aluminum alloy, etc.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It can be used in...

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The main scene that can be considered is that the composite structure of multi-materials,

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
such as the structure of the car body,

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
can achieve the goal characteristics of lightweighting and high strength.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sorry, I just made a mistake.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I graduated from Tokyo University of Japan in 2019,

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and majored in material engineering.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
My other major is the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China,

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's all for the main self-introduction.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Next, I'm going to start introducing today's main speech topic,

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
which is mainly about the integration of solid-state and liquid metal materials that are similar in nature,

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and then use ultrasonic integration to observe the strength of its interface.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
First, I will give a simple background introduction.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In the engineering background,

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
listeners may be more familiar with the fact that

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
steel is a very solid base.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It is one of the basic and indispensable materials.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The picture on the left shows that

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
there are about 15% to 20% of steel in the world every year.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Because there are a lot of steel applications,

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
including architecture, general people, military facilities, transportation, etc.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It accounts for about 15% to 20% of transportation.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It is mainly applied to the construction of car parts and the structure of the car body.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There are a lot of types of steel used,

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
including soft steel, medium-strength, high-strength, and ultra-high-strength steel.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
At present, the development field of materials is mainly focused on

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
how to improve its extensibility and high-strength, etc.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The picture on the lower left is called DynamoCurve,

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
which is a curve distribution like a banana.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why is there such a distribution?

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It is mainly derived from the fact that the strength of the material increases,

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but the extensibility does not decrease.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Based on the background of traditional physics,

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
such strength and extensibility are indispensable.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
However, many scientists are using various methods

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to try to get out of this field.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The current research situation is to try to achieve the high strength and high extensibility of both, etc.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why do we need such a high-strength steel development?

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It is mainly used when the car body is hit by a heavy object.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
High-strength steel can often provide stronger support

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to avoid fatal damage to passengers.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In order to improve safety,

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the current material development is mainly focused on high-strength and high extensibility, etc.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What kind of steel is used?

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Different strengths of steel are used in different areas of the car body structure.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is a simple introduction.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can clearly see that

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
if the car is hit by a heavy object,

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the stress and gravity come from the front and back, etc.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
At this time, you need a high-strength structural material

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to support the entire car body.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The current high-strength steel developed by traditional physics

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
has reached 780, 980, 1180, etc.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This represents the strength of steel,

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
which is about 550 MPa.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The current mainstream high-strength steel is

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
concentrated in the front and back of 1000 MPa.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is the current situation in which the structural material is used.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
On the other hand,

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
if we don't use steel,

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and we use a high-strength material,

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
it will not be able to support the entire car body.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
On the other hand,

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
if we don't use steel,

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and we use a high-strength material,

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
such as aluminum, copper, and carbon fiber, etc.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If we use this material,

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it can be made very lightweight

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and has sufficient safety.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
However, the price is also very high.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
As you can see here,

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
for a good car like Audi R8,

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the recommended price in 2020 is about $70,000.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This price is hard to meet for ordinary people.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So we mainly use traditional steel

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and aluminum and carbon fiber.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
In this respect,

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you have to make a choice

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
in terms of cost and mechanical quality.

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The name of the car body structure we often use in our industry

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is a multi-material structure.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Multi-Material Structure

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
As you can see here,

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
in addition to steel,

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
it also has a lot of external body parts,

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
such as the door, engine cover, etc.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In order to make it lightweight,

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
we usually use aluminum alloy.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The main maintenance material is aluminum alloy.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
In this respect,

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
when the car body is assembled,

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
we mainly use

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
high-strength steel

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and aluminum alloy.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In this respect,

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
they need to be fixed and processed

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to form a complete structure.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It is conceivable that

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
some processes need to be processed

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to combine them together.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In recent years,

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
in addition to the emission of environmental regulations,

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the demand for lightweighting is increasing.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
On the right side of the slide,

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
there is a picture of

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the materials used in the field of cars

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
in 2030,

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
including aluminum and high-strength steel.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HSF stands for High Strength Steel.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The ratio of these two materials

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
will increase from 29% to 57%.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In the near future,

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
in order to establish high strength

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and lightweighting,

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
we will use more aluminum

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and more high-strength steel.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Therefore, how to combine

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
iron and lightweighting alloy

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
in the manufacturing process

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is quite important.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now we will introduce

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the traditional way

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
of combining materials

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and manufacturing technology,

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
i.e. welding.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Traditionally,

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
we define welding

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
as a process

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
in which two separate materials

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
are heated

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
to a high temperature

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and then combined

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to produce

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
sufficient quality

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
welding.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
In this process,

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the defects

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
will gradually disappear.

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
At such a high temperature,

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
along with the change

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
in the structure

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
of the fibers

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and the growth

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
of the center,

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
heat is also affected,

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and so on.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
In this regard,

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the material itself

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
is mechanically affected

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
by the change

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
in the structure

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
of the fibers.

180
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
After the welding point

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is formed,

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
all the fibers

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
around it

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
will undergo

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
huge changes.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Such changes

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
are sometimes not

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
completely positive.

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
How to prevent

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
low-performance

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
welding?

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In general,

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
if we use

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
a high temperature

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
to melt steel

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and aluminum,

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
we will encounter several problems.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The first is that

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
aluminum and steel

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
have very different melting points.

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The melting point of aluminum

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is about 600 degrees,

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
while steel is about

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
1400 to 1500 degrees.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Therefore,

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
at such a high temperature,

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
it will produce

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
a huge

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
expansion.

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The expansion

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
will form

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
many compounds

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
between

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
steel and aluminum.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This compound

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
is not

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
conducive to

218
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
mechanical performance.

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why?

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The problem is that

221
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
it is very brittle

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and unbearable to impact.

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
After a little impact,

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
it will crack

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
like ceramics

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
or glass.

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
At the same time,

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it will also

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
produce cracks

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
in the joint

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
between the

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
welding points.

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
quite disadvantageous to

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
mechanical manufacturing.

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That is to say,

237
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
it is quite disadvantageous

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
to use general

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
combination technology

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to combine steel and aluminum

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
at high temperature.

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In other words,

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
what we may

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
consider next

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is how to reduce

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the temperature of the

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
welding point

248
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to a certain degree.

249
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
In other words,

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
we will focus on

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
how to combine

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
steel and aluminum.

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We need to combine at

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
the melting point of

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
aluminum, which is about

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
660 degrees.

257
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
At this temperature,

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
it is called solidification.

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Next,

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will briefly introduce

261
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
solidification.

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
As I mentioned earlier,

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it can combine

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
two components

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it will not

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
melt during the process.

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Its heating is also

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
lower than the melting point of any material.

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We need to introduce

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
more concepts

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
such as sufficient deformation

273
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
at the material interface.

274
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
At sufficient temperature,

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the interface will expand.

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
After the expansion,

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
the defect will gradually disappear

278
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
to achieve

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the effect of combination.

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Here is our main

281
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
design concept.

282
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The main concept of solidification

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
is how to make

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the defect on the interface disappear,

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
including holes and

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
cavities, etc.

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
At the same time,

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
most materials

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
usually have a layer of

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
pollutants on the surface,

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
such as carbon

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and oxygen,

293
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and other compounds.

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
At the same time,

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
there will be a certain

296
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
degree of oxidation film

297
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
on the surface.

298
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You may have heard

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that aluminum

300
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
is very easy to oxidize.

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It forms a layer

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
of oxidizing film

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
on the surface.

304
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This oxidizing film

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
has a sufficient quality

306
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
to protect the material

307
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
from further oxidation.

308
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This kind of oxidizing film

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
is quite beneficial

310
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
in combination.

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Traditionally, we still

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
have to achieve the contact

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
between the atomic and

314
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
pure atoms

315
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to form an aqueous bond.

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
In other words,

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the bond between the

318
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
atom and the atom

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
or the metal bond,

320
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
etc.

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
On the other hand,

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
we can say that

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
we have introduced

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
enough deformation

325
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
at high temperature

326
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to make it like clay

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
to stir and form a

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
interlocking interface structure.

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
OK.

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Here,

331
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
we will

332
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
make a brief introduction

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
about solid-state integration.

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Traditionally,

335
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
the first way of integration

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
is called expansion integration.

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The main principle is to use

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
high pressure and high temperature

339
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
to apply on two objects

340
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
that need to be integrated.

341
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
With such high temperature and high pressure,

342
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
sufficient time can form

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
a bond.

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This way of integration

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
can be applied on

346
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
metal or ceramic

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
or metal or even

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
carbon fiber.

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But the problem is that

350
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
the integration time is quite long

351
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and requires a higher temperature.

352
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
At the same time,

353
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
if the interface passes

354
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
a high temperature and a long time,

355
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it will form an

356
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
overly complex structure,

357
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
including metal-based objects,

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
which we mentioned earlier,

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
forming a layer

360
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
like ceramic,

361
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
a non-extensible middle layer.

362
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This middle layer

363
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
has a very weak mechanical nature

364
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and is not conducive to the overall integration strength.

365
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
On the other hand,

366
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the other

367
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is friction-mixing integration.

368
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The principle is

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to use a high-speed

370
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
rotation

371
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
weld head

372
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
directly on the surface

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
to form a high temperature.

374
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
After the high temperature,

375
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
the material will gradually soften,

376
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
but it is not yet at the melting point.

377
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So it will be like

378
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
clay.

379
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
After it softens,

380
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
this weld head can be pressed down

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and then start to move.

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Then move along

383
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
the seam between the two.

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let the defect of the interface

385
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
gradually pass through

386
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and move and soften.

387
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But on the other hand,

388
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
this material

389
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
can be used in all kinds of

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
aluminum alloy, aluminum-ferrous alloy,

391
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
etc. Its application range is quite wide.

392
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
For example,

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
let's take the

394
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Japanese alloy as an example.

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It mainly uses

396
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
this type of

397
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
alloying technology

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
for the

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
combination of

400
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
interfaces.

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
On the other hand,

402
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
its shortcomings are

403
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that it takes a long time to

404
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
combine.

405
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
At the same time,

406
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
on the other hand,

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the time it takes to combine

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
also takes a long time to

409
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
combine.

410
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
This may be due to the

411
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
shortcomings of the interface

412
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and the shape of the

413
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
intermetallic alloy.

414
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So

415
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
based on this

416
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
background,

417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
based on this research background,

418
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
we use another type of

419
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
alloying technology.

420
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This is called ultrasonic welding.

421
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The principle of ultrasonic welding

422
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
may be mentioned earlier.

423
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It is a certain degree of pressure

424
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
on the two overlapping

425
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
bows.

426
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It is about

427
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
15,000 to 24,000

428
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
degrees of vibration.

429
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Then the interface is friction-heated.

430
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
In this state,

431
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
the interface will

432
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
deform unilaterally.

433
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
After deformation,

434
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
it will form a fiber structure

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
that forms a ring.

436
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This causes the surface

437
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
interface to disappear

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and the welding point to form.

439
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In this respect,

440
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
we believe that

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
it can be used in

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
the future.

443
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because it does not

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
follow the fusion,

445
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
it will not produce a large amount of

446
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
intermetallic alloys that are

447
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
not conducive to mechanical strength.

448
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Therefore, it is expected to be

449
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
used in the future.

450
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It can be used in

451
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
car lightweighting

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and high-strength composite

453
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
structure materials manufacturing,

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
etc.

455
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Its advantages include

456
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
lower

457
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
fusion temperature

458
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
compared to

459
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
normal welding.

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
At the same time,

461
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
its interface friction

462
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
heat is formed in a

463
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
relatively small area.

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The friction heat

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
formed in the small area

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
is relatively small

467
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
for the overall

468
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
fiber structure change.

469
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
In this way,

470
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
under the strength

471
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
of the material itself

472
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and the machine itself,

473
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
it can be fully combined

474
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to produce a relatively small

475
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
fiber structure change.

476
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is quite beneficial

477
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
to the overall manufacturing.

478
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
On the other hand,

479
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the picture on the

480
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
bottom right is the

481
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
application of the current

482
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
superfine wave fusion

483
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
on the machine-made

484
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
rolling wheel.

485
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
In the rolling wheel,

486
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
it is the high-speed vibration

487
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
of the water and the

488
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
friction heat of the interface

489
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
is formed and the

490
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
water is transformed

491
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
into a fusion

492
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
to carry out

493
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the machine-made

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
process.

495
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The superfine wave

496
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
fusion itself is not

497
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
a relatively new technology.

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It was first used in the

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
1960s.

500
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
At first, the main application

501
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
scene was the

502
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
printing circuit board

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and the wiring of

504
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
various chips.

505
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It is a technology

506
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
often used in

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
circuit board manufacturing.

508
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It also uses

509
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
pressure and vibration

510
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to complete the

511
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
fusion on the machine board.

512
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It is a process

513
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
of pressure and vibration.

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Combining the main principles,

515
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
we can make a

516
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
more detailed introduction.

517
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Traditionally,

518
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
there may be hundreds to thousands

519
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
of newtons of pressure.

520
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
After pressing,

521
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
the two bows

522
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
will be welded

523
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and the base will be fixed.

524
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
High-speed vibration will begin

525
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
to form.

526
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The vibration is usually

527
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
about 20 to 60 micrometers

528
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
per second,

529
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
which is about

530
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
15,000 to 24,000

531
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
per second.

532
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
In such a short and

533
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
dense vibration,

534
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the interface will

535
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
generate a lot of deformation

536
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and a lot of friction heat

537
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
will appear.

538
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Friction heat and deformation

539
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
combine to form the interface.

540
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
In this process,

541
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the interface

542
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
will undergo high-speed

543
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
deformation.

544
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
After the deformation,

545
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
different phenomena such as

546
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
heat and expansion

547
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
will appear.

548
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Therefore, in so many

549
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
interfaces,

550
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
the interface formation mechanism

551
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
is quite difficult to

552
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
understand,

553
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
especially in the case of

554
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
soft metal materials.

555
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
In the case of harder materials,

556
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
such as steel and

557
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
carbon,

558
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
it is quite rare

559
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
to study the formation

560
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
of the interface mechanism

561
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
in the scene.

562
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Therefore,

563
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
our main research

564
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
is on the hard materials.

565
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Assuming that

566
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
we are now

567
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
progressing to how to

568
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
use superfine fiber

569
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
in the application of hard materials,

570
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
mainly in some

571
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
advanced research,

572
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
most of the superfine fiber

573
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
is used in aluminum alloy

574
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
or plastic alloy,

575
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
which is a soft material.

576
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The interface will form

577
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
a different degree of friction flow,

578
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that is, after it reaches a high temperature,

579
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
it will constantly

580
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
deform and squeeze.

581
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The deformation and squeezing process

582
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
causes a lot of changes

583
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
in the fiber structure of the interface.

584
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
However,

585
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
such a situation will not

586
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
appear in the human position

587
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
on the hard material.

588
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
If you want to combine

589
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
superfine fiber

590
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
on a steel

591
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
with a higher strength,

592
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
steel, iron, and

593
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
aluminum alloy,

594
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
this part needs to be further explored.

595
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
On the other hand,

596
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
if it is used in hard materials,

597
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
the combination of steel and aluminum

598
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
has been done

599
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
a lot of advanced research

600
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
in the superfine fiber combination.

601
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They are mainly concentrated

602
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
in a short time,

603
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
within a few seconds,

604
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
they can form

605
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
about 30 minutes

606
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
in the expansion combination

607
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
of superfine fiber

608
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and intermetallics.

609
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Such a combination

610
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
is not conducive

611
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
to the mechanical properties

612
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
mentioned earlier.

613
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Most of the research

614
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
focuses on this later stage

615
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
of superfine fiber

616
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
formation.

617
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
On the other hand,

618
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
in the early days,

619
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the material was friction

620
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and deformed after friction.

621
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
How will the formation

622
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
of intermetallics

623
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
evolve?

624
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
This mechanism

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
is relatively rare.

626
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
However, this part is also true.

627
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The application of superfine fiber

628
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
in the combination of steel

629
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and aluminum has a significant

630
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
impact.

631
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
We mainly

632
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
understand

633
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
how to use superfine fiber

634
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
in the superfine fiber

635
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
combination

636
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
situation.

637
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
This is divided into two parts.

638
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
The first one

639
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
will be divided into

640
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
the phenomenon of

641
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
no interface reaction

642
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
when combined.

643
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
On the other hand,

644
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
we will use another type of

645
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
metal combination

646
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
to discuss

647
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
how to combine

648
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
superfine fiber

649
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
in the superfine fiber

650
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
combination situation.

651
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The first part

652
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
is to understand

653
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
how to combine

654
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
superfine fiber

655
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
in the superfine fiber

656
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
combination situation.

657
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
We will use steel and aluminum.

658
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Why do we use steel and aluminum?

659
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The main purpose is that

660
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
there is no interface reaction

661
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
between the two,

662
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
so it is difficult

663
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
to analyze the interface.

664
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
As a comparison,

665
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
we use steel and aluminum to combine.

666
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
On the other hand,

667
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
from the previous principle introduction,

668
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
it can be known that

669
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
only high-speed friction

670
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
will cause interface contact.

671
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The depth of the contact point

672
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and the roughness of the material surface

673
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
have a significant impact.

674
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
This research

675
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
is not enough.

676
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
On the other hand,

677
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
one part of the research

678
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
also focuses on the roughness of the surface

679
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and the impact on the strength of the combination.

680
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
On the other hand,

681
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
because we have to use steel

682
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and other materials to combine,

683
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the mechanical performance of steel

684
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
such as hardness and strength

685
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and other changes

686
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
will also affect the nature of the combination.

687
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Therefore, the hardness of the iron itself

688
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and the different microstructures

689
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
will also have an impact

690
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
.

691
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
On the other hand,

692
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
this part is the combination of hard materials

693
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
such as steel and aluminum, steel and titanium, etc.

694
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Why choose these two combinations?

695
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Mainly because the two

696
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
aluminum and titanium have different

697
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
deformation capabilities at high temperatures.

698
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Therefore, when we plan to explore

699
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
the origin of the combination,

700
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
what impact

701
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
these two different materials

702
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and their deformation capabilities

703
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
have on the combination of the two?

704
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Because of time,

705
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
we will directly enter the

706
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
experimental step.

707
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
First of all, it is the combination of steel and aluminum

708
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
to form the interface.

709
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The material we use

710
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
is a non-metallic atomic steel,

711
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
which is a relatively soft

712
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
medium-strength steel

713
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and a pure aluminum plate

714
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
as a research subject.

715
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
On the surface,

716
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
we will use

717
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
a mirror-surfacer

718
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
to measure the roughness

719
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
of the surface.

720
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Next,

721
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
we use a superfine grain

722
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
to make a superfine grain

723
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
combination.

724
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The main combination condition

725
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
is that we use a pressure

726
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
of about 2000 newtons,

727
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
which is applied to

728
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
about 10 times the

729
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
power of the steel head,

730
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
which is accompanied by

731
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
about 20,000 times of vibration

732
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
. The combination time

733
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
is about 0.01 seconds

734
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
to 2.0 seconds.

735
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
After completing the

736
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
superfine grain combination,

737
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the next step is to

738
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
stretch the time to judge the

739
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
strength of the combination.

740
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
After the stretching is broken,

741
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
suppose that it is broken on the interface,

742
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
we will observe the electronic

743
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
microscope and

744
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
analyze the microstructure.

745
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
On the other hand,

746
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
if it is not suitable for

747
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
stretching time, we will prepare

748
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
another batch of samples that have not yet been stretched.

749
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
After the

750
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
two halves are cut in half,

751
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the surface is exposed

752
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and the

753
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
electronic microscope

754
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and the back image electronic

755
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
3D EBSD are observed

756
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
to observe the image

757
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and the

758
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
deformation of the interface.

759
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
First of

760
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
all, suppose the

761
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
steel head is used,

762
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
made of steel and iron,

763
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and the iron plate using

764
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
superfine media

765
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
on the interface can

766
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
be seen for the

767
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
angle of integration,

768
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
the combination time

769
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
against the middle is

770
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
stressed.

771
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Its crystal here

772
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is about

773
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
2,000 newtons,

774
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
which is enough

775
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
to break the

776
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
IF steel,

777
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
that is, the

778
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
infinite-sphere atomic steel itself.

779
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It is greater than the strength of the steel itself.

780
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
On the other hand,

781
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
if we compare it with other

782
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
integrations,

783
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
such as the expansion integration

784
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
using iron and iron,

785
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
it requires a relatively long

786
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
time, which is about 50 seconds,

787
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and requires a certain degree of

788
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
high temperature.

789
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In this case,

790
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
if we compare it with the

791
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
microstructure of the interface,

792
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
its interface deformation

793
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
is quite concentrated,

794
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
about only 10 micrometers

795
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
before and after.

796
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
On the other hand,

797
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
if we compare it with the

798
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
friction-mixing-combination FSW,

799
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
its deformation is greater,

800
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
about 15 to 20

801
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
micrometers.

802
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
At the same time, it is accompanied by a very severe deformation.

803
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Such severe deformation

804
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
is reliable to the welding point itself.

805
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That is to say,

806
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
its durability is

807
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
also a subject to

808
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
consider.

809
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Therefore,

810
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
the superfine-mixing-combination

811
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
can be done in a short time

812
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
without a lot of deformation

813
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to complete the

814
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
superfine-mixing-combination.

815
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
On the other hand,

816
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
if it is used on

817
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
the interface of iron and iron

818
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and iron and nickel,

819
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
this part

820
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
is that we did

821
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
electronic microscope

822
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and EBSD analysis

823
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and found that the

824
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
formation of the interface

825
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
will form such a

826
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
small friction particle.

827
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
This friction particle will gradually increase

828
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and at the same time be accompanied by friction

829
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
to friction the upper and lower

830
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
nickel and iron body.

831
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
After enough time

832
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and temperature, it will

833
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
gradually be compressed.

834
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
After the compression,

835
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
it will produce severe deformation

836
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and spread to the entire

837
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
interface to complete

838
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
the formation of the interface.

839
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
At the same time,

840
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
it is accompanied by

841
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
this

842
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
seam,

843
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
the seam and

844
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
the segment.

845
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
If

846
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
there is enough time,

847
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
it is

848
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
superfine-mixing-combination

849
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
can form enough

850
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
partial and

851
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
severe shrinkage deformation.

852
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It can be completed in a short time.

853
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
On the other hand,

854
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
superfine-mixing-combination

855
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
is the surface.

856
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
On the other hand,

857
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
if we use a thicker

858
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
seam, the time of

859
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
combining will be shorter.

860
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The time of shrinkage will be longer.

861
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Why does it get longer?

862
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If it is a thick seam,

863
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
it will form a thicker

864
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and larger

865
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
seam, such as

866
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
seam seam and seam seam.

867
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
In this way,

868
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
how do I compress

869
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
these three peaks and three valleys?

870
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It takes a longer time and

871
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
pressure to compress it

872
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
to form the interface and

873
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
form the friction force

874
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
to form more combining time.

875
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Therefore,

876
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
a slightly smoother

877
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
combination interface

878
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
does not have any

879
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
pollutants or oxidants

880
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
at the same time.

881
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
What about the type of steel itself?

882
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Assuming that it is replaced,

883
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
because what we mentioned earlier

884
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
is that it uses

885
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
relatively

886
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
average fiber structure

887
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
ferrite

888
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
IF steel.

889
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Next, we will use

890
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
polyester

891
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and ferrite

892
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
neutral carbon steel

893
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and 14% nickel steel.

894
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
There is also 0.08%

895
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
low carbon steel.

896
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Their hardness and

897
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
microstructure, we will make a

898
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
more detailed

899
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
comparison.

900
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This part is the

901
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
ferrite itself.

902
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
In addition to the

903
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
IF steel used at the beginning,

904
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
we also prepared different types of steel.

905
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Here,

906
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
ferrite, porcelain steel, and

907
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
martensite steel have different hardness.

908
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
As the hardness increases,

909
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the combination strength

910
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
is getting lower and lower.

911
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Compared to the beginning,

912
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
nickel and IF steel only need

913
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
2 seconds to combine.

914
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
On the other hand,

915
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
neutral carbon steel, including

916
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
ferrite and ferrite,

917
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
takes about 5 seconds to

918
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
combine.

919
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
On the other hand,

920
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
once the hardness is higher,

921
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
about 200 to 300 hardness

922
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
martensite steel,

923
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it takes longer to combine.

924
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Why do we have

925
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
different situations?

926
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We analyzed the interface

927
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and found that

928
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
for the same steel photo,

929
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
the bottom is

930
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
porcelain steel, the bottom left is

931
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
porcelain steel, and the bottom right is ferrite.

932
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Ferrite and nickel will form

933
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
more friction resistance.

934
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This friction resistance has a larger

935
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
coefficient of friction resistance.

936
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
On the other hand,

937
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
ferrite and nickel

938
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
have relatively low deformation.

939
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
At the same time,

940
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
there are still

941
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
interface defects.

942
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That is to say,

943
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
in a harder steel,

944
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
it takes a long time to

945
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
complete the combination.

946
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
At the same time,

947
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
we can get

948
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
a conclusion that

949
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
ferrite and nickel have

950
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
relatively similar hardness.

951
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
On the other hand,

952
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
ferrite and nickel have

953
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
relatively similar hardness.

954
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It can provide more

955
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
deformation.

956
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Such large-scale deformation

957
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
is conducive to the rise of

958
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
the combination strength.

959
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This part is

960
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the friction

961
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
generated by the

962
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
combination.

963
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
There are different mechanisms.

964
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The main difference is

965
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
the friction between

966
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
ferrite and nickel.

967
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The main difference between the two

968
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
is that the interface

969
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
on the ferrite and nickel

970
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
will form

971
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
something like a friction resistance.

972
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
On the other hand,

973
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
if it is nickel,

974
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
in the case of nickel,

975
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
the harder material

976
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
will be

977
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
deformed

978
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
in the ferrite material

979
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and form a friction resistance.

980
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
In other words,

981
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
such a situation

982
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
occurs when the hardness

983
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
gap is relatively large,

984
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
such as ferrite and nickel.

985
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
In other words,

986
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the first part of our

987
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
conclusion can be concentrated

988
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
in the appearance of

989
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
friction resistance particles

990
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
with a relatively large

991
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
friction resistance.

992
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
On the other hand,

993
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
if it is ferrite and nickel,

994
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
the friction loss

995
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
in the ferrite itself

996
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
will take longer

997
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to eliminate

998
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
such interface defects

999
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to complete the

1000
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
combined formation.

1001
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The second part

1002
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
is the

1003
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
combination strength.

1004
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
In other words,

1005
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
in the case of a reaction,

1006
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the combined interface

1007
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
is formed.

1008
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
As mentioned earlier,

1009
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
we skip this part.

1010
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
In other words,

1011
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
at the initial stage,

1012
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
before the bonding structure

1013
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
is formed,

1014
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
how does the combined interface

1015
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
develop?

1016
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
This is the part

1017
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
to be discussed.

1018
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
First of all,

1019
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in the case of ferrite and nickel,

1020
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
we use the

1021
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
traditionally mentioned

1022
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
IF steel and 5000-gram aluminum alloy.

1023
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Then we

1024
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
do superimposed bonding.

1025
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
In the process of bonding,

1026
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
we will stick a thermocouple

1027
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
on the interface to measure

1028
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
the temperature of the bonding structure.

1029
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
The picture on the right shows

1030
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the change in strength and time.

1031
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It can be clearly seen that

1032
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
before 0.5 seconds,

1033
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
the combined strength was very weak

1034
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and could not be measured.

1035
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
After 1 second,

1036
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the combined strength rose rapidly

1037
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
to 2.5 seconds,

1038
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and the bonding was completed.

1039
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
At the same time,

1040
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
it gradually decreased

1041
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
due to the serious deformation

1042
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
of the aluminum itself,

1043
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
resulting in the fracture

1044
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
in the aluminum.

1045
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Why is there such a change?

1046
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We can see that

1047
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
if we

1048
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
combine the temperature changes

1049
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
here,

1050
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
it rises very rapidly

1051
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
at the initial temperature,

1052
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and it can reach

1053
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
about 400 degrees in about 1 second.

1054
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Here, we have

1055
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
compared it with the previous study,

1056
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and found that the temperature obtained

1057
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
in 1 second is about 400 degrees.

1058
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Once it exceeds 400 degrees,

1059
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
the aluminum itself

1060
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
will shrink

1061
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and its deformable ability

1062
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
will increase rapidly,

1063
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
which is enough to

1064
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
remove the defect of the interface

1065
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and combine it.

1066
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
On the other hand,

1067
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
we used the electronic microscope

1068
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
to observe its interface

1069
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and found that as time went by,

1070
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
it was indeed about 1.1 seconds

1071
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
that the interface became sticky

1072
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and the defect was concentrated in the aluminum.

1073
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
As time went by,

1074
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
the interface was gradually completed,

1075
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and the defect on this side of the aluminum

1076
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
gradually disappeared,

1077
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
and it took 2.5 seconds

1078
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
to complete a fully integrated interface.

1079
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
As time went by,

1080
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the interface became

1081
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
more and more sticky.

1082
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Therefore,

1083
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
we can categorize

1084
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the whole phenomenon here.

1085
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
At the beginning of the integration,

1086
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the factor of

1087
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
the strength being too low

1088
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
caused the aluminum to be friction,

1089
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and it will break off from the aluminum

1090
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and attach to the iron side

1091
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and the IF steel side.

1092
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
As time goes by,

1093
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
the aluminum itself

1094
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
has enough deformable ability at high temperature,

1095
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
it will gradually be compressed

1096
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and the defect can

1097
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
gradually disappear to complete the integration.

1098
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
OK.

1099
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The other part

1100
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
is the combination of iron and titanium.

1101
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The reason why we

1102
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
use titanium

1103
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
is that the deformation ability of

1104
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
titanium itself at high temperature

1105
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
is not as obvious as aluminum.

1106
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
On the other hand,

1107
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
some basic

1108
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
physics concepts

1109
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
may know that titanium is a hexagon.

1110
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If the hexagon is deformed

1111
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and subjected to friction,

1112
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
it will have a lot of defects,

1113
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
so it is a metal

1114
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
that has relatively little extension ability.

1115
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
In this way,

1116
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
the superhexagon

1117
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
can be found

1118
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
under the similar conditions

1119
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
mentioned earlier.

1120
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Before 2 seconds,

1121
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
the strength of the integration

1122
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
gradually reaches a platform,

1123
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
which is a stable state.

1124
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But after 2 seconds,

1125
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
the strength of the integration

1126
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
has increased dramatically

1127
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
during 2 seconds to 2.5 seconds.

1128
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Why does this happen?

1129
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
At first,

1130
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
we think that

1131
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
after 2 seconds,

1132
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
we will find that

1133
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
once it exceeds 600 degrees,

1134
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
it may produce

1135
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
the hexagon of iron and titanium

1136
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
on the left.

1137
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
On the hexagon,

1138
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
you can see that

1139
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
there is a lower point of contact here.

1140
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
At this point of contact,

1141
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
it will be found that

1142
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
once the iron has a certain degree of

1143
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
about 15 to 20%

1144
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
, it will produce the hexagon.

1145
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That is to say,

1146
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
from the original HCP type

1147
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
to the BCC type,

1148
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
BCC's beta type.

1149
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
BCC's deformation ability

1150
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
is that

1151
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
the deformation ability of the

1152
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
BCC is better than

1153
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
the HCP of the hexagon

1154
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and the most dense hexagon.

1155
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
In the next step,

1156
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
in order to verify

1157
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
our assumption,

1158
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
we observed the interface

1159
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and found that

1160
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
at about 2.0 seconds,

1161
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
the interface will

1162
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
break off

1163
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
on the side of the

1164
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
machine itself and stick

1165
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
to the side of the iron.

1166
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
After 2 seconds,

1167
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
up to 2.5 seconds,

1168
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the interface's

1169
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
original gap

1170
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
will disappear

1171
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and become

1172
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
a hole.

1173
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
As time goes by,

1174
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
these holes will gradually disappear.

1175
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So,

1176
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
up to 3 seconds

1177
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
can complete the interface.

1178
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Compared to the expansion

1179
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
interface mentioned earlier,

1180
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
it usually takes

1181
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
about 1 to 2 hours

1182
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
to complete the interface

1183
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
of iron and iron type.

1184
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
On the other hand,

1185
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
if you use a transverse interface,

1186
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
you will find that

1187
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
after about 2.0 seconds,

1188
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
it will appear again and again.

1189
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Why does this happen?

1190
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
As mentioned earlier,

1191
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
the initial interface

1192
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
is still an alpha type

1193
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
of the hexagon machine at 2.0 seconds.

1194
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
On the other hand,

1195
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
as time increases to 2.5 seconds,

1196
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
it will form

1197
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
such a BCC

1198
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
structure beta type

1199
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
when the temperature

1200
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
is high enough

1201
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
to make the gap

1202
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
disappear.

1203
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Therefore,

1204
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
we can conclude that

1205
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
BCC type has the

1206
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
power to

1207
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
combine the interface.

1208
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Therefore,

1209
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
the summary of the second part

1210
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
of the interface

1211
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
is mainly here.

1212
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Here you can see that

1213
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
it only takes about 450 degrees

1214
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
On the other hand,

1215
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
if you use iron and type,

1216
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
type takes longer.

1217
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Why? Because it needs

1218
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
a temperature of more than 600 degrees

1219
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
with the expansion of iron

1220
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
to complete the interface.

1221
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
The method of completing the interface

1222
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
is to convert type from the

1223
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
original alpha to beta type.

1224
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Therefore, the last part

1225
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
is the summary of this speech.

1226
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Here we mainly

1227
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
talk about the first part.

1228
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
In the similar hard material

1229
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
combination, we will find

1230
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
such a BCC.

1231
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
BCC can provide greater

1232
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
partial deformation,

1233
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and at the same time,

1234
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
the combination can be completed

1235
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
in about 2 seconds.

1236
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
On the other hand,

1237
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
if you use a harder material

1238
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
such as porcelain, iron,

1239
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
or martensite,

1240
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
it will damage the internal structure

1241
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and cause such a defect to disappear.

1242
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
On the other hand,

1243
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
a smoother combination is

1244
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
conducive to integration.

1245
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
At the same time,

1246
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
if you use a more

1247
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
similar hard material,

1248
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
it is also conducive to

1249
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
the increase in the intensity of the integration.

1250
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
On the other hand,

1251
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
if it is a hard material,

1252
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
we must consider

1253
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
the enough deformation ability

1254
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
to introduce deformation.

1255
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
These are the interesting points

1256
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
that have been discovered

1257
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
so far.

1258
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
In this speech,

1259
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
we have mentioned

1260
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
that in the combination,

1261
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
we will produce rapid and large-scale deformations,

1262
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and there will also be

1263
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
contact friction damage,

1264
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
or metal decomposition,

1265
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and image transformation, etc.

1266
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
What we have learned

1267
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
is that in the future,

1268
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
we expect to apply

1269
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
the multi-component composite material

1270
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
to structure manufacturing

1271
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
or further 3D metal decomposition.

1272
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
OK

1273
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That's the main part of

1274
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
today's speech.

1275
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Thank you.

1276
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Thank you.

1277
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It's a very interesting speech.

1278
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Now it's Q&A time.

1279
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
We can ask

1280
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
because there are

1281
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
two questions

1282
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
in the chat box.

1283
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We can ask Kunyan

1284
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
to use

1285
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
your microphone

1286
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
to ask your questions.

1287
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
OK

1288
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
The first question is

1289
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
how do you measure the temperature and heat

1290
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
of your composite?

1291
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Traditionally, I use

1292
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
thermal electric heating.

1293
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
If you can see me,

1294
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm welding at the edge of the material.

1295
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Wait a minute.

1296
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I use this method

1297
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
to weld at the edge of the material itself.

1298
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
At the edge,

1299
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
it is subjected to direct pressure

1300
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
from the welding head.

1301
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Under the pressure,

1302
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
it can be guaranteed that

1303
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
although the combined temperature

1304
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
is the middle one,

1305
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
the heat of the metal interface

1306
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
will disappear immediately

1307
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
after the welding is over?

1308
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Will it disappear immediately?

1309
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Or will it remain the same?

1310
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Under its condition,

1311
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
the thermal profile

1312
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
can be seen.

1313
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
That is,

1314
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
after the combined time

1315
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
is over,

1316
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
it will be about 1000 degrees

1317
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
per second.

1318
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Why is it so fast?

1319
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Because once the welding is over,

1320
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
it is touched

1321
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
by the welding head

1322
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and the base.

1323
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
This kind of contact will make

1324
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
the heat dissipation very fast.

1325
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yes, I understand.

1326
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
One more question.

1327
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You just mentioned

1328
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
that

1329
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
the combination of

1330
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
alpha and theta

1331
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
changes to beta and theta.

1332
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But if your cooling speed

1333
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
is so fast,

1334
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
is your interface

1335
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
pure beta titanium

1336
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
or will it produce martensite?

1337
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
In fact,

1338
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
this picture at 3.0 seconds

1339
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
actually forms

1340
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
a martensite structure.

1341
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It is a Weissmannian structure.

1342
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It is formed by alpha and beta

1343
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
passing through.

1344
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Under extreme cold conditions,

1345
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
it forms a martensite structure

1346
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
like this.

1347
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
On the other hand,

1348
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
why doesn't it

1349
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
form such a transition structure?

1350
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Mainly because iron

1351
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
also expands at high temperatures.

1352
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
After expanding to the side of theta,

1353
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
we actually analyzed it.

1354
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
We found that there is about

1355
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
5-10% iron in it.

1356
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
This iron

1357
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
is a beta-theta stabilizer.

1358
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
This was also mentioned

1359
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
in the preliminary study.

1360
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
OK.

1361
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Thank you.

1362
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Can we ask

1363
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Y.H. Guo

1364
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
to explain your question?

1365
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
OK.

1366
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I'm more of an application person.

1367
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Can you hear me?

1368
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I can hear you.

1369
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I'm more of an application person.

1370
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
But there are also people in my lab

1371
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
working on materials.

1372
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So I understand

1373
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
that it may be a practical

1374
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
application issue.

1375
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
First of all,

1376
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I mentioned the AM part.

1377
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I'm more curious about

1378
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
the AM part.

1379
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Is it locked in any application?

1380
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
For the AM application,

1381
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
we are working on

1382
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
lightweight...

1383
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Traditionally...

1384
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
In the preliminary study,

1385
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
they didn't mention

1386
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
the AM part in detail.

1387
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But the possibility

1388
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
is that

1389
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
the AM application

1390
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
is made

1391
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
from super-thin-waves

1392
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
combined with

1393
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
aluminum alloy

1394
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and copper.

1395
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
After forming

1396
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
such a composite structure,

1397
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
it will be cut.

1398
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
In this way,

1399
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
the super-thin-waves

1400
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
will be cut.

1401
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's like

1402
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
creating a composite structure.

1403
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Yes.

1404
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
In the end,

1405
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
it will be cut.

1406
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But in this way,

1407
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
the material consumption

1408
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
will not be as much as

1409
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
traditional CNC cutting.

1410
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
OK.

1411
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And...

1412
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
In your conclusion,

1413
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
you mentioned

1414
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
the super-thin-waves.

1415
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I'm more curious about

1416
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
how thin it should be

1417
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
to be good enough.

1418
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Because it will affect

1419
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
the smoothness of the

1420
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
manufacturing process.

1421
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Yes.

1422
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
For the super-thin-waves,

1423
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
we want to provide

1424
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
a very flat surface.

1425
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Because it's flat,

1426
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
once two blades

1427
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
are pressed together,

1428
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
the contact point of the interface

1429
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
is not enough.

1430
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Here, I use

1431
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
a relatively flat surface.

1432
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The RASA is about

1433
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
0.1 microns.

1434
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
OK.

1435
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
0.1 microns.

1436
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Yes.

1437
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But this is the result of

1438
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
oxidized aluminum powder.

1439
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
We didn't do it for a long time.

1440
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
About 10 to 20 seconds.

1441
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
The surface is really smooth.

1442
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
OK.

1443
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And...

1444
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You mentioned that

1445
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
aluminum and iron

1446
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
don't mix.

1447
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Is that right?

1448
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yes.

1449
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I understand.

1450
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yes.

1451
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Aluminum and iron

1452
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
don't mix.

1453
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Aluminum and iron

1454
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
don't mix.

1455
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Aluminum and iron

1456
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
are oxidized.

1457
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Aluminum and iron

1458
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
meet.

1459
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Aluminum and iron

1460
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
are oxidized.

1461
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Aluminum and iron

1462
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
are oxidized.

1463
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Aluminum and iron

1464
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
are oxidized.

1465
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Aluminum and iron

1466
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
are oxidized.

1467
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Aluminum and iron

1468
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
are oxidized.

1469
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Aluminum and iron

1470
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
are oxidized.

1471
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Aluminum and iron

1472
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
are oxidized.

1473
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Aluminum and iron

1474
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
are oxidized.

1475
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Aluminum and iron

1476
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
are oxidized.

1477
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Aluminum and iron

1478
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
are oxidized.

1479
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Aluminum and iron

1480
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
are oxidized.

1481
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Ningnew

1482
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
are oxidized.

1483
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Sorry,

1484
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I have a question.

1485
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I made a video

1486
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
with

1487
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Laser Metal 3D

1488
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Laser Metal 3D

1489
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
When they were scanning

1490
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
the metal powder,

1491
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
it was a bit like melting.

1492
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
They used a welding machine.

1493
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I'm curious.

1494
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
When I made that video,

1495
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
you mentioned that

1496
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
there are oxidization problems.

1497
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Will aluminum oxidize

1498
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
in your research?

1499
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Will aluminum oxidize

1500
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
in your research?

1501
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
In fact,

1502
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
in most cases,

1503
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
aluminum oxidizes

1504
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
after grinding.

1505
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
We will measure the thickness of the oxidizing film.

1506
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
The thickness of the oxidizing film

1507
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
may be less than 100 nanometers.

1508
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It doesn't affect

1509
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
our research.

1510
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
You can see that

1511
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
we focus on

1512
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
SEM.

1513
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
SEM is a few microns ahead and behind.

1514
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
In this case, we didn't see

1515
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
any obvious oxidization.

1516
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
About oxidization research,

1517
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
there are a lot of advanced research.

1518
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
They use a small-density analysis method.

1519
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
So this method

1520
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
doesn't need to be done in a non-oxidized environment.

1521
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
In fact, it doesn't need to be done in a non-oxidized environment.

1522
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Why?

1523
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Because after high-temperature bonding,

1524
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
it doesn't affect

1525
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
the atmosphere

1526
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
in the middle of the bonding point.

1527
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Therefore,

1528
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
when we cut it in half

1529
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and look at the interface analysis,

1530
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
we found that there was no obvious oxidization.

1531
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
OK.

1532
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
If there is, it's all micro-density.

1533
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It has to go to PPM,

1534
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
such as using atomic carbon

1535
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
OK.

1536
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Got it.

1537
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Thank you.

1538
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Thank you.

1539
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Can we ask Matt Sly

1540
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
to ask you a question?

1541
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Hello.

1542
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Thank you for

1543
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
your wonderful speech.

1544
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I have three questions.

1545
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
First, you said that

1546
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
IMC has an impact on strength.

1547
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I want to know

1548
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
how to define

1549
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
its impact on strength.

1550
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Since IMC can form bonding,

1551
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
its strength should be stronger.

1552
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Why is its strength

1553
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
not good?

1554
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Yes.

1555
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Regarding the strength of IMC,

1556
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
we have established it

1557
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
in a more basic concept.

1558
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Traditionally,

1559
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
thick IMCs

1560
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
usually form a large amount of IMCs

1561
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
at high temperatures.

1562
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
A large amount of IMCs

1563
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
has a negative effect.

1564
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
On the other hand,

1565
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
if we

1566
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
control the bonding conditions

1567
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
precisely,

1568
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
it can form

1569
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
a more detailed IMC image.

1570
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
On the other hand,

1571
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
it has a better impact

1572
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
on the bonding strength.

1573
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
This diagram

1574
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
shows that

1575
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
IMC thickness

1576
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
has an impact on bonding strength.

1577
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
However,

1578
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
if it is too thick,

1579
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
its bonding strength will decrease.

1580
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I see.

1581
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The second question is

1582
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
you just mentioned

1583
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the roughness.

1584
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Basically,

1585
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
the whole technology

1586
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
requires some roughness

1587
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
on the surface.

1588
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
When you have high temperatures,

1589
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
it can melt the surface

1590
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
at the same time.

1591
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You also mentioned

1592
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
the better the surface,

1593
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
the better the bonding strength.

1594
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Is there a

1595
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
roughness limit?

1596
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
The roughness limit

1597
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
is based on

1598
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
the smoothness

1599
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
of the surface.

1600
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
For example,

1601
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
if we use 1 micrometer

1602
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
of oxidized aluminum

1603
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
to measure the surface,

1604
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
we can see that

1605
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
the surface is smooth

1606
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
and the surface surface is smooth.

1607
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
However,

1608
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
if we use a

1609
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
thicker surface

1610
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
to measure the surface,

1611
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
the contact point

1612
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
will be reduced.

1613
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
The less contact points,

1614
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
the less bonding strength.

1615
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The more contact points,

1616
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
the better bonding strength.

1617
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
On the other hand,

1618
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
as you mentioned before,

1619
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
there should be contact points.

1620
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
If the surface is smooth

1621
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and there are no contact points,

1622
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
there will be no friction.

1623
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Theoretically,

1624
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
it is possible.

1625
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
However,

1626
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
in terms of

1627
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
our current technology,

1628
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
it is OK

1629
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
if the surface is smooth to a certain extent.

1630
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
However,

1631
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
this is what we can imagine.

1632
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Thank you.

1633
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
My last question is

1634
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
that you said that

1635
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
it should be applied

1636
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
to the frame of the car.

1637
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Basically,

1638
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
the frame of the car

1639
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
is three-dimensional,

1640
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and the experiment

1641
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
you do here is

1642
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
two-dimensional.

1643
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
In the future,

1644
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
will it be possible

1645
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
to make a car frame

1646
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that is three-dimensional

1647
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
with three-dimensional

1648
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
car frame?

1649
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Because in the future,

1650
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
there will be no

1651
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
three-dimensional car frame.

1652
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
We don't know

1653
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
whether the car can be

1654
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
made in three-dimensional.

1655
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
We don't know

1656
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
if it can be

1657
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
made in three-dimensional.

1658
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
In other words,

1659
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
it can be applied

1660
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
to some points

1661
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
in the three-dimensional

1662
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
structure of the car body.

1663
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
It is mainly

1664
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
the connection between

1665
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
the engine cover,

1666
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and the structure of

1667
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
the car body.

1668
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It is relatively difficult

1669
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
to combine large areas of

1670
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
supercardioid combination

1671
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
as of now.

1672
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Can we ask Mr. Huang

1673
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
to ask you a question?

1674
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Yes.

1675
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Can I ask a question?

1676
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Sure.

1677
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I have two or three questions.

1678
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The first one is

1679
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
that what you are doing now

1680
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
is basically based on

1681
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
a balanced project.

1682
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I have a curious question.

1683
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
How do you control

1684
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
whether it produces IMC

1685
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
or solid solution?

1686
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
It mainly depends on

1687
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
the combination of

1688
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
the two materials.

1689
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
In the beginning,

1690
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
our judgment was based on

1691
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
a two-dimensional picture.

1692
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
In addition,

1693
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
let's take this picture as an example.

1694
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It is enough for us to increase

1695
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
to about 5,600 degrees.

1696
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
With some expansion,

1697
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
we can get

1698
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
such a BCC structure.

1699
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
On the other hand,

1700
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
if the BCC is too high,

1701
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
but the expansion also increases,

1702
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
the amount of expansion also increases,

1703
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
it may form another aspect,

1704
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
such as IMC, solid solution,

1705
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
or solid-solid solution, etc.

1706
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
In other words,

1707
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the control of the

1708
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
product itself

1709
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
mainly depends on

1710
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
the conditions of interface reaction,

1711
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
such as temperature, time, etc.

1712
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It's hard to judge.

1713
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
The second question is

1714
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
because both are

1715
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
single elements,

1716
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
if the other side is

1717
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
BCC,

1718
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
or some special

1719
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
metal-solid solution,

1720
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
is it possible that

1721
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
it will produce some

1722
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
unequal attacks during the manufacturing process?

1723
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
In this case, will it affect

1724
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
the interface?

1725
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Or will it not affect the interface

1726
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
during the process?

1727
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
The temperature of the BCC

1728
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
may be higher than the temperature of the BCC.

1729
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Yes,

1730
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
if it's a low-temperature material,

1731
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
it's true that it can be

1732
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
liquefied.

1733
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
For example,

1734
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
the new solution

1735
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
is only 400 degrees Celsius.

1736
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
If it's more than 400 degrees Celsius,

1737
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
the temperature of the BCC

1738
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
will exceed the temperature of the solution.

1739
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
In this case,

1740
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
you have to consider

1741
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
whether the strength of the BCC

1742
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
has a positive effect on the interface.

1743
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
If it's a negative effect,

1744
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
you may choose to skip

1745
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
the application of this material.

1746
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
The previous question

1747
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
is about multi-elements,

1748
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
such as BCC

1749
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
or metal-solid solution.

1750
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Is it possible

1751
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
that it will produce some unequal attacks?

1752
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
It's possible.

1753
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Because it's a short-term solution,

1754
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
it will produce some

1755
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
unequal attacks.

1756
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It's possible that

1757
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
the overall analysis will be difficult.

1758
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Generally speaking,

1759
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
if there is an interface issue,

1760
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
it may not be a good thing for bonding.

1761
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Yes,

1762
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
why is it not necessarily a good thing?

1763
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Because once the interface

1764
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
has an issue,

1765
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
it will slowly go back to the temperature.

1766
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
The cooling effect

1767
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
will change the volume.

1768
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Most of the time,

1769
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
you will see that

1770
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
there are many unequal holes

1771
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
under the temperature.

1772
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
These holes are usually not conducive

1773
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
to the strength of the interface.

1774
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I see.

1775
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
The last question is about the interface.

1776
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
You will produce this IMC.

1777
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So, in your opinion,

1778
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
this IMC is the main cause

1779
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
of the linear deformation.

1780
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Is that right?

1781
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Linear motion.

1782
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Is your IMC

1783
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
generated later or linear motion?

1784
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It still supports linear motion.

1785
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Because it's harder,

1786
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
it will lead to linear deformation.

1787
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Generally speaking,

1788
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
it is generated

1789
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
after the surrounding

1790
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
linear deformation ability

1791
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
is better.

1792
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Then, it may be formed

1793
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
by the interface as the integration point.

1794
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Sometimes,

1795
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
you will find that

1796
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
the IMC will be erased.

1797
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It is brittle.

1798
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It can't improve the ability

1799
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
of linear deformation

1800
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
on the whole.

1801
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So, it has no auxiliary function.

1802
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Yes.

1803
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So, it is quite hard.

1804
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It is generated

1805
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
from the expansion layer

1806
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
and the manufacturing process.

1807
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It's like this.

1808
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's possible.

1809
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Let's take this picture as an example.

1810
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Let's say it reaches 500°C.

1811
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
At the end of the friction,

1812
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
the temperature may drop.

1813
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Although it's a short time,

1814
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
it may be generated

1815
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
in this situation.

1816
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
But we don't have the so-called

1817
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
zero tower observation.

1818
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So, it's hard to be sure

1819
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
whether the IMC is generated

1820
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
here or at the end.

1821
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Is there any specificity of the IMC

1822
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
or is it random?

1823
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
The specificity depends on

1824
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
the material itself.

1825
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Some are obvious,

1826
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
some are not.

1827
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
For example,

1828
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
it's not obvious

1829
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
because it's too small.

1830
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It's beyond EBSD's

1831
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
detection limit.

1832
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I see.

1833
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It's quite interesting.

1834
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Thank you.

1835
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Thank you.

1836
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Any other questions?

1837
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
No more questions?

1838
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
If they have any questions,

1839
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
they can send an email to you.

1840
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Okay.

1841
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It's the same email.

1842
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
The traditional email.

1843
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Okay.

1844
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Thank you for your

1845
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
wonderful presentation.

1846
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Thank you for coming

1847
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
to explain your research.

1848
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It's very interesting.

1849
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You're welcome.

1850
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
That's all

1851
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
for today's presentation.

1852
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
If you

1853
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
haven't

1854
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
joined

1855
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Taira's team,

1856
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
you can

1857
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
fill in the form.

1858
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I will

1859
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
stop the recording

1860
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
now.
