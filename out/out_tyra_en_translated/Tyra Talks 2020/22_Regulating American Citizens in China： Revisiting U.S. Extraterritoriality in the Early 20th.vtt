00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Recording has started.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
In fact, he was originally a law student at NTU Law School.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
He had studied in the Department of Law at Hokkaido University in Japan for a year.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Not only did he complete his law degree, he also obtained a lawyer's license.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
He also worked at a large law firm in Taiwan and Japan.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
To add to that, Ming-Hsi and I have known each other for a long time.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
We were classmates in the same year at NTU Law School.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
In our hearts, Ming-Hsi has always been a strong character like a god.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
We thought it was difficult for him to study law.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We didn't expect him to be able to study history.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Not only that, he is also the president of NTU's Food & Beverage Association.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
To us, he has always been a very strong god.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
He also won countless books.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I think it's very impressive.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
What's cool about Ming-Hsi is that he always follows a two-way path.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
He studies both law and history at the same time.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
At the moment, he is in the Department of History at NTU Law School.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
He also combined his two-way background with his major.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
His field of research includes modern international law history,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
East Asian legal modernization,

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Sino-US relations history,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
international economic law and tax law, and so on.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
I was thinking about today's topic, foreign law.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
For many people, foreign law is a familiar and uncertain concept.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
So let's talk about the rules of today's speech.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Today's speech is actually quite simple.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
If you have any questions,

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
you can either turn on your microphone and ask the speaker directly.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Ming-Hsi likes this kind of interactive speech mode.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Or if you are shy or worried about affecting the speaker's flow,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
you can also post your questions in the chat area.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
I will find the right time to ask.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
After Ming-Hsi finishes his speech,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
we will also have a Q&A session.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
If everyone is okay,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
let's welcome Ming-Hsi.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Hello, everyone.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Can you see my PowerPoint?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Okay.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Thank you for your introduction.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
As Yi-An said,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
we are both university classmates.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
But in the legal department of NTU,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I think Yi-An and I are quite different.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Yi-An left the legal department to study psychology

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
and became a lawyer.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
I am honored to have Yi-An as my host.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Today's topic is

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
controlling US citizens in China.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
This is my research plan for the first-year students

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
in the history department of NTU.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
This plan is still in the early stages,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
so I would like to share it with you.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I found that in this project,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
there are fewer liberal arts students.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
So I will spend a little more time

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
to introduce to you

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
the current situation of humanities

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
and legal studies in the US.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
So today's speech will be divided into several parts.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
One is self-introduction.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
But I don't think I need to introduce too much,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
because Yi-An has given me a very detailed explanation.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
The second part is to share with you

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
what history is.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
This is actually a common question for everyone.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And I am often asked by teachers

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
in different departments or classmates.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Because history is abstract.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
We can say that what happened in the past is history.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
There are so many things in history.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
As a historian or a doctoral student in history,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
how do we choose the topic?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
How do we do research?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
In other words, what are the doctoral students

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
in the history department doing?

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Why do I want to study legal history?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
What is the relationship between law and history?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
In particular, why do I want to choose the topic

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
of international law as my research topic?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
After the introduction of these major subjects

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
and the background,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I will talk about my initial research in the first year.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
That is, what is the foreign law in the United States?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
In the past, in high school textbooks,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
we often heard that foreign law

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
is a part of an unequal treaty.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
In the past, our country or China

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
suffered a lot of unequal treatment.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Then it was a matter of losing power.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Is it true? Is it true?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Did the United States benefit from this?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Who benefited from this?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
The first research in the history department

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
is to clarify some facts and some institutional backgrounds.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
The higher level is to develop theories.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
So in the end, I want to talk about my future plan.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
How do I develop these facts and their theoretical meanings

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
and then carry out my future research?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
So here, actually,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yi-An has already introduced it to me.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm not drunk.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I want to talk about the last point.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
That is, why do I want to study history?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
In fact, my initial goal was

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
to teach in a law school in the United States.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Here, I think there is something very interesting

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
that I can share with you.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
In the United States, professional schools,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
such as law schools,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
their practice is very different from

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
what we usually do in history, physics, or math.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
As a historian, I will tell you

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
what the origin and evolution of this system is.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
As you know,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
in the world of legal education,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
North America is very special.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
They do not have legal education in the university.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Unlike in Taiwan, Japan, Germany,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
the United Kingdom, or France,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
we can choose the law department

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
after graduating from high school.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
After graduating from the law department,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
you can take a law exam.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Then you can become a lawyer

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
or continue to study for a master's degree

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
and return to the law department to teach.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
This is not the case in the United States and Canada.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
The U.S. Department of State does not have a law department.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
You have to graduate from the Department of State

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
before you can get your first law degree,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
which is called JD, or Juris Doctor.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
It's the same as MD.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
It has the title of a doctor,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
but it's not a Ph.D. doctor.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
So traditionally,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
when there was a law school in the United States,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
they thought that

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
law was a skill,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
not a subject.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
So in the 19th century,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
the teachers of the law school

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
were some senior lawyers,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
judges, or food workers.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
And the education of the law school

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
was to have these food workers

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
tell you how to become a good lawyer.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
So the course of the law school

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
was very food-oriented.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
It taught you how to sign a contract,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
how to act or defend in front of the jury,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
how to interact and interrogate,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
how to get along with the judge,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
and so on and so forth.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Later, everyone thought

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
that if you teach at school,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
you still need to have a little bit of academic knowledge.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
But there was no such thing as a law Ph.D.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So what should you do?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
There is still a method

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
taught at law schools in the United States

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
called traditional track,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
which allows you to become a teacher of the law school.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
What is traditional track?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
It's when you graduate from college

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and become a JD,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
your first law degree.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
After that,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
you become a lawyer for three years

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
or a judge assistant for three years

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
to gain food experience.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
After gaining food experience,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
you go to the law department of the university

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
to apply for the position of teacher.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
When you're a teacher,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
it's usually three years.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
You have to teach on the side.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
What you teach is to teach some legal writing,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
mathematical writing, and so on.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
These are related to food.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
During the three years you teach,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
you have to write a master's thesis.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
If this master's thesis is well written,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
you can go to various schools

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
and apply for the position of assistant professor.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Once you become an assistant professor,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
you'll be like other departments.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
You'll start writing thesis,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
升等,教書, and so on.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
But later,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
in the 1970s or 1980s,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
we found that

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
the failure of being a fellow

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
and not becoming an assistant professor

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
is very high.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
This can also be seen.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
In JD for three years,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
you're learning how to write a book,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
and then you become a lawyer for three years.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
It doesn't make sense.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
When you go back to law school,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
you suddenly start writing a thesis.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Like everyone here,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
we all study Ph.D.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
We all know that

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
writing a thesis requires a lot of practice,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
and then you need someone to lead.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
You need a lot of research methods, and so on.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
So later, the U.S. Law School

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
came up with a new way

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
to make you a teacher,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
which is the so-called JD Ph.D. double degree.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
In other words,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
you get a Ph.D. in another field,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
such as history, economics,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
politics, language,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
psychology, and so on.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Then you go to JD,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
and then you become a lawyer for two years.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
At this point, you don't have to be a fellow,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
and you can take your Ph.D. thesis

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
and apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Basically,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
all the new professors at the U.S. Law School

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
are JD Ph.D. double degrees.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
This is my original goal.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I want to get a Ph.D. in history first,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and then I want to get a Ph.D. in JD.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Then I can apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
There are more and more Chinese people

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
applying for a Ph.D. degree

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
at the U.S. Law School

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
through this kind of double degree.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
But as far as I know,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
no one in Taiwan

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
has applied for a Ph.D. degree

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
at the U.S. Law School in this way.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So I want to give it a try.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Next,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
in the past,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
most of the Ph.D. and JD degrees

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
were obtained at different schools.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
For example,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Professor Ian Ayers,

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
who is very famous for

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
doing legal economic analysis

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
at Yale University.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
He was MIT's Econ Ph.D.,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
plus Yale's JD,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
and then he taught at Yale.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
For people in mainland China,

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
for example,

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Professor Li Ji at UC Irvine,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
he was a political science Ph.D.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
at Northwestern University,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
plus Yale's JD,

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
and then he taught law at UC Irvine.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
So this is what I want to challenge.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I want to practice and hone my knowledge

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
in the history department,

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
learn the methods of history,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
and write papers.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Later on,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
in the last stage of my Ph.D. program,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
in the 6th, 7th, or 8th year,

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
I applied for a Ph.D. degree

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
at another school.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I was a lawyer in the U.S. for two years,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and then I taught at a law school.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
This is a brief explanation

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
of why I want to

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
apply for a Ph.D. degree in history.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
On the one hand,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I always have this idea of cross-field.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I think this kind of training and environment in the U.S.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
is the best fit for my research.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
The last thing I want to add is that

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I just said that

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Taiwanese have not yet read Ph.D. and JD,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
right?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
The next question must be

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
that in Taiwan's law department,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
there are many legal scholars

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
who claim to have obtained a Ph.D. degree in the U.S.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
What kind of degree did they read?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
What kind of career path did they embark on?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Since they are different from Americans

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
who cultivate law schools,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
they must have a different set of things, right?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
So I wrote LLM and JSD here later.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Here I would like to explain to you

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
what this is.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
LLM is generally translated as

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
a legal master's degree.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
It is a Latin abbreviation.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
It means that

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
if you are not in the U.S. today,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
for example, the U.K., France,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Taiwan, or Japan,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
you have already studied law in college.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
So it is an abbreviation

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
for a legal master's degree

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
for foreigners.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
This is called LLM.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
You only need to study for nine months

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
without writing a paper.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Then you can be qualified

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
to be a lawyer in New York.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So in most cases,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
in general, in Taiwan or Japan,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
if you have been a lawyer for three or five years

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
and you think you need to retire,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
you can go to the U.S.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
and study for nine months.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Among these LLM students,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
some may be interested in academics.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
So you can find a professor

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
who is willing to teach you

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
while you are studying LLM.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Then you can enroll

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
and become a JSD,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
which we generally call

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
a legal master's degree.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
This JSD is actually very different

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
from our general Ph.D.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Because once you enroll,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
you are a doctoral candidate.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
So you don't need to take classes,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
you don't need to be a teacher,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
you don't need to be a lecturer.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
In principle, if you write a paper,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
you can graduate after the exam.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
So there are some very famous

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
LLM teachers in China.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
They may only study JSD for a year and a half

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
or two years

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
before they graduate.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
There are a lot of people like this.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Because JSD is not like

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
our Ph.D. training,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
you have to take classes,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
take exams,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
be a lecturer,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
teach, and so on.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
So the problem with a JSD graduate

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
is that

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
their quality is not very certain.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Some people are JSD,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
their boss has very high requirements for them,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
asking them to continue to take classes,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
continue to study methods,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
or take the qualification exam with them.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Or some students are very smart.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
I have a lot of JSD teachers

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
in the Department of Law in Canada.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
They are very smart.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
They watch the lecturers

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
have a seminar in the law school every day,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
and they will kill each other.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
They watch Huashan's paper every day

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
and become a big family.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
After they return to China,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
they can be a Ph.D.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
and teach law in Taiwan.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
But in the US Department of Law,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
you can hardly see any teachers

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
who are JSD.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Because they are

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Ph.D. for foreigners.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
This is a brief introduction.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I used to think that

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
if I went to the US to study law,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I could just study LLM and JSD.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
But I thought,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
no,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I want to try to

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
receive the same training as Americans.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
If Americans want to become a professor of law,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I will become a professor of law.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
So I started with Ph.D.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Later,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
in my senior year,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I will see if I can get a J.D.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
and try to find a job

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
in the US Department of Law.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Next, I will answer a question.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
What is history?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
I am often asked this question.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But I think this is a disaster question.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
It's like I want to ask,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
what is physics?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
What is math?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
It is difficult to define a subject.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
But I think I can try

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
to look at this subject

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
from a more specific perspective.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
What is it?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I think from the perspective of abstract theory,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
in the Western context,

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
history is also a method of philosophy.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
In other words,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
the research we do in history

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
is the same as asking a question,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
giving it a false hypothesis,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
and then verifying it, right?

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
It is the same as philosophy, physics, and chemistry.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
We need to ask a question,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
and then use some methods to answer it,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
to verify if your hypothesis is correct.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Of course, this is a bit of nonsense.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Because anyone who studies Ph.D.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
has to do this kind of study.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So I think we can look at history

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
from a different perspective.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Whether it is Greece or China,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
people in ancient times

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
have a cycle of history.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
By cycle of history,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I mean that

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
for them,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
history is something that

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
happens over and over again.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
For example,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
in the Tang Dynasty,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Emperor Taizong said that

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
history is the key to understanding the mind.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
In other words,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
as long as you study the past,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
you will learn some lessons.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
By cycle of history,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I mean that

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
there is nothing new under the sun.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
So I understand the past,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
and I understand the future.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Because what happened in the past

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
will keep happening over and over again.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So as long as I know the past,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I will know how to face the same thing in the future.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
What should I do when it happens again?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
But as we all know,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
this is a kind of fantasy.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
How is it possible that

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
people 200 years ago

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
would face the same problems

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
as we do now?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Of course, it is different.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
In the 18th and 19th centuries,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
history was taken over by the state.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
There was a very

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
purposeful approach

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
to help

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
build a democratic country.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
For example,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
when Germany was about to be unified,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
a group of historians came out

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
and wrote history of Germany.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
They told us that we were different

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
from the Italians.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
We have a glorious history.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Who is German?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
We have a common memory.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
This also happened

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
in the end of the Qing Dynasty

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
and the beginning of the Republic of China.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Chinese historians told you

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
that we are all descendants of the Yan Emperor.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So we have a common ancestor.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
We must agree that we are all Chinese.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So for a while,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
history was used by the state

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
to build the common memory of the nation.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
In the 19th century,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
there was another trend.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Social science,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
political science,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
and other social sciences

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
wanted to become

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
like natural science

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
and discover the common principles

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
of human society.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
They wanted to analyze

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
why the French Revolution happened,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
what its causal relationship was,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
and what its social background conditions were.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
If we can build

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
a abstract theory

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
that the French Revolution

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
will happen

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
when the four conditions

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
are met,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
we can predict

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
when the next revolution will happen

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
or prevent it from happening.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Another famous example

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
is Marx.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
He said that human history

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
has a process.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
We will go from feudalism

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
to a small class revolution

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
to a large class revolution.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Many historians' work

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
is to prove

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
the theory of social science

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
and the process

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
of social science principles.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Until now,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
many historians in mainland China

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
are still trying to prove

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
the process of Marxism

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
in China.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
This is the purpose

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
of the third kind of history.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
The fourth kind of history

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
is similar to the second kind of history,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
but it starts to ask smaller questions.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Historians want to

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
understand the history of the past

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
and develop quantitative studies

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
of economics or politics.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
The most famous example

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
is Professor Daniel Clerman

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
at the University of South Carolina.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
He taught at the University of Chicago

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
because his wife was a lawyer

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
who was afraid of the cold.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
His family moved to South Carolina.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
He is a history doctor

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and a law professor

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
at the University of Chicago.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
His research is very interesting.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
He uses the documents

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
and information

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
he discovered

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
in history training

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and his strong

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
statistical and quantitative background

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
to do some

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
theoretical practical research.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Some questions

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
are difficult to answer.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Does judicial independence

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
help economic development?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
We are not like natural science,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
which can control all variables

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
in the laboratory.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
When we want to study this topic,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
we have to do some social experiment

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
to do the cause-and-effect theory,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and we need to find

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
a lot of agent variables.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Every time a country

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
does judicial independence reform,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
it often follows

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
many other reforms at the same time.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
This is the best way

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
to understand the relationship

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
between judicial independence

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
and economic development in the UK.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Professor Dan Clearman

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
has some very good information.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
For example,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
he found that

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
in the 18th and 19th centuries,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
the UK was doing judicial independence reform.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
At the same time,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
East India Company

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
was listed

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
in London Stock Exchange

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
because

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
there was no

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
good information transmission system.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Therefore, news from London

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
had to wait three or five days

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
before it could be sent to Amsterdam.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
He thought

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
that the agent variables

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
of economic development

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
were the high and low prices

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
of East India Company's shares.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Whenever a judicial independence

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
law or reform

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
occurred in the UK,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
East India Company's shares

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
would rise or fall

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
when the news

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
was sent to Amsterdam.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
He used statistics

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
to infer the situation in the UK.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
In the end,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
he concluded that

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
every judicial independence reform

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
in the UK

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
had something to do

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
with the rise of

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
East India Company's shares.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Without historical training,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
East India Company's shares

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
would not have risen.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
This is another theory.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
In the early years,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
there was a theory

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
that asked

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
why there was

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
no China in the West.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
In the early years,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
historians liked to ask

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
why there was no capitalism in China,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
why there was no scientific revolution in China,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and why there was no

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
revolution in China.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The next theory is

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
very popular recently,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
but it is a bit similar

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
to the idea of a national state.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Historians believe that

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
the people's historical memory

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
should not serve the country.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Therefore,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
historians began to write

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
some important historical memories.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
For example,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
transitional justice should tell you

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
that the Nazi massacre

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
against the Jews

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
was really horrible.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
We should remember this

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
forever.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Because it happened once,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
it may happen again.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
The main consciousness of Taiwan

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
must be awakened,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
because the people of Taiwan

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
have been oppressed for the past 400 years.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
These popular historical writings

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
are actually shaping historical memory.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Another group of people

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
believe that

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
history should not serve the country,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
so there are a lot of historical studies

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
to deconstruct the national state.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
For example,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
tradition is invented,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and tradition does not have

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
a long history of 5,000 years.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
The so-called descendants of the King of Japan

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
only appeared for 100 years.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
The so-called Japanese cuisine

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
was invented after the Ming Dynasty.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
In the Middle Ages,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
the Emperor of Japan believed in Buddhism,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
so he told everyone not to eat meat.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
In ancient East Asia,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
there were four categories of animals

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
in the world,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
such as grass fish and birds.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
At that time,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
the Emperor of Japan said

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
that everyone was not allowed to eat meat,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
grass fish and birds.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
In fact,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
before the Ming Dynasty,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
the Japanese did not eat beef or pork,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
so the so-called barbecue and fried pork chops

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
were far-fetched Japanese cuisine.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
They appeared in the late 19th century

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
and even in the early 20th century.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Finally, I think history

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
is different from everyone else.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
In politics and sociology,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
they ask more objective questions,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
but in history,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
they also ask subjective questions.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Traditional sociology

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
may ask a question,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
such as

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
whether the exam system

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
has promoted social movement.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
So some historical sociologists

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
will look for a lot of past history

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
to see if there are some

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
poor and hard-working people

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
who became good officials

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
because of the imperial examination,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
and then flew to Tengda

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
and became famous

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
from the Han dynasty.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
But historical sociology

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
will ask a question.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Objectively,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
even if the imperial examination

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
really promoted social movement,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
did the people at that time

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
really realize that

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
the imperial examination

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
promoted social movement?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
In the Han dynasty,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
there were some economic works.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
We can find out from economics

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
what is the meaning of

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Chou Chou's The Theory of Economics?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
What does it mean in economics?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
But historians may ask

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
a person who has not studied

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
modern economics,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
has not studied Adam Smith,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
or has not studied economics

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
in NTU,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
how can he write The Theory of Economics?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I think this is the difference

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
between historical sociology

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
and other subjects.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
The next question is

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
what is legal history?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Why is legal history

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
a field worth studying

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
for me?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
The first argument is,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
of course,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
all the legal experts in the court

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
are historians,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
because the court can only

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
judge what has happened.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I am going to discuss

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
whether Su Jianhe killed someone

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
in the past or not.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Is he guilty or not?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
We can only discuss

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
whether he killed someone in the past.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
The court cannot decide

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
whether he will kill someone in the future.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
This is a matter of fact.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
The court can only deal with

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
what has happened.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
From the legal point of view,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
when we make a judgment,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
the court will always

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
make a judgment.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
In the tradition of British and American law,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
there are many cases

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
that are not in the text,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
so you have to tell everyone

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
whether the case in front of you

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
is the same as the case in the past.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
If it is the same,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
you should apply the same law.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
If it is different,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
you should make another explanation.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
There are some famous cases

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
where, for example,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
a court said that

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
A car must pay

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
$10,000.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Later,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
a new case came out

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
where

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
A was hit by B car.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Then

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
A told the court

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
that the driver of B car

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
should pay me $10,000.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
But the lawyer of B car said

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
no, no, no,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
our case is different from A car.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Because A car is black

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
and B car is red.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Because humans are more alert

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
when they see a red car.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
So

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
when they are hit,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
they have to take more responsibility

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
because they see a red car.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
British and American law

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
has been debating this kind of thing,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
so you have to keep looking at

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
the past cases

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
as they are now.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Then you need a lot of

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
historical training

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
The second thing is that

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
there is a saying in English

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
that the past is like a foreign country.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
So when we study

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
the history of law,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
it's like we are studying

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
another country.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
So it's like we are now in Taiwan,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
we are going to legislate.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
We will refer to what the Japanese do,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
what the Germans do,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
what the Americans do.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Because these comparisons

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
can give you some ideas.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
But if you refer to other countries,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
you will be surprised.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Because from a psychological point of view,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
people all have this

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
in-domain effect.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It's not good to play big

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
in front of the case.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
But you will think

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
what you have is the best.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
But sometimes when you look at

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
foreign things,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
you will know that

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
there are many different ways

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
in this world.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
For example, if I want to control

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
cigarettes,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
can I refer to

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
how people controlled

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
opium in the past?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Of course, opium and cigarettes

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
are different things.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
But you can think about

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
some new ideas.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
The second thing is that

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
we all know that

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
humans have a path to rely on.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
There is one thing that people

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
have been doing for a long time,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
and the legal history

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
can help you understand

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
the background of this system

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and its reasons.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
What did people think at that time?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
After understanding the reason for

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
the path to rely on,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
we should now verify that

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
this condition no longer exists

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
or the condition has changed,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
which means that

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
we should do something different.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
For example,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
in the debate on same-sex marriage,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
it is said that two people

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
of the same sex can get married.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
If not, why?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
If there is, why?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Has it really changed now?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Another common legal history

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
is the debate on

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
the structure of mainstream.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
For example, we used to think

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
that Hitler's Nazi was terrible

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
because he killed Jews.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
He set up a prison court

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
and let the judge judge

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
that homosexuals and Jews

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
are inferior species

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
and are not suitable for having children.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
On the other hand,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
the United States

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
is a free and democratic defender.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Through World War II,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
the United States

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
liberated

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
these oppressed people.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
James Whitman,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
a professor at Yale University,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
is also a doctor of history.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
He wrote a book

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
called Hitler's American Model.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
He said that

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Hitler's

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
racial discrimination law

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
was widely referred to

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
in the United States

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
as the law of racial discrimination

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
that oppresses black people.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
In fact, Hitler once said

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
that Americans were too fierce to black people.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
We can't be so fierce.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
So, how did Hitler

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
know how to use the law

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
to oppress minorities?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It came from the United States.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
This is what I am doing now.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I am using the third world approach

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
to look at the international law.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
In the past,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
we thought that the international law

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
was a principle of equal interaction

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
between sovereign states.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But in fact, it was not.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
We know that the international law

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
was once used to oppress

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and to colonize.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
The Third World Approach

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
to International Law

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
has a group of scholars.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Their goal is to tell you

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
how the international law

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
from the European international law

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
to the international law of the world

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
has contributed a lot to China,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Japan, Latin America, etc.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
They want to tell you

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
that the international law

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
is a tool of oppression.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
We should not allow the international law

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
to become a tool of oppression again.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
We must preserve these historical memories.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
This is what I think

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
the legal history is doing.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Before I share my research,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I would like to know

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
if you have any questions.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I can answer first.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I would like to know

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
what is the general history

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
and what is the legal history.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I think I have learned a lot.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Even if I am a lawyer,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I think I have learned a lot.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Should I continue?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It seems that

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
everyone is still digesting.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
The information is a bit large.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I will try to speak in plain language.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I don't know if

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
everyone can understand.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I think I have made it clear.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I have heard a lot of concepts

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
for the first time.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I am not sure

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
but you have made it clear today.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
The language is very good.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I think it has helped me

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
to digest so much information.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Can you hear me?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Yes.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I have a question.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I am curious

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
about the background

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
you set up

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
in the beginning.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
What is history?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
The front part

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and the back part

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
are there any differences in views?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
If so,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
what do you think?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Today's speech

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
is mainly to

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
deconstruct nationalism.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
In the past, foreign law

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
was described as

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
a symbol of

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
a third world people,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Chinese, Japanese,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
or non-Western people

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
being oppressed.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
But I will tell you

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
that the actual operation

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
of this theory

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
is based on two things.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
The first is that

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I want to improve

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
the meaning of the theory.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
In the future,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I may want to

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
use other methods

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
of political,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
economic,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
and socialization

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
to make it more abstract

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and more applicable.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I also hope you can

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
give me some advice.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Many people

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
are not familiar with

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
law and history,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
so I hope I can

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
give you a brief introduction

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
of what I am doing in this field.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I also want to

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
take this opportunity

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
to let you know

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
what is the purpose

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
of the American Academy of Law

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and what is the purpose

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
of the American Academy of Law.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Did I answer your question?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Yes, you did.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Thank you.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
If not,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
please continue.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Thank you.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I think the training

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
from Northwestern University

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
is very interesting.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Foreign students

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
have to take a class

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
in English.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
The teacher will teach us

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
some tips.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
When you don't know what to say,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
just take a sip of water.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
No one will ask you

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
why you are drinking water.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Sometimes,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
you can relax

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and think about

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
what you want to say.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Let's move on

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
to the topic of

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
extracurricular law.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Extracurricular law,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
at least for me,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
is a term

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
but we don't know

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
what actually happens

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
to it.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
To put it simply,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
extracurricular law

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
is the privilege that

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
foreigners are not

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
under the jurisdiction

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
of the local courts.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
In other words,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
in 1900,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
if an American

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
stole or committed a crime

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
in China

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
or any other country

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
wanted to sue him,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
the Chinese government

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
and the Chinese courts

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
couldn't do anything

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
because he was under the jurisdiction

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
of the local courts.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Only the U.S. courts

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
or the U.S. courts

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
can deal with such cases.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
This is extracurricular law.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Extracurricular law still exists

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
in some countries.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
For example,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
if an American

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
raped a woman

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
or a child

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
in a local court,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
the Japanese courts

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
couldn't bring him to trial

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
because he was under the jurisdiction

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
of the U.S. courts.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's not that the U.S. courts

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
couldn't bring him to trial,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
but the U.S. courts.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
It sounds unreasonable.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Let's move on.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
The first time that

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
the U.S. signed a treaty

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
was in 1842,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
the Treaty of Nanjing,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
China signed a treaty

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
after the Opium War.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
In this treaty,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
the U.K. required

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
China to provide

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
extracurricular law to the U.K.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
The U.S. signed the treaty

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
in 1844,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
the Treaty of Wangxia,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
China.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
In Chinese textbooks,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
extracurricular law

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
is a symbol of

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
imperialism.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Today, our country's citizens

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
are being bullied.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Why doesn't our country

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
promote justice?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Why does the U.S. court

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
have to bring him to trial?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
The U.S. court

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
must be very biased.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
The U.S. court

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
must tolerate

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
the U.S. people

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
because the U.S. people

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
betrayed the sovereignty

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
of China.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
The U.S. court must

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
revolutionize the U.S.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
The U.S. court

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
must abolish extracurricular law

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
so that the Chinese people

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
will no longer be bullied.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Is it really like this?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Let's move on.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
For example,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
when the U.S. came to China

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
to negotiate the Treaty of Wangxia,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
the U.S. diplomat,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
William Cushing,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
gave a speech

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
in the U.S. Congress.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
He said,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
his proudest moment

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
was when the U.S. wrote

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
the extracurricular law

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
in the Treaty of Wangxia.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Because China

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
is an uncivilized place.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The judges in their countries

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
do not have three powers.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
The county magistrates

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
do not have three powers.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
How can the county magistrates

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
be the judges?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
In Taiwan,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
can He Wen-je be a judge?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
No.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Administrative and judicial

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
should be separated.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
China is an uncivilized country.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
If you commit a serious crime,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
you will be imprisoned,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
you will be tortured,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
you will be beaten.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
If our people

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
are the most advanced species,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
how can we obey the laws of the barbarians?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Therefore,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
obtaining the extracurricular law

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
is a civilized victory.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It sounds like a good idea.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
However,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
historians have found

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
that before 1868,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
we could not find

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
any Chinese history

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
against the extracurricular law.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
This is actually

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
a very strange thing.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
If China is so powerful,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
why does China never object

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
to all the negotiations?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
China thinks it is good.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Why?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
If you want to extracurricular law,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
we will give it to you.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
This question

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
is related to a very popular research topic

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
in recent history,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
which is the multidimensionalism

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
of the empire and the law.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
In fact,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
the majority of human history

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
is dominated by the British

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and the Germans.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
In fact,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
the majority of human history

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
is dominated by the Empire.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
What is the Empire?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
The simplest definition

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
is that

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
under a regime,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
there are many different

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
ethnic groups

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and activists.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
For example,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
the Qing Dynasty

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
was an empire

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
with Han people,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Tibetans,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Mongols,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
ethnic minorities

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
and Xinjiang people.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
The next question is

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
that we all know that

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
there is a law called the Qing Dynasty Law.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
But did the Qing Dynasty Law

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
apply in Tibet?

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Did the Qing Dynasty Law

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
apply in Xinjiang?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
In fact, it did not.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Although the Qing Dynasty Law

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
applied to most empires,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
the Roman Empire

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
also applied the law to the Jews.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
In the Qing Dynasty,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
the Mongols still applied

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
the traditional Mongolian law,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
while the Tibetans still applied the Tibetan law.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Only the Han people

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
applied the Qing Dynasty Law.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
This is understandable.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
When a country is very large

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
and is an empire,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
how could it be possible

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
to force a Mongolian

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
to marry in a Confucian way?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
This is also a question of

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
the cost of rule.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
In order to maintain the operation of an empire

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and the coordination of the ethnic groups,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
you must use different laws

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
to treat different people.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
This is now called

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
the law pluralism.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Does Taiwan want to do the same thing?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Should the indigenous people

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
apply the indigenous law

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
or not?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
From the perspective of China,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
in 1842,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
the British said

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
that they wanted to

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
apply the British law in China.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Think about it.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
What's wrong with

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
the Mongolians

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
applying the Mongolian law

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
and the British applying the British law?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
At that time,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
foreigners could only

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
move around

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
when they came to China.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Basically,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
it did not affect the original life of the Han people.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Therefore,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
there is nothing wrong with

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
giving you a piece of land

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
and having your own law.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
In 1842,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
foreigners were limited to Guangzhou.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
We call it the Guangzhou system.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Originally in Guangzhou,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
in 1842,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
China had already admitted

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
that the Americans could apply the British law

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
in Guangzhou.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Therefore, in 1842 and 1844,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
foreigners came to China

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and told the negotiators

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
that they wanted to apply the foreign law.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
The Chinese thought it was good,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
so they gave it to them.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
However, in 1868,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
people found that something was wrong.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
At first,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
there were many cases

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
in which

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
foreigners committed crimes

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
in China

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and could not be punished.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
In these cases,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
too many countries had foreign law,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
so the legal vacuum was created.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Finally,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
in 1910,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
there were 23 countries with foreign law in China.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
We often see in the files

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
that an American

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
committed a crime

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
and was arrested in the U.S. Court.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
The first defense he made was

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
that he was not an American,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
but an Englishman.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Because he had a lot of passports,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
he kept hiding.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Later, he made Shanghai the most

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
famous criminal heaven in the world,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
because everyone would not be arrested.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
This problem became more and more serious,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
affecting China's security,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
China's economic development,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and so on.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Later,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
he began to think that

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
it was a matter of right to enter the country,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
and we had to oppose it.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
To this day,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
there is a modern meaning.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
For example,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
every year on January 11th,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
there is a Judiciary Day,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
and the Judiciary Council

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
holds a seminar and a celebration.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Why is there a Judiciary Day

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
on January 11th?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Because January 11th, 1943

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
was the day

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
when China and the U.S.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
signed an equal treaty

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
and abolished foreign law.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
They thought that from that day on,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
the judicial system of the Republic of China

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
would no longer be dominated by the West.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Since then,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
the Nationalist government

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
moved to Taiwan in 1949,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
so the Judiciary Day

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
is still on January 11th.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Do you still remember

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
the Lincoln case?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
It was about a British man

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
who died in Taiwan.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Later, he fled the country

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
and returned to the U.K.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
At that time,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
when the U.K. Supreme Court

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
ruled that Lincoln

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
should be transferred back to Taiwan,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
the representative of the U.K.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
was Ambassador St. Luke.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I took his class with Ian.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Ambassador St. Luke was

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
the Minister of Foreign Affairs

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
at the time,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
and I took his class with Ian.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
He wrote in the newspaper

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
that Lincoln should have

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
a symbolic meaning.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Because the law of the U.K.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
and its citizens

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
cannot be transferred to

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
an uncivilized country.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
At that time,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Ambassador St. Luke wrote

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
that the Lincoln case

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
proved that the U.K.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
had already become

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
a legally civilized country,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
so the U.K. would be willing

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
to transfer people back to Taiwan.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
However, when the U.K. Supreme Court

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
overturned the ruling,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
the U.K. was defeated.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
As a result,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
the U.K. had to

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
fight against foreign law.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
My question is very simple.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Is it really easier to fight against

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
foreign law?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
We can see that

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
the U.S. has to maintain

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
a court in China,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and it has to invest a lot of money.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And we can also

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
intuitively find that

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
if a U.S. court

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
in China

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
favors U.S. citizens,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Chinese people

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
should not do business

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
with U.S. citizens.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Chinese people do not want to

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
get along with U.S. citizens,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
which will worsen Sino-U.S. relations

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
and damage U.S. business interests in China.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
My question is

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
if foreign law is really better,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
how does it actually work?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Let's look for its file.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Excuse me, can I ask a question?

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Yes, go ahead.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I want to ask...

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
You can go back to the presentation.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Okay.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I want to ask...

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I want to ask...

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I want to explain that

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
the person who asked the question

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
can introduce himself.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Okay.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I'm Hong Shaoming.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I'm also a post-doc at Caltech.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I graduated from the Department of Psychology at NTU.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I want to ask...

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
When you talk about foreign law,

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
you put foreign law

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
and multilateralism

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
together.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
But their essence is the same.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
At least on the surface,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
when you talk about

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
multilateralism,

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
it feels like you're talking about

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
a country with different laws

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
for different groups.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
But foreign law is about

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
the relationship between

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
countries.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
You mentioned that

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
before 1868,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
China didn't oppose foreign law.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Maybe they thought

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
foreign law was one form

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
of multilateralism.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
After 25 years,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
they thought it wasn't right.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
It wasn't the same as we imagined.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
It's about the relationship

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
between countries.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Do you have any opinion on this?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Do you have any opinion on this?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Thank you.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I should say that

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
under the pre-modern rule,

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
everyone can accept multilateralism.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Because it's a low-cost

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
method that can maintain national governance.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
So most of the current research

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
believes that

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
before 1868,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Chinese central government officials

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
simply believed that

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
it was a matter of multilateralism.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
It's not necessarily within a country.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
For example,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
when the Pope came to China,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
China also respected the idea

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
of using its own laws to deal with

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
its own problems.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
After 1868,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I think it was because

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
China wanted to modernize.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
So in the process of modernization,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
it hoped that the whole country

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
would adopt the same laws.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Because this approach

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
can achieve the central authority

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
and mobilization that modern countries want.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
We can also see that

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
after the founding of the Republic of China,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
China hoped that

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
would adopt the laws of the Republic of China.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
China no longer respected its autonomy.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Its autonomy became very limited.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
The current People's Republic of China

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
also hopes that

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
will adopt the laws of the People's Republic of China.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I think the same is true for Hong Kong.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
At the beginning,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
China thought that

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
it had adopted multilateralism,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
and that Hong Kong people could continue

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
to use the law of the Republic of China.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
However, when China wanted to

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
modernize the country,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
it wanted to adopt

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
multilateralism.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
After all, we are one nation,

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
one country.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Why can't we all

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
use different things?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I think this idea

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
is related to the nature of a nation.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
If all people,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
whether you are Mongolian,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
or Tibetan,

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
are different,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
it means that China

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
is not a single nation.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I think the real difference

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
between multilateralism

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
and unilateralism

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
is the effect

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
it brings

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
on the central power

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
and sovereignty

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
in the process of

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
transferring from the empire

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
to a democratic country.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I think multilateralism

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
and unilateralism

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
are different things.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Not necessarily.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Unilateralism is

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
a legal multilateralism.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Let me think.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Yes, they are different things.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
It should be said that

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
under a democratic country,

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
it wants its people

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
to adopt the same set of laws.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
The reason why foreigners

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
have adopted the same set of laws

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
is because

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
they have the potential

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
to show the spirit

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
of legal multilateralism.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
In some countries,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
however,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
legal multilateralism

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
and unilateralism

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
are different things.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
They think they are different things.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Legal multilateralism is possible,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
but unilateralism is not.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
They can also explain

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
why China did not object

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
to unilateralism.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
In the beginning,

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
they thought it was the same thing.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
They found that

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
it was a different thing.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
When it interfered with

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
the sovereignty of our country,

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
they began to oppose it.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
If such an attack is established,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
legal multilateralism

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
does not seem to be able

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
to support whether foreign law

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
is good or bad.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I think I will go back to

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
what I said at the beginning.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Historians will ask

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
why they could not find

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
opposition in 1868.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
We will think that

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
the subjective will of

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
the historical activists

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
mixed them with

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
legal multilateralism.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
That's right.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
The reason why

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
people did not object

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
is that

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
people at that time

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
did not think

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
it was the same thing.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
In the beginning,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
they thought it was the same thing,

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
so they did not object.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Later, they found that

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
it was not the same thing.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
It seems that

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
the range of influence

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
is not the same.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Anyway,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
we have spent too much time

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
on this topic.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Thank you.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Oh, is that so?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Does it prove that Taiwan

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
is a civilized country?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Well,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
the main reason why

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Taiwan was invited

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
was to ask

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
whether there was a significant difference

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
between the British and the Taiwanese

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
in terms of mass movement.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I see.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Please go on.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
OK, I will finish it soon.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I seem to have a little bit of plagiarism.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I will finish it soon.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
So,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
my research mainly focuses on

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
the judicial reform of the United States

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
in Shanghai in 1906.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
From 1844 to 1905,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
the U.S. did not establish

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
a formal court in China.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Therefore,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
we often hear the term

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
consular trial.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
What is a consular trial?

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
It is when a diplomat

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
consulates as a judge.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
He will be sent to the local consulate

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
to be tried.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Who is a judge?

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
It is a diplomat.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Sometimes,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
this diplomat also has some legislative powers.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
This is a tricky situation.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
When the U.S. criticized

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
China's law of non-discrimination

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
and non-civilization,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
the U.S. did not discriminate.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
The diplomat is an executive,

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
and he has the right to be tried.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
At the same time,

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
the diplomat is not civilized at all.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
The diplomat is more like

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
a governor-general,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
or even more like

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
a magistrate in China,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
like Bao Qingtian,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
who is both a mayor and a judge.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Furthermore,

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
the U.S. was not a rich country

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
at that time.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
The U.S. did not invest

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
a lot of personnel,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
finance,

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
and legal professionals in China.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
For example,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
the U.S. sentenced a person to prison.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
At first,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
the U.S. did not even have a prison.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
The U.S. even rented a prison

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
to the British and French,

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
because the U.S. built a prison

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
in Shanghai earlier than the French.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Why did the U.S. have

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
a legislative reform in 1906?

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
For me,

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
this is a modern Chinese country

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
that has encountered

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
the U.S. imperialism.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
In this video,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
we can see two figures.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
The first figure is

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
the date when the U.S.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
acquired the colony.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
We can see Hawaii,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Wake Island, Samoa,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
the Philippines,

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
and Panama.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
They were all acquired

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
at the end of the 19th century

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
or the beginning of the 20th century.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
In other words,

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
between 1844 and 1900,

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
the average trade volume

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
between China and the U.S.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
increased significantly

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
and even doubled.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
This expansion of the U.S. imperialism

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
brought a lot of trade

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
between China and the U.S.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
At that time,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
the U.S. business community

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
began to respond

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
to the U.S. federal government

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
that the Supreme Court

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
was not enough

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
to resolve the trade dispute

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
between China and the U.S.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Because these judges

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
are not legal people.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
They are just diplomats.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
As we all know,

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
our diplomats abroad

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
are also responsible

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
for business affairs.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
They do not have legal expertise

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
and are not able

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
to do a trial.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
So the efficiency of the court

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
is very low

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
and it is very painful

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
for these people

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
including sex workers,

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
gamblers, and vagabonds.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
At that time,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
U.S. missionaries in China

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
believed that these illegal immigrants

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
had a serious impact on the image

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
of the U.S. in China.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
In 1900,

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
there was a protest in Shanghai

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
against the U.S. import movement.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
The U.S. consulates

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
were highly tolerant of sex workers.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
So in 1900,

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
all the white prostitutes in Shanghai

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
said that they were American.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
At that time,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
the word American Girl

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
meant prostitutes.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
When a prostitute was arrested,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
she would say,

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I am American.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
When she was sent to the U.K.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
court,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
she would say,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I am American.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
When she was sent to the U.S.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
court,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
she would say,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I am American.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
So we can see that

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
the word extraterritoriality

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
and consular jurisdiction

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
were not important

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
concepts to the U.S.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
until 1900.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
The frequency of

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
extraterritoriality

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
and consular jurisdiction

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
increased significantly

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
after 1900.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
On the other hand,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
we all know that

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
the Eight-Nation Allied Forces

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
were attacked in Beijing.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
After the attack,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Beijing signed the Qing Dynasty

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Treaty.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
After the Treaty,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
the Qing Dynasty began

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
to reform the modern legal system.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
At that time,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
the reform of the modern legal system

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
was to transform Chinese law

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
into Western modern law.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Basically,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
we see so-called

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Legislative Codespotism

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
and white light law

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
later.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
We will see some citations

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
of that book

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
referred to

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
the Great Qing Ming-Liu case.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
This case was

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
published in 1906.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
As a result,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
in 1903,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
the arms tribunals

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
signed an agreement

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
that China

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
should start

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
legal and judicial reform.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Western countries should help us.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
If they help us,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
we will abolish

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
foreign law.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
At that time,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
the U.S. faced two pressures.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
The first was

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
the expansion of

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
the U.S. Empire

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
and the development of

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Sino-US trade relations

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and the reform of

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
the U.S. Constitution.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
The second was

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
the reform of

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
the U.S. Constitution.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
If the U.S. becomes

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
a modern,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
civilized,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
and three-party

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
court,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
the U.S.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
will not have

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
a place to stand.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
In 1906,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
the U.S. established

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
the United States Court for China.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
It appointed a judge

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
who had graduated from

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
the University of Yale

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
and was the director of

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
the Philippine Procuratorate

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and established a modern

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
and formal court.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
After the judge came to power,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
he did three things.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
The first thing he did

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
was to declare that

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
he would not have any

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
business dealings with the U.S.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
because the U.S. business community

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
wanted him to deal with

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
some business cases and disputes.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Instead, he dealt with

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
brothels and casinos.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
He felt that there were

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
many U.S. lawyers

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
who had a bad image of the Chinese.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
So he called all the U.S.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
lawyers in Shanghai

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
for a lawyer exam.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
The U.S. lawyer exam

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
made 80% of the people

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
think that U.S. lawyers

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
should not come to the U.S.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
court.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
The next thing he did

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
was to sue the boss

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
of eight brothels

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and four casinos.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
In the past,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
the U.S. lawyers used

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
the same trick

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
to say that

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
they were not U.S.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
lawyers,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
but the judge

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
who asked them

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
if they used

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
U.S. consulates.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
He even asked the U.S. consulate

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
to open their diplomatic documents

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and see if they had

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
a passport in the U.S. consulate.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Some of the U.S. lawyers

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
did not give a reason

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
and said,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I do not care,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
you are an American.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
He wanted to eliminate

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
the legal vacuum

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
that caused

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
a fierce backlash

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
among the U.S. community

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
in Shanghai.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
The U.S. judge was

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
impeached and resigned

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
a year later.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
The next U.S. judge

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
did not care.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
In the future,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I think there are several

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
theoretical meanings

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
that can be developed.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
The first is

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
that cross-border trade

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
is very common.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
For example,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
if a Japanese

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
signs a trade contract

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
with a Singaporean,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
he or she can use

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
the New York State Act

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
to settle the dispute

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
in Paris.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I think

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
the current situation

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
is similar to the past.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
China in the 19th century

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
pushed the situation

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
to extremes.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
For example,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
there are nine countries

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
in Tianjin.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
In Tianjin,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
there are ten laws

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
in the same city.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
There are some

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
theories that can be developed.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
The next is

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
system competition.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
We know that

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
in a globalized era,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
many countries

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
will look for

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
low-cost institutions.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
For example,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
labor laws

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
or environmental laws

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
are relatively loose.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
At that time,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
there were more than

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
20 countries in China

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
who competed

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
with each other

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
for the greatest interests

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
in China.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I don't know

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
if there are more theories

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
that can be developed.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
The next is

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
modern foreign law.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
For example,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
the US military

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
has foreign law in Chongqing.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Is there any way

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
to push back

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
or deny the existence

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
of foreign law

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
from the actual

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
implementation of

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
the United States?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
At that time,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
the United States had a very

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
intense backlash in China,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
which made it believe

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
that the United States

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
should not throw

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
taxpayers' money

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
overseas for foreign law.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
In fact,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Americans have been

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
faced with the fact

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
that they cannot

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
manage their citizens

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
without the support

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
of the United States.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Is it really beneficial?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
For example,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
the image of the United States

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
is so bad,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
and if the court is not fair,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
the Chinese will resist your goods.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Therefore,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
foreign law

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
is not something

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
that can be implemented

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
indefinitely.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
In addition to the law itself,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
it is also necessary

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
to understand the context

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
of these systems,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and then think about

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
more theoretical and abstract things

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
according to your research.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
That's all for today.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Thank you.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Thank you.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Thank you.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Thank you.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Thank you.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Thank you.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Thank you.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Thank you.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Thank you.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Thank you.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Thank you.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Thank you.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Thank you.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Thank you.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Thank you.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Thank you.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Thank you.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Thank you.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Thank you.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
