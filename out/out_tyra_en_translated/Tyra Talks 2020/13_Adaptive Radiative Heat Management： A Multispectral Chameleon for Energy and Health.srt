1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Welcome everyone to participate in our presentation today.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am the host today, Zhang Yuanping.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Our speaker today is very happy to invite Mr. Bojun to share his research with us.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As for the content, we will leave it to Mr. Bojun to share directly with everyone.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It will be about the熱傳熱導.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If I'm not mistaken, it should be like this, right?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because it's not my major.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Everyone will know the details later.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's share the background of the teacher.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The teacher used to be Qingda Materials.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If I'm not mistaken, Qingda Materials.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
After graduating, he went to Stanford to study materials.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, at the beginning of this year, he went to Duke.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
At the beginning of last year.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
At the beginning of last year, sorry.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
At the beginning of last year, he went to Duke.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's from the west coast to the east.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And it's almost a right-angled line.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's not that right-angled, but a little bit.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Then I just missed the teacher.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because I came back to Taiwan from UNC at that time.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I came back to Qingda Materials.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So I just missed the teacher.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Otherwise, there should be a chance to meet in person.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I am very happy to have this opportunity today.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So let's not talk too much.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
On behalf of everyone, I would like to warmly welcome the teacher to share with us today.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to take a picture.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
OK.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You can share your screen.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's at the top.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you swipe over, there will be...

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you know how to do it?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There are four buttons.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
One of them is the share screen.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Then you do this.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
OK, I saw it.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
OK.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then I'll turn off my microphone.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I...

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OK, so you really can't see what I mean.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
OK.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you, Yen Ping.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you for coming to listen to me.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let me talk about the two little things I've been doing recently.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's quite interesting.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's mainly about how we can adjust our heat radiation.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And then let this building be more...

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's simple.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I just...

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yen Ping has already introduced my background.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Mainly, when I was at Stanford, I started doing nano.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And then I switched to doing some metal nanowires.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And then I started doing some textile research.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Textile, in my understanding, is actually related to energy.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Because...

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I hope this slide will be clearer.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Because we actually spent a lot of energy

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to provide us with a very comfortable hot environment.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In fact, most of the energy consumption in the United States

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
actually comes from fossil fuels.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That is to say, on the one hand, we have to push for renewable energy,

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
such as solar energy and wind energy.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
On the other hand, if we can save the energy we use,

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
it will contribute a lot to reducing CO2 emissions.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The reason why I say that

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
textile and energy are closely related

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
is because if we look at...

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is also from the United States.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let me ask everyone first.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe I'll use a pointer.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, yeah.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is American consumption.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's by different areas.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There's transportation, there's industry, and there's architecture.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Architecture is where we are now.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Just now, Yanping told me that

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
he's been looking for a parking lot for a long time.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We always go to a meeting place

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to have a conference, class, and so on.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Even if you get off work, you go home.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So it's always in a building.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So it's not surprising that this building

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
takes up one-third of the energy consumption.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When we were young,

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think when we grew up in Taiwan,

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
we were taught to turn off the light

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and turn off the faucet

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to save electricity.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But in fact,

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
we didn't know until later that

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
most of the electricity

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
is consumed...

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're in this building.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're consuming electricity.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Even if you don't turn on the light.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because this building

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
needs to have a proper temperature.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You have to turn on the air conditioner in summer.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Taiwan doesn't need air conditioners in winter.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But in fact,

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
most places in the world

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
still have air conditioners in winter.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So HVAC is heating,

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ventilation,

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and AC is air conditioning.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is a thermal air conditioner.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It basically takes up

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
17% of the energy in the United States.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can imagine

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
if such a large amount of energy

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is not consumed at all.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because it is

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the most basic living condition.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So the so-called textile

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and energy-related places

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
are in this concept

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
called personal self-management.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
In other words,

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
our traditional concept

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
is that we take this building,

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the temperature of the whole building,

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and make it very warm in winter.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Turn on the heater

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and the whole building becomes very comfortable.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Personal self-management means

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that we don't want to

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
make the whole building very warm.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Instead, we focus on

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
the environment around these people.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We try to make

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
these people feel warm.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
After all, these tables and chairs

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and decorations

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
don't really matter.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Textile is in this place.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We can make some new innovations

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
to achieve this goal.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's review

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
some of the past work

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
in personal self-management.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mainly talk about radiative,

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
which is heat radiation.

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In general, when we talk about a textile,

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
its cold or heat

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is usually its flow

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
or evaporation,

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
how it is controlled.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Radiation is actually a very large piece,

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
but it has not been adjusted much.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So here we hope

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that we can use some of the materials

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and innovations to achieve different properties.

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
For example, we can

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
buckle the 7N wire

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to the top of the clothes.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We can suppress the radiation.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
In other words,

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
we can reduce our heat loss.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
On the other hand,

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
we also made transparent clothes.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you ask a physicist

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
how to make the coolest clothes,

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
the simplest answer is

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
not to wear it.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But obviously you can't do that.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So we can make clothes

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that look colorful visually,

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
not transparent,

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
but don't seem to wear inside and outside.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is the meaning of cooling textile.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like this one,

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it doesn't look very good,

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
but it's a prototype.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In the visible light,

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
it looks like a white vest.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In the infrared camera,

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
it looks completely transparent.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You can see the blood behind the clothes.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Radiation has a very special place

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that is different from flow and evaporation.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Basically, it's like a TV.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's like a light.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We all know that light has color.

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Color is the nature of a surface.

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Things can have two sides.

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Two sides can have different colors.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So we can use this method

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to make some traditional textiles

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that can't be disturbed.

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
For example,

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the textile of this Bill Maugham

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
looks the same on both sides

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
but it has a bilayer structure inside.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So when we put one side on the skin,

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
you will feel that your radiation is working,

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
so you will feel cooler.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But when you turn it over,

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the other side is not so strong radiation,

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
so you will feel warmer

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
because it keeps your heat.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So with this Bill Maugham textile,

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
we can increase people's ability

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to adapt to the environment.

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
For example,

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
for elderly people,

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
or people who get sick easily,

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
or people who get sick easily,

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
this can be a good protection for their immune system.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But there are also other ways to control it.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
For example,

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
it's responsive to sweat.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
When you sweat,

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the textile becomes cooler,

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and so on.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So the first thing I want to talk about today

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
is that when we finish these

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
heating, cooling,

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and Bill Maugham textiles,

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
we find an interesting problem.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We find that the radiative heat management

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
actually has something to do with the substance underneath.

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
For example,

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
the reason this infrared transparent textile can work

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
is because this person is a very good radiator.

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He's already radiating thermal radiation,

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
so we want to cool it.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The best way is to make this textile transparent.

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So for a high-transmittance cooling,

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
for people,

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
a good radiator is more useful.

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But if we want to manage things that are not people,

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
let's say a car.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Cars also need cooling.

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That's not going to work,

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
because the metal itself is not a good radiator.

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you put a transparent thing in it,

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
it still doesn't radiate.

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's still very hot.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
On the other hand,

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
if we want to do low-emissivity,

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
what is low-emissivity?

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Emissivity is the ability to radiate thermal radiation.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The higher the emissivity,

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the more radiation you emit.

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The lower the emissivity,

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the less radiation you emit.

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So for a low-emissivity thing,

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
we want to use a high-emissivity device.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's useful for low-emissivity objects,

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
but for high-emissivity objects,

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
it's a bit...

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How can you be high-emissivity

254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
if you don't have anything above that?

255
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So from an engineer's point of view,

256
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
this is something that can't be tolerated.

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Because when we make something,

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
we have to ask first

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
what kind of object this thing is suitable for.

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In terms of design,

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
this is not a very perfect design.

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Especially when we don't know what this object is.

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's easy to accidentally

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
make a lot of different devices

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
that can be useful for all objects.

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
On the other hand,

267
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
in terms of heating,

268
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
as long as we make this thing active,

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
it can always work.

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This actually tells us that

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
today's transmittance,

272
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
emissivity, and reactivity,

273
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
these three modes need to be there

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
so that we can...

275
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
When we don't know what this object is,

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
we hope it can be controlled by heating and cooling.

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We need these three modes

278
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
to have these three modes at the same time

279
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
on my device.

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This is what I just said,

281
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
but in a more

282
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
quantitative way.

283
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Basically,

284
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
when I use a transparent film

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
to cover an object,

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
the higher the coefficient of heat transfer,

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
the cooler it is.

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The higher the emissivity,

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
the cooler it is.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If this is emissive,

291
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
let's say this thing is...

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It becomes opaque.

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So no matter what the thing underneath is,

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
the film above determines

295
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
whether it's cold or hot.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So you can imagine

297
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
there's a crossover

298
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
when the object underneath

299
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
is emissive,

300
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
you want to use the transmittance mode

301
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
to do the cooling.

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So basically,

303
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
our goal is to

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
make a triple mode modulation.

305
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
At the same time,

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
this triple mode is also a completion,

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
because you want a light and an object

308
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
to be either opaque,

309
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
or absorb,

310
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
or reflect.

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So basically,

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
as long as these three modes are available,

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
it's basically done.

314
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So how do we do this?

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
First of all,

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
we choose an

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
infrared semi-absorbed elastomer.

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Then we put this elastomer...

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The surface of this elastomer

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
has some texture,

321
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
which is high-density adhesive.

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Then we stretch this elastomer

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
to 100%,

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and then put more metal on it.

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So at this time,

326
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
this elastomer has two properties.

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
One is that its thickness becomes thinner.

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The other is that

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the metal is actually flat.

330
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So at this time,

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
it's a better reflector.

332
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This is a reflection mode.

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So when we remove this elastomer,

334
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
so that it can be released,

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
two things will happen.

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The first one is that the film becomes thicker.

337
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Then this is its...

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The metal layer we just cut,

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
it has an extra length.

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So it becomes more wrinkled.

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So we increase the thickness at the same time.

342
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We also increase the surface...

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What we call slow reflection,

344
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
which is scattering.

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So overall,

346
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
we can increase

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the composite absorption.

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
According to Kracov's law,

349
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
which is a very useful physical law,

350
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
it says that

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
in a thermodynamic equilibrium,

352
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
the more you absorb,

353
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the more you release.

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That is to say,

355
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
when we make a film with high absorption,

356
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
it also has high emittance.

357
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So at this time,

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
it can do this cooling.

359
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The third mode,

360
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
we just pulled this

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
100% film,

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and then pulled it out.

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We will pull this metal film.

364
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
After pulling it out,

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
of course,

366
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the opened part becomes transparent.

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because this is a semi-absorbing elastomer.

368
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So this is a state of high transmittance.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
By using this open area

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and relatively small thickness

371
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
to achieve this transmittance.

372
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This is a simple evidence.

373
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We made this material.

374
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
SCM is to look at the surface of the material

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
with an electron.

376
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
First of all,

377
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
we can compare this

378
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
emissive mode with static.

379
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's rougher.

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's rougher than it is.

381
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And then it's all broken.

382
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We also use a more static way

383
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
to explain the same thing.

384
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Next,

385
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
we really want to prove that

386
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
it can be absorbed from the outside of the red

387
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and then reflected and transparent.

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So this is a

389
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
heavy-folding,

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
as I just said,

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
the nature of the three modes.

392
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Of course,

393
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
we measured the entire spectrum

394
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and then made a score.

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But in short,

396
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
we started from 100%,

397
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
which is to pull and then cut the metal.

398
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Then you put it in

399
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
the emissive mode.

400
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And then you pull it back to the original state

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
when you pull it to 100%.

402
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This is all reflected.

403
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And then you pull it,

404
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and you see that the green area becomes wider,

405
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and the transmittance is dominant.

406
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then this kind of

407
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
trend-induced cycling

408
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
can last for a thousand cycles.

409
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And then,

410
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
of course,

411
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
there's a little degradation,

412
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
but it's not a big deal.

413
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
In addition,

414
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
we also focus on switching from reflectance

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
to emittance

416
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
as a mechanism study.

417
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
As I just said,

418
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the emittance mode

419
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
mainly comes from two factors.

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The first is that its thickness becomes thicker,

421
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and the second is that its surface becomes rougher.

422
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So we can see that

423
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
the emittance mode

424
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
mainly comes from two factors.

425
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The first is that its thickness becomes thicker,

426
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and the second is that its surface becomes rougher.

427
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So we can think of the contrast of emittance

428
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
as contributing to these two factors.

429
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And this

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is our experimental data.

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We can do some simple fitting and modeling

432
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
to explain

433
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
what the surface roughness factor

434
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
corresponds to

435
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
in terms of surface roughness.

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
At the same time,

437
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
this is a smooth surface.

438
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you don't do surface texturing today,

439
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
you won't be able to achieve

440
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
such a high contrast of emittance.

441
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
As I just said,

442
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
texturing is very, very important.

443
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
At the same time,

444
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
we can also

445
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
artificially predict

446
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
if we push

447
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
its application technique today,

448
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
we may be able to

449
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
push it better.

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
For example,

451
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
if we can

452
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
make a perfect diffuse scattering

453
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
from a completely smooth surface

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
after it is released,

455
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
we can predict

456
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
a 0.7 emittance contrast.

457
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In terms of the knowledge limit,

458
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
today's surface

459
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
is a perfect diffuse

460
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
surface.

461
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So when the light hits it,

462
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
it will present a

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
it will present a

464
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
it has a specific distribution.

465
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And this distribution

466
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
has to do with the thickness

467
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and the scattering rate of the material.

468
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
According to this thickness,

469
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
according to this scattering rate,

470
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and according to this

471
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the main thing is the scattering rate.

472
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
According to this scattering rate,

473
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
we can calculate

474
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
how much enhancement you have.

475
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
We can predict

476
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
if this is the limit,

477
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
we can have higher and higher emittance.

478
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Next,

479
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
when we have this infrared measurement,

480
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
how much can it bring

481
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the change in thermodynamics.

482
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We also did a

483
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
heat transfer coefficient measurement.

484
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The most important thing is to measure

485
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the ability to control heating and cooling.

486
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
For example,

487
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
if we look at the red line,

488
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
the metal is at 100% strength.

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It can go from 10 to 7.5

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and then go a little higher.

491
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Of course, this is completely customizable.

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It depends on

493
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
whether you want more cooling

494
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
or more heating.

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If it is blue,

496
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
it means there is a lot of heating mode.

497
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
In addition,

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
the picture on the right

499
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
is an experiment

500
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to prove

501
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
what I said at the beginning.

502
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I said,

503
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
if I don't know

504
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
the emissivity of the underlying object,

505
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I can't

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
heat and cool all the objects.

507
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
For example,

508
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
if this blue thing

509
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
is a low emissivity material,

510
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
you will find that

511
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
when I use T-mode,

512
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
it is actually very hot.

513
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The important thing is the temperature.

514
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
On the other hand,

515
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
if today I have a

516
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
high emissivity material,

517
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I use T-mode,

518
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
which is actually cooler.

519
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That is to say,

520
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
only when these three modes are available,

521
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can do the best

522
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
heating or cooling

523
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
for all the different objects.

524
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Finally,

525
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
because we are adjusting the infrared now,

526
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
we made a

527
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
simple little device.

528
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's a

529
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
thing called

530
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
4x4.

531
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We made a 4x4

532
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
pixel device

533
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
that we can use

534
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
to pump air

535
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
into a small chamber

536
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
or to draw vacuum.

537
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We can adjust the

538
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
strength of the film above.

539
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We made a

540
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
not very good-looking

541
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
but still

542
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
distinguishable letter D.

543
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then, of course,

544
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
we can adjust the other parts

545
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
to adjust the color

546
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
from non-radiative

547
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
to radiative.

548
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I can pause here

549
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and ask if you have any questions.

550
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Hi,

551
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
if you have any questions,

552
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
you can ask directly.

553
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Remember to turn on your microphone

554
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
or you won't hear the sound.

555
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
If not,

556
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I will

557
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
continue.

558
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Okay.

559
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay,

560
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
so

561
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
this is just

562
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
for the infrared.

563
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I just said

564
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
that

565
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
light and

566
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
infrared

567
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
are different from

568
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
radiation or radiation.

569
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
They are different wavelengths

570
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and have different properties.

571
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So we can have

572
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
different ways to adjust them.

573
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The second part

574
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
is also

575
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
for architecture.

576
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But we won't

577
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
do

578
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
this small device.

579
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
We will talk about architecture.

580
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Excuse me, Bo-Jun.

581
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Do you have a video?

582
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I didn't see it.

583
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Let's share it again.

584
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Sorry.

585
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Sorry.

586
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Sorry for

587
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
interrupting.

588
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay,

589
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
do you have it?

590
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Do you have it?

591
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes, I have it.

592
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I have it.

593
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Okay,

594
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
the second part is

595
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that

596
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
another way

597
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
to save energy

598
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
from building

599
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
is to

600
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
use

601
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
renewable

602
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
energy

603
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
directly.

604
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Renewable energy is

605
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
very simple.

606
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We all know that

607
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
renewable energy is

608
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
a very mature industry.

609
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Not many people

610
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
know that

611
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
there is another popular

612
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
field in the academic world

613
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
called radiative cooling.

614
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Actually,

615
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
it has been happening

616
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
all the time.

617
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
When we

618
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
are in a vacuum,

619
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
besides the sun

620
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
giving you energy,

621
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
you are also radiating

622
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
to the earth.

623
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's hard to imagine,

624
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
but as I said,

625
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
infrared is a kind of light.

626
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
If you take a laser

627
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and shine it to the sky,

628
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
you can shine it all the way to the moon.

629
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So for light,

630
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
as long as nothing absorbs it,

631
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
it will keep going.

632
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So when you are

633
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
on the surface of the earth,

634
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
let's say 25 degrees,

635
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
you are radiating to the universe,

636
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
which is 3 Kelvin.

637
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So this is a very, very large temperature difference

638
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
that we can use

639
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
as a source of energy.

640
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's hard to say

641
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
why you don't feel

642
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
the energy

643
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
when you are outside in the daytime

644
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
because the sun is too strong.

645
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
This is why the academic world

646
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
has been doing

647
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
various materials

648
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
to make

649
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
what we call

650
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
daytime radiative cooling.

651
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It can reflect

652
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
all the sunlight,

653
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
but there is still

654
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
a very strong radiation

655
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
that can do the cooling.

656
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So this studio,

657
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
as Ye Min said,

658
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I was at Stanford

659
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and after my Ph.D. and postdoc,

660
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I suddenly realized

661
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
that the world

662
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
has 4G.

663
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In California,

664
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
it's basically the same every day.

665
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The result of having 4G

666
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
is that when this building

667
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
may be good for heating

668
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
in winter,

669
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
but it needs cooling

670
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
in summer.

671
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So buildings,

672
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
like people,

673
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
all need a control function

674
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
to have the best

675
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
energy saving

676
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
portfolio

677
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
in a year with 4G.

678
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So we want to

679
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
have these two

680
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
sources of renewable energy

681
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
in the building

682
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
at the same time.

683
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But it's not that simple.

684
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The solar heating

685
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and radiative cooling

686
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
require exactly the opposite

687
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
qualities.

688
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
As an ideal

689
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
solar heating material,

690
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
you want it to absorb

691
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
all the sunlight.

692
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You don't want it to

693
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
keep all the

694
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
heat radiation

695
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
around you.

696
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
On the other hand,

697
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
for radiative cooling,

698
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
you want to do the opposite.

699
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You don't want to absorb

700
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
any sunlight.

701
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You want to maximize

702
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
the amount of heat

703
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
in the building.

704
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But you can't

705
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
control these two

706
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
materials by adding

707
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
or subtracting.

708
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You have to replace

709
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
the whole material

710
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
by chemical

711
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
or other methods.

712
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So we chose

713
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
an engineering solution

714
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
with different

715
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
land scale tricks

716
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and different performance.

717
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But there is also

718
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
the possibility of

719
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
dual-mode control.

720
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We made a film

721
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
that is very light

722
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and can be

723
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
made into a roll-to-roll.

724
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You can move

725
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
the film

726
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
in a roll-to-roll way.

727
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We put the

728
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
solar heating

729
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and radiative cooling

730
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
on the film.

731
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We can use

732
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
the motor to switch.

733
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
First of all,

734
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
this material needs

735
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
good heating and cooling performance.

736
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Let me briefly

737
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
introduce

738
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
the principles of these two parts.

739
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
In terms of heating,

740
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
we use

741
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
plasmonic absorber.

742
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Basically,

743
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
it is used to make

744
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
small metal nanoparticles.

745
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We have

746
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
used

747
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
a sound wave,

748
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
right?

749
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
The sound wave

750
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
has a fixed frequency.

751
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The size of the sound wave

752
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
or the frequency of the sound wave

753
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
will have different frequencies.

754
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The size of the nanoparticle

755
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
corresponds to the absorption

756
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
of visible light.

757
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
There are many different sizes of nanoparticles.

758
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You can absorb

759
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
all the sunlight.

760
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
At the same time,

761
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
because it is metal,

762
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
it does not emit light.

763
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I said in the last project

764
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
that if it is a metal nanoparticle,

765
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
it does not emit light.

766
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
A metal nanoparticle

767
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
can be designed

768
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
to be a perfect

769
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
solar absorber,

770
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
but it is a bad

771
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
infrared emitter.

772
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
On the other hand,

773
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
we use

774
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
PDMA.

775
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
PDMA is a transparent

776
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
rubber.

777
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It is called silicone.

778
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It is transparent

779
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
under visible light or sunlight,

780
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
but it is a good

781
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
absorber,

782
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
so the result is

783
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
a PDMA-covered

784
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
silver mirror.

785
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
We can reflect

786
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
sunlight, but it is a good

787
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
absorber.

788
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We deliberately chose

789
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
these two materials

790
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to be very scalable.

791
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Because this thing

792
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
is going to be used by the building.

793
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It is impossible to choose

794
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
a very unscalable

795
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
equipment.

796
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Basically,

797
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
we are limiting

798
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the size of the equipment

799
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
in our school.

800
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
For example,

801
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
a 12-centimeter-wide

802
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
film side-by-side.

803
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
This is

804
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
the opposite

805
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
optical quality I just mentioned.

806
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Of course, it is not perfect,

807
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
but it is close to the

808
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
trend I just described.

809
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Alpha and

810
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Epsilon. Alpha is

811
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
the absorption of sunlight, and

812
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Epsilon is the emission of infrared light.

813
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
For example,

814
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
PDMA is a very high

815
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
absorption of infrared light.

816
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This is okay,

817
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
but it can

818
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
be lower.

819
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Cooling is

820
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
visible light.

821
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Solar does not need to be absorbed.

822
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It is an infrared emission.

823
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So this 2.7

824
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
is not

825
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
less than 5%.

826
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Basically, you can't achieve

827
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
an effective cooling.

828
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Because the sunlight is too strong.

829
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The quality of both

830
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
materials

831
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
takes some time

832
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
to optimize the

833
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
material synthesis conditions.

834
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
In addition,

835
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
we use a

836
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
motor to

837
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
move the film to

838
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
make the material lighter

839
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and thinner.

840
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
At the same time, it can also

841
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
reduce the energy

842
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
required for switching.

843
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
In addition, you don't want

844
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
the material to be too thick.

845
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Because if it is too thick,

846
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
you have to spend some energy

847
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
to heat it or cool it.

848
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It is more thermodynamic.

849
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
This is a simple demonstration

850
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
of its durability.

851
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I did it 100 times.

852
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Its performance is basically

853
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
unchanged.

854
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The third point is

855
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
not so obvious,

856
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
but it is very important.

857
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It is called reversible thermal contact.

858
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You can imagine that when the film

859
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
moves to the left,

860
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
the solar heating will be very hot

861
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and the water cooling will be very cold.

862
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But if you can't

863
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
bring this heat or cold

864
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
to the building,

865
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
it will be meaningless.

866
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Reversible thermal contact

867
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
is when we fix it,

868
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
we hope that it can

869
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
bring the heat down,

870
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
but it can also remove

871
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
and make a switching.

872
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We use static electricity

873
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
as a driving force

874
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
to realize this function.

875
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Basically, it is

876
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
a metal electrode

877
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
and substrate

878
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
as an electrode board.

879
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
As you can see,

880
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
the higher the voltage,

881
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
the higher the thermal contact.

882
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
On the right is the reference.

883
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
This is our film.

884
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The higher the voltage,

885
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the closer it is to the reference.

886
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
In other words,

887
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
it can bring all the heat

888
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
at the bottom.

889
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
This is a way

890
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
to reduce

891
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
or increase

892
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
its thermal contact conductance.

893
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
This is a relatively

894
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
simple way to describe it.

895
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
This is...

896
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We want to demonstrate

897
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
that we don't need

898
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
to keep adding static electricity.

899
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's like today,

900
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I know the capacitor.

901
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
After you add the voltage to the capacitor,

902
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
you break the voltage,

903
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
and the voltage is still there.

904
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
If you are

905
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
a circuit breaker.

906
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So today,

907
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
as long as you don't

908
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
break the voltage,

909
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
it will stay there

910
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
until the water

911
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
or something else

912
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
takes the voltage away.

913
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
We measured

914
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
how long the voltage

915
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
can stay at the top.

916
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
After three days,

917
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
we can see the decay.

918
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But it doesn't matter

919
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
if it's decayed.

920
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
We just need to touch it

921
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
a little bit

922
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
This is a video

923
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
of a real device

924
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
moving.

925
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
We use this motor

926
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
to move it.

927
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The black part is

928
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
the solar heater.

929
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The reflective part

930
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
is the radiator cooler.

931
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
This is the actual

932
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
roof of our school.

933
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We did this experiment.

934
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Doing this experiment

935
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
was actually

936
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
very difficult.

937
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
If it rains, we can't do it.

938
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Anyway,

939
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
this is our

940
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
actual data.

941
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
The positive value

942
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
is for heating.

943
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
The negative value is for cooling.

944
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We put a sensor

945
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
to measure this.

946
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
We also verified

947
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
the importance

948
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
of the voltage

949
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
in this device.

950
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
When we

951
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
gradually increase the voltage,

952
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
we can see that

953
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
the number of heating and cooling

954
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
has increased.

955
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Switching

956
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
takes about one or two minutes.

957
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
In terms of

958
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
a building's time scale,

959
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
it's very fast.

960
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Then we compare

961
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
the data

962
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
with the

963
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
model value.

964
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The model value is

965
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
the weather,

966
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the solar energy,

967
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
the humidity,

968
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and the wind speed.

969
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I can expect

970
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
how much heating

971
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
and cooling.

972
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
If the measurement

973
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
is close to the model,

974
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
it means that

975
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the thermal contact

976
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
has been solved.

977
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We can see

978
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
the black line

979
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
is the model value,

980
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and the red line

981
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
is the model value.

982
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Lastly,

983
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
we hope

984
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
that this

985
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
dual-mode device

986
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
can be used

987
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
in other places

988
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
in the United States.

989
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
As I said,

990
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
buildings

991
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
require

992
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
dynamic

993
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and smart tuning.

994
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
With this

995
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
dual-mode device,

996
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
we expect

997
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
it can be used

998
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
in different climatic areas

999
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
in the most

1000
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
effective way.

1001
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
In fact,

1002
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
if your building

1003
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
can only do heating,

1004
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
you can save a lot of energy

1005
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
in the Five Lakes

1006
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and the Northeast.

1007
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Does it make sense?

1008
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Cooling is more average.

1009
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
As you know,

1010
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
in the East China Sea,

1011
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the East China Sea is

1012
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
hot in the winter and cold in the summer.

1013
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
In the West China Sea,

1014
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
the four seasons are different.

1015
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Cooling is basically needed

1016
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
in every place.

1017
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
If you have dual-mode today,

1018
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
you can choose

1019
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
to do cooling or heating

1020
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
when it is cold.

1021
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
In different areas,

1022
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
you can have a cool

1023
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
or energy-saving

1024
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
improvement.

1025
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Finally,

1026
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
to summarize,

1027
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
the two main tasks today

1028
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
are dual-mode

1029
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and

1030
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't know

1031
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
whether it can do heating

1032
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
or cooling.

1033
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We also demonstrated

1034
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
multi-spectral,

1035
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
which is to say,

1036
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
it can control

1037
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
the two different

1038
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
wavelengths.

1039
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Let's talk about

1040
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
what kind of work

1041
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
we want to do

1042
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
from now on.

1043
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
For example,

1044
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
we can further subdivide

1045
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
the concept of multi-spectral.

1046
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
We know that although it is solar,

1047
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
it also has visible light

1048
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and infrared.

1049
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Infrared is

1050
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
coming from the sun,

1051
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
but it can't be seen.

1052
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Today,

1053
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I just want to see the scenery.

1054
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
If we can

1055
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
subdivide it,

1056
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
there will be more

1057
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
useful functions.

1058
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
In addition,

1059
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
we need to use

1060
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
telemetry to control it.

1061
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Basically,

1062
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
these two tasks

1063
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
are controlled by

1064
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
mechanical methods.

1065
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
For many applications,

1066
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
moving part

1067
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
is not a good thing.

1068
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It is easy to be damaged.

1069
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Telemetry has

1070
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
advantages in this aspect.

1071
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Of course,

1072
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
it is also more fun

1073
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
in Fundamental Material Science.

1074
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
For example,

1075
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Electrochromic,

1076
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
we are doing a topic

1077
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
about

1078
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
wearable infrared

1079
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
control.

1080
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Basically,

1081
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
it can control

1082
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
the radiation

1083
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
from 1.5 times

1084
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
to 1.5 times.

1085
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Another one

1086
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
is

1087
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
the work of

1088
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
an audience called

1089
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Dai Yiqin Initiator.

1090
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It basically follows

1091
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
the control of

1092
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Miraiya solar.

1093
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
But we don't use

1094
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
mechanical methods,

1095
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
which is the same as before.

1096
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
After we add electricity,

1097
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Miraiya becomes

1098
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
higher,

1099
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
solar becomes lower,

1100
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and vice versa,

1101
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
solar becomes higher,

1102
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Miraiya becomes lower.

1103
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
This is my talk today.

1104
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I should acknowledge

1105
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Lai Yiqin,

1106
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
but that is

1107
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
not the case.

1108
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The main work is

1109
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
completed by my postdoc

1110
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and the students.

1111
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
My collaborator is

1112
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Duke's

1113
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Willie Padilla,

1114
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and Wyoming's

1115
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Kang Tan.

1116
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Thank you.

1117
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Before we start,

1118
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I would like to

1119
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
thank Lai Yiqin

1120
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
for his wonderful talk.

1121
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Thank you.

1122
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't think it will be long.

1123
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think the time is just right.

1124
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We usually have

1125
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
this kind of time.

1126
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So,

1127
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't know

1128
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
if you have any questions.

1129
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Since it is

1130
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
over,

1131
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
please turn on your mic.

1132
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
If you are too shy,

1133
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
you can ask me.

1134
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Can I ask a question?

1135
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
No.

1136
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You can ask.

1137
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh, no. I was shot.

1138
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
We are classmates.

1139
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We are college roommates.

1140
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, right.

1141
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I just want to

1142
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
thank Taira

1143
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
for this great platform.

1144
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We haven't seen each other

1145
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
for hundreds of years.

1146
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Let me introduce myself.

1147
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I am Ethan,

1148
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and I am doing research

1149
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
in the field of materials.

1150
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
We are college classmates.

1151
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
This platform

1152
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
is cross-field.

1153
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I don't want to get into

1154
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
material science.

1155
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't want people to know

1156
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
what we are talking about.

1157
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I want to ask a general question.

1158
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
We are all overseas.

1159
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I believe this platform

1160
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
is for Taiwanese

1161
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
who are mainly scholars.

1162
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I want to ask you

1163
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
to share your experience

1164
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
in Duke.

1165
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You worked hard

1166
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
to get a faculty position.

1167
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
This is the light of Taiwan.

1168
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I want to ask

1169
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
about your experience

1170
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
in this platform

1171
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and your connection with Taiwan.

1172
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
For example,

1173
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
you interviewed students in Taiwan.

1174
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You also had a job interview

1175
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
with some PhD students.

1176
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I want to ask you to share

1177
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
what I think can be discussed.

1178
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
First, what is the current situation of Taiwanese students?

1179
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
For example, how active are they in studying abroad?

1180
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Second,

1181
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
on a global scale,

1182
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
what do you think

1183
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
are the advantages of being Taiwanese?

1184
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What was the first question?

1185
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
The first one is...

1186
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I know you didn't sleep well.

1187
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
The second one is the level of activity, right?

1188
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yes.

1189
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I think

1190
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
in general,

1191
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
everyone should have

1192
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
a sense of crisis.

1193
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Of course, I think

1194
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Taiwan's society is stable

1195
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and prosperity is a good thing.

1196
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But I think

1197
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
in terms of security,

1198
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
at least

1199
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
since we went abroad,

1200
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I've only heard about the situation in Taiwan.

1201
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
But, for example,

1202
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
there are fewer and fewer people studying abroad.

1203
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I don't think many people want to go abroad.

1204
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Actually, I'm curious about where everyone is going.

1205
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
If it's a financial system,

1206
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
it should be obvious.

1207
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Of course, everyone has their own...

1208
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Everyone has their own aspirations.

1209
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But I think

1210
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
this distribution...

1211
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Fewer people

1212
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
are doing academic research.

1213
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
In the long run,

1214
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
it's not good.

1215
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
We'll be short of a lot of...

1216
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
First,

1217
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
let's say

1218
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
in the first ten or twenty years,

1219
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
there will be more potential

1220
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
for growth.

1221
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But in

1222
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
other countries,

1223
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the connection

1224
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
will be weaker.

1225
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I still encourage

1226
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
everyone to

1227
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
take more risks.

1228
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
What's the first question?

1229
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Share your experience

1230
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
building connections with Taiwan.

1231
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Of course,

1232
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
my experience is

1233
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
taking care of Taiwanese people.

1234
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Let me give you an example.

1235
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I met

1236
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
a Taiwanese

1237
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
in a meeting.

1238
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
We discussed

1239
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
how to promote

1240
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Taiwanese students

1241
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
to study abroad.

1242
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
At the time,

1243
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I suggested...

1244
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It's simple.

1245
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I was teaching in

1246
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
an American school.

1247
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
If Taiwanese students

1248
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
can get

1249
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
a small living

1250
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
allowance,

1251
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
for example,

1252
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
they can come to me

1253
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
or other teachers

1254
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
to do summer research

1255
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and get a recommendation.

1256
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I think it's easier

1257
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
than

1258
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
building a

1259
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
school-to-school

1260
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
memorandum.

1261
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
If you sign a memorandum,

1262
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
you'll know

1263
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
you have a weak connection

1264
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
with the teacher.

1265
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
As a Ph.D.,

1266
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you can't do that.

1267
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
If you can do that,

1268
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I think

1269
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
it's possible.

1270
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Actually,

1271
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I brought this student

1272
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
this summer,

1273
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
but it became remote

1274
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
due to COVID-19.

1275
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't know

1276
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
how she'll do.

1277
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It's her first year.

1278
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But I think

1279
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
it's a good summer experience.

1280
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
For me,

1281
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I...

1282
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
For her,

1283
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
she has a very direct

1284
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
teacher's recommendation

1285
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
in the U.S.

1286
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It's very detailed.

1287
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's different

1288
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
from the teacher's

1289
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
recommendation in Taiwan.

1290
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
This is the style

1291
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
between Taiwan and the U.S.

1292
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
In Taiwan,

1293
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
a lot of students

1294
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
in the U.S.

1295
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
would look at

1296
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
when they met this student.

1297
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
What was their first impression

1298
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
when they first met her?

1299
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
What project did she do?

1300
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
What did she do?

1301
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
What did she do?

1302
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
What did she do?

1303
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
What did she do?

1304
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
What did she do?

1305
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
What did she do?

1306
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
What did she do?

1307
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Even if she was an exchange student,

1308
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
it's not as detailed.

1309
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
This is my...

1310
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
This year,

1311
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I established a new

1312
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
connection with Taiwan.

1313
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It's a new experiment.

1314
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I think it's a good point.

1315
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I'm a beneficiary.

1316
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
We also have students

1317
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
who are like you.

1318
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Visiting students.

1319
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Because of your recommendation,

1320
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
we have some opportunities

1321
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
for students

1322
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
to exchange abroad

1323
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
in college.

1324
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Of course, it's not much,

1325
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
but it's a big difference

1326
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
for a poor student.

1327
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Of course, we will try to make up for it.

1328
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
We try to help with some costs,

1329
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
such as experimental fees,

1330
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
some space, and so on.

1331
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
As for living expenses,

1332
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
she may have to figure it out herself.

1333
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I believe it's across the board.

1334
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Many Taiwanese friends

1335
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
are serving in different schools.

1336
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Let's see if there's a chance

1337
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
to compete with her mother's school.

1338
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Of course, the school can do it.

1339
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
If there is such an opportunity,

1340
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
exchange students with Taiwanese students.

1341
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Of course, the main purpose

1342
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
is to get a recommendation later.

1343
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And this thing

1344
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
is easy to do.

1345
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Because for us,

1346
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
today, of course,

1347
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
there is a layer of alumni relationship.

1348
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But even if you go to

1349
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
a non-alumni,

1350
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
you tell him you have a free labor

1351
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
to work for you.

1352
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
No one will say no.

1353
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It will be very simple.

1354
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
If you choose a more official

1355
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
recommendation today,

1356
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
but you have to admit your academic qualifications

1357
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
and credit,

1358
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
it will be very troublesome.

1359
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And let me tell you first

1360
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
that now all schools

1361
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
have some operations,

1362
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
such as 2 plus 2.

1363
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It's a bit like Chinese people

1364
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
stealing Western resources

1365
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
to train their students.

1366
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
At least I don't know other places,

1367
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
but our whole country in Australia

1368
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
has banned

1369
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
signing MOUs with any place

1370
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
in detail.

1371
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So you can't sign it.

1372
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You can't sign it at all.

1373
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So

1374
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I think

1375
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
it's the first year

1376
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
now.

1377
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Let's see how this student applies.

1378
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Of course, his application is mainly related

1379
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
to his own ability.

1380
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But I think

1381
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
this may help.

1382
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
OK.

1383
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That's about it. Don't take up my time.

1384
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yiting, do you have anything to add?

1385
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yiting is my

1386
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
first

1387
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Taiwanese student.

1388
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Yiting.

1389
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I have a question.

1390
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Can you hear me?

1391
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yes, I can.

1392
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Now

1393
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
it's global warming,

1394
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
so Taiwan's summer temperature

1395
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
has reached 37-38 degrees.

1396
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I went with my uncle to visit

1397
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
a orchid farmer.

1398
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
They use a greenhouse.

1399
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
During the day,

1400
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
the sunlight comes in.

1401
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
But because the temperature is too high,

1402
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
they have to turn on the air conditioner all the time.

1403
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Because their orchids are very large,

1404
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
their air conditioner power is not enough,

1405
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
so many orchids die.

1406
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Now because of global warming,

1407
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Taiwan's orchids

1408
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
also have other problems.

1409
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
They can't lower

1410
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
the temperature to the right temperature.

1411
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Do you have any suggestions?

1412
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Sure.

1413
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Like I said earlier,

1414
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
first of all,

1415
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
you have to let the light in.

1416
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
The cheapest way

1417
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
is to add a black cloth.

1418
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
That's the cheapest way.

1419
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
A more high-tech way

1420
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
is to

1421
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
block the part

1422
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
where the sunlight

1423
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
is only hot.

1424
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You can reduce it a little bit.

1425
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I think

1426
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
in terms of greenhouse,

1427
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
transparent is the first priority.

1428
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So this is a little bit

1429
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
related to my last slide

1430
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
about the future world.

1431
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Today,

1432
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
for a very special requirement,

1433
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
there will be a different approach.

1434
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
The dual mode

1435
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
just now

1436
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
doesn't work because it's not transparent.

1437
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Orchids are all dead.

1438
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So we have to think of

1439
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
a new material solution.

1440
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The interesting part is here.

1441
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
For this different application.

1442
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Thank you.

1443
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1444
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Our discussion today

1445
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
is because we already asked

1446
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
so we don't have to

1447
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
ask about the content.

1448
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I think the content is really interesting.

1449
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I'm not a professional

1450
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
so I can't ask professional questions.

1451
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I want to leave it

1452
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
at the end

1453
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
and let everyone

1454
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
discuss first.

1455
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
If there are any questions

1456
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
related to the content,

1457
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
we can discuss

1458
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
whether it is

1459
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
students studying abroad

1460
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
or international cooperation

1461
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
between teachers.

1462
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
This is definitely

1463
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
the core of Terra.

1464
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
You can speak

1465
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
later.

1466
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
What time is our meeting scheduled?

1467
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
In fact, there are only about 10 minutes left.

1468
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
If everyone has something to say,

1469
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
you can also be neutral.

1470
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
If you want to stay and discuss later,

1471
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
this room can be kept open.

1472
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
After 10 minutes,

1473
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
you can turn it off.

1474
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It's a bit stressful to talk while recording.

1475
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I've been waiting for you to turn it off.

1476
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I'll ask the next question first.

1477
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm going to turn it off.

1478
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
What?

1479
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Are you going to turn it off?

1480
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Wait, let me finish my question first.

1481
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I have a question.

1482
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I just saw you talking about

1483
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
the D

1484
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
written in Chongqing style,

1485
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
right?

1486
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I was thinking

1487
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
when I went to see your website,

1488
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
you mentioned

1489
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
that the cloth becomes transparent

1490
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
after it is covered,

1491
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
but the white cloth

1492
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
will pass the red line,

1493
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
so there is no cloth

1494
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
in Chongqing.

1495
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But if

1496
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
the transparent cloth

1497
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
doesn't pass the red line,

1498
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
so you can see the cloth.

1499
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I was thinking

1500
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
these things

1501
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
can be used

1502
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
for confidential communication

1503
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
or other applications.

1504
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Do you know what I mean?

1505
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
These possibilities are...

1506
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Can you answer this question?

1507
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yes, of course.

1508
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Actually,

1509
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
the red line

1510
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
means

1511
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
that

1512
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
you can imagine

1513
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
if

1514
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
you have

1515
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
a sensor

1516
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and you

1517
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
take a picture of

1518
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
the background

1519
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
of the red line,

1520
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
and you know

1521
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
what the background looks like,

1522
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
then you

1523
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
wear a

1524
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
pixel-by-pixel display,

1525
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and you adjust

1526
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
the radiation on your body

1527
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
to be the same as the background,

1528
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
then you are

1529
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
transparent in real life.

1530
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yes,

1531
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
there are many...

1532
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yes, yes.

1533
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I was thinking that

1534
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
it's like a encryption.

1535
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
You put something on it,

1536
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
but in a certain channel,

1537
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
it's actually transparent.

1538
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
You have to decode it.

1539
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It's like that.

1540
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
You can think like that.

1541
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
At least I thought like that when I saw it.

1542
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Yes,

1543
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
basically,

1544
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
we are talking about

1545
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
a visible

1546
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
material.

1547
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
It can have

1548
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
a color of

1549
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
heat radiation.

1550
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You can control it

1551
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
separately like this.

1552
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
OK.

1553
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
But in this case,

1554
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
in the application of communication,

1555
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
it will be

1556
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
like what we usually

1557
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
say,

1558
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
like the encryption of visual data

1559
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
and decode it.

1560
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Compared to that,

1561
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
how efficient is it?

1562
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Because it's not a very...

1563
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
When we do communication,

1564
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
we don't think like that.

1565
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But in terms of concept, it's a bit like that.

1566
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Is it more efficient?

1567
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Or is its safety level

1568
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
higher? I think the safety level is lower.

1569
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But

1570
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
the efficiency seems to be quite high.

1571
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Because it can be...

1572
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It can be recorded.

1573
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
The

1574
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
amount of

1575
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
data will be smaller.

1576
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I don't know.

1577
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I think if I really want to

1578
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
push it like this,

1579
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I can think about it.

1580
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
If you do it today,

1581
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
suppose I only have

1582
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
a very narrow

1583
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
wavelength

1584
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
with

1585
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
specific text.

1586
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I can't see the other wavelengths.

1587
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Let me tell you

1588
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
how many

1589
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
wavelengths I'm going to use today.

1590
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Then you can see my text in this wavelength.

1591
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
You can't see the other wavelengths.

1592
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
In this case, it may be possible.

1593
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Because you talked about the

1594
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
rush later, I think it's really cool.

1595
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So I just thought

1596
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
it was a bit like what you said.

1597
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And because of

1598
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
the control of the

1599
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
current of the film,

1600
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
you can have a schedule.

1601
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
It doesn't have to be

1602
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
a fixed wavelength.

1603
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It will change

1604
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
according to some other conditions.

1605
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So even if you

1606
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
really find that wavelength,

1607
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
it's only for that second.

1608
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Because it's already

1609
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
somewhere else.

1610
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So it's a

1611
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
visual data

1612
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
that covers it.

1613
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Because at least people

1614
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
can't see it, so it's a visual data

1615
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
method.

1616
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Yes.

1617
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I don't know.

1618
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I just thought about it.

1619
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I think

1620
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
it's pretty cool.

1621
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But I don't have

1622
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
a lot of ideas to realize this thing.

1623
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But I think it's okay.

1624
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You can think about it.

1625
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I'm done asking.

1626
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Because what I do

1627
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I'm not doing material science.

1628
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I'm not doing chemistry or physics.

1629
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm doing more communication research.

1630
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So I think about

1631
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
this kind of thing.

1632
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yes.

1633
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
You can

1634
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
brainstorm again another day.

1635
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Okay.

1636
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Do you have any more questions?

1637
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Then

1638
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
if there are no questions,

1639
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'll turn off the recording.

1640
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I'll turn it off.

1641
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
1, 2, 3.
