0	5000	Ok, let's start.
5000	15000	Ok, first I need to introduce myself.
15000	18000	Please introduce yourself, thank you.
18000	22000	Ok, I have prepared a few videos.
22000	26000	I will use them to introduce myself.
26000	32000	Today, I will talk about the simple introduction of metal solvents.
32000	41000	My name is Zeyu Lin, and I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.
41000	44000	First, I will give a brief self-introduction.
44000	52000	As I mentioned, I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.
52000	58000	My department is the National Research and Development Department of the Institute of Materials and Materials Research.
58000	61000	My main job here is...
61000	63000	Sorry, let me use the laser pointer.
63000	72000	My main job here is to connect the material's microstructure with its mechanical properties,
72000	80000	as well as its related performance characteristics.
80000	90000	At present, I am working on the development of high-strength and high-durability ferrous alloys,
90000	98000	as well as the microstructure of permanent magnets,
98000	103000	as well as the development of some raw materials.
103000	110000	Today, I would like to introduce my post-doctoral research...
110000	114000	No, I mean my work accumulated during my post-doctoral studies,
114000	118000	and my post-doctoral research in February this year,
118000	121000	which is about four years of work.
121000	125000	The field of research is mainly the solid-state integration of copper,
125000	128000	which is similar in nature, as well as liquid metal.
128000	132000	The integration technology used is a technology called ultrasonic integration.
132000	141000	Its principle is to use high-pressure and high frequency vibration to achieve the deformation of the material to form the node.
141000	149000	It can be used in steel, high-strength steel, or aluminum alloy, etc.
149000	150000	It can be used in...
150000	154000	The main scene that can be considered is that the composite structure of multi-materials,
154000	156000	such as the structure of the car body,
156000	161000	can achieve the goal characteristics of lightweighting and high strength.
166000	168000	Sorry, I just made a mistake.
168000	172000	I graduated from Tokyo University of Japan in 2019,
172000	174000	and majored in material engineering.
174000	181000	My other major is the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China,
181000	185000	and the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China.
185000	188000	That's all for the main self-introduction.
188000	195000	Next, I'm going to start introducing today's main speech topic,
195000	202000	which is mainly about the integration of solid-state and liquid metal materials that are similar in nature,
202000	207000	and then use ultrasonic integration to observe the strength of its interface.
208000	214000	First, I will give a simple background introduction.
214000	220000	In the engineering background,
220000	226000	listeners may be more familiar with the fact that
226000	232000	steel is a very solid base.
232000	235000	It is one of the basic and indispensable materials.
235000	239000	The picture on the left shows that
239000	248000	there are about 15% to 20% of steel in the world every year.
248000	250000	Because there are a lot of steel applications,
250000	254000	including architecture, general people, military facilities, transportation, etc.
254000	258000	It accounts for about 15% to 20% of transportation.
258000	264000	It is mainly applied to the construction of car parts and the structure of the car body.
264000	267000	There are a lot of types of steel used,
267000	275000	including soft steel, medium-strength, high-strength, and ultra-high-strength steel.
275000	278000	At present, the development field of materials is mainly focused on
278000	286000	how to improve its extensibility and high-strength, etc.
286000	292000	The picture on the lower left is called DynamoCurve,
292000	295000	which is a curve distribution like a banana.
295000	297000	Why is there such a distribution?
297000	300000	It is mainly derived from the fact that the strength of the material increases,
300000	302000	but the extensibility does not decrease.
302000	307000	Based on the background of traditional physics,
307000	311000	such strength and extensibility are indispensable.
311000	316000	However, many scientists are using various methods
316000	319000	to try to get out of this field.
320000	326000	The current research situation is to try to achieve the high strength and high extensibility of both, etc.
326000	330000	Why do we need such a high-strength steel development?
330000	334000	It is mainly used when the car body is hit by a heavy object.
334000	338000	High-strength steel can often provide stronger support
338000	343000	to avoid fatal damage to passengers.
343000	345000	In order to improve safety,
345000	350000	the current material development is mainly focused on high-strength and high extensibility, etc.
354000	358000	What kind of steel is used?
358000	361000	Different strengths of steel are used in different areas of the car body structure.
361000	364000	This is a simple introduction.
364000	366000	You can clearly see that
366000	369000	if the car is hit by a heavy object,
369000	375000	the stress and gravity come from the front and back, etc.
375000	379000	At this time, you need a high-strength structural material
379000	383000	to support the entire car body.
383000	389000	The current high-strength steel developed by traditional physics
389000	392000	has reached 780, 980, 1180, etc.
392000	394000	This represents the strength of steel,
394000	397000	which is about 550 MPa.
397000	400000	The current mainstream high-strength steel is
400000	403000	concentrated in the front and back of 1000 MPa.
403000	406000	This is the current situation in which the structural material is used.
406000	408000	On the other hand,
408000	411000	if we don't use steel,
411000	414000	and we use a high-strength material,
414000	419000	it will not be able to support the entire car body.
419000	421000	On the other hand,
421000	424000	if we don't use steel,
424000	430000	and we use a high-strength material,
430000	436000	such as aluminum, copper, and carbon fiber, etc.
436000	439000	If we use this material,
439000	441000	it can be made very lightweight
441000	445000	and has sufficient safety.
446000	449000	However, the price is also very high.
449000	452000	As you can see here,
452000	456000	for a good car like Audi R8,
456000	460000	the recommended price in 2020 is about $70,000.
460000	462000	This price is hard to meet for ordinary people.
462000	467000	So we mainly use traditional steel
467000	471000	and aluminum and carbon fiber.
471000	473000	In this respect,
473000	476000	you have to make a choice
476000	482000	in terms of cost and mechanical quality.
487000	493000	The name of the car body structure we often use in our industry
493000	496000	is a multi-material structure.
496000	498000	Multi-Material Structure
499000	502000	As you can see here,
502000	504000	in addition to steel,
504000	507000	it also has a lot of external body parts,
507000	510000	such as the door, engine cover, etc.
510000	512000	In order to make it lightweight,
512000	514000	we usually use aluminum alloy.
514000	516000	The main maintenance material is aluminum alloy.
518000	520000	In this respect,
520000	525000	when the car body is assembled,
525000	527000	we mainly use
527000	531000	high-strength steel
531000	533000	and aluminum alloy.
533000	535000	In this respect,
535000	537000	they need to be fixed and processed
537000	539000	to form a complete structure.
539000	542000	It is conceivable that
542000	545000	some processes need to be processed
545000	547000	to combine them together.
547000	549000	In recent years,
549000	553000	in addition to the emission of environmental regulations,
553000	557000	the demand for lightweighting is increasing.
557000	559000	On the right side of the slide,
559000	561000	there is a picture of
561000	564000	the materials used in the field of cars
564000	567000	in 2030,
567000	572000	including aluminum and high-strength steel.
572000	577000	HSF stands for High Strength Steel.
577000	579000	The ratio of these two materials
579000	582000	will increase from 29% to 57%.
582000	585000	In the near future,
585000	590000	in order to establish high strength
590000	592000	and lightweighting,
592000	594000	we will use more aluminum
594000	596000	and more high-strength steel.
596000	598000	Therefore, how to combine
598000	600000	iron and lightweighting alloy
600000	602000	in the manufacturing process
602000	606000	is quite important.
608000	610000	Now we will introduce
610000	612000	the traditional way
612000	614000	of combining materials
614000	616000	and manufacturing technology,
616000	618000	i.e. welding.
618000	620000	Traditionally,
620000	622000	we define welding
622000	624000	as a process
624000	626000	in which two separate materials
626000	628000	are heated
628000	630000	to a high temperature
630000	632000	and then combined
632000	634000	to produce
634000	636000	sufficient quality
636000	638000	welding.
638000	640000	In this process,
640000	642000	the defects
642000	644000	will gradually disappear.
644000	646000	At such a high temperature,
646000	648000	along with the change
648000	650000	in the structure
650000	652000	of the fibers
652000	654000	and the growth
654000	656000	of the center,
656000	658000	heat is also affected,
658000	660000	and so on.
660000	662000	In this regard,
662000	664000	the material itself
664000	666000	is mechanically affected
666000	668000	by the change
668000	670000	in the structure
670000	672000	of the fibers.
672000	674000	After the welding point
674000	676000	is formed,
676000	678000	all the fibers
678000	680000	around it
680000	682000	will undergo
682000	684000	huge changes.
684000	686000	Such changes
686000	688000	are sometimes not
688000	690000	completely positive.
690000	692000	How to prevent
692000	694000	low-performance
694000	696000	welding?
696000	698000	The first point
698000	700000	is to use
700000	702000	a high temperature
702000	704000	to melt steel
704000	706000	and aluminum.
706000	708000	There will be several problems.
708000	710000	The first is that
710000	712000	aluminum and steel
712000	714000	have very different melting points.
714000	716000	The melting point of aluminum
716000	718000	is about 600 degrees,
718000	720000	while that of steel
720000	722000	is about 1400 to 1500 degrees.
722000	724000	At high temperature,
724000	726000	it will generate
726000	728000	a huge
728000	730000	for aluminum,
730000	732000	at such a high temperature,
732000	734000	it will generate a huge
734000	736000	firepower,
736000	738000	and it will generate a lot of expansion.
738000	740000	Expansion will form
740000	742000	various compounds
742000	744000	between steel and aluminum
744000	746000	in the interface.
746000	748000	This compound
748000	750000	has a very poor mechanical performance.
750000	752000	Why?
752000	754000	Because the problem it encounters
754000	756000	is very brittle,
756000	758000	and it is very impenetrable.
758000	760000	After a little impact,
760000	762000	it will crack like ceramic
762000	764000	or glass.
764000	766000	That is to say,
766000	768000	the function of the melting point itself
768000	770000	will fail.
770000	772000	At the same time,
772000	774000	there will be cracks
774000	776000	in the interface
776000	778000	due to high temperature
778000	780000	.
780000	782000	This is quite disadvantageous
782000	784000	to mechanical manufacturing.
784000	786000	That is to say,
786000	788000	at high temperature,
788000	790000	it is quite disadvantageous
790000	792000	to combine steel and aluminum
792000	794000	with general combination technology.
794000	796000	In other words,
796000	798000	what we may consider next
798000	800000	is how to
800000	802000	reduce the temperature of the combination.
802000	804000	That is to say,
804000	806000	the combination technology at low temperature
806000	808000	can prevent
808000	810000	such a problem
810000	812000	to a certain extent.
812000	814000	That is to say,
814000	816000	we will focus on
816000	818000	how to combine steel and aluminum.
818000	820000	That is, we want to combine
820000	822000	at the melting point of steel and aluminum,
822000	824000	which is about 660 degrees.
824000	826000	Combining at this temperature
826000	828000	is called solidification.
828000	830000	That is to say, there is no
830000	832000	fusion between the two.
832000	834000	Next,
834000	836000	I will introduce
836000	838000	solidification.
838000	840000	As I mentioned earlier,
840000	842000	it can combine
842000	844000	two components
844000	846000	and
846000	848000	there will be no fusion
848000	850000	during the process.
850000	852000	Its heating is also
852000	854000	lower than the melting point of any material.
854000	856000	What we need
856000	858000	is to introduce more
858000	860000	sufficient deformation
860000	862000	in the material interface.
862000	864000	At sufficient temperature,
864000	866000	the interface will expand.
866000	868000	After the expansion,
868000	870000	the defects will gradually disappear.
870000	872000	That is to say,
872000	874000	the effect of combining.
874000	876000	Here, our main
876000	878000	design concept is
878000	880000	that the main concept of solidification
880000	882000	is how to make
882000	884000	the defects on the interface disappear,
884000	886000	including holes and
886000	888000	cavities, etc.
888000	890000	At the same time,
890000	892000	most materials
892000	894000	usually have a layer of
894000	896000	pollutants on the surface,
896000	898000	such as carbon
898000	900000	and oxygen,
900000	902000	and other compounds.
902000	904000	At the same time,
904000	906000	there will be a certain
906000	908000	degree of oxidation film
908000	910000	on the surface.
910000	912000	You may have heard
912000	914000	that aluminum
914000	916000	is very easy to oxidize.
916000	918000	It forms a layer
918000	920000	of very self-destructive oxidation film
920000	922000	on the surface.
922000	924000	This oxidation film
924000	926000	is self-destructive enough
926000	928000	to protect the material inside
928000	930000	from further oxidation and deformation.
930000	932000	This kind of oxidation film
932000	934000	is quite beneficial in the
934000	936000	combination.
936000	938000	Traditionally, we still have to
938000	940000	achieve the contact between the
940000	942000	pure atom and the atom
942000	944000	in solidification.
944000	946000	That is to say,
946000	948000	the contact between the
948000	950000	pure atom and the atom
950000	952000	or the metal atom
952000	954000	is formed.
954000	956000	On the other hand,
956000	958000	we can say that
958000	960000	we have introduced
960000	962000	enough deformation
962000	964000	at high temperature
964000	966000	to make it like clay
966000	968000	to stir
968000	970000	and form a
970000	972000	interlocking interface structure.
972000	974000	OK
974000	976000	Here,
976000	978000	I will
978000	980000	make a brief introduction
980000	982000	to solid-state integration.
982000	984000	In traditional
984000	986000	solid-state integration,
986000	988000	the first method is called expansion integration.
988000	990000	The main principle is to use
990000	992000	high pressure and high temperature
992000	994000	to apply on two objects
994000	996000	that need to be combined.
996000	998000	With such high temperature and high pressure
998000	1000000	condition, it can form
1000000	1002000	interlocking structure in enough time.
1002000	1004000	Such
1004000	1006000	integration method can be applied
1006000	1008000	on metal or ceramic
1008000	1010000	or metal
1010000	1012000	or even carbon fiber.
1012000	1014000	But the problem is that
1014000	1016000	its integration time is quite long and
1016000	1018000	requires a higher integration temperature.
1018000	1020000	At the same time,
1020000	1022000	assuming that the interface is over
1022000	1024000	high temperature and over a long time,
1024000	1026000	it will form an
1026000	1028000	overly complex structure,
1028000	1030000	including a metal-based object,
1030000	1032000	which is what we mentioned earlier,
1032000	1034000	forming a layer
1034000	1036000	like a ceramic,
1036000	1038000	a non-extensible middle layer.
1038000	1040000	This middle layer
1040000	1042000	has a very weak mechanical nature,
1042000	1044000	and is not conducive to the overall integration strength.
1044000	1046000	On the other hand,
1046000	1048000	the other
1048000	1050000	is friction-mixing integration.
1050000	1052000	Its principle is
1052000	1054000	to use a high-speed
1054000	1056000	rotating
1056000	1058000	welding head.
1058000	1060000	The surface friction
1060000	1062000	forms a high temperature.
1062000	1064000	After the high temperature, the material
1064000	1066000	gradually softens,
1066000	1068000	but it is not yet at the melting point.
1068000	1070000	So it will be like
1070000	1072000	clay.
1072000	1074000	After it softens,
1074000	1076000	the welding head can be pressed down
1076000	1078000	and start to move.
1078000	1080000	Then move along
1080000	1082000	the seam between the two.
1082000	1084000	Let the interface
1084000	1086000	gradually pass through
1086000	1088000	the welding head.
1088000	1090000	But on the other hand,
1090000	1092000	this material
1092000	1094000	can be used in all kinds of
1094000	1096000	aluminum alloy, aluminum-ferrous alloy,
1096000	1098000	etc. Its application range is quite wide.
1098000	1100000	For example,
1100000	1102000	let's take the
1102000	1104000	Japanese alloy as an example.
1104000	1106000	It mainly uses
1106000	1108000	this kind of
1108000	1110000	alloying technology
1110000	1112000	for the
1112000	1114000	combination of
1114000	1116000	materials.
1116000	1118000	On the other hand,
1118000	1120000	its shortcomings are
1120000	1122000	that it takes a long time to
1122000	1124000	combine, and
1124000	1126000	after it is combined,
1126000	1128000	there will be some
1128000	1130000	differences in the interface.
1130000	1132000	At the same time,
1132000	1134000	on the other hand,
1134000	1136000	the time it takes to combine
1136000	1138000	also takes a long time to
1138000	1140000	combine.
1140000	1142000	As a result,
1142000	1144000	based on
1144000	1146000	this background,
1146000	1148000	based on this background,
1148000	1150000	we use another
1150000	1152000	type of alloying technology.
1152000	1154000	This is called ultrasonic welding,
1154000	1156000	which is ultrasonic welding.
1156000	1158000	The principle of ultrasonic welding
1158000	1160000	may be mentioned earlier.
1160000	1162000	It is a certain degree of pressure
1162000	1164000	on the two overlapping
1164000	1166000	blades,
1166000	1168000	which is about
1168000	1170000	15,000 to 24,000
1170000	1172000	degrees,
1172000	1174000	and then the
1174000	1176000	interface is
1176000	1178000	friction-heated.
1178000	1180000	In this case,
1180000	1182000	the interface will
1182000	1184000	develop a
1184000	1186000	deformity
1186000	1188000	that will
1188000	1190000	form a
1190000	1192000	fiber structure
1192000	1194000	that causes
1194000	1196000	the surface
1196000	1198000	interface to
1198000	1200000	be damaged.
1200000	1202000	Therefore,
1202000	1204000	it is not
1204000	1206000	conducive to
1206000	1208000	the production of
1208000	1210000	metal-fiber products
1210000	1212000	with mechanical strength.
1212000	1214000	Therefore,
1214000	1216000	it is expected to
1216000	1218000	be used in
1218000	1220000	car lightweighting
1220000	1222000	and high-strength
1222000	1224000	composite structure
1224000	1226000	materials manufacturing in the
1226000	1228000	future.
1228000	1230000	At the same time,
1230000	1232000	there is also a lower
1232000	1234000	combination temperature
1234000	1236000	compared to the
1236000	1238000	general ultrasonic welding.
1238000	1240000	At the same time,
1240000	1242000	the friction heat
1242000	1244000	formed in the
1244000	1246000	interface is
1246000	1248000	quite small.
1248000	1250000	The friction heat
1250000	1252000	formed in the
1252000	1254000	small area
1254000	1256000	affects the strength
1256000	1258000	of the material
1258000	1260000	and the machine itself,
1260000	1262000	and it can be fully combined
1262000	1264000	to produce less
1264000	1266000	micro-structural changes.
1266000	1268000	This is quite beneficial
1268000	1270000	to the overall production.
1270000	1272000	On the other hand,
1272000	1274000	the picture below
1274000	1276000	is the application
1276000	1278000	of the current
1278000	1280000	ultrasonic welding
1280000	1282000	on the base
1282000	1284000	and the
1284000	1286000	high-speed vibration of
1286000	1288000	the water and the
1288000	1290000	friction heat of the
1290000	1292000	interface and the
1292000	1294000	transformation of
1294000	1296000	water and water
1296000	1298000	to form a
1298000	1300000	composite
1300000	1302000	and
1302000	1304000	carry out
1304000	1306000	the process of
1306000	1308000	mechanical manufacturing.
1308000	1310000	About the
1310000	1312000	1960s,
1312000	1314000	the main application
1314000	1316000	scene was used
1316000	1318000	on the
1318000	1320000	printing circuit board
1320000	1322000	to make the
1322000	1324000	chips.
1324000	1326000	It is a technique
1326000	1328000	often used in
1328000	1330000	circuit board manufacturing.
1330000	1332000	It also uses
1332000	1334000	pressure and vibration
1334000	1336000	to complete the
1336000	1338000	combination on the
1338000	1340000	surface of the
1340000	1342000	chip.
1342000	1344000	Combining the
1344000	1346000	main principles,
1346000	1348000	we can make a
1348000	1350000	more detailed introduction.
1350000	1352000	Traditionally,
1352000	1354000	there may be hundreds to
1354000	1356000	thousands of newtons of
1356000	1358000	pressure on the
1358000	1360000	pressure.
1360000	1362000	After the
1362000	1364000	pressure is
1364000	1366000	fixed, the
1366000	1368000	vibration is usually
1368000	1370000	20 to 60 microns.
1370000	1372000	The vibration is
1372000	1374000	about 15,000 to 24,000
1374000	1376000	per second.
1376000	1378000	In such a short
1378000	1380000	and dense vibration,
1380000	1382000	the interface will
1382000	1384000	generate a lot of deformation
1384000	1386000	and a lot of friction
1386000	1388000	heat.
1388000	1390000	The temperature of
1390000	1392000	friction heat and deformation
1392000	1394000	can be completed
1394000	1396000	by combining the
1396000	1398000	shape of the interface.
1398000	1400000	However,
1400000	1402000	due to the
1402000	1404000	high-speed deformation of the
1404000	1406000	interface,
1406000	1408000	various phenomena such as
1408000	1410000	heat and expansion
1410000	1412000	will occur.
1412000	1414000	Therefore, in so many
1414000	1416000	interfaces, including heat,
1416000	1418000	expansion, and deformation,
1418000	1420000	the interface formation mechanism
1420000	1422000	is not easy to
1422000	1424000	understand, especially
1424000	1426000	when it comes to
1426000	1428000	soft metal materials.
1428000	1430000	For harder materials,
1430000	1432000	such as steel and
1432000	1434000	carbon,
1434000	1436000	it is quite rare
1436000	1438000	to use the
1438000	1440000	scene to
1440000	1442000	combine the
1442000	1444000	formation of the
1444000	1446000	interface mechanism.
1446000	1448000	If we now
1448000	1450000	further
1450000	1452000	progress to
1452000	1454000	how to use the
1454000	1456000	superfine fiber to
1456000	1458000	apply it on hard materials,
1458000	1460000	mainly in some
1460000	1462000	preliminary research,
1462000	1464000	most of the
1464000	1466000	superfine fiber is used
1466000	1468000	in aluminum alloy or
1468000	1470000	aluminum alloy, etc.,
1470000	1472000	which is called soft material.
1472000	1474000	The interface will form
1474000	1476000	after it reaches a high temperature,
1476000	1478000	like clay,
1478000	1480000	such as deformation and compression.
1480000	1482000	The deformation and compression
1482000	1484000	process causes a lot of
1484000	1486000	changes in the
1486000	1488000	fiber structure of the
1488000	1490000	interface.
1490000	1492000	However,
1492000	1494000	if the superfine fiber
1494000	1496000	is used
1496000	1498000	on steel,
1498000	1500000	iron,
1500000	1502000	and carbon,
1502000	1504000	this part needs to be
1504000	1506000	further explored.
1506000	1508000	On the other hand,
1508000	1510000	if it is used on hard materials,
1510000	1512000	the combination of
1512000	1514000	iron and aluminum
1514000	1516000	has been done in
1516000	1518000	a lot of preliminary research.
1518000	1520000	They are mainly concentrated
1520000	1522000	in a short time,
1522000	1524000	within a few seconds,
1524000	1526000	they can form
1526000	1528000	about 30 minutes
1528000	1530000	in the expansion
1530000	1532000	process.
1532000	1534000	IMC is mainly
1534000	1536000	intermetallic,
1536000	1538000	which is not
1538000	1540000	conducive to
1540000	1542000	mechanical properties.
1544000	1546000	Most of the research
1546000	1548000	is focused on this later stage
1548000	1550000	of intermetallic
1550000	1552000	formation.
1552000	1554000	On the other hand,
1554000	1556000	in the early stage,
1556000	1558000	the material was rubbed,
1558000	1560000	molded, and then transformed.
1560000	1562000	After the transformation,
1562000	1564000	how will the
1564000	1566000	interface
1566000	1568000	form?
1568000	1570000	This mechanism is relatively rare,
1570000	1572000	but this part is also right.
1572000	1574000	Superfine fiber
1574000	1576000	application
1576000	1578000	has a significant impact
1578000	1580000	on the combination of
1580000	1582000	iron and aluminum.
1582000	1584000	Therefore,
1584000	1586000	we mainly
1586000	1588000	use superfine fiber
1588000	1590000	for the
1590000	1592000	interface of
1592000	1594000	superfine fiber and
1594000	1596000	iron.
1596000	1598000	First, we will
1598000	1600000	divide it into
1600000	1602000	interface reactions
1602000	1604000	when it is combined.
1604000	1606000	On the other hand,
1606000	1608000	we will use another type of metal
1608000	1610000	combination to discuss
1610000	1612000	how to combine
1612000	1614000	in a shorter time
1614000	1616000	.
1618000	1620000	Here,
1620000	1622000	I may have mentioned that
1622000	1624000	the first part is
1624000	1626000	to understand
1626000	1628000	its interface
1628000	1630000	when it is combined
1630000	1632000	.
1632000	1634000	We will use iron and aluminum,
1634000	1636000	and iron and iron.
1636000	1638000	The main purpose is that
1638000	1640000	there is no interface reaction
1640000	1642000	between the two,
1642000	1644000	so we use iron and aluminum.
1644000	1646000	After the combination,
1646000	1648000	the interface analysis will be more difficult.
1648000	1650000	As a contrast,
1650000	1652000	we use iron and aluminum to combine.
1652000	1654000	On the other hand,
1654000	1656000	from the principle introduction above,
1656000	1658000	it can be said that
1658000	1660000	only high-speed friction
1660000	1662000	will cause contact between the interface.
1662000	1664000	The deepening of the contact point
1664000	1666000	and the roughness of the material surface
1666000	1668000	have a significant impact.
1668000	1670000	Research in this area
1670000	1672000	is not sufficient.
1672000	1674000	On the one hand,
1674000	1676000	one part of the research
1676000	1678000	focuses on the roughness of the surface
1678000	1680000	and the impact on the strength of the combination.
1680000	1682000	On the other hand,
1682000	1684000	because we have to use iron
1684000	1686000	and other materials to combine,
1686000	1688000	the mechanical performance of iron
1688000	1690000	such as hardness and strength
1690000	1692000	will also have an impact
1692000	1694000	on the nature of the combination.
1694000	1696000	Therefore, the hardness of the iron itself
1696000	1698000	and the different micro-structures
1698000	1700000	will also have an impact
1700000	1702000	in the next introduction.
1702000	1704000	On the other hand,
1704000	1706000	why do we choose these two combinations
1706000	1708000	such as iron and aluminum
1708000	1710000	and iron and titanium
1710000	1712000	?
1712000	1714000	The main reason is that
1714000	1716000	aluminum and titanium
1716000	1718000	have different deformation capabilities
1718000	1720000	at high temperatures.
1720000	1722000	Therefore, we plan to
1722000	1724000	explore the impact of
1724000	1726000	these two different materials
1726000	1728000	.
1728000	1730000	Because of time,
1730000	1732000	we will directly enter the
1732000	1734000	experimental step.
1734000	1736000	First of all, it is the combination of
1736000	1738000	iron and aluminum.
1738000	1740000	The material we use
1740000	1742000	is a soft
1742000	1744000	non-metallic atomic steel,
1744000	1746000	a medium-strength steel,
1746000	1748000	and a pure aluminum plate
1748000	1750000	as a research subject.
1752000	1754000	On the surface,
1754000	1756000	it is exposed to the mirror.
1756000	1758000	After the exposure,
1758000	1760000	we will measure the roughness
1760000	1762000	of the surface.
1762000	1764000	Next, we use superfine steel
1764000	1766000	to make superfine steel.
1766000	1768000	The main combination
1768000	1770000	condition is that we use
1770000	1772000	a pressure of about 2000 newtons,
1772000	1774000	which is applied to
1774000	1776000	about 10 times the
1776000	1778000	thickness of the steel,
1778000	1780000	which is about 20,000 times per second
1780000	1782000	and about 40 microns
1782000	1784000	.
1784000	1786000	The combined time is about
1786000	1788000	0.01 seconds to
1788000	1790000	2.0 seconds.
1790000	1792000	After the superfine steel
1792000	1794000	is combined,
1794000	1796000	the next step is to
1796000	1798000	stretch the time to judge
1798000	1800000	its combined strength.
1800000	1802000	After the stretching is broken,
1802000	1804000	suppose that it is broken on the interface,
1804000	1806000	we will observe
1806000	1808000	the electronic microscope
1808000	1810000	and analyze the microstructure.
1810000	1812000	On the other hand,
1812000	1814000	if it is not suitable for stretching time,
1814000	1816000	we will prepare another batch of
1816000	1818000	samples that have not yet been stretched.
1818000	1820000	After the sample is cut
1820000	1822000	into two halves,
1822000	1824000	the surface is exposed
1824000	1826000	and the electronic microscope
1826000	1828000	is used
1828000	1830000	to observe
1830000	1832000	its image
1832000	1834000	and the deformation
1834000	1836000	of the interface
1836000	1838000	.
1838000	1840000	First of all,
1840000	1842000	suppose we use
1842000	1844000	steel and iron,
1844000	1846000	and iron and iron
1846000	1848000	and iron and iron and iron
1848000	1850000	on the interface,
1850000	1852000	we use
1852000	1854000	superfine steel to combine,
1854000	1856000	we can see that the horizontal axis
1856000	1858000	is the combined strength and the vertical axis
1858000	1860000	is the combined time.
1860000	1862000	It is obvious that
1862000	1864000	it only takes about
1864000	1866000	2 seconds.
1866000	1868000	Its strength
1868000	1870000	is about
1870000	1872000	2,000 newtons.
1872000	1874000	This sufficient pull strength
1874000	1876000	is enough to break
1876000	1878000	the IF steel,
1878000	1880000	that is, the infrared atomic steel itself.
1880000	1882000	It is greater than
1882000	1884000	the strength of the steel itself.
1884000	1886000	On the other hand,
1886000	1888000	if we compare it with other combinations,
1888000	1890000	such as expanding
1890000	1892000	and combining iron and iron,
1892000	1894000	it takes a relatively long
1894000	1896000	time, about 50 seconds,
1896000	1898000	and requires a certain degree of
1898000	1900000	high temperature.
1900000	1902000	In this case,
1902000	1904000	if we compare
1904000	1906000	the microstructure of the interface
1906000	1908000	with the microstructure of the microscope,
1908000	1910000	we find that the deformation of the interface
1910000	1912000	is quite concentrated,
1912000	1914000	about only 10 micrometers
1914000	1916000	before and after.
1916000	1918000	On the other hand,
1918000	1920000	if we compare it with the FASW
1920000	1922000	combined with friction mixing,
1922000	1924000	it is about 15 to 20
1924000	1926000	micrometers.
1926000	1928000	At the same time, it is accompanied by a very serious deformation.
1928000	1930000	Such a severe deformation
1930000	1932000	is reliable to the welding point itself.
1932000	1934000	That is to say,
1934000	1936000	its durability is
1936000	1938000	also a subject to
1938000	1940000	consider.
1940000	1942000	Therefore,
1942000	1944000	the superimposed interface
1944000	1946000	shows that it can be done
1946000	1948000	in a short time without
1948000	1950000	a lot of deformation
1950000	1952000	.
1952000	1954000	On the other hand,
1954000	1956000	if it is used on
1956000	1958000	the interface of iron and iron
1958000	1960000	and iron and nickel,
1962000	1964000	this part
1964000	1966000	is that we did
1966000	1968000	electronic microscope
1968000	1970000	and EBSD analysis on it.
1970000	1972000	We found that the
1972000	1974000	formation of the interface
1974000	1976000	will form a small
1976000	1978000	friction particle on the interface.
1978000	1980000	This friction particle will gradually increase
1980000	1982000	and at the same time be accompanied by friction
1982000	1984000	to friction the upper and lower
1984000	1986000	nickel and iron body.
1986000	1988000	After enough time
1988000	1990000	and temperature, it will
1990000	1992000	gradually be compressed.
1992000	1994000	After the compression,
1994000	1996000	it will produce a serious deformation
1996000	1998000	and then spread to the entire
1998000	2000000	integrated interface
2000000	2002000	to complete the formation of the integrated interface.
2002000	2004000	At the same time,
2004000	2006000	it is accompanied by the
2006000	2008000	interface and
2008000	2010000	the
2010000	2012000	interface and
2012000	2014000	the
2014000	2016000	interface.
2016000	2018000	If
2018000	2020000	with enough time,
2020000	2022000	the superimposed
2022000	2024000	interface
2024000	2026000	can form enough
2026000	2028000	partial and
2028000	2030000	serious deformation.
2030000	2032000	It can be completed in a short time.
2032000	2034000	On the other hand,
2034000	2036000	the surface of the superimposed
2036000	2038000	interface is
2038000	2040000	on the other hand,
2040000	2042000	if we use a thicker
2042000	2044000	interface, the
2044000	2046000	time of the
2046000	2048000	interface will be shorter
2048000	2050000	and the time of the
2050000	2052000	interface will be longer.
2052000	2054000	If it is a thicker
2054000	2056000	interface,
2056000	2058000	it will form a thicker
2058000	2060000	and larger
2060000	2062000	situation such as
2062000	2064000	how to compress
2064000	2066000	these three peaks and three valleys.
2066000	2068000	It takes a longer time and
2068000	2070000	pressure to compress it,
2070000	2072000	and then the interface will form such a
2072000	2074000	deformed surface to form more
2074000	2076000	integrated interfaces.
2076000	2078000	Therefore, a slightly smoother
2078000	2080000	integrated interface
2080000	2082000	does not have any
2082000	2084000	pollutants or oxidizers,
2084000	2086000	etc. It is powerful.
2086000	2088000	On the other hand,
2088000	2090000	if it is
2090000	2092000	the type of steel itself,
2092000	2094000	if it is replaced,
2094000	2096000	because what we mentioned earlier
2096000	2098000	is that it uses a
2098000	2100000	relatively
2100000	2102000	average fiber structure
2102000	2104000	of ferrite
2104000	2106000	IF steel.
2106000	2108000	Next, we will use
2108000	2110000	polystyrene
2110000	2112000	and ferrite
2112000	2114000	neutral carbon steel
2114000	2116000	and 14% nickel steel
2116000	2118000	and 0.08%
2118000	2120000	low carbon steel.
2120000	2122000	Their hardness and
2122000	2124000	microstructure will be
2124000	2126000	a relatively
2126000	2128000	close comparison.
2132000	2134000	This part is
2134000	2136000	ferrite itself.
2136000	2138000	In addition to the
2138000	2140000	IF steel used at the beginning,
2140000	2142000	we also prepared different types of steel.
2142000	2144000	Here,
2144000	2146000	ferrite, porcelain steel, and
2146000	2148000	martensite steel have different hardness.
2148000	2150000	As the hardness increases,
2150000	2152000	the combination of strength
2152000	2154000	is getting lower and lower.
2154000	2156000	Compared with the beginning,
2156000	2158000	nickel and IF steel only need
2158000	2160000	2 seconds to complete the combination.
2160000	2162000	On the other hand,
2162000	2164000	ferrite and ferrite
2164000	2166000	neutral carbon steel
2166000	2168000	need about 5 seconds to
2168000	2170000	complete the combination.
2170000	2172000	On the other hand,
2172000	2174000	once the hardness of
2174000	2176000	martensite steel is about
2176000	2178000	200 to 300 hardness,
2178000	2180000	it needs more time to complete the combination.
2180000	2182000	Why do we have
2182000	2184000	different situations?
2184000	2186000	We analyzed the interface
2186000	2188000	and found that
2188000	2190000	for the same steel photo,
2190000	2192000	the bottom is
2192000	2194000	porcelain steel,
2194000	2196000	the right bottom is ferrite.
2196000	2198000	Ferrite and nickel
2198000	2200000	will form more friction resistance.
2200000	2202000	This friction resistance has a
2202000	2204000	partial shrinkage and deformation.
2204000	2206000	On the other hand,
2206000	2208000	ferrite and nickel
2208000	2210000	have a relatively low deformation.
2210000	2212000	At the same time,
2212000	2214000	the interface
2214000	2216000	still has a defect.
2216000	2218000	That is to say,
2218000	2220000	steel steel
2220000	2222000	requires a long time to complete the combination.
2222000	2224000	At the same time,
2224000	2226000	we can get
2226000	2228000	a conclusion
2228000	2230000	that
2230000	2232000	ferrite steel
2232000	2234000	has a relatively similar
2234000	2236000	hardness.
2236000	2238000	It can provide
2238000	2240000	more
2240000	2242000	shrinkage and deformation.
2242000	2244000	This large-scale shrinkage and deformation
2244000	2246000	is conducive to the increase in the strength of the combination.
2246000	2248000	Therefore,
2248000	2250000	this part is
2250000	2252000	the friction
2252000	2254000	generated by the
2254000	2256000	combination.
2256000	2258000	Friction has
2258000	2260000	different mechanisms.
2260000	2262000	It is mainly divided into
2262000	2264000	ferrite and
2264000	2266000	nickel friction.
2266000	2268000	The main difference between the two is that
2268000	2270000	the interface
2270000	2272000	on the ferrite and nickel
2272000	2274000	will form
2274000	2276000	something like a friction resistance.
2276000	2278000	On the other hand,
2278000	2280000	if it is nickel,
2280000	2282000	in the case of
2282000	2284000	nickel,
2284000	2286000	the harder material
2286000	2288000	on the ferrite
2288000	2290000	will break down
2290000	2292000	and form
2292000	2294000	friction.
2294000	2296000	In other words,
2296000	2298000	such a situation occurs
2298000	2300000	when the hardness difference is relatively large,
2300000	2302000	such as nickel and ferrite.
2302000	2304000	In other words,
2304000	2306000	the first part of the
2306000	2308000	conclusion here
2308000	2310000	focuses on the appearance of
2310000	2312000	friction particles
2312000	2314000	with a relatively large
2314000	2316000	friction resistance.
2316000	2318000	On the other hand,
2318000	2320000	if it is ferrite,
2320000	2322000	the friction loss
2322000	2324000	in the ferrite itself
2324000	2326000	will take longer
2326000	2328000	to eliminate
2328000	2330000	such interface defects
2330000	2332000	to complete the
2332000	2334000	formation of the combination.
2334000	2336000	The second part
2336000	2338000	is the
2338000	2340000	strength of the combination.
2340000	2342000	In other words,
2342000	2344000	in the case of
2344000	2346000	a reaction,
2346000	2348000	the formation of the
2348000	2350000	combination interface
2350000	2352000	will be skipped.
2352000	2354000	In other words,
2354000	2356000	at the initial stage,
2356000	2358000	before the formation of
2358000	2360000	the interface,
2360000	2362000	how does the
2362000	2364000	interface system evolve?
2364000	2366000	This is the part
2366000	2368000	to be discussed.
2368000	2370000	First of all,
2370000	2372000	in the case of
2372000	2374000	ferrite,
2374000	2376000	we use the traditional
2376000	2378000	IF steel mentioned earlier,
2378000	2380000	as well as 5000-grade aluminum alloy,
2380000	2382000	and then superimpose the
2382000	2384000	interface.
2384000	2386000	During the process of
2386000	2388000	interface, we will
2388000	2390000	stick a thermocouple
2390000	2392000	to measure the temperature of
2392000	2394000	the interface.
2394000	2396000	The picture on the right
2396000	2398000	shows the change in
2398000	2400000	strength of the
2400000	2402000	interface.
2402000	2404000	After 1 second,
2404000	2406000	the strength of the
2406000	2408000	interface increased rapidly
2408000	2410000	to 2.5 seconds,
2410000	2412000	and the
2412000	2414000	interface was
2414000	2416000	completed.
2416000	2418000	After that,
2418000	2420000	the strength of the
2420000	2422000	interface decreased
2422000	2424000	gradually,
2424000	2426000	and the
2426000	2428000	temperature of the
2428000	2430000	interface increased
2430000	2432000	rapidly.
2432000	2434000	The temperature of the
2434000	2436000	interface increased
2436000	2438000	rapidly.
2438000	2440000	In about 1 second,
2440000	2442000	the temperature reached
2442000	2444000	about 400 degrees.
2444000	2446000	We compared it with
2446000	2448000	the previous study,
2448000	2450000	and found that the temperature
2450000	2452000	obtained in 1 second was
2452000	2454000	about 400 degrees.
2454000	2456000	The ability of the
2456000	2458000	interface to transform
2458000	2460000	increased rapidly,
2460000	2462000	and the
2462000	2464000	interface's
2464000	2466000	defective adjustment
2466000	2468000	and integration were
2468000	2470000	enough to
2470000	2472000	complete the
2472000	2474000	interface.
2474000	2476000	On the other hand,
2476000	2478000	we used the
2478000	2480000	electromagnetic microscope
2480000	2482000	to observe the
2482000	2484000	defective adjustment
2484000	2486000	and integration of the
2486000	2488000	interface.
2488000	2490000	The defective adjustment
2490000	2492000	and integration of the
2492000	2494000	interface were
2494000	2496000	enough to complete
2496000	2498000	the complete
2498000	2500000	integration of the
2500000	2502000	interface in 2.5 seconds.
2502000	2504000	Therefore,
2504000	2506000	we can classify the
2506000	2508000	whole phenomenon
2508000	2510000	as the initial
2510000	2512000	phase of the
2512000	2514000	interface.
2514000	2516000	After the
2516000	2518000	interface was
2518000	2520000	frictionized,
2520000	2522000	it would break off
2522000	2524000	from the
2524000	2526000	machine's side
2526000	2528000	and attach to the
2528000	2530000	iron's side.
2530000	2532000	As time went on,
2532000	2534000	the interface's
2534000	2536000	ability to transform
2536000	2538000	under high temperature
2538000	2540000	was not as obvious
2540000	2542000	as that of aluminum.
2542000	2544000	On the other hand,
2544000	2546000	some basic
2546000	2548000	physics concepts
2548000	2550000	may know that
2550000	2552000	iron is a hexagonal
2552000	2554000	metal.
2554000	2556000	If the hexagonal metal
2556000	2558000	is subjected to friction in
2558000	2560000	transformation,
2560000	2562000	it will have many
2562000	2564000	limitations.
2564000	2566000	Therefore,
2566000	2568000	we can see that
2568000	2570000	the integration strength of the
2570000	2572000	interface gradually
2572000	2574000	reached a platform
2574000	2576000	before 2 seconds.
2576000	2578000	It reached a
2578000	2580000	stable state.
2580000	2582000	However,
2582000	2584000	after 2 seconds,
2584000	2586000	the strength of the
2586000	2588000	interface increased dramatically.
2588000	2590000	Why did this happen?
2590000	2592000	At first,
2592000	2594000	before the
2594000	2596000	interface reached
2596000	2598000	a stable state,
2598000	2600000	we thought that
2600000	2602000	after 2 seconds,
2602000	2604000	we would find that
2604000	2606000	once it passed
2606000	2608000	600 degrees,
2608000	2610000	it would
2610000	2612000	produce a
2612000	2614000	lower
2614000	2616000	contact point
2616000	2618000	on the
2618000	2620000	left side
2620000	2622000	of the
2622000	2624000	interface.
2624000	2626000	That is to say,
2626000	2628000	from the original
2628000	2630000	HCP type
2630000	2632000	to the BCC type.
2632000	2634000	BCC's
2634000	2636000	transformation ability
2636000	2638000	is better than
2638000	2640000	the hexagonal
2640000	2642000	metal's
2642000	2644000	HCP,
2644000	2646000	the densest hexagonal metal.
2646000	2648000	In the next step,
2648000	2650000	in order to verify
2650000	2652000	our assumption,
2652000	2654000	we observed the interface
2654000	2656000	and found that
2656000	2658000	at about 2.0 seconds,
2658000	2660000	the interface would
2660000	2662000	break off on the
2662000	2664000	left side of the
2664000	2666000	HCP type
2666000	2668000	and stick to the
2668000	2670000	metal's side.
2670000	2672000	After 2 seconds,
2672000	2674000	the interface's
2674000	2676000	original gap
2676000	2678000	would disappear
2678000	2680000	after 2.0 seconds.
2680000	2682000	The gap would
2682000	2684000	gradually disappear.
2684000	2686000	So,
2686000	2688000	3.0 seconds
2688000	2690000	is enough to
2690000	2692000	complete the interface.
2692000	2694000	In contrast,
2694000	2696000	the expansion interface
2696000	2698000	mentioned earlier
2698000	2700000	usually takes
2700000	2702000	about 1-2 hours
2702000	2704000	to complete
2704000	2706000	the metal-type interface.
2706000	2708000	We also found that
2708000	2710000	after about 2.0 seconds,
2710000	2712000	the interface would
2712000	2714000	break off on the left side of the
2714000	2716000	HCP type.
2716000	2718000	We also found that
2718000	2720000	at about 2.0 seconds,
2720000	2722000	the interface would
2722000	2724000	break off on the
2724000	2726000	left side of the
2726000	2728000	HCP type.
2728000	2730000	In contrast,
