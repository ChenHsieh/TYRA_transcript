Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's presentation by Project Tara.
I'm your host, Suyi An.
First of all, I'd like to thank our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,
for being our speaker today.
I'm also very happy to have people from all cities
and towns join us in this online academic presentation.
I'm going to spend a minute or two to introduce our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,
and then I'm going to talk a little bit about today's event.
I'm really happy that Gaoxue can be our speaker today.
Gaoxue and I met in NTU.
Gaoxue's background is very, very special.
Gaoxue graduated from NTU's Department of Chemistry,
so she didn't major in psychology.
Later, she studied at NTU's Psychological Institute,
which is a laboratory in the field of development.
She had a very special experience.
After Gaoxue studied at the Psychological Institute,
she didn't give up her original chemistry major.
Instead, she studied at NTU's Counseling Center.
After graduation, she even became a full-time high school chemistry teacher.
Gaoxue is currently studying in the Ph.D. class of the Catholic University of Belize.
As far as I know, she also studies in the field of psychological development.
When I was preparing for this presentation, I was actually quite nervous.
Because Gaoxue herself sent me a very rich CV.
At first glance, I thought she was a god.
Gaoxue, if I say something wrong, you can correct me at any time.
I was thinking about what to prepare.
The information is too rich.
Gaoxue has won many research-related awards,
including the Best Dictionary and Dictionary Award
at the Taiwan Psychological Institute,
as well as the Young Scholar Award
at the Taiwan Women's Studies Institute, etc.
I can't wait to be awarded.
Today, Gaoxue will mainly share with us
her speech on the topic of gender equality.
After all, I'm not an expert,
so I'll leave it to Gaoxue to explain it to us later.
But I think this topic, especially recently,
is particularly in line with the current situation.
During COVID-19, Taiwan may not be very obvious,
but abroad, there are indeed quite a lot of people
who are concerned about gender equality.
Many parents and children
may be stuck at home all day long
due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.

There will be Q&A at the end.
But the Project Hera's mode is quite casual.
So if you have any questions,
you can just turn on your microphone and ask.
Or if you feel a little embarrassed,
you can leave a comment in the chat.
Or you can also leave a comment
at the end of the Q&A.
That's all for my introduction.
Gaoxue, it's your turn.

My name is Lin Gaoxue.
I'm a Ph.D. student in the research lab of Parenthoven Research Lab.
Let me introduce our school first.
Our school's name in Chinese is the Parenthoven Research Lab.
Fifty years ago, there was a political dispute over the unification of Taiwan.
In Belgium, this political dispute was led by the mother tongue.
In Belgium, this political dispute was led by the mother tongue.
Fifty years ago, our Parenthoven Research Lab
was divided into two groups,
which were the parents and native speakers.
The first one was the first Parenthoben,
which was more Spanish-speaking,
while the other group was the second Parenthoven.
We call it the Anthropology and Japanese Studies University.
We are only different in terms of the knowledge,
but our training is the Hangul and French.

After introducing our school,
let me introduce myself.
Thank you for the introduction.
I have been at the University of Taiwan
for 8 years.
My major is Chemistry,
and my minor is Psychology.
My major is Psychology.
In 2019,
I joined the University of Taiwan
to study for my Ph.D.
My major is Psychology,
and I joined the two subfields,
Culture and Health Psychology.
I used to be a full-time
Chemistry teacher in Songshan High School,
and now I am a full-time research assistant
in the Laboratory of Professor Cao Zheng-cao
at the Department of Communication and Technology
of the Department of Communication and Technology.
I am interested in the emotional experience
in my family,
especially the influence of parents
in the social culture.
The keywords of my research theme
include parenting stress, parental burnout,
and emotional regulation
of how parents deal with their emotions related to stress.
I will use a physiological indicator
to measure the stress of a person.
I will use cultural perspective
or the network analysis commonly used in communication psychology
to care about the relationship between people
or the different phenomena in people's minds.
At the beginning of the report,
I will introduce my field,
the field of developmental psychology.
I refer to the introduction
made by my master's class teacher,
Prof. Lei Ganlin, in the online course of Coursera.
From his point of view,
before we get to know the development of psychology,
we may need to understand what psychology is.
Psychology cares about the knowledge of people and minds.
It also includes the field of experimental psychology.
In this field,
we may want to care about a person's cognitive,
emotions, language,
and even our intuition.
We also include social and personality psychology.
In this field, we care about a person's personality.
We care about social psychology
and the special cultural phenomenon
in a cultural community.
We also care about the similarities and differences
between different cultures.
Of course, applied psychology is also a major field in psychology.
For example, criminal psychology,
which I mentioned before.
It also includes the issues of clinical psychology
in the interaction between clinical psychologists and patients.
In the field of education or organization,
there are also many issues discussed in psychology.
Regardless of the field,
we must accept the training provided by the following three sets of knowledge.
The first is physiological psychology.
Regardless of which field we are,
we must understand that there is a set of physiological mechanisms
behind everyone's behavior and cognition.
In addition to this,
when we measure the abstract phenomenon in psychology,
we must be sure that the phenomenon we measure
is what we think in our mind.
This approach is usually a psychometric method.
The last is developmental psychology.
Developmental psychology provides us
with a holistic approach
that allows us to understand that each of us is developing over time.
The current time will affect my current behavior,
and the current time will affect my future time.
So we are all evolving and developing
over a period of time.
In this case, everyone will interact with their society,
so they will play different roles.
For example, you may play a student,
you may play a partner, you may play a friend,
or even a parent.
The development of cognition,
the development of language, the development of character,
the development of emotion, and even the development of action
will be discussed in different topics.
My research focuses on the relevant issues
when a person is a parent.
Parenting psychology
is a very popular research topic
in developmental psychology in the past.
Some researchers even believe that
the relevant life experience of parenting
is a very central aspect of our modern life.
The reason why this experience
is so important is that
when we are middle-aged and become parents,
we do a lot of things
that are driven by parenting.
Some researchers even believe
that parenting is a fundamental human need
or human motive.
Since parenting is such an important life experience,
it is very complicated.
If there are teachers or students
who are now parents,
they will be very familiar with the following sentence.
Parenting is a very good experience.
Because of being parents, we have experienced a lot of things
and gained a sense of meaning.
But at the same time,
we also feel a lot of pressure because we are parents.
In my master's class,
I especially focused on the general situation.
When parents are taking care of their children,
they feel the daily pressure to discuss.
After I completed a theory model
for a master's thesis,
like what I wrote on Facebook,
maybe because I am a chemistry intern
who graduated from NTU,
many parents came to me to discuss
the psychological development of their children.
In fact,
rather than discussing the development of their children with me,
I feel that these parents need an ear
to listen to their pain
in the past few years.
For example,
what they often say to me is,
Teacher, I really don't know what to do.
Can you help me? We are really helpless as parents.
We are really tired.
This is what a group of teenagers' parents told me.
When they talk about this,
they usually play along with their tears.
In the course of the internship,
I often think about
whether my simple model
of daily stress relief
is suitable to explain
the intense depression
these parents feel.
At this time,
in 2019, I met my two bosses.
They are recruiting PhD students
to discuss the extreme phenomenon
of parenting stress,
so I went from NTU Psychology
to the University of Paris.
In particular, I will further discuss
the topic of Parental Burnout in my PhD paper.
This brings me to the main focus of my report today,
Parental Burnout.
I will talk about this concept from a historical background.
I will also talk about how we define
Parental Burnout from the perspective of psychology.
I will also ask a question,
why is Parental Burnout so important?
It must be because we consider its consequences.
Finally, we want to provide a method
to deal with Parental Burnout.
Before dealing with it,
let's start with the concept of Parental Burnout.
If you are a parent,
you may have experienced the following experiences.
If you are a psychologist,
you may have heard of these experiences from your parents.
These experiences are what we visit
those parents who have obviously been
traumatized by Parental Burnout.
We ask them,
what is Parental Burnout?
They will tell you,
this is a giant fatigue.
They live every day,
just trying to get by.
They live like a robot,
dealing with Parental Burnout every day.
Parental Burnout is like a mess.
Parental Burnout is like a mess.
Just trying to take care of their kids.
But they found out that
it is hard to control their kids.
They could not bear their kids.
The most horrible thing is,
they told us,
if they could not imagine
that they could become a parent like that.
These are what we visit
parents of parental burnout.
When we asked them about their experience,
they told us.
This phenomenon was discovered by
a Russian researcher, Enika.
She found out that
parents of children with brain hemorrhage
seem to have some asthmatic phenomenon.
Not only that,
parents of children with chronic illness
also have this phenomenon.
For example,
parents of children with diabetes
also have this phenomenon.
We found out that
parents of children with special needs
also have this phenomenon.
My two instructors,
we asked them further.
Is it possible that
this asthmatic phenomenon
not only occurs in families with special needs?
Is it possible that
this phenomenon also occurs in ordinary families?
Why did they ask this question?
Mainly because they observed
a large-scale change in modern culture.
Whether it's official or
books in our rooms,
we promoted a kind of
noble guide on education,
namely positive parenting.
We asked our parents to
adopt non-violent,
loving, supportive, and sensitive
education to face our children.
If you see this kind of
propaganda,
you can see that
there is even a positive parenting tip
on CDD's website in the US.
A book was also published in the EU
to talk about how parents can
teach their children.
One of the ideas is positive parenting.
In Taiwan,
CDD has been promoting
positive parenting.
Another thing is that
parents' custody
is also under the control of the government.
For example,
if our parents take a strict education,
such as scolding or beating our children,
our government may not be able to
teach our children well.
In this case,
our parents' rights are constantly being adjusted.
Children's rights are constantly increasing.
The concept of positive parenting is that
we need to respect our children.
In fact, our children
are increasingly disrespecting our parents.
We also see that
our husbands are still maintaining their jobs.
Many women are
starting to work.
A family becomes a double-minded family.
However, there are still many problems with children.
The time that parents can allocate to their children
is relatively compressed.
When parents' resources are compressed,
it is easier for them to feel
the pressure of raising their children.
Of course,
women should not return to the family environment.
The change in the economic environment
makes the time for the husband and wife
to take care of their children less and less.
Because of this environment,
two teachers asked
if it is possible to see
parental burnout in ordinary families.
In recent cross-cultural research,
it is estimated that
at least 5% of parents in the United States,
more than 3.5 million parents,
are suffering from parental burnout.
Parental burnout is a new prevailing psychological syndrome.
In fact,
in a well-known psychological science website,
there are experts who are specifically introducing
what parental burnout is.
In the New York Times and CNN Opinion,
many reporters and food workers
are constantly advocating parental burnout
during the quarantine period.
We should provide the first-hand help
to such a phenomenon.
In 2017,
researchers from more than 100 countries
around the world
organized an international consulting
to focus on
what parental burnout is.
We pay special attention to whether parental burnout
appears not only in the United States and Europe,
but also in various cultures around the world.
Basically, every year,
we hold a seminar to share
the recent research results of parental burnout.
Last year, we held the first seminar
to discuss the epidemic in Belgium.
This year, we will hold the second conference
on parental burnout in Poland.
However, due to the epidemic,
we will postpone it until next year, 2021.
Welcome to our seminar.
Let's join us
to discuss the topic of parental burnout.
Let's go back to science.
To discuss parental burnout,
the first thing we need to do is to tell you
that the phenomenon we measure really exists.
We use two ways to define parental burnout.
In the past,
there was a very well-developed concept,
job burnout,
which was discussed.
We changed it into a way
suitable for parenting context
through a top-down approach
to define parental burnout.
The second way is to interview
parents who are already
in the job market.
This is a bottom-up approach
to define parental burnout.
After two years of research and definition,
we finally defined it as a psychological syndrome
with four major symptoms.
The first symptom is that
you feel exhausted by your role as a parent.
For example,
I am completely run down by my role as a parent.
The second symptom is that
you feel the distance between you and your child.
For example,
I do what I am supposed to do for my children,
but nothing more.
I can't stand my role as a father
and mother anymore.
The last symptom is
contrast with previous parental self.
For example,
I don't think I am a good father and mother
like I used to be to my children.
After defining the four major symptoms
of parental burnout
through psychological syndrome,
the next question is
whether the concept of parental burnout
is a specific concept.
In our recent research,
we asked parents about their work burnout
and their parental burnout.
We took their answers
and did a factor analysis.
We found that
when we separate the two factors,
parental burnout and work burnout,
it is more suitable than
when we combine the two concepts
into one.
From this result,
we can see that
parental burnout has a variable effect.
I hope that
the above introduction can convince you that
parental burnout really exists.
It is a psychological concept
that can be measured
and has a professional definition.
The next question is
if it really exists,
is it really important?
If we want to consider whether it is important or not,
we must consider its consequences.
In the following session,
in our early research,
we found that parental burnout
can predict the idea of parents
avoiding and committing suicide
at the same time.
We can imagine that
a parent who is under pressure
has two most common reactions.
One is to avoid.
However,
parenting is completely different
from the work environment.
If we feel tired at work,
we can ask for sick leave,
we can even resign.
However, as parents,
we can't ask for leave or resign.
We are always the parents of the child.
We can see that
parents have suicidal thoughts.
In addition,
we can see that parents have drug addiction.
If they have parental burnout,
we can imagine that
a person who wants to avoid these related things
may take drugs to avoid
and continue to think about these related issues.
We can also see that
parents who are under parental burnout
can predict that
they will be violent to their children.
We can also imagine that
when we are under pressure,
in addition to avoiding,
another way is to attack.
We can see that
parents who are under parental burnout
are more likely to abuse their children.
We can also see that
parents who are under parental burnout may ignore their children.
Finally, we can see that
parents who are under parental burnout
will be deeply affected
by the relationship between their husband and wife
when they are in a marital relationship.
We can further discuss these consequences
for such issues.
We need to make sure that
the consequences of parental burnout
occur after parental burnout.
We need to make sure that
the consequences of parental burnout
occur after parental burnout.
We use a research analysis method
to collect data for three times
at different time points across 5.5 months.

to analyze whether our parental burnout
can predict the result of the next time point.

Okay.
Thank you for your presentation.
I have a question.
You mentioned that
PARENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
is a very important factor.
Do you find that
it has something to do with genetics?
Is it related to genes?
Or,
in the future
when parents
get birthed in,
there is also the risk of parental burnout?
Thank you.
First of all,
as far as I know,
there are no proofs for THIS.
I have to admit that
the topic of parental burnout
is a new topic
in the last 5 years.
So, I think,
at least as far as my knowledge,
I haven't seen any discussion on the related genes.
But I can see,
for example, depression,
I can guess that
in the topic of parental burnout,
or even in the topic of job burnout,
I am not familiar with the topic of job burnout.
But I think there are many genes
that play an important role.
This is the first question.
The second question is,
can you repeat the second question?
The first question is,
can parents
get birthed in,
there is also the risk of parental burnout?
Is there any similar phenomenon?
OK.
We are still in the process of research,
so we don't know how the next generation
will raise their children.
From the past research,
we can see that
if the previous generation
took violent
or negative behavior,
the next generation
will also take negative behavior.
This is a vicious cycle.
This is a very good question.
Maybe the parents
who are in parental burnout,
their children
may continue to be in parental burnout.
But because our children have not grown up yet,
we are not sure
if this phenomenon is possible.
But it is possible.
Thank you.
Let's see if there are any questions
from the audience.
Hello.
I have a question
about this paper.
First of all, thank you for this presentation.
My research is related to the role of parents.
My group focuses on
the experience of parenting
, so there are many things to connect with.
I would like to ask about this paper.
The author is Gao Xian.
When he wrote this paper,
he mentioned that
part of the parental psychological characteristics
is their own EQ.
The other part is that they want to be a perfect parent.
This idea may also cause
parental burnout.

I am a researcher
and I immigrated to the US.
I was originally from Taiwan,
Hong Kong, and the US.
I decided to move to the US
because I have a child with a mental disability.
I decided to move to the US
because I have a child with a mental disability.
I decided to move to the US
because my assumption was that
parents were expecting their children
to be a good parent.
to be a good parent.
It was hard for them
to agree on their goals
when they were raised in a Chinese society.
It was hard for them to agree on their goals
when they were raised in a Chinese society.
I assumed that
they would feel more pressure
to adjust their education
to fit the mainstream American culture.
I asked them similar questions.
I asked them similar questions.
What do you think is a good parent
in your original culture?
What do you think is a good parent
in your original culture?
What do you think is a good parent
in your original culture?
I am a family member with a mental disability.
I am a family member with a mental disability.
In my culture,
the acceptance of parents
in this country is much higher.
In my culture,
parents respect their children
and how they raise their children.
Even if a child has an emotional breakdown,
the society has a high tolerance for such a situation.
The society has a high tolerance for such a situation.
The pressure of raising a child with a mental disability
is much lower than in their original country.
This cross-culture does not cause too much pressure on them.
However, my research is a culture change.
The current research is a culture change.
It is not the same as the research that you are doing in your country.
It is not the same as the research that you are doing in your country.
This research is very interesting.
I want to share it with you.
Have you read a 2014 article by Charlie Sum Chu
Have you read a 2014 article by Charlie Sum Chu
about Thai parenting?
He is specializing in Chinese families
In the United States.
He mentioned that
Chinese parents
are proud of their children
but also make sure their children
are educated like the world requires.
In addition to this,
they also want their children
to stay in the family
and feel their values in China.
They might even be strengthened.
I remember...
Is it Kangyi?
I'm afraid I said it wrong.
I think it's Kangyi.
They might strengthen
their original culture
in the immigrant family.
That's what I remember.
I wouldn't be surprised
if that's the case.
Indeed,
my research focuses on
disability.
I can only look at
the intersectionality
between disability, culture, and parenting.
It's very different
from just looking at the family.
I can only say that
having a family
with different characteristics
from other families
does affect the whole relationship.
I think
I can do more research on this
in the future.
I don't know how to
take this into consideration.
It's just my opinion.
You mentioned the education culture
of special families.
I think it's very interesting.
You mentioned
the intersectionality
between special families
and education culture.
It's very interesting.
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to your paper.
Or any...
Any publication.
I'm looking forward to your paper.
My first paper
is on meta-synthesis.
It's like a meta-analysis
of a qualitative model.
This paper has been published.
I'll link it to you later.
It's more of a literature review.
It talks about the intersectionality
between parents.
We generally talk about the role of parents.
But there are many aspects
under the role of parents.
They may just provide
the care of everyday life.
Or they may play
the role of
family financial support.
At the same time,
there are many other aspects
under the umbrella term
of parents.
So my first paper
is about this.
My second paper
is purely on qualitative research.
It hasn't been published yet.
I hope I can finish it this year.
I see.
I hope you can finish it soon.
I can't wait to see your paper.
I'm looking forward to
your comment.
Your first paper.
Okay.
I'll look for it.
Yiting is posting
her paper link
in the chat.
I'm quite happy
that today's discussion
is very heated.
I think it's as exciting
as the speech itself.
Due to time constraints,
I'd like to ask
whether you have
any last words
or take home message
for the audience
or future audience
who can listen to
the speech
on Project Taira.
Parental balance is a very important issue.
We think it's a very important issue.
There are many social cultures
and personal factors
that play an important role.
As I said in the final remark,
we hope to rebalance
the entire research.
In the past,
we only cared about the child's
positive development.
We also hope that
we can care more about
the health of parents themselves
in the future research.
We hope that
we can contribute
more to the research.
That's all.
Thank you, Annie.
Thank you, Kaohsiung.
I think Kaohsiung's speech
is very useful
for parents
in Taiwan
who are struggling
to raise their children.
Thank you
for your participation.
I know Kaohsiung's video
is very interesting
and has references.
Today's speech
will be posted
on Project Taira's website.
If you want to review
or recommend it to your friends,
you can search
on Project Taira's website.
Good night to everyone
in Taiwan.
Have a wonderful Saturday
in Europe or America.
That's all for today's speech.
I will leave
the chat
for a few more minutes
so you can
take a look at the chat.
I will also
download it.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, Kaohsiung.
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.
We have to turn off the recording.
Okay.
