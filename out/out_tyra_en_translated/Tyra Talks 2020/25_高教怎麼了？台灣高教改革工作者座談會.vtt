00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the summer special series activities of Taira at the end of September.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
This year's summer special series activities are a bit long. We will actually extend it to October.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
Today's topic is called, what's wrong with high-profile, high-profile reform workers forum.

00:22.000 --> 00:33.000
We are very honored to invite three speakers from different perspectives and fields to talk about high-profile reform for a long time.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
The first thing I want to do is to introduce our speakers to you.

00:39.000 --> 00:50.000
Our first speaker is Dr. Chen Xiaoyu. He is currently a vice-researcher at the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy Research and Information Center.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
He is also a member of the Taiwan High-Level Educational Industry Association.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
The second speaker is Dr. Xu Ruifu. He is currently a doctoral student at the Taiwan University Telecommunications Institute.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
He was the president of the former Taiwan University Graduate Association.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
At the same time, he is also a youth consultant member of the Executive Yuan.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
He has been very active in participating in high-profile reform, especially from a student's point of view.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
The third speaker is Dr. Xie Ruizhe.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
But we may not call him that today.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Because everyone is used to calling him Zha Shi.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
So we may also call him Zha Shi.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
You can also call him that.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
He is now the policy assistant of the Legislative Yuan Educational and Cultural Committee.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
So he can also bring you different points of view in this regard.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I will not mention it again today.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
But let me talk about it first.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Today's three speakers, their bosses are very willing to let them share.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
But based on their experience, they will speak on behalf of themselves.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I will talk about it for them.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Okay.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
So this is what we are going to do today.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
We will invite the three speakers to talk about how they view the issue of high-profile reform.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Then we can start discussing from what they have said.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Let's start with Xiaoyu.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
How do you view this issue?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Okay. I am Xiaoyu Chen.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Thank you for the invitation.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
And thank you to the other two speakers, Ruizhe and Zha Shi, for their participation.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
When it comes to high-profile reform,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
I dare not say that I have been involved in reform for many years.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
I basically want to share some observations on high-level education.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Okay.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
My interest in research is mainly high-level education.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I also read this in my class.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
The topic I want to talk about today is about high-level talents.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
If you have seen my Facebook page,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
which is LaoYuNanJie,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I have a fan page.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
I often write on it that Taiwan issues are global issues.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
But we also have different domestic issues that need to be discussed.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
I cut from three perspectives of human resources management.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
The first is the part about talent selection.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
In fact, my country's current problem of doctoral education,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I personally think that it is not that no one reads doctoral classes,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
but that excellent talents are not willing to read doctoral classes.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
That is the problem of our country.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Okay. This is the part about talent selection.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Everyone can discuss this later.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
From the part about the budget and the budget flow,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I personally think that there are two things,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
some things are worth discussing.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
The first is the talent selection.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
The first is the part about doctoral education.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
What kind of doctoral education do we provide in China?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Do we treat everyone as paper machines,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
lab workers,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
or do we really need to train people to solve problems?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And then in the future,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I hope that the industry or the academic world

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
will develop more and more.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I think this is a very important issue.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I think this is a very important issue.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I think this is a very important issue.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I hope that the industry or the academic world

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
will develop more and more.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I hope that the industry or the academic world

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
will develop more and more.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Okay. The other problem is the mechanism.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
The mechanism will be discussed by the other two speakers.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
I personally think there are two parts.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
One part is about the part about study abroad scholarship.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
One part is about the part about study abroad scholarship.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
The related planning and distribution of the field

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
is how to proceed.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
The more serious problem for our domestic doctoral class

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
is that at present

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
the domestic doctoral class

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
only has the part about study abroad scholarship.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Whether you are a TA or an RA,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
the education of the doctoral class

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
does not have the so-called scholarship system.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
In other words,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
we do not have the so-called fellowship.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
The third part is

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
mainly about the flow of money.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
The human resources management

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
likes to talk about the flow of money.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
The part about the flow of money.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
The part about the flow of money.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
My personal opinion is that

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
whether you are a senior talent,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
a doctoral talent,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
an academic talent,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
or an industrial talent,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
in other words,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
if you want to develop into the academic world

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
or the industry,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
basically,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
the mechanism of the talent

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
is a part of the global flow.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Regardless of which university you graduate from,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
or which direction you want to go in the future,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
for example,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
if you want to go to a foreign university

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
or research institution

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
in the future,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I suggest that

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
we should think about

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
how to cooperate internationally in the future

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
and help these talents

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
to have a good development abroad.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
If you want to come back to China,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
whether it is a university,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
research institution,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
or industry development,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
in fact,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
we consider,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
for example,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
whether you apply for

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
a job in China,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
to be honest,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
in my personal experience,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
if you really come back to China

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
and apply for a job in China

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
or do research,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
of course money is a very important factor,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
but money can never

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
solve all the problems.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
In fact,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
we need more related support,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
for example,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
for young scholars.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
In fact,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
if you want to

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
enter the industry,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
my personal opinion is that

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
in fact, there are many doctors in Taiwan

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
and there are many questions related to

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Dr. Liu Lang.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Basically, if you can pass the doctorate exam,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
you basically have a certain

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
ability or a certain degree.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
My personal opinion is that

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
if you finish your doctorate,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
you have to have a bottom line,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
which is to know that

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
you may not be able to develop

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
as much as you want,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
but you have a lot of things you can do.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Like me,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
to be honest,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I am a Ph.D.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
in the Department of Philosophy

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
at the National University of Private University.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
To be honest,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
we are the weakest group.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I graduated from the Department of Literature

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
and then I studied a doctorate,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
but after I graduated,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I found that I could not

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
engage in teaching at all.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Even when I was laid off

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
from school for a while,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I was thinking that

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
there was no other possibility.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
So my friends called me

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
a truck driver.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I have a driver's license

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
in Taiwan.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
In other words,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
if the school or my legal agency

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
doesn't want me,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I can find it the next day

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
and I can drive a bus right away.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
We often joke that

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
the school or my legal agency

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
doesn't want me

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
because my colleagues

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
don't want me to hurt passers-by.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
This is my report.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Thank you.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Let me summarize a little bit.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
As Xiaoyu mentioned,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Taiwan has talented people,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
but it seems that

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
there are very few people

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
who are willing to be a Ph.D.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Also,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Taiwan is obviously

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
without a Ph.D. system.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Thirdly,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
we either have talented people

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
or they don't come back.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It seems that

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
somehow we don't have such a balance

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
to achieve such a fluid balance.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
We can discuss this later.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Before we discuss,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
let's change the order.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
As Xiaoyu and Ruifu

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
just introduced,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
let's have Zha Shi

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
to talk about

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
the reform of higher education.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Can you hear me?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yes.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I'm Zha Shi.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Today, I'm going to

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
talk about something

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
that I don't understand.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
After all, the Legislative Yuan

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
has to supervise the education committee

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
for a long time,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
so I think the government

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
should do more.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
What are these actions?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Today's audience

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
has a different point of view.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
From the beginning,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I think the talent cultivation,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
the ability to retain talents,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
and the ability to retain talents

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
is a national security strategy.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I think everyone can accept this.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
We all think

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
this is a national strategy,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
but if more and more people

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
in Taiwan are missing

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
or unwilling to be a Ph.D.,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
this is definitely a national security crisis.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
From this perspective,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
starting with the local Ph.D.,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
we have indeed encountered

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
a lot of situations and problems.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
But let's start

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
with a big vision.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
If Taiwan wants to be

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
a country with international competitiveness

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
and global competitiveness,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
first of all, our local Ph.D. students

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
like Xiaoyu said,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
these excellent Ph.D. students are not willing to study.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
This is definitely the first part of the problem

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
that we have to solve.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
In fact, talents are not only

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
local talents, international talents,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
and overseas talents

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
like you.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Can Taiwan do this?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Because we have been dealing with

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
an overseas study and

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
international education specialization.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
This is related to

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
international education specialization.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
To echo what Xiaoyu said,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
many of our Ph.D. students

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
have a healthy

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
education plan system overseas.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
This part allows us to

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
recruit more international students

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
in Taiwan.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
We focus on Ph.D. students.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
They have more planning resources

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
to go to the world

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
to have more international experience,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
more international education experience.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
But for Taiwan,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
the last piece of the puzzle

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
is the new economic immigration law

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
that we did not finish

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
in the 9th session of the last meeting.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
This is actually a lot of pieces.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Starting with local Ph.D. training,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
this is very important.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Because I believe that many

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
academic professors

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
will have this goal

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
in the end.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
So local Ph.D. training

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
is very important.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
But in terms of international flow,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
do we have such a healthy

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
international education

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
that allows everyone to

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
communicate internationally?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
In the end, there is a very good

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
talent or flow policy,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
which is our new economic immigration law.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
We have been following it recently.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
So I think this is a part of the

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
perspective to think about

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
every link is important.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
But although every link is important,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I personally feel that

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
there is still very little

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
discussion on local Ph.D. training.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
For me,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
a local Ph.D. training

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
needs to have many important aspects.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
The first is economic support.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
We just talked about

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
a lot of Ph.D. students

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
have to get a two- or three-year Ph.D.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
and have to work outside

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
to complete their research.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
This is the first economic support.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Next,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
is there a good training plan?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Whether it is in China,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
there can be better

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
forward-looking academic research

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
or production planning

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
or to become a more practical Ph.D.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
This is the second piece

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
that I think is very important.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
The third piece is entry.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Whether it is to become

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
a forward-looking academic or a practical Ph.D.,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
what is the government's

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
thinking in Taiwan?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I think this is an interesting part

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
that can be discussed.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
From the government's point of view,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
we have to deal with these things.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
But which role in the government

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
is the most qualified

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
and should play

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
such a role?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
In fact, what we see now is

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
that the national integration is very bad.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
How do I put it?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
For example, the Ministry of Education.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Of course, everyone will think that

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
all the questions we just talked about

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
are the Ministry of Education.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It has a huge responsibility.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
But for the Ministry of Technology,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
it also has a very important

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
responsibility to train

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
these senior talents

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
as a research talent.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Is the Ministry of Economy important?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
If we are going to talk about

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
the important support for industry transformation,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
is it important for the

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
connection between enterprises?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
It is very important.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Next is the Ministry of Labor.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
For these young graduates,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
do they have a better way

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
to help them?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
So we can actually know that

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
the issue of talent training

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
actually has a certain responsibility

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
in different departments.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Of course, the most important thing

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
is the Ministry of Education

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
When we do a lot of interviews,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
we will find that the Ministry of Education

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
will do the Ministry of Education.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
The Ministry of Technology will do the Ministry of Technology.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
The connection between the ministries

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
is actually lacking.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Let me give you an example.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Last year, the Ministry of Technology

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
did an excellent doctoral student scholarship program.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Simply put,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
it hopes to recruit many excellent talents

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
to Taiwan.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
These students in Taiwan

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
are willing to study for a doctorate.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
The Ministry of Technology

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
will give them about $500,000.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Of course, the Ministry of Technology

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
will cooperate with the universities.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But the Ministry of Technology

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
will provide the greatest assistance

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
in economic support.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
This plan has been discussed for a long time.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
The Ministry of Technology

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
has been looking for the Ministry of Education

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
to cooperate.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
But in the end, the Ministry of Education

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
did not want to join.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
The Ministry of Technology

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
is more likely to join

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
than the Ministry of Education.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
The Ministry of Education

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
is more likely to join

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
than the Ministry of Technology.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
The Ministry of Education

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
did not want to join.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
This is a problem

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
that cannot be solved.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Sometimes, it cannot be solved

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
and it cannot cooperate.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Why?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
In the Ministry of Education

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
or Ministry of Technology,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
the Ministry of Education

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
is a single unit

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
in the constitutional system.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
It has a budget

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
and it has to implement these plans every year.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
The Ministry of Education

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
and the Ministry of Technology

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
are equal and respect each other.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Nobody can lead the other.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
This is an interesting discussion.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
In other countries,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
the Ministry of Education

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
and the Ministry of Technology

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
are tied together.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
When we do not have

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
a comprehensive strategy

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
for the country,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
the Ministry of Education

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
seems to have only completed half of the plan.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
The Ministry of Technology

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
seems to have only completed the other half.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
But can these two ministries cooperate?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
This is a big question mark.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
We will try to push them.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
But after all,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Technology

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
have a strong fundamentalism.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
So many plans

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
will not meet.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
So I think

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
from the biggest point of view,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I think the local

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
or international

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
or overseas talents

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
come back to Taiwan.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
This is what our government

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
needs to complete

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
through some legal procedures.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
But gradually,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
in fact,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
there are some problems

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
in the division of labor.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
The Ministry of Education

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
does not do this.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
This is because it is called the Ministry of Labor

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
in the system.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
The Ministry of Labor has its own restrictions.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
So there is a lot of support

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
that has been talking about

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
whether the Ministry of Education

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and the Ministry of Technology

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
can be combined.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Or is there a higher unit,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
such as the National Development Committee?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
This kind of high-level ministry

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
can do the integration of the ministries.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
The plan of the ministries

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
really has its similarities.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Where is the integration?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
How to do it?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I think this is a very interesting part.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
So from the point of view

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
of government supervision,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
this is probably the part I mentioned today.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Thank you.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I think this is very interesting.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
That is to say,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
let's find another person

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
to talk to you.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Let's ask Ralph to talk about it.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
He used to be the president

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
of the Taiwan University Graduate Association.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Then he was a youth consultant

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
at the Executive Yuan.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Of course, now he is also a PhD student

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
doing TA and receiving scholarships.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Ralph, what do you think?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
What is your opinion?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Let me post my Facebook first.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
You can talk to me later.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Because I often

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
write articles or have some new plans.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
If I have a chance,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I would like to find everyone to do it together.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Let me briefly talk about

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
the whole process and the path of participation.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
There may be more issues

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
to be discussed later.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I think this experience is very important.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Because I have always been

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
participating from a student's point of view.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Then I saw the first line of the problem

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
and thought about how to change it.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I started to participate

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
in 2016.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
At that time, I was recommended

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
to join the Executive Yuan Youth Consultation Committee.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Why is there this organization?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
It is because

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
in 2014,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
after the Taiyanghua School,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
the government slowly realized

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
that the voice of the youth is very important.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
In addition to social movements,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
the government

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
established a youth consultation committee

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
and held a public election.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Later, after Tsai Ing-wen came to power,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
she slightly changed her approach.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Because they felt that

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
many of the youth consultants

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
wanted to directly participate in politics and elections.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
They felt that this approach

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
was not OK.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
In practice, they became conservative.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
They changed their approach

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
to let the officials of the committee recommend them.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Of course, the recommended candidates

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
are conservative,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
but there are also some more advanced candidates.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
So in practice,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
it is more like

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
the committee has some policies that have been implemented.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Then you can make some amendments on it.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
In fact, it is not possible

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
for example, at that time,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
you can take any action.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
At that time,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I was in office for two years.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
It happened to be the time when

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
my research institute was in its first year.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I proposed two proposals.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
It happened to be in the office of Lin Quan and Lai Ching-teh.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
One of the proposals

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
was aimed at

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
some of the problems

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
in TA.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
After the proposal,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
the problem was not solved.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
The second proposal

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
happened to be the opportunity

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
for UCLA scholars

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
to visit us.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I think the cooperation experience

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
of international research and academic exchange

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
is very important for an academic talent.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So I asked

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
if we should encourage more scholars

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
in our research institute.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Maybe it's not just a collaboration

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
with the teacher.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
It is to let students have more research experience

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
and expand their international vision.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
There are also some opportunities for international development.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Although the proposal was approved,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
the result was not ideal.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The reason is that

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
about 80% to 90% of the content

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
was written

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
by the Ministry of Science and Technology

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
and the Ministry of Education.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
They wrote an article

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and replied to me.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
The result of not communicating

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
is more like

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
you not only need to know

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
what they have done

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
in advance,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
but also need to point out

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
which part of what they have done

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
is problematic

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and they are willing to accept

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
what you have said.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
It's not just that you may see

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
a problem from the outside

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
and think how to solve it

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
would be better.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Next, I will talk about the second part.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
In that period of time,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I have a conclusion,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
observation or summary.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
If a problem can be improved,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
there may be three motivations

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
or three reasons.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
The first one is the government official.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
The government official is the minister,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
so he may not be able to achieve

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
what he wants to do.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
But the will and choice of the government official

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
are very important.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
The second one is the civil society.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
The civil society is not only

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
publicizing information

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
or giving actual consultations.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
For example,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Xiao Yu and Zha Shi

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
are the representatives of the civil society.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
The pressure of the civil society

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
should be combined

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
through private meetings

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
or public speeches

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
to make people pay more attention.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
This is also a very important way.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
After that,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I had no choice

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
but to choose

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
the president of the Taiwan University Research Association.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
In the position of president,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I have done

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
two things

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
for the Taiwan University Research Association.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
First,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I had a meeting with the president

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
of the Taiwan University Research Association

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
and the director of the Ministry of Education

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
to discuss the improvement

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
of the student's treatment.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
In fact,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
the meeting was not very pleasant.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
At that time,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
we raised some issues

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
that we observed.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
At that time,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
we were not mature enough

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
to point out what he did wrong

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and figure out how to solve the problem

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
and convince him.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
We were not mature enough.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
However,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
some senior officials asked us

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
that if doctors

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
are unemployed

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
and unable to work,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
we can easily invest more resources

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
instead of causing more unemployment.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Secondly,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
how to convince the society

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
to invest more social resources

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
is really valuable.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Therefore,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
the meeting was not pleasant.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
At that time,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I observed

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
how to promote

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
the change of policy

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
to reduce the pressure of public opinion.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
In the field of doctors,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
there was a gap.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
In the past,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
there were many issues

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
about the student's point of view

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
at the Taiwan University Research Association

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
However,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
the student's point of view

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
was always a problem.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
For example,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
the Taiwan University Research Association

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
had been promoting

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
the social movement

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
for 6 or 7 years

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
mainly for the employees

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
who had been working hard.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
They made a lot of efforts

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
but I think

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
what they did

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
was meaningful.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
First of all,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
it was hard to continue

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
their movement.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Secondly,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
the fundamental problem

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
was that the TA's salary

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
had not increased

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
from the 1930s to the present.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
So,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
it was a basic salary

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
of a supermarket.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
This was a big problem.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
It was the investment of social resources

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
rather than the calculation

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Finally,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
one of my goals

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
when I stay in Taiwan

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
is to improve the environment.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
In the long run,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I hope that

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
the TA's education level

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
can be similar

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
to the higher education system

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
in the world.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
No matter what,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
it is important

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
to fulfill the TA's point of view.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
According to our professors,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
we need good researchers

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
and local academic development.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Whether it is academic development

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
or the development of industry,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
we need these talents.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
So,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
it is important to

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
achieve a balance.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I am thinking about

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
organizing a national

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
TA's organization.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I hope that

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
we can continue to

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
organize it.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I will share more ideas with you later.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Thank you.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
After hearing

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
the three

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
TA's statements,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
we can hear

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
a clear

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
point of view.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Everyone mentioned

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
what is the role of a doctor?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
What is the value of

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
cultivating these high-level talents?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
If we understand it,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
can we discuss

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
how to do it?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Then, the TA's

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
mentioned the resources.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
After having the resources,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
how can we

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
implement the policy?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Can we start from the beginning?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I will ask the three

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
TA's questions.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
What do you think

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
the role of cultivating

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
these high-level talents

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
should be?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
What is our

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
imagination?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Does anyone want to volunteer?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Sorry,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
you can also

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
ask questions in the chat.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Let's go back

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
to the question.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I saw that

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Xiao-Yu typed something.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Xiao-Yu, why don't you go first?

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Not everyone can read the chat.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
For example,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
what do you think

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
the role of cultivating

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
these high-level talents

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
should be?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
This is a difficult question.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I will go first.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Please.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Actually,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
this question is also

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
to thank Zha Shi

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
after I graduated.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
At that time,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I met him and he was

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
a professor.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I always felt that

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Taiwan did not have a

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
continuous discussion

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
of high-level policy

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
and the power of continuous development.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Whether it was a group of French

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
or a political group

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
or various units.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
At that time,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I met the biggest difficulty.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
For example,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I was a doctor at

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
the University of Taiwan.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
The power of continuous development

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
and innovation and transformation.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
But this is not the case

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
in other fields.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Because the industrial development

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
is not the same

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
or there is no industry at all.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
After I graduated from the master's class,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I did one thing.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I classified the three academic subjects

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
of the Department of Humanities and Social Science

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
in the Ministry of Education.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Then I found

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
the professors in these three fields.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
According to their status,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
they regularly

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
come to the Legislative Yuan

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
to discuss the direction

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
of policy development.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
So this is really a more

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
top-level issue.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
But I think

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
the other aspect of my talk

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
is that for this issue,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
it is easy to limit

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
one's own learning experience

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
and one's own professional field.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
So it becomes

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
more ideal

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
to have a more

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
top-level policy

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
of coordination and integration.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
So I didn't directly answer this question,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
but I just gave feedback on the other aspect.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Do you have any comments?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
The other two.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Let me mention

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
because the Legislative Yuan

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
is held twice a year

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
in Taiwan.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Once is from February to May.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Once is from September to

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
the end of December.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
This meeting is also called

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
the Budget Meeting of Taiwan.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
We will start to review

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
the entire budget

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
proposed by the ministries

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
as a role of the Legislative Yuan.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
So we normally have

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
a lot of discussions

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
with the Ministry of Education

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
about the budget report.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
In this budget report,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
all the ministers sit at the bottom.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
In fact, I also asked directly.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
This may be a very difficult question

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
and there is no standard answer.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
What kind of talents

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
do we need to cultivate?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Is it a food type

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
or is it a front-line teacher?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
What do we need to cultivate?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
OK, then the head of the faculty

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
will talk first.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
He said that as a main unit

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
of the faculty education,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
we certainly hope that our faculty university

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
is a type of application

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
study.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Of course, if you want to study

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
a doctor,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
we hope that they focus on

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
food type research.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
OK, then the head of the faculty

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
will talk next.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
We also know that

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
this is also a different faction.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Some people think that

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
it is a research faction and

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
some people think that

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
it is a food faction.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
There are a lot of people

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
talking about this.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I myself am a lecturer

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
at the Institute of Electrical Engineering

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
with a background in technology.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
So I also know that

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
today we are going to talk about

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
going to the workplace

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
and helping food companies.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
This matter actually makes a lot of sense.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
However, it is also because of the

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
many meetings we held together

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
at the University of瑞福,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
we began to understand that

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
the doctoral students in the

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
humanities group and the social group

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
are completely different,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
even none.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
In this situation,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
it is difficult for me to say

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
that I have always used the point of view

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
of technology.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
In fact, it should be said

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
that from the point of view of the

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
government, I think that

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
it should be more responsible

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
to break down the humanities,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
social science and technology,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
even if the three groups are divided.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
In fact, the different departments

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
are in technology.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
For example, ecology,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
one is a doctor of ecology,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
and ecology and biology are completely different.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
In fact, although it is just

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
such a standard under a big theme,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
in fact, there are many

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
differences in each group.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
So in fact, my own feeling is

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
that the government must have

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
sufficient height and policy resources.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
It can go to the face.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The most ideal, of course,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
is the science department in each field.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
How much is the academic demand

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
at the academic end?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Will there be an industrial demand?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
If these are all there,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
it should be put back to the front end of education.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
How do we do

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
a policy of recruiting students?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And of course, the other

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
part of the ideal is that for each student,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I believe that there must be students

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
who want to enter the enterprise to do industrial transformation,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
do more experience in food.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
There will also be these academic

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
research goals.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
In fact, I think from the perspective of students,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
how can they choose more freely?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Knowing that this choice

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
will have a job opportunity in the future,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
but will there be a job opportunity?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I think the government

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
should take a

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
big responsibility to play.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
But now we see that

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
it's more passive.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
What do you use?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I'll cut your number

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
by less than the ratio of your recruitment.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Or say that our country has a key industry.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It seems that we want to develop these key industries,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
so we come to add these positions.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
But I think the most fundamental problem

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
is that it still takes a lot of time.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
In this part, the government

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
should make more efforts.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
The above is probably the case.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
What do you think, Xiaoyu?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I think this is

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
a big problem.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
In fact, this goes back to the policy.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
In other words, is the high-level education

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
of our country a planned economy,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
that is, government control,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
or a free market?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
If it is the United States,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
to be honest, the doctoral program

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
is a free market.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
In other words,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
only graduate schools

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
can offer doctoral programs.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
What kind of field or science

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
does the doctoral program provide?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
In fact, it is mainly

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
dominated by various schools.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
As for the job,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
in my country,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
we are actually under the control

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
of the Ministry of Education.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
In this case,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
what should we do?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
How much should we do?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
This matter is worth considering.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
In other words,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
of course, if you are a doctor,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
you mainly want to

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
follow the academic path,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
or want to develop the industry.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
It is true that there are

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
social and scientific fields

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
that are not related

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
to the industry.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
But in fact,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
we have a lot of things to do.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
So,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
is the doctoral program

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
completely

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
aimed at the profession?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Or is it

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
still a basic ability

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
or a more professional ability

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
to hope to

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
move towards

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
long-term development in the future?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
So,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
this is actually

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
from a policy position.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
So,

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
what should we do?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
To what extent should we do?

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Of course,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I also admit that

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
the relevant government,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
whether it is the Ministry of Education,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
the Ministry of Science and Technology,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
or other units,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
to be honest,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
we are not fully equipped.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I actually heard you all say

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
that first of all,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
there should be a policy

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
that is above the current level

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
of cross-departmental structure.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Or we should have a comprehensive strategy.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Let's put it this way.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
And then to promote this strategy,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
there is a very important one.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
What kind of product

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
do we want to produce

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
to convince our government

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
to carry out what kind of policy

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
and then what kind of resources

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
do we need?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Do you have any practical ideas?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Of course, this is my ideal picture.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
We can do this.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
But do you have any experience?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Or do you have any

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
actual proposals?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Or any countries

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
have done this?

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Or have you ever thought about it?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Or the government has actually done it,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
but people have no feeling about it.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Or in fact,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
do you have anything to share?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
You are all very polite.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Otherwise,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
let's start from the previous order again.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Otherwise, let's go back to RAVE.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
So your question is

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
what are the more clear

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
policies that have been proposed

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
or what is the situation?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Yes.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Then I will use

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
the experience of

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
our recent meeting with

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
the senior teacher to explain to you.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Because what we did this year

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
was to go to the Legislative Yuan every month

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
to have a meeting.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Then the professors of Humanities, Social Sciences and Technology

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
made their own reports.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
After everyone discussed,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
the final conclusion was to

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
integrate the opinions of the overall report.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
In the report at that time,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
the general direction was

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
that the whole meeting

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
lasted about one hour,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
almost two hours.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
The meeting schedule can also be

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
divided into several parts.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
In fact,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
we have just discussed

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
several parts.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
For example,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I mentioned that

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
last year,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
the Ministry of Science and Technology

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
held a seminar on the

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
talent improvement of doctors.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
At that time,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
there was a professor at

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
the University of Jianqiao

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
who was in charge of the

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
training of researchers

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
from policy execution

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
to human resources.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
At that time,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
I also mentioned that

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
perhaps the Ministry of Education

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
should provide more resources

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
to establish a role

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
like a research center

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
if there is no difficulty

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
in the implementation

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
of this plan.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
He was thinking about

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
the continuity of these policies

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
not only in the field of

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
post-doctoral studies,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
but also in the development

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
of the entire career of a doctor.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
On the other hand,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
doctors should have

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
a basic knowledge system.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
For example,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
how did we explain to him

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
that we have transferred

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
the current data

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
to the professors of

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
major universities in Taiwan

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
every year,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
and there are about

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
1,200 people

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
who are professionals

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
in the field of

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
post-doctoral studies,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
so you can think

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
about the size of the market.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
There are about 2,000

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
new job opportunities.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Since these 2,000 people

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
are important people

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
in the Ministry of Education,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
let's say the employees

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
of the Ministry of Education,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
so the Ministry of Education

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
should have a basic

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
education guarantee

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
for these so-called

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
educational staff,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
or you should have

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
a basic environment.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
If you evaluate

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
this number,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
there should be

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
4,000 or 5,000

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
new doctoral students

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
every year,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
so you can

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
say that if

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
at least 1,000 people

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
become professors every year,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
2,000 people are

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
highly educated people,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
what kind of

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
basic resources

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
should these people

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
be given?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
For example,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
there was a proposal

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
that the former

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Minister of

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Administration and

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
the Ministry of Education

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
should have a basic

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
education guarantee.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
If there are

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
industrial development resources,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
it can be added

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
to make it higher.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
So when we see

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
this proposal,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
even the Ministry of Education

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
has already

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
prepared to

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
approve it.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
We think it is

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
a good idea.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
However,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
the proposal was

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
stopped after

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Yalda left,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
and it was not

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
carried out.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Later,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
we had a meeting

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
with the Ministry of Education,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
and they said

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
they were afraid that

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
if more resources were

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
invested,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
the proposal would be

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
rejected.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Of course,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
we have some

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
opinions,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and there are many

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
other opinions.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
If you are more careful,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
you can refer to

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
the document.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
In my opinion,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
the bigger structure

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
is like this.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I also found

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
that when the president

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
wants to do something,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
the Ministry of Education

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
will send out the proposal

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
and write a version.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
For example,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
there is a 5 plus 2

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
key industry policy

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
in our country's

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
industrial talent policy,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
and it is to investigate

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
which talents are missing

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
in the key industry.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
We found that

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
the Ministry of Education

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
did not even investigate

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
how many PhDs are

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
in the industry development

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
or transformation,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
let alone the policy

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and implementation.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
We think it is ridiculous.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
After our meeting with

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
the Ministry of Education,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
they said that

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
it is just a form,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
and they did not

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
investigate this.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
As mentioned earlier,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
the integration of all ministries

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
is really difficult.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
It requires specific

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
inspections and changes.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Otherwise,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
there may be other channels.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Do you have anything

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
to add?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Or do you want to comment?

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Let me talk about it.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I am Zashi.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I mentioned a lot of

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
specific policies

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
that we mentioned to the mayor.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
From my point of view,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
in recent years,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
everyone knows that

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Taiwan's government,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
whether it is the Ministry of Technology

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
or the Ministry of Education,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
has mentioned some

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
international talent planning

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
projects,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
such as Yushan Scholar,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Qianlima,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
and so on.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
However,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
in recent years,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
the Ministry of Education

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
has proposed

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
these projects

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
to the schools

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
every year,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
and the money

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
will be allocated

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
to each school.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
However,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
we started to

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
focus on international talent

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
because we need

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
a good professor

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
and a good teacher.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
If these teachers

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
don't have good students,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
will the teacher

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
really have a strong

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
research motivation?

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
This is what we see.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
These talent planning projects

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
have already started,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
but how do you return

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
these important talents

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
to Taiwan?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
During the meeting with the

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Minister of Education,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
we specifically mentioned

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
that in recent years,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
these talent planning projects

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
are aimed at

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
increasing the salary of professors

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
and teachers,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
but is it possible

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
to create another project

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
that is more friendly

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
to students?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Our view is simple.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
If you have good teachers

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
and good students,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
it's meaningless

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
if you don't have good professors.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
The Ministry of Education

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
is concerned about

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
whether these projects

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
will attract

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
a large number of

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
professors in the future.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
However,

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
these projects

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
are aimed at

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
excellent professors.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
We fully agree with this.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
In my opinion,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
some things

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
need to be adjusted

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
from a small place.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
For example,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
we have been talking about

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
the Doctor's Scholarship Program,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
the Ministry of Science and Technology's

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Doctor's Scholarship Program.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I talked directly with the

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Director of the Ministry of Science

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
and Technology.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I told him

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
my thoughts on

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
this project.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
When we interview,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
we usually

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
talk about the exact salary,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
such as how much

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
the annual salary is.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
At least the annual salary is like this.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
If the company operates better,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I will add a few more months.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
This is a means that a company

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
will definitely use

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
when it is lazy.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
But in Taiwan,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
for example,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
you may have a chance

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
to apply for this scholarship

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
when you come to Taiwan.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
You may apply for it

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
and you will get

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
NT$40,000 scholarship

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
every month for four years.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I started to talk to them.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Can't we give

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
the school or push the school

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
to have a more corporate thinking model?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Today,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Ralph is an excellent doctor.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
When he came in,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I already told him

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
that we think

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
he is an excellent doctor.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
We hope that

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
you will have a lot of economic support

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
in this stage of your research.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
One of them is this project.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
If you choose to study at NTU,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I will give you this project.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Because we think your conditions are in line.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Even for those students

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
who hesitate whether to study at NTU

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
or NTU,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
can't these schools

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
be more active in

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
applying for scholarships?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Do we have to tell them

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
that you may have a chance when you come in?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
In fact, the Ministry of Science and Technology

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
heard this idea

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
and they also want to move in this direction.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Although it seems that

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
it is difficult to say at the university level.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
In fact, every university

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
may be allocated

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
some positions in each department,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
but they may not dare

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
to be so brave

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
to apply for scholarships.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
In fact, I think

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
this is a very important direction

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
to discuss.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
So, in my own experience,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
it will be like this.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
That's all.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
OK.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I am Xiaoyu.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
What Justin just mentioned

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
is that

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
if NTU teachers

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
are very active

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
in applying for scholarships,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
NTU teachers

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
can find the best students.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
But I also know that

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
this is not

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
what NTU professors

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
should do

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
through their personal strength.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
There should be

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
a more comprehensive

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
at least at the school level.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
For example, NTU itself

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
should have more specific plans

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
to assist teachers.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Instead of giving money to the school

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
and saying,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
OK, you can do it yourself.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
You have to provide

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
all kinds of assistance to do it yourself.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
My point of view

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
on doctoral education

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
is that

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
from our educational point of view,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
our scholarship

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
is not a bonus, but a benefit.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
In fact, in doctoral education,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
to be honest,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
from the point of view of

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
the government,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
we actually only look at one thing,

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
that is, we only give it to excellent people.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
But in fact, doctoral education

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
is not only like this,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
there is also a free market.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
If someone is willing to come to

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
the doctoral class and graduate,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
we will also open it to you.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
But the related packages

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
may not provide

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
you to pay for yourself,

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
you may have to work harder

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
or cooperate with the professor, etc.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
In addition,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
this is my general idea.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Let's open it to the audience

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
to see if there are

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
any other questions.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Thank you.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I have a question.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Are there any three people

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
or sorry,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
two people besides Xiaoyu

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
who want to add to what Xiaoyu just said

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
or what else do you think?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
At the moment,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
everyone is very enthusiastic,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
so we have a lot of questions.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Or do you want to

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
discuss the audience's questions?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Of course.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Sorry,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
because there are a lot of questions,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
we probably can't see all of them,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and there are really a lot of words,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
so I may miss it,

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
so I apologize to everyone first.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Let's start from the beginning,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
because maybe some people

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
want to add to what Xiaoyu just said.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Xun Yu asked,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
sorry, let me go back a little bit.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
The sustainability of policies

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
is terrible.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Recently, I heard a rumor that

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
the Columbus Peace Project

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
is about to die.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
No, I mean it's about to end.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I don't know if the government

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
is specifically referring to

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
the Love Song Project,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
but the sustainability.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I don't know what you think.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Besides how to look at it,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
what should we do?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
OK.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Are we answering directly?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Yes, yes.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
OK, let me talk about it.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I've been studying this topic recently.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
In fact, this goes back to

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
the question I asked at the beginning.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
In fact, let me talk about

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
the so-called Columbus or Einstein Project,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
which are all called

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
the Young Learners Development Project

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
That is, the preliminary basic construction budget

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
may be a four-year

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
continuous plan like this.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Because we are now

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
moving towards the third phase,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
every four years,

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
we are now slowly moving

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
towards the third phase and starting to implement it.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
In fact, to answer a comprehensive

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
question,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
the current situation is

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
that the budget should be reduced a little.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
If I remember correctly,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
is it 2.3 billion?

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I need to look it up again,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
because I have such preliminary information in my hand.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
The preliminary report of the last issue

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
is about the budget of the Young Learners Development Project

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
and the preliminary plan

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
that is going to be reviewed

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
in this issue.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It seems that the budget is a little less,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
but it is not terminated.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Back to the question I'm concerned about,

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
why is this thing

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
very interesting?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Because every year when I review the budget,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
we, as a supervision unit,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
will write a summary of the budget

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
or freeze it,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
or the main resolution.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
These are all the parts that need to be

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
formally replied to you,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
and they are usually very worried about

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
the budget of the legislators.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
So usually

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
they will be very concerned about

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
all the things we write.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I write one thing every year.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I said that the Ministry of Education has a budget plan,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
the Ministry of Science and Technology has a

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Young Learners Development Project,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
and the Chinese Academy of Sciences,

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
a research unit,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
they also have their own budget plans.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And sometimes

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
in the budget of those international talents,

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
the target that everyone is looking for

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
is not too far away.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
So let's go back to the beginning.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Is there any way

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
to have a better integration?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
In fact, the Ministry of Science and Technology said

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
that I was looking for

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
research experts.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
The Ministry of Education said

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
that the researchers

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
actually operate

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
like this.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
That is really a very vague situation.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
So in fact, I think

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
the plan is not to be broken,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
but we will pay more attention to

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
the different parts of the plan.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
In fact, 1 plus 1 must be greater than 2.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
And in fact, the attitude of the Ministry of Science and Technology

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
every year is that their budget is really not much.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
We support all their plans.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Because I am

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
in charge of the Ministry of Science and Technology

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
and I am in charge of the

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
consultation policy or bill

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
or budget supervision.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
So I can really

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
say that I fully support

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
many of the plans of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
The Ministry of Education really does less.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
But in some of the plans,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I actually think they must cooperate.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
So every year we will continue to

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
push this department.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
That's about it.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
OK.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I am Xiaoyu.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
My question is whether the

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
will continue.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
As far as I know,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
just like what

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Dr. Zha mentioned,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
the plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
and Einstein is really

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
a special budget.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
So in other words, it is the

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
budget of the front-end plan.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
In fact, he said that

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
there is a reduction of

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
more than 2.3 billion.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
So I think that

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
after the new 520 minister

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
took office,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
in fact, the plan of

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
the Ministry of Science and Technology

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
or the talent cultivation plan itself,

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
in fact, they will already have a

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
relatively long-term

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
view of this matter.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
In other words,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
we are not pushing a short-term

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
plan like the five-year plan,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
but in the future,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I believe it will be announced soon

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
that this matter needs to be

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
promoted for a long time.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
In other words, our country

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
will have different plans for

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
the cultivation of young scholars,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
whether they are young scholars,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
middle-aged scholars,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
or senior scholars.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
OK.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Ralph, do you want to add something?

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Or are we looking for another question?

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
It doesn't matter.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I just saw an interesting question.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I think we should

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
give this question to Ralph.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
This may be the most

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
in line with your experience.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Sorry.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
He said,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
what is the relationship

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
between the Association of Researchers

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
and the school?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Can you explain the financial

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
situation of the school

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
and the allocation of funds?

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Then,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Jeff,

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
the Association of Researchers

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
in the U.S. can check the

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
financial situation of the school

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
and ask them to provide

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
specific welfare conditions

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
for the students,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
labor conditions,

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
and living conditions.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
What is the situation

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
in Taiwan now?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I just answered

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
the question.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
The Association of Researchers

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
mainly plans the use of

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
the annual budget

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
in the Association of

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Researchers.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Unless there are special cases

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
that need to be approved

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
by the school council,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
most of the discussions and

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
decisions will be made there.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
At present,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
there is no student representative

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
in the Association of Researchers.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
In addition to the Association of

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Researchers,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
there is another important

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
participation channel called

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
administrative meetings.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Administrative meetings

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
are held by the principal,

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
dean,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
and director

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
to discuss

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
how to plan

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
the administration

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
of the school.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
At that time,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
there will be at least

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
one student representative

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
in the meeting.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
The current situation is that

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
when the school council

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
feels that this matter

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
is related to the students,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
they will issue a meeting notice

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
saying that you can come to practice.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
By practice,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
it means that you do not

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
have the right to vote,

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
but the school will listen to

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
your opinion.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
However,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
this is usually the last straw.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
When the school feels that

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
this matter is not

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
controversial,

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
they will come to discuss with you.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
However, as you know,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
last year and the year before last,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
there was a lot of discussion

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
about the principal,

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
so some teachers

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
who support the principal

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
or conservative teachers

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
will feel that

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
some student representatives

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
have this tendency,

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
so they failed.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
I am not depressed about the failure.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
So,

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I can listen to

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
everyone's opinion

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
more.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Especially today's discussion

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
is very valuable.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Someone said that

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
it may be related to

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
the financial structure

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
or the position of the school

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
in general.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Ray has mentioned

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
a very interesting thing.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I don't know what the other two

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
think.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
He mentioned that

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
this is related to

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
the role we give them

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
or their own role.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
What do you think

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
about this?

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
For example,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Xiaoyu or Zashi.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Are you talking about the role of the university?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Yes.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
How does the university

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
set its own role?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Will they decide how to do it?

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
You mean

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
if the school

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
thinks it is

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
a research university

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
or a teaching university

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
or other types of universities,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
such as industrial universities

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
or entrepreneurial universities?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Or something else?

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Let me add something.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I think the financial structure

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and the right of students

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
are not necessarily related.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
What is the reason?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
For example,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
private colleges in Taiwan

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
have a tuition fee of

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
50% to 70%.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
But private colleges

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
don't pay much attention to students.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
That's it.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
On the one hand,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
the atmosphere of students' self-participation

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
is not so good.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
On the other hand,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
they don't pay much attention

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
to students.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So it may be a sufficient condition,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
but not a necessary condition.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
If you have time,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I see Jeff

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
wants to ask a question.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I think it's a good time.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
if it's convenient for Jeff,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
please turn on the microphone

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
to talk about REEF.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Thank you.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I'm a third-year student

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
at the University of Indiana

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
in the United States.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I used to work

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
as a teacher

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
for several years.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I think

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
REEF's

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
information about Taiwan is very good.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I think

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
since Taiwan is different

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
from the United States,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
the United States is a market mechanism.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Taiwan is mainly

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
caught by the Ministry of Education.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
In this case,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
from the perspective

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
of the Legislative Yuan,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I think REEF

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
is an important role

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
in the school

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
role management process.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
In terms of supervision,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
can the school

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
implement this mechanism?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
In addition,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
in addition to the REEF,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
REEF will also form a union.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
The union

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
is different from the

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
REEF.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The union actually

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
starts from the perspective

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
of the Legislative Yuan

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
to talk about the lack of

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
wage and salary.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
What the school

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
will do

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
is to mobilize

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
demonstrations

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
and make demands.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
As I mentioned

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
in the chat,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
these demands

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
come from

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
more information.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
For example,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
the salary of the school

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
is transparent.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I can share with you

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
that REEF

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
did some reports

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and mentioned

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
the salary of the

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
football team

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
coach

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
is as high as

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
6 to 7 million Taiwan dollars

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
a year.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
They feel that

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
the school

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
cannot hide

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
this information.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Therefore, the school

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
cannot stand still.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I think the transparency of this information

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
is very important.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Taiwan is not a market mechanism.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
The Ministry of Education

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
should implement

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
this transparent mechanism

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
through the Ministry of Education.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Perhaps this will

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
be helpful

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
to solve the problem.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
That's all. Thank you.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I think this is

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
a process of transformation.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
In the process of transformation,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I think it is very important

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
to ensure the legalization.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Of course,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
in the next session,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
we will focus on

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
the so-called school dismissal.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
However,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
many rights and interests

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
are included in the Ministry of Education

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
in the University Act

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
or the school fund management

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
in the Ministry of Education.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
These things should be reviewed.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Recently,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
many groups of students

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
have come to

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
communicate with us

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
on the University Act.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
In terms of

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
these self-government groups,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
can they have more

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
guaranteed things?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
For example,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
we heard that

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
some schools

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
charge two different

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
channels for their

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
school fees.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
You can't pay online.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
You have to pay by paper.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
This is incredible.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Or some schools

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
because the students

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
group, for example,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
the source of the money

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
is the tuition fee.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Basically,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
the student council

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
can decide

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
what to do

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and how to do it.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Even if the money

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
is the tuition fee,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
the school has to do it.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
In fact, the student rights

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
are moving forward.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
However,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
many schools still

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
have a conservative attitude.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
What should we do?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I agree with what Jeff said.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
The student rights

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
can't be a hostage.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
If you are willing to communicate

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
with a good principal,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
you will have more opportunities.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Sometimes it's hard to be a principal.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
In the school council,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
he didn't just say it.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Many teachers are there.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
He wants to give students

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
more space,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
but sometimes it's hard to do it.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Legislative establishment

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
is necessary.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Through the university law

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
and the school fund,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
it's two different things.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
However,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
the legislative process

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
is still ongoing.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Hello, I'm Xiaoyu.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Is Jeff studying

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
at Indiana Bloomington?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I also graduated

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
from this school.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I majored in higher education.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
As far as I know,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
the tuition fee

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
for public universities

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
is transparent.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It's in the US.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
In my impression,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
the IU Foundation

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
is not open

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
to the public.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I don't know

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
if there are any adjustments.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Some employees

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
are transparent.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
In my impression,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
the professors are not transparent.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
In Taiwan,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
the HR department

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
often discusses

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
whether the tuition fee

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
is suitable for the public.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
In other words,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
will it cause

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
some kind of

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
malicious competition?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I think we should

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
be careful

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
and consider

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
whether the tuition fee

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
is suitable for the public.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
In the future,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
will there be

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
a union

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
or some rights protection?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I think we can

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
work on it.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Through the union,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
the tuition fee

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
can be improved.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I think it's

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
a positive step.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
That's all.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I don't understand

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
one thing.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
It's my personal question.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Why Taiwan

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
or other countries

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
like Japan

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
have such

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
poor

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
marketing

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
system?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
What's the reason?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Why do we

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
become different

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
from the US?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
In the US,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
for the sake of talents

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and PhD students,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
they hire people

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
with their salary.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
But in Taiwan,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
the power of the labor market

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
is the opposite.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
In other words,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
we need to ask

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
the school to pay us tuition.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
If we don't pay

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
the tuition fee,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
no one will

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
pay the tuition fee.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
That's my question.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Why is Taiwan

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
such a poor market?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
What's the reason?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Does anyone

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
want to

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
answer this question?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
It looks like

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Yu wants to answer.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Let me answer

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
briefly.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
When we had a meeting

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
last year,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Yu asked

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
this question.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Why is Taiwan

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
not legalized?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
What's the current situation?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Yu's answer

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
was

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
there are

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
several doubts.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
First,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
all the departments that don't make money

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
may be shut down.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Because universities

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
are the only indicators.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Second,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
the whole society

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
is divided.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
What is our

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
view of education?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I may need to look up

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
the meeting notes.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
There may be other answers.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
However,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
people generally

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
look at it

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
as a negative effect

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
on the society.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
What's the difference

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
between legalization

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and marketization?

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
That's all.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I'm Yu.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I have a question

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
about whether

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
higher education

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
is a capital market.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Is it necessarily good?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
It involves many things,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
such as regulation

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
and so on.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
In my opinion,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
universities should not

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
rely on the Ministry of Education.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Almost all universities

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
rely on the Ministry of Education.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
However,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
the Ministry of Education

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
spends

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
less than half

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
of their budget.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
As for

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
legalization,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
such as Japan

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
or other countries,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
it may lead to

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
the collapse of

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
non-profit science.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
To be honest,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
non-profit science

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
is still

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
maintained in the United States.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
For example,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
it is still maintained

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
in the top universities

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
in the field of

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
human and social science.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
In my country,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
the National University

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
is a national university.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It is responsible

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
for maintaining

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
non-profit science

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
in the field of

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
human and social science.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I think

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
there should be

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
more communication

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
between universities.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It is not just

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
trying to

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
promote non-profit science.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
We should listen to

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
everyone's opinions.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
That's all.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
What about Zha Shi?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Do you have any opinion?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
It's okay.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Ralph has already said that.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Okay.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
It has been more than

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
an hour.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
It will be an hour and a half

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
in 10 minutes.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
That's what we didn't mention.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
If you are curious or

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
want to know more,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
you can ask our speaker.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Or did I miss something?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Okay.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Sorry.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Go ahead.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I just want to share

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
our high-profile

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
video and meeting

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
with you.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Okay.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Sorry.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I have a question.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Do you know

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
how many high-profile researchers

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
are needed in Taiwan?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Are there too many

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
high-profile researchers?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Can we

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
focus on some of them?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
It's a classic question.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Can we ask

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
this way?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
How many high-profile researchers

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
are needed?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
How many schools?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
How many teachers?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
How many students?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
It's a classic question.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
How many schools?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
How many teachers?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
How many students?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Do you have any opinion?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Do I have to say?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It's the biggest

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
problem we have.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Obviously,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
there must be a big employment problem.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Let me give you an example.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
When we had a meeting,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
there was a simple calculation.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
There are so many

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
high-profile researchers you can hire

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
in a year.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
There is no shortage of

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
people in the industry.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Every year,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
there are at least

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
10 jobs

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
in the industry.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
There is a big gap.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
So, we asked the Ministry of Education

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
about the plan

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
of the whole

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
graduate school

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
or the whole

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
human resources evaluation.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
To be honest,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
the result we asked

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
was that

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
they didn't do well

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
in the special graduate school.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
For example,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I said that

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
the Ministry of Education

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
did not investigate

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
the high-profile talents

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
for the development of 5 plus 2.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
So,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
if you want to say

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
if it's too deep now,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
it must be too deep.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
But what is a reasonable number?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Especially now,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
it's a decimal trend.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
When the industry transforms,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
is there any organization

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
or a policy-making unit

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
that can provide

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
the answer?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
In my experience,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I don't think

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
there is one.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Hello,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I'm Xiaoyu.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I think

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
to find the problem

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
or to find

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
the future trend,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I think

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
we can do it.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
But what I'm confused about

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
is that we can't find the solution.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
That's what I'm confused about.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Of course,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I think the industry needs

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
our supply and demand

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
must be

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
accurate.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
That's what I'm confused about.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
But now,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
whether it's a PhD

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
or a future talent

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
evaluation,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I think

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
it's very difficult.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The industry

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
may not know

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
the relevant information.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
But they may not know

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
the future development

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
of their company

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
or how many people

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
they need

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
in the next few years.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Even if you ask TSMC,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
they may not know.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
That's what I'm confused about.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
How many students

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
do we need?

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I agree that

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
with the number of students

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
and enrollment,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
let's say

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
4,000 to 5,000 people a year,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
the demand in the academic world

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
may be around 1,000 a year.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
There is a big gap

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
between supply and demand.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
But the problem is

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
that I think

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
PhD education

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
is half of

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
what we need

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
to find

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
excellent academic talents.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I think half of it

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
is the market mechanism.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Half of it is the economic planning,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
half of it is the market mechanism.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
In other words,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
if a lot of people

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
are willing to take a PhD,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
it's OK for us.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
But you may be burdened

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
and take it as

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
a part of the economic planning.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
For us,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
it's more important

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
how to attract excellent people

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
to take a PhD.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
This is what we may

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
focus on in the future,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
whether it's research or industry.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
As for the school,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
as I mentioned at the end,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
how many universities

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
or teachers

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
or students

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
or staff

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
are there?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Some of you may know

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
that if you calculate it,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
you will know that

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
in the next 10 to 15 years,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I guess

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
there are only

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
national universities

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
and medical universities

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
with competitive

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
medical departments

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
in the future.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
To be honest,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
other schools will not be able to

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
take a PhD or transfer.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
This is my personal opinion.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I guess

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
that

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
in the future,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
the number of teachers

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
may be

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
around 40,000

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
or 50,000.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
At that time,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
there may be

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
only about 20,000 teachers

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
in the country.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
This is our current estimate.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
If you are interested,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
you can keep calculating

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and see if it's what we think.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Our idea is

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
to increase the number

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
of students

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
in national universities.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
This so-called increase

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
is a situation

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
where the total number

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
is under control

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
and the number

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
of students

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
is constantly increasing.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
The question is

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
about schools, students and teachers.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
In fact,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
we say that this meeting

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
must be held

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:47.000


01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
school withdrawal regulations.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Otherwise,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
from the perspective

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
of the Ministry of Education,

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
the Ministry of Education

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
has a budget

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
of more than 26 million yuan every year.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
37% of the budget

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
is spent on higher education,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
which is about 100 billion yuan.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
The current direction

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
of the Ministry of Education

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
is to cut

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
some of the basic expenses

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
and apply for

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
a higher education upgrade plan

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
for the school.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Of course,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
although private universities

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
are not public,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
they still have some subsidies.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
So all schools

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
say that the scholarship is not enough

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
to apply for a higher education upgrade plan.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
In fact, this is just

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
a basic default.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I can't make some breakthrough plans.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
These things are actually

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
so many from the entire Ministry of Education.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But maybe we are going the wrong way in Taiwan.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
That is, from Guangzhou University

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
to today,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
we have to close

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
these universities one by one.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
In fact, we all know

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
how difficult this is in practice.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Why didn't the school withdrawal regulations

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
in Taiwan

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
take too much power?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
If you want to close my private school,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
how many people

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
will be affected?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
How much is the interest structure?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
So everyone stepped on it and didn't do it.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
This is a very real

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
situation.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Now we are focusing on the industry

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
and pushing it to each school.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Now it's all like Xiaoyu said,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
extra fees.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
In fact, this is also a statistic.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Now the total enrollment

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
of universities in Taiwan

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
may be 250,000

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
or 260,000.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
But the number of students we actually recruit

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
seems to be only 160,000.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
What about the key industry now?

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
It's extra fees.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
You will think,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
how can there be such a gap in numbers?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
But now as long as it's a key industry,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
telecommunications, 5 plus 2,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
the national defense industry,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I'll give you an extra fee for your school.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
This is a strategy.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But why do this?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
In the end, it's still a cruel thing.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
You're going to cut the enrollment

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
of schools today.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
What you touch is the teacher's

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
current teaching.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
We can all understand

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
what the actual problem may be.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
So when I think about

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
this question,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
maybe I'm a minister.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I often

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
communicate with many people

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
about their own

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
fundamentalism.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And many times it's really

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
a huge thing.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It's really not that easy.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Maybe you have to start from a young age.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Do you think the Ministry of Education

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
is actually calculating

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
how many schools are left in the future?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I believe they won't do it.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
But now,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
just like the current version of the Ministry of Education

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
that is to say,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I encourage you,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I give you a way,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
you can go.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
But the Ministry of Education's attitude is

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
that in addition to this,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
it has no way to follow more actively.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
It has already planned

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
the number of schools that may be left in the future.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
The rest of these are

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
going to be challenged in the future.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
It early deployed

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
to tell these schools

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
that you should retire first.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
In fact, this is really a very,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
very difficult thing.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Many people give their opinions.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
But from the perspective of the Ministry of Education,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
it has a lot of pressure

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
from schools,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
even a lot of teachers.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I think this is a big problem.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
But indeed,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
from the total number of recruits

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
to the actual number of recruits,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
in fact, just having such a big gap,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
we know that we definitely need

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
more clues.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I think there are many more

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
things to discuss.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
We seem to have a question.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I think this question

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
is very suitable for an interlude.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
This question comes from

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Liao Kunyan.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
His question is this.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
In Taiwan,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
among all kinds of problems,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
does the public really care about

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
the education issue?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
This is a very cruel question.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
His answer is,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
do you have any specific ideas

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
to help the public

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
solve this problem?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Let's take this question

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
to sum up today's event.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Let's go back to the order

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
from the beginning.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Let's start with Xiaoyu.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I am Xiaoyu.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I am a high-level educator.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
But I often joke that

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
high-level education

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
is not professional.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
The so-called lack of professionalism

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
is that we do not pay much attention

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
to the public's opinion.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
As long as it is the public,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
as long as it is someone who

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
used to go to college,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
or as long as it is a college teacher

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
in the school,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
everyone thinks they know

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
high-level education very well.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
But in fact,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
high-level education

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
is a very complicated

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and a situation

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
that requires a lot of

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
details to be discussed.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
In fact,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
high-level education

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
is mainly based on

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
research universities.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
In other words,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I can even say that

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
it is mainly based on

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
professors from the University of Taiwan.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
But in fact,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
professors from the University of Taiwan

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
have a disadvantage

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
that they cannot see

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
the situation of other types

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
of schools,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
but the problem is that

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
we are really facing

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
a problem.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
In fact, we cannot come up

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
with a solution

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
to solve the problem

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
to help the high-level education

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
industry or

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
other schools

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
to have a better development.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
In this case,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
it is difficult for me to say

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
whether the public is

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
concerned about high-level education

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
or not.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
But in fact,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
we should also help

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
other schools or institutions

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
to propose specific solutions

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
to the current situation

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
of high-level education.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Thank you.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Thank you.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Let's move on to Justin.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
OK.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
In fact,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I think that

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
high-level education

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
today is more focused on

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
post-doctoral or post-doctoral education.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
In fact, this is a stage

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
of the pyramid.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Legislators want votes.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Which ethnic group has the most votes?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It is the state.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It is the state.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Because all people go through state education.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Most people go to college,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
but today we are concerned

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
about the rights of doctoral students.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
When we talk about this matter,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
it is obvious that

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
it is so small.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
But is it important?

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Does it have anything to do

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
with national security and national competitiveness?

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Absolutely.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I think

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
from this perspective,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
we probably know

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
that legislators

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
who are really concerned

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
about this issue,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
and even peers of the Ministry of Education,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
when they are concerned about high-level education,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
they will spend more time

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
and energy.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
After all,

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
fewer and fewer students

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
and fewer and fewer people

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
are concerned about it.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
In fact,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I think

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
it is important

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
to start from

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
what we are concerned about.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
We must have our own reasons

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
and things we believe in,

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
so we come out to pay attention.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
We call on more people

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
who are concerned about this issue.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
In fact,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
when I first heard about

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
what REEF was going to do in the future,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
it was very, very important.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
How can we get

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
more people

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
who are concerned about this issue

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
to pay more attention

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
and communicate more?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And through an organization,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
the actual energy

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
you can generate is very strong.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I think it is very important

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
to cooperate with these

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
external units.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Because in the end,

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
as REEF said at the beginning,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
from an official,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
even from the president

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
of the Executive Yuan,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
whether he supports it

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
or not,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
it is up to the leaders

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
of these ministries

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and legislators

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
to pay attention.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
There is no way to call

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
a person who is already working

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and not studying for a doctor

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
to pay attention to this issue right away.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
But this is actually very distant.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
So I think it is very pragmatic

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
to bring people who are willing to pay attention

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
together through more activities

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
as much as possible,

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
so that we can do something together.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
That's all.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Okay, then it's REEF's turn.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
If you think about it

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
in a pragmatic way,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
after we held the meeting

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
of REEF,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
we thought that

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
instead of doing more research

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
and policy development

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
for the Ministry of Education,

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
we should think about

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
how to continue

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
a long-term power

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
that can continue to happen

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
with so many problems.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Assuming that

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
there is no sudden

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
interest in

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
high-ranking or doctors,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
because of the issue of

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
the ballot,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
and assuming that

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
there is no sudden interest

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
in government officials,

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I think

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
there are two possible

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
possible options.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
There are three possible directions.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
One is that

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
government officials have a certain chance

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
to pay attention,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
and maybe they can

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
have some formal

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
legal institutions

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
to do the research

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
on the policy.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
The second is that

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
universities should have

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
more resources

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
or be more serious

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
in this area.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
There will be a more

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
stable power in it.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
The third is what I'm thinking

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
and what I want to do.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
When I asked the

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
High-Level Education Association,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
they were

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
proposing some

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
reform proposals.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
However, the youth

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
association under them

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
has no manpower

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
because everyone

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
has to go to work after graduation.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Although the situation

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
is difficult,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
there are some organizations

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
and organizations

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
around me

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
who are willing

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
to pay attention.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I hope to

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
form some consensus

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
to form an organization.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Instead of

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
proposing a proposal

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
or a policy study,

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
it is more feasible

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
to gather everyone's

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
opinions and

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
deepen

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
or discuss

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
and form an organization.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
That's it.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Thank you for watching!

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
