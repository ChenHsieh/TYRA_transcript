00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Recording has started.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
In fact, he was originally a law student at NTU Law School.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
He had studied in the Department of Law at Hokkaido University in Japan for a year.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Not only did he complete his law degree, he also obtained a lawyer's license.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
He also worked at a large law firm in Taiwan and Japan.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
To add to that, Ming-Hsi and I have known each other for a long time.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
We were classmates in the same year at NTU Law School.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
In our hearts, Ming-Hsi has always been a strong character like a god.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
We thought it was difficult for him to study law.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We didn't expect him to be able to study history.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Not only that, he is also the president of NTU's Food & Beverage Association.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
To us, he has always been a very strong god.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
He also won countless books.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I think it's very impressive.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
What's cool about Ming-Hsi is that he always follows a two-way path.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
He studies both law and history at the same time.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
At the moment, he is in the Department of History at NTU Law School.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
He also combined his two-way background with his major.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
His field of research includes modern international law history,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
East Asian legal modernization,

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Sino-US relations history,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
international economic law and tax law, and so on.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
I was thinking about today's topic, foreign law.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
For many people, foreign law is a familiar and uncertain concept.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
So let's talk about the rules of today's speech.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Today's speech is actually quite simple.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
If you have any questions,

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
you can either turn on your microphone and ask the speaker directly.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Ming-Hsi likes this kind of interactive speech mode.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Or if you are shy or worried about affecting the speaker's flow,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
you can also post your questions in the chat area.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
I will find the right time to ask.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
After Ming-Hsi finishes his speech,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
we will also have a Q&A session.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
If everyone is okay,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
let's welcome Ming-Hsi.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Hello, everyone.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Can you see my PowerPoint?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Okay.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Thank you for your introduction.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
As Yi-An said,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
we are both university classmates.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
But in the legal department of NTU,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I think Yi-An and I are quite different.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Yi-An left the legal department to study psychology

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
and became a lawyer.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
I am honored to have Yi-An as my host.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Today's topic is

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
controlling US citizens in China.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
This is my research plan for the first-year students

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
in the history department of NTU.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
This plan is still in the early stages,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
so I would like to share it with you.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I found that in this project,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
there are fewer liberal arts students.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
So I will spend a little more time

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
to introduce to you

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
the current situation of humanities

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
and legal studies in the US.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
So today's speech will be divided into several parts.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
One is self-introduction.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
But I don't think I need to introduce too much,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
because Yi-An has given me a very detailed explanation.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
The second part is to share with you

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
what history is.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
This is actually a common question for everyone.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And I am often asked by teachers

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
in different departments or classmates.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Because history is abstract.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
We can say that what happened in the past is history.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
There are so many things in history.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
As a historian or a doctoral student in history,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
how do we choose the topic?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
How do we do research?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
In other words, what are the doctoral students

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
in the history department doing?

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Why do I want to study legal history?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
What is the relationship between law and history?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
In particular, why do I want to choose the topic

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
of international law as my research topic?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
After the introduction of these major subjects

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
and the background,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I will talk about my initial research in the first year.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
That is, what is the foreign law in the United States?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
In the past, in high school textbooks,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
we often heard that foreign law

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
is a part of an unequal treaty.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
In the past, our country or China

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
suffered a lot of unequal treatment.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Then it was a matter of losing power.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Is it true? Is it true?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Did the United States benefit from this?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Who benefited from this?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
The first research in the history department

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
is to clarify some facts and some institutional backgrounds.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
The higher level is to develop theories.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
So in the end, I want to talk about my future plan.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
How do I develop these facts and their theoretical meanings

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
and then carry out my future research?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
So here, actually,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yi-An has already introduced it to me.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I'm not drunk.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I want to talk about the last point.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
That is, why do I want to study history?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
In fact, my initial goal was

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
to teach in a law school in the United States.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Here, I think there is something very interesting

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
that I can share with you.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
In the United States, professional schools,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
such as law schools,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
their practice is very different from

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
what we usually do in history, physics, or math.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
As a historian, I will tell you

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
what the origin and evolution of this system is.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
As you know,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
in the world of legal education,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
North America is very special.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
They do not have legal education in the university.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Unlike in Taiwan, Japan, Germany,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
the United Kingdom, or France,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
we can choose the law department

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
after graduating from high school.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
After graduating from the law department,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
you can take a law exam.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Then you can become a lawyer

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
or continue to study for a master's degree

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
and return to the law department to teach.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
This is not the case in the United States and Canada.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
The U.S. Department of State does not have a law department.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
You have to graduate from the Department of State

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
before you can get your first law degree,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
which is called JD, or Juris Doctor.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
It's the same as MD.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
It has the title of a doctor,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
but it's not a Ph.D. doctor.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
So traditionally,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
when there was a law school in the United States,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
they thought that

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
law was a skill,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
not a subject.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
So in the 19th century,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
the teachers of the law school

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
were some senior lawyers,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
judges, or food workers.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
And the education of the law school

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
was to have these food workers

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
tell you how to become a good lawyer.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
So the course of the law school

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
was very food-oriented.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
It taught you how to sign a contract,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
how to act or defend in front of the jury,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
how to interact and interrogate,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
how to get along with the judge,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
and so on and so forth.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Later, everyone thought

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
that if you teach at school,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
you still need to have a little bit of academic knowledge.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
But there was no such thing as a law Ph.D.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So what should you do?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
There is still a method

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
taught at law schools in the United States

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
called traditional track,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
which allows you to become a teacher of the law school.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
What is traditional track?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
It's when you graduate from college

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and become a JD,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
your first law degree.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
After that,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
you become a lawyer for three years

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
or a judge assistant for three years

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
to gain food experience.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
After gaining food experience,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
you go to the law department of the university

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
to apply for the position of teacher.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
When you're a teacher,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
it's usually three years.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
You have to teach on the side.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
What you teach is to teach some legal writing,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
mathematical writing, and so on.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
These are related to food.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
During the three years you teach,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
you have to write a master's thesis.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
If this master's thesis is well written,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
you can go to various schools

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
and apply for the position of assistant professor.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Once you become an assistant professor,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
you'll be like other departments.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
You'll start writing thesis,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
升等,教書, and so on.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
But later,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
in the 1970s or 1980s,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
we found that

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
the failure of being a fellow

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
and not becoming an assistant professor

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
is very high.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
This can also be seen.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
In JD for three years,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
you're learning how to write a book,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
and then you become a lawyer for three years.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
It doesn't make sense.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
When you go back to law school,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
you suddenly start writing a thesis.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Like everyone here,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
we all study Ph.D.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
We all know that

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
writing a thesis requires a lot of practice,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
and then you need someone to lead.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
You need a lot of research methods, and so on.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
So later, the U.S. Law School

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
came up with a new way

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
to make you a teacher,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
which is the so-called JD Ph.D. double degree.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
In other words,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
you get a Ph.D. in another field,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
such as history, economics,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
politics, language,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
psychology, and so on.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Then you go to JD,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
and then you become a lawyer for two years.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
At this point, you don't have to be a fellow,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
and you can take your Ph.D. thesis

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
and apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Basically,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
all the new professors at the U.S. Law School

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
are JD Ph.D. double degrees.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
This is my original goal.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I want to get a Ph.D. in history first,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and then I want to get a Ph.D. in JD.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Then I can apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
There are more and more Chinese people

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
applying for a Ph.D. degree

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
at the U.S. Law School

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
through this kind of double degree.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
But as far as I know,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
no one in Taiwan

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
has applied for a Ph.D. degree

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
at the U.S. Law School in this way.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So I want to give it a try.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Next,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
in the past,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
most of the Ph.D. and JD degrees

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
were obtained at different schools.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
For example,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Professor Ian Ayers,

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
who is very famous for

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
doing legal economic analysis

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
at Yale University.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
He was MIT's Econ Ph.D.,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
plus Yale's JD,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
and then he taught at Yale.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
For people in mainland China,

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
for example,

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Professor Li Ji at UC Irvine,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
he was a political science Ph.D.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
at Northwestern University,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
plus Yale's JD,

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
and then he taught law at UC Irvine.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
So this is what I want to challenge.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I want to practice and hone my knowledge

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
in the history department,

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
learn the methods of history,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
and write papers.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Later on,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
in the last stage of my Ph.D. program,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
in the 6th, 7th, or 8th year,

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
I applied for a Ph.D. degree

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
at another school.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I was a lawyer in the U.S. for two years,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and then I taught at a law school.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
This is a brief explanation

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
of why I want to

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
apply for a Ph.D. degree in history.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
On the one hand,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I always have this idea of cross-field.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I think this kind of training and environment in the U.S.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
is the best fit for my research.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
The last thing I want to add is that

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I just said that

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Taiwanese have not yet read Ph.D. and JD,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
right?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
The next question must be

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
that in Taiwan's law department,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
there are many legal scholars

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
who claim to have obtained a Ph.D. degree in the U.S.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
What kind of degree did they read?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
What kind of career path did they embark on?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Since they are different from Americans

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
who cultivate law schools,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
they must have a different set of things, right?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
So I wrote LLM and JSD here later.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Here I would like to explain to you

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
what this is.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
LLM is generally translated as

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
a legal master's degree.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
It is a Latin abbreviation.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
It means that

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
if you are not in the U.S. today,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
for example, the U.K., France,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Taiwan, or Japan,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
you have already studied law in college.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
So it is an abbreviation

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
for a legal master's degree

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
for foreigners.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
This is called LLM.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
You only need to study for nine months

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
without writing a paper.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Then you can be qualified

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
to be a lawyer in New York.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So in most cases,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
in general, in Taiwan or Japan,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
if you have been a lawyer for three or five years

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
and you think you need to retire,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
you can go to the U.S.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
and study for nine months.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Among these LLM students,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
some may be interested in academics.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
So you can find a professor

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
who is willing to teach you

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
while you are studying LLM.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Then you can enroll

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
and become a JSD,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
which we generally call

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
a legal master's degree.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
This JSD is actually very different

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
from our general Ph.D.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Because once you enroll,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
you are a doctoral candidate.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
So you don't need to take classes,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
you don't need to be a teacher,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
you don't need to be a lecturer.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
In principle, if you write a paper,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
you can graduate after the exam.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
So there are some very famous

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
LLM teachers in China.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
They may only study JSD for a year and a half

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
or two years

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
before they graduate.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
There are a lot of people like this.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Because JSD is not like

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
our Ph.D. training,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
you have to take classes,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
take exams,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
be a lecturer,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
teach, and so on.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
So the problem with a JSD graduate

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
is that

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
their quality is not very certain.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Some people are JSD,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
their boss has very high requirements for them,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
asking them to continue to take classes,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
continue to study methods,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
or take the qualification exam with them.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Or some students are very smart.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
I have a lot of JSD teachers

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
in the Department of Law in Canada.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
They are very smart.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
They watch the lecturers

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
have a seminar in the law school every day,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
and they will kill each other.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
They watch Huashan's paper every day

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
and become a big family.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
After they return to China,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
they can be a Ph.D.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
and teach law in Taiwan.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
But in the US Department of Law,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
you can hardly see any teachers

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
who are JSD.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Because they are

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Ph.D. for foreigners.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
This is a brief introduction.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I used to think that

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
if I went to the US to study law,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I could just study LLM and JSD.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
But I thought,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
no,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I want to try to

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
receive the same training as Americans.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
If Americans want to become a professor of law,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I will become a professor of law.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
So I started with Ph.D.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Later,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
in my senior year,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I will see if I can get a J.D.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
and try to find a job

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
in the US Department of Law.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Next, I will answer a question.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
What is history?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
I am often asked this question.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But I think this is a disaster question.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
It's like I want to ask,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
what is physics?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
What is math?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
It is difficult to define a subject.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
But I think I can try

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
to look at this subject

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
from a more specific perspective.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
What is it?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I think from the perspective of abstract theory,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
in the Western context,

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
history is also a method of philosophy.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
In other words,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
the research we do in history

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
is the same as asking a question,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
giving it a false hypothesis,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
and then verifying it, right?

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
It is the same as philosophy, physics, and chemistry.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
We need to ask a question,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
and then use some methods to answer it,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
to verify if your hypothesis is correct.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Of course, this is a bit of nonsense.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Because anyone who studies Ph.D.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
has to do this kind of study.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So I think we can look at history

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
from a different perspective.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Whether it is Greece or China,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
people in ancient times

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
have a cycle of history.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
By cycle of history,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I mean that

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
for them,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
history is something that

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
happens over and over again.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
For example,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
in the Tang Dynasty,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Emperor Taizong said that

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
history is the key to understanding the mind.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
In other words,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
as long as you study the past,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
you will learn some lessons.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
By cycle of history,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I mean that

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
there is nothing new under the sun.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
So I understand the past,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
and I understand the future.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Because what happened in the past

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
will keep happening over and over again.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So as long as I know the past,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I will know how to face the same thing in the future.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
What should I do when it happens again?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
But as we all know,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
this is a kind of fantasy.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
How is it possible that

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
people 200 years ago

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
would face the same problems

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
as we do now?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Of course, it is different.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
In the 18th and 19th centuries,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
history was taken over by the state.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
There was a very

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
purposeful approach

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
to help

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
build a democratic country.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
For example,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
when Germany was about to be unified,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
a group of historians came out

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
and wrote history of Germany.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
They told us that we were different

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
from the Italians.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
We have a glorious history.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Who is German?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
We have a common memory.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
This also happened

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
in the end of the Qing Dynasty

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
and the beginning of the Republic of China.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Chinese historians told you

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
that we are all descendants of the Yan Emperor.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So we have a common ancestor.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
We must agree that we are all Chinese.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So for a while,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
history was used by the state

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
to build the common memory of the nation.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
In the 19th century,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
there was another trend.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Social science,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
political science,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
and other social sciences

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
wanted to become

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
like natural science

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
and discover the common principles

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
of human society.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
They wanted to analyze

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
why the French Revolution happened,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
what its causal relationship was,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
and what its social background conditions were.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
If we can build

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
a abstract theory

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
that the French Revolution

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
will happen

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
when the four conditions

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
are met,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
we can predict

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
when the next revolution will happen

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
or prevent it from happening.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Another famous example

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
is Marx.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
He said that human history

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
has a process.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
We will go from feudalism

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
to a small class revolution

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
to a large class revolution.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Many historians' work

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
is to prove

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
the theory of social science

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
and the process

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
of social science principles.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Until now,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
many historians in mainland China

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
are still trying to prove

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
the process of Marxism

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
in China.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
This is the purpose

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
of the third kind of history.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
The fourth kind of history

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
is similar to the second kind of history,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
but it starts to ask smaller questions.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Historians want to

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
understand the history of the past

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
and develop quantitative studies

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
of economics or politics.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
The most famous example

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
is Professor Daniel Clerman

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
at the University of South Carolina.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
He taught at the University of Chicago

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
because his wife was a lawyer

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
who was afraid of the cold.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
His family moved to South Carolina.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
He is a history doctor

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and a law professor

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
at the University of Chicago.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
His research is very interesting.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
He uses the documents

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
and information

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
he discovered

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
in history training

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and his strong

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
statistical and quantitative background

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
to do some

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
theoretical practical research.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Some questions

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
are difficult to answer.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Does judicial independence

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
help economic development?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
We are not like natural science,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
which can control all variables

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
in the laboratory.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
When we want to study this topic,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
we have to do some social experiment

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
to do the cause-and-effect theory,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and we need to find

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
a lot of agent variables.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Every time a country

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
does judicial independence reform,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
it often follows

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
many other reforms at the same time.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
This is the best way

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
to understand the relationship

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
between judicial independence

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
and economic development in the UK.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Professor Dan Clearman

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
has some very good information.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
For example,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
he found that

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
in the 18th and 19th centuries,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
the UK was doing judicial independence reform.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
At the same time,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
East India Company

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
was listed

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
in London Stock Exchange

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
because

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
there was no

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
good information transmission system.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Therefore, news from London

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
had to wait three or five days

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
before it could be sent to Amsterdam.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
He thought

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
that the agent variables

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
of economic development

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
were the high and low prices

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
of East India Company's shares.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Whenever a judicial independence

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
law or reform

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
occurred in the UK,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
East India Company's shares

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
would rise or fall

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
when the news

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
was sent to Amsterdam.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
He used statistics

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
to infer the situation in the UK.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
In the end,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
he concluded that

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
every judicial independence reform

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
in the UK

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
had something to do

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
with the rise of

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
East India Company's shares.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Without historical training,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
East India Company's shares

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
would not have risen.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
This is another theory.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
In the early years,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
there was a theory

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
that asked

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
why there was

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
no China in the West.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
In the early years,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
historians liked to ask

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
why there was no capitalism in China,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
why there was no scientific revolution in China,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and why there was no

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
revolution in China.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The next theory is

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
very popular recently,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
but it is a bit similar

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
to the idea of a national state.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Historians believe that

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
the people's historical memory

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
should not serve the country.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Therefore,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
historians began to write

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
some important historical memories.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
For example,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
transitional justice should tell you

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
that the Nazi massacre

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
against the Jews

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
was really horrible.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
We should remember this

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
forever.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Because it happened once,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
it may happen again.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
The main consciousness of Taiwan

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
must be awakened,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
because the people of Taiwan

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
have been oppressed for the past 400 years.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
These popular historical writings

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
are actually shaping historical memory.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Another group of people

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
believe that

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
history should not serve the country,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
so there are a lot of historical studies

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
to deconstruct the national state.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
For example,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
tradition is invented,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and tradition does not have

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
a long history of 5,000 years.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
The so-called descendants of the King of Japan

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
only appeared for 100 years.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
The so-called Japanese cuisine

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
was invented after the Ming Dynasty.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
In the Middle Ages,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
the Emperor of Japan believed in Buddhism,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
so he told everyone not to eat meat.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
In ancient East Asia,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
there were four categories of animals

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
in the world,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
such as grass fish and birds.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
At that time,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
the Emperor of Japan said

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
that everyone was not allowed to eat meat,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
grass fish and birds.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
In fact,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
before the Ming Dynasty,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
the Japanese did not eat beef or pork,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
so the so-called barbecue and fried pork chops

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
were far-fetched Japanese cuisine.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
They appeared in the late 19th century

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
and even in the early 20th century.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Finally, I think history

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
is different from everyone else.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
In politics and sociology,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
they ask more objective questions,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
but in history,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
they also ask subjective questions.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Traditional sociology

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
may ask a question,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
such as

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
whether the exam system

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
has promoted social movement.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
So some historical sociologists

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
will look for a lot of past history

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
to see if there are some

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
poor and hard-working people

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
who became good officials

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
because of the imperial examination,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
and then flew to Tengda

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
and became famous

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
from the Han dynasty.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
But historical sociology

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
will ask a question.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Objectively,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
even if the imperial examination

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
really promoted social movement,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
did the people at that time

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
really realize that

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
the imperial examination

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
promoted social movement?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
In the Han dynasty,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
there were some economic works.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
We can find out from economics

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
what is the meaning of

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Chou Chou's The Theory of Economics?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
What does it mean in economics?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
But historians may ask

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
a person who has not studied

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
modern economics,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
has not studied Adam Smith,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
or has not studied economics

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
in NTU,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
how can he write The Theory of Economics?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I think this is the difference

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
between historical sociology

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
and other subjects.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
The next question is

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
what is legal history?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Why is legal history

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
a field worth studying

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
for me?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
The first argument is,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
of course,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
all the legal experts in the court

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
are historians,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
because the court can only

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
judge what has happened.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I am going to discuss

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
whether Su Jianhe killed someone

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
in the past or not.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Is he guilty or not?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
We can only discuss

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
whether he killed someone in the past.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
The court cannot decide

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
whether he will kill someone in the future.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
This is a matter of fact.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
The court can only deal with

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
what has happened.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
From the legal point of view,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
when we make a judgment,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
the court will always

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
make a judgment.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
In the tradition of British and American law,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
there are many cases

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
that are not in the text,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
so you have to tell everyone

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
whether the case in front of you

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
is the same as the case in the past.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
If it is the same,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
you should apply the same law.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
If it is different,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
you should make another explanation.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
There are some famous cases

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
where, for example,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
a court said that

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
A car must pay

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
$10,000.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Later,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
a new case came out

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
where

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
A was hit by B car.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Then

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
A told the court

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
that the driver of B car

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
should pay me $10,000.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
But the lawyer of B car said

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
no, no, no,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
our case is different from A car.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Because A car is black

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
and B car is red.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Because humans are more alert

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
when they see a red car.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
So

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
when they are hit,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
they have to take more responsibility

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
because they see a red car.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
British and American law

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
has been debating this kind of thing,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
so you have to keep looking at

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
the past cases

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
as they are now.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Then you need a lot of

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
historical training

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
The second thing is that

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
there is a saying in English

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
that the past is like a foreign country.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
So when we study

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
the history of law,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
it's like we are studying

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
another country.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
So it's like we are now in Taiwan,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
we are going to legislate.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
We will refer to what the Japanese do,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
what the Germans do,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
what the Americans do.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Because these comparisons

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
can give you some ideas.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
But if you refer to other countries,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
you will be surprised.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Because from a psychological point of view,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
people all have this

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
in-domain effect.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It's not good to play big

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
in front of the case.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
But you will think

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
what you have is the best.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
But sometimes when you look at

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
foreign things,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
you will know that

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
there are many different ways

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
in this world.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
For example, if I want to control

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
cigarettes,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
can I refer to

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
how people controlled

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
opium in the past?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Of course, opium and cigarettes

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
are different things.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
But you can think about

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
some new ideas.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
The second thing is that

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
we all know that

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
humans have a path to rely on.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
There is one thing that people

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
have been doing for a long time,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
and the legal history

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
can help you understand

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
the background of this system

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and its reasons.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
What did people think at that time?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
After understanding the reason for

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
the path to rely on,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
we should now verify that

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
this condition no longer exists

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
or the condition has changed,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
which means that

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
we should do something different.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
For example,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
in the debate on same-sex marriage,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
it is said that two people

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
of the same sex can get married.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
If not, why?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
If there is, why?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Has it really changed now?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Another common legal history

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
is the debate on

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
the structure of mainstream.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
For example, we used to think

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
that Hitler's Nazi was terrible

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
because he killed Jews.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
He set up a prison court

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
and let the judge judge

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
that homosexuals and Jews

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
are inferior species

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
and are not suitable for having children.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
On the other hand,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
the United States

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
is a free and democratic defender.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Through World War II,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
the United States

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
liberated

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
these oppressed people.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
James Whitman,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
a professor at Yale University,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
is also a doctor of history.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
He wrote a book

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
called Hitler's American Model.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
He said that

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Hitler's

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
racial discrimination law

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
was widely referred to

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
in the United States

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
as the law of racial discrimination

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
that oppresses black people.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
In fact, Hitler once said

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
that Americans were too fierce to black people.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
We can't be so fierce.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
So, how did Hitler

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
know how to use the law

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
to oppress minorities?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It came from the United States.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
This is what I am doing now.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I am using the third world approach

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
to look at the international law.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
In the past,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
we thought that the international law

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
was a principle of equal interaction

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
between sovereign states.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But in fact, it was not.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
We know that the international law

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
was once used to oppress

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and to colonize.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
The Third World Approach

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
to International Law

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
has a group of scholars.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Their goal is to tell you

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
how the international law

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
from the European international law

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
to the international law of the world

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
has contributed a lot to China,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Japan, Latin America, etc.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
They want to tell you

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
that the international law

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
is a tool of oppression.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
We should not allow the international law

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
to become a tool of oppression again.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
We must preserve these historical memories.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
This is what I think

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
the legal history is doing.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Before I share my research,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I would like to know

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
if you have any questions.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I can answer first.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I would like to know

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
what is the general history

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
and what is the legal history.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I think I have learned a lot.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Even if I am a lawyer,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I think I have learned a lot.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Should I continue?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It seems that

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
everyone is still digesting.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
The information is a bit large.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I will try to speak in plain language.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I don't know if

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
everyone can understand.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I think I have made it clear.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I have heard a lot of concepts

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
for the first time.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I am not sure

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
but you have made it clear today.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
The language is very good.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I think it has helped me

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
to digest so much information.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Can you hear me?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Yes.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I have a question.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I am curious

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
about the background

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
you set up

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
in the beginning.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
What is history?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
The front part

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and the back part

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
are there any differences in views?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
If so,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
what do you think?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Today's speech

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
is mainly to

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
deconstruct nationalism.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
In the past, foreign law

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
was described as

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
a symbol of

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
a third world people,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Chinese, Japanese,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
or non-Western people

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
being oppressed.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
But I will tell you

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
that the actual operation

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
of this theory

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
is based on two things.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
The first is that

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I want to improve

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
the meaning of the theory.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
In the future,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I may want to

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
use other methods

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
of political,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
economic,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
and socialization

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
to make it more abstract

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and more applicable.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I also hope you can

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
give me some advice.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Many people

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
are not familiar with

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
law and history,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
so I hope I can

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
give you a brief introduction

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
of what I am doing in this field.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I also want to

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
take this opportunity

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
to let you know

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
what is the purpose

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
of the American Academy of Law

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and what is the purpose

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
of the American Academy of Law.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Did I answer your question?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Yes, you did.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Thank you.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
If not,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
please continue.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Thank you.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I think the training

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
from Northwestern University

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
is very interesting.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Foreign students

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
have to take a class

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
in English.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
The teacher will teach us

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
some tips.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
When you don't know what to say,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
just take a sip of water.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
No one will ask you

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
why you are drinking water.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Sometimes,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
you can relax

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and think about

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
what you want to say.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Let's move on

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
to the topic of

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
extracurricular law.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Extracurricular law,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
at least for me,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
is a term

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
but we don't know

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
what actually happens

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
to it.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
To put it simply,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
extracurricular law

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
is the privilege that

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
foreigners are not

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
under the jurisdiction

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
of the local courts.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
In other words,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
in 1900,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
if an American

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
stole or committed a crime

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
in China

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
or any other country

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
wanted to sue him,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
the Chinese government

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
and the Chinese courts

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
couldn't do anything

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
because he was under the jurisdiction

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
of the local courts.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Only the U.S. courts

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
or the U.S. courts

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
can deal with such cases.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
This is extracurricular law.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Extracurricular law still exists

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
in some countries.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
For example,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
if an American

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
raped a woman

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
or a child

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
in a local court,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
the Japanese courts

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
couldn't bring him to trial

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
because he was under the jurisdiction

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
of the U.S. courts.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's not that the U.S. courts

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
couldn't bring him to trial,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
but the U.S. courts.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
It sounds unreasonable.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Let's move on.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
The first time that

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
the U.S. signed a treaty

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
was in 1842,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
the Treaty of Nanjing,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
China signed a treaty

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
after the Opium War.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
In this treaty,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
the U.K. required

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
China to provide

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
extracurricular law to the U.K.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
The U.S. signed the treaty

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
in 1844,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
the Treaty of Wangxia,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
China.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
In Chinese textbooks,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
extracurricular law

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
is a symbol of

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
imperialism.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Today, our country's citizens

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
are being bullied.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Why doesn't our country

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
promote justice?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Why does the U.S. court

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
have to bring him to trial?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
The U.S. court

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
must be very biased.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
The U.S. court

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
must tolerate

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
the U.S. people

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
because the U.S. people

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
betrayed the sovereignty

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
of China.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
The U.S. court must

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
revolutionize the U.S.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
The U.S. court

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
must abolish extracurricular law

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
so that the Chinese people

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
will no longer be bullied.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Is it really like this?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Let's move on.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
For example,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
when the U.S. came to China

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
to negotiate the Treaty of Wangxia,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
the U.S. diplomat,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
William Cushing,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
gave a speech

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
in the U.S. Congress.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
He said,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
his proudest moment

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
was when the U.S. wrote

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
the extracurricular law

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
in the Treaty of Wangxia.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Because China

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
is an uncivilized place.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The judges in their countries

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
do not have three powers.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
The county magistrates

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
do not have three powers.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
How can the county magistrates

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
be the judges?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
In Taiwan,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
can He Wen-je be a judge?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
No.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Administrative and judicial

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
should be separated.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
China is an uncivilized country.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
If you commit a serious crime,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
you will be imprisoned,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
you will be tortured,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
you will be beaten.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
If our people

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
are the most advanced species,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
how can we obey the laws of the barbarians?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Therefore,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
obtaining the extracurricular law

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
is a civilized victory.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It sounds like a good idea.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
However,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
historians have found

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
that before 1868,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
we could not find

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
any Chinese history

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
against the extracurricular law.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
This is actually

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
a very strange thing.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
If China is so powerful,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
why does China never object

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
to all the negotiations?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
China thinks it is good.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Why?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
If you want to extracurricular law,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
we will give it to you.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
This question

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
is related to a very popular research topic

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
in recent history,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
which is the multidimensionalism

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
of the empire and the law.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
In fact,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
the majority of human history

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
is dominated by the British

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and the Germans.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
In fact,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
the majority of human history

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
is dominated by the Empire.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
What is the Empire?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
The simplest definition

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
is that

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
under a regime,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
there are many different

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
ethnic groups

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and activists.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
For example,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
the Qing Dynasty

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
was an empire

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
with Han people,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Tibetans,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Mongols,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
ethnic minorities

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
and Xinjiang people.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
The next question is

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
that we all know that

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
there is a law called the Qing Dynasty Law.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
But did the Qing Dynasty Law

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
apply in Tibet?

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Did the Qing Dynasty Law

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
apply in Xinjiang?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
In fact, it did not.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Although the Qing Dynasty Law

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
applied to most empires,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
the Roman Empire

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
also applied the law to the Jews.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
In the Qing Dynasty,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
the Mongols still applied

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
the traditional Mongolian law,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
while the Tibetans still applied the Tibetan law.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Only the Han people

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
applied the Qing Dynasty Law.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
This is understandable.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
When a country is very large

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
and is an empire,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
how could it be possible

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
to force a Mongolian

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
to marry in a Confucian way?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
This is also a question of

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
the cost of rule.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
In order to maintain the operation of an empire

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and the coordination of the ethnic groups,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
you must use different laws

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
to treat different people.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
This is now called

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
the law pluralism.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Does Taiwan want to do the same thing?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Should the indigenous people

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
apply the indigenous law

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
or not?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
From the perspective of China,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
in 1842,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
the British said

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
that they wanted to

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
apply the British law in China.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Think about it.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
What's wrong with

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
the Mongolians

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
applying the Mongolian law

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
and the British applying the British law?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
At that time,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
foreigners could only

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
move around

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
when they came to China.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Basically,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
it did not affect the original life of the Han people.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Therefore,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
there is nothing wrong with

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
giving you a piece of land

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
and having your own law.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
In 1842,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
foreigners were limited to Guangzhou.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
We call it the Guangzhou system.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Originally in Guangzhou,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
in 1842,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
China had already admitted

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
that the Americans could apply the British law

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
in Guangzhou.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Therefore, in 1842 and 1844,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
foreigners came to China

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and told the negotiators

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
that they wanted to apply the foreign law.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
The Chinese thought it was good,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
so they gave it to them.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
However, in 1868,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
people found that something was wrong.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
At first,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
there were many cases

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
in which

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
foreigners committed crimes

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
in China

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and could not be punished.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
In these cases,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
too many countries had foreign law,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
so the legal vacuum was created.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Finally,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
in 1910,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
there were 23 countries with foreign law in China.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
We often see in the files

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
that an American

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
committed a crime

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
and was arrested in the U.S. Court.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
The first defense he made was

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
that he was not an American,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
but an Englishman.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Because he had a lot of passports,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
he kept hiding.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Later, he made Shanghai the most

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
famous criminal heaven in the world,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
because everyone would not be arrested.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
This problem became more and more serious,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
affecting China's security,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
China's economic development,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and so on.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Later,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
he began to think that

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
it was a matter of right to enter the country,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
and we had to oppose it.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
To this day,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
there is a modern meaning.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
For example,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
every year on January 11th,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
there is a Judiciary Day,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
and the Judiciary Council

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
holds a seminar and a celebration.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Why is there a Judiciary Day

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
on January 11th?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Because January 11th, 1943

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
was the day

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
when China and the U.S.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
signed an equal treaty

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
and abolished foreign law.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
They thought that from that day on,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
the judicial system of the Republic of China

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
would no longer be dominated by the West.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Since then,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
the Nationalist government

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
moved to Taiwan in 1949,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
so the Judiciary Day

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
is still on January 11th.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Do you still remember

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
the Lincoln case?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
It was about a British man

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
who died in Taiwan.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Later, he fled the country

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
and returned to the U.K.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
At that time,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the U.K. House of Representatives

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
decided that Lincoln

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
should be transferred back to Taiwan.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
The representative of the U.K.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
was Ambassador St. Luke.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I attended his class with Ian.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Ambassador St. Luke was

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
the Minister of Foreign Affairs

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
when he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
at the University of Taitung.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
He said in a newspaper

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
that Lincoln should have

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
a symbolic meaning,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
because the law in the U.K.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
cannot be transferred

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
to a country that is not civilized by the law.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
At that time,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Ambassador St. Luke wrote an article

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
that the Lincoln case proved

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
that the U.K. had become

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
a country that was civilized by the law,

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
so the U.K. would be willing

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
to transfer people back to Taiwan.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
However, when the second trial was overturned,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
the U.K. was defeated.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
However, in the hearts of many

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
lawyers and diplomats,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
the rule of law

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
in the U.K.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
must be carried on

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
by a civilized country.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
My question is very simple.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Is foreign law really better?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
We can see that

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
the U.S.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
must maintain a court

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
in China,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and it must invest a lot of money.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
In fact, we can also

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
intuitively find that

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
if a U.S. court

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
in China

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
favors U.S. citizens,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Chinese people

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
should not do business

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
with U.S. citizens.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Chinese people do not want to

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
get along with U.S. citizens,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
which will worsen Sino-U.S. relations

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
and damage U.S. business interests in China.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
My question is

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
if foreign law is really better,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
how does it actually work?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Let's go to the U.S.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Can I ask a question?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Sure, go ahead.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I'd like to ask...

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
You can go back to your seat.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Okay.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I'd like to ask...

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I'd like to ask...

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Can you tell us

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
who sent the question?

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Can you introduce yourself

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
so that we can understand

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
the situation better?

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Thank you.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Okay, I'm

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Hong Shaoming.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I'm also a postdoc at Caltech.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I graduated from NTU Psychology.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I'd like to ask...

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
When you talk about

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
foreign law,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
do you mean

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
foreign law and

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
multilateralism?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Are they the same?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
At least on the surface,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
when you talk about

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
multilateralism,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
you're talking about

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
the international community.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
But foreign law is about

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
the relationship between

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
countries.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
This can also be applied to...

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
For example, you just mentioned

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
that before 1868,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
China did not oppose

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
foreign law.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
It is possible that

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
they have always felt that

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
foreign law is one form

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
of multilateralism.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
After 25 years,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
do you think

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
foreign law and

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
multilateralism are related?

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Thank you.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I think

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
everyone can accept

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
multilateralism

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
under the previous rule.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Because it is a low-cost

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
way to maintain national governance.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
So most of the current research

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
believes that

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
before 1868,

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Chinese central government officials

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
did not oppose

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
multilateralism.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Because it is not necessarily

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
within a country.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
For example,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
when Western missionaries

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
came to China,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
China also respected

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
the use of its own laws

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
to deal with its own problems.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
After 1868,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I think it is because

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
China wants to modernize.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
So in the process of modernization,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
we can achieve the ability

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
of central power and mobilization

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
that modern countries want.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
We can also see that

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
after the establishment of the Republic of China,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
China hopes that

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
all use the laws of the Republic of China.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
China no longer respects

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
China's autonomy.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
China's autonomy has become very limited.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
The current People's Republic of China

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
also hopes that

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
all use the laws of the Republic of China.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I think the same is true for Hong Kong.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
At the beginning,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
China thought that

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Hong Kongers could continue

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
to use the law of the Republic of China.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
However, when China wants to

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
modernize Hong Kong,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
it wants to adopt

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
a new law of monolateralism.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
After all, we are one nation,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
one country.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Why can't we all

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
use different laws?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
If you are a Mongolian,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
a Tibetan, a Xinjiang or a Hong Konger,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
you should adopt the same law.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
You are not different.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
If you are different,

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
you are admitting that

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
China is not a monolateral country.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I think the real difference

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
between legal pluralism and

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
legal monolateralism is that

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
in the process of

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
transferring from the empire

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
to a democratic country,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
China wants to strengthen

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Hong Kong.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
In your opinion,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
in a democratic country,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
legal pluralism is

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
different from

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
legal monolateralism,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
isn't it?

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Not necessarily.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
It should be said that

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
legal pluralism is

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
different from

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
legal monolateralism.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
It should be said that

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
in a democratic country,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
you should adopt the same law.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Foreigners adopt the same law

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
because they want to

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
show their national sovereignty.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Yes.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Your defense of

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
legal pluralism is that

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
it may show

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
the spirit of

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
legal pluralism.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
But in some countries,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
legal pluralism and

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
legal monolateralism are

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
fundamentally different.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
First of all,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
legal pluralism can,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
but legal monolateralism can't.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Second, it can explain

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
why China did not oppose

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
at the beginning.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Because they thought

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
it was different.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
At first, they thought

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
it was the same thing.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Their opposition was

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
when they found

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
that it was actually

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
different and

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
they could not support

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
whether it was good or

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
bad.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
But when I first

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
talked about it,

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
historians would ask

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
why they could not

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
find opposition in 1868.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
We would say that

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
we thought that the subjective

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
will of the activists

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
at that time

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
mixed it with

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
legal pluralism.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
In other words,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
the reason why historians

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
did not oppose

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
is that they thought

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
it was a mix of two things.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
It is a bit like

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
what I just said.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
At first, they thought

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
it was the same thing,

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
so they did not oppose.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
But later they found

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
that it was different.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Anyway,

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
we have spent too much time

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I would like to add

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
a cold knowledge.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
My ex-boss is an expert

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
on the LinkedIn case.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Oh, really?

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Did he prove that Taiwan

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
is a civilized country?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
The main reason

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
why he was invited

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
was to ask

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
whether there was a significant difference

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
between the British and the Taiwanese

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
in terms of quantity.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
I see.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
That's all.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Please go on.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
OK.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Sorry,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I am running out of time.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
So,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
in 1906,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
the U.S. carried out

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
a judicial reform in Shanghai.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
From 1844 to 1905,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
the U.S. did not

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
establish a formal court

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
in China.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
We often hear the term

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
that the U.S. sent

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
a diplomat to be a judge.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
In other words,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
if an American committed a crime in China,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
he would be sent to the local consulate

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
to be tried.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Who is the judge?

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
It is a diplomat.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Sometimes, the diplomat

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
also has some legislative powers.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
It is a tricky situation.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
When the U.S. criticized China

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
for not having a separation of powers

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
and not being civilized,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
because the diplomat is an administrator

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
and has the right to be tried,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
the U.S. is a system

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
of three powers.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
The U.S. is not civilized at all.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
The U.S. is more like

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
the governor-general

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
or the county magistrate of China,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
like Bao Qingtian.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
He is a mayor

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
and a judge at the same time.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Next,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
the U.S. was not a rich country

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
at that time.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
The U.S. did not invest

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
a lot of people,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
finance and legal experts

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
in China.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
For example,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
the U.S. did not have a prison

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
at the beginning.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
The U.S. even rented a prison

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
to the British and French,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
because the U.S. built

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
the British and French prisons

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
in Shanghai earlier.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Why did the U.S. have a legal reform

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
in 1906?

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I will explain in the next video.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
The U.S. began

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
the expansion of the empire

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
at the end of the 19th century.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
In this video,

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
we can see two data.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
The first is the date

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
when the U.S. acquired the colony.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Hawaii,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Wake Island,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Samoa, the Philippines,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
and Panama were all

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
acquired at the end of the 19th century

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
and the beginning of the 20th century.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
In other words,

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
between 1844 and 1900,

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
the U.S. did not trade much.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
In the second table,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
we can see that

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
between 1900 and 1912,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
the average trade volume

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
of China and the U.S.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
increased significantly,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
and even doubled.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
The expansion of the U.S.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
brought a lot of trade between

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
China and the U.S.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
At that time,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
the U.S. federal government

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
responded that

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
the Judiciary

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
was not enough

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
to solve the trade dispute

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
between China and the U.S.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
because these judges

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
were not legal people.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
They were just diplomats.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
As we all know,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
diplomats abroad

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
were also responsible

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
for business affairs,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
and they did not have

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
much influence on the U.S.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
economy.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
In addition,

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
as the U.S. expansion

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
spread,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
a lot of smugglers

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
came to China,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
including sex workers,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
gamblers, and vagabonds.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
At that time,

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
the U.S. missionaries

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
in China believed

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
that these illegal immigrants

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
had a serious impact

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
on the sex workers

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
in the U.S.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
So in 1900,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
all the white prostitutes

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
in Shanghai

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
said they were American.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
At that time,

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
the word American Girl

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
meant prostitutes,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
because every prostitute

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
said she was American

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
when she was arrested.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
If you were sent to the U.K.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
court,

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
you would be a prostitute.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
At that time,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
there was a lot of discussion

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
in the U.S.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
As we can see in this picture,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
foreign law was not

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
an important concept

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
for both China and the U.S.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
It was not until 1900

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
that the word

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
extraterritoriality

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
and consular jurisdiction

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
began to appear

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
in foreign law.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
On the other hand,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
China also began to reform

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
the modern country.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
In 1900,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
the Eight-Nation Alliance

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
was established in Beijing.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
After the establishment of the Eight-Nation Alliance,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Beijing signed the New Deal,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and the Qing Dynasty began

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
to reform the modern country.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
At that time,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
the modern country reform

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
was to transform Chinese law

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
into Western modern law.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The origins of the Eight-Nation Alliance

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
can be traced back to the

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Ming and Qing dynasties

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
published in 1906.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
If you ask a student

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
of the Taiwan University Law Department

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
who is majoring in

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Law,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
he will use a classic textbook

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
written by Wang Zhejian.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Many of the citations in that textbook

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
are back to the Ming and Qing dynasties.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The Ming and Qing dynasties

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
were published in 1906.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
At that time,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
China had signed

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
an agreement with the United Kingdom

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and the United States.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
The agreement said

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
that China was about to

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
start legal and judicial reform,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and Western states

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
had to help it.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
If you helped,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
and later I succeeded in reforming,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
you would be expelled from foreign law.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
At that time,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
the United States was faced

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
with a new legal system

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
that needed to be improved

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
in order to improve

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Sino-US trade relations.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
On the other hand,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
China was about to start

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
legal and judicial reform.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
What if China really became

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
a modern civilized,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
three-powered court,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
using the same laws

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
as the U.S. or Taiwan?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
If the U.S. still uses

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
a three-powered,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
one-of-a-kind system,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
the U.S. established

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
the United States Court for China

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
in Shanghai in 1906.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
The U.S. sent

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
a graduate of Yale University

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
who was once the director

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
of the Philippine Procuratorate

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
to serve as a judge

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
and establish a modern court.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
The judge

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
did three things.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The first thing he did

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
was to declare that

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
the U.S. did not do anything

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
related to civil and commercial affairs.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
This was strange,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
because the U.S. business community

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
wanted him to deal with

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
some business cases and disputes.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Instead, he had to deal

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
with brothels and casinos.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
He felt that

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
many U.S. lawyers

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
had a bad image of the Chinese.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So he called all the U.S. lawyers

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
in Shanghai

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
for a legal exam.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
80% of the U.S. lawyers

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
failed the exam,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
which caused a great uproar.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
The U.S. lawyers

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
were not allowed to come

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
to the U.S. court.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
The next thing he did

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
was to sue the boss

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
of eight brothels

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and four casinos.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
In the past,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
the U.S. lawyers used

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
the original defense technique

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
to say that they were not U.S. citizens

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and that they were U.S. citizens.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
For example, he called

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
U.S. Consulates in Shanghai

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and asked them

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
if they had ever used

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
U.S. Consulates.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
He even asked

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
U.S. Consulates

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
to show their diplomatic documents

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
and ask them

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
if they had ever

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
filed a passport in the U.S. Consulate.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Some of them

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
even said

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
that the U.S. Consulate

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
was a legal vacuum

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
caused by U.S. law.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
This caused

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
a fierce uproar

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
among the U.S. community

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
in Shanghai.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
The U.S. lawyer

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
was impeached

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
and resigned a year later.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
The next U.S. lawyer

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
was not in charge anymore.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
In the future,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I think there are several

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
different types of

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
jurisdiction.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
This is common in the modern world.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
For example,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
if a Japanese

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and a Singaporean

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
sign a business contract,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
the law can be the law of New York.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
When there is a dispute,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
the law can be used in Paris

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
to solve the dispute.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I think the situation in the world

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
is similar to the past.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
There are many different types

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
of jurisdiction.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I think China in the 19th century

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
is a good place to develop theory.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
China has pushed the situation

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
to the extreme.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
For example,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
there are nine states in Tianjin.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
In Tianjin,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
there are ten laws

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
in the same city.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
There must be some

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
place to develop

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
theory and research.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Next,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I will talk about competition.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
We know that

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
in the age of globalization,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
manufacturers will look for

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
the place with the lowest cost

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
of the system.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
For example,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
the labor law is relatively loose,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
the salary is relatively low,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
or the environmental law is relatively loose.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
At that time,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
in China,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
there were more than 20 countries

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
with foreign jurisdiction.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
For example,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
there are nine states in Tianjin.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Is there any more theory

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
that can be developed?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Next,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
there are some foreign law in the modern world.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
For example,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
there is foreign law in Chongqing.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Is there any way

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
to push or deny

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the existence

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
of foreign law

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
from the implementation

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
of the actual system

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
The last point is

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
who benefits from foreign law?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
At that time,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
the United States had a very

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
intense backlash,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
which made it believe that

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
the United States should not

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
throw taxpayers' money

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
overseas for foreign law.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
In fact, the Americans have been

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
faced with the fact that

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
they can not manage

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
the situation of their citizens

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
in other countries.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
So they were impeached

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
and resigned.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Later, the judges also

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
continued to ignore these things.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Is there really benefit?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
For example, if the image of the United States

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
is so bad,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
if the court is not fair,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
the Chinese will resist your goods.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So it seems that foreign law

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
is not something that can be

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
implemented indefinitely.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
In addition to the law itself,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
there are many other factors to consider.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
In the first part,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
the teacher will ask you

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
to understand the content of the system

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and then think about

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
more theoretical and abstract

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
things with your eyes.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
So today I will briefly

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
report to you.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Please give me your advice.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Thank you.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I think today's lecture is really wonderful.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I really learned a lot.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
It's like a book.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I think it's pretty exciting.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Do you have any questions?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Please feel free to ask.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
If you can,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
please briefly introduce yourself

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
before asking questions.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Can I ask another question?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Welcome.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Sorry, the question just ended.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I'm afraid it will delay your time.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
If I ask you now,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
if we want

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
contemporary foreign law

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
to continue to exist,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
what do you think

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
is the best way

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
to defend it?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
What is the direction?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Why does contemporary foreign law

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
still need to exist?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
If I ask you to make

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
the strongest defense,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
what should it be?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Thank you.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I think it depends on

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
who you are talking to.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
For example,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
there are a lot of things

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
that are close to foreign law.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
For example,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
investment in heavy industry.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
What is investment in heavy industry?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
For example,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
a Singaporean came to Taiwan

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
to invest.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
He bought a piece of land.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
As a result,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
today our government

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
does not support

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
the acquisition of land.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
At this time,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
according to our domestic law,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
if he does not support

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
the acquisition,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
he thinks it is illegal.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Then he should be sued

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
by our administrative court.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
However,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
because we have an investment

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
guarantee agreement with Singapore,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
at this time,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
this Singaporean

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
did not support

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Taiwan's domestic law.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Instead, he sued

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
the World Bank's

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Investment Heavy Industry Center.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
This is a bit like

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
not being governed by the domestic court.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
We entrust him to a third party.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
In fact, foreign law

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
is entrusted to his motherland.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Of course,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
in Africa or some countries

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
where the law is not so stable,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
or you do not trust

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
the law or the court,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
you have to entrust

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
the solution of this dispute

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
to a fair institution

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
that you believe in.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Then this foreign law

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
will be meaningful.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So some people ask,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
because there used to be a theory

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
called the law and development theory.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
He believes that in the process

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
of capitalist development,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
good courts must be coordinated

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
to help each other.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Otherwise, there will be a lot of

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
commercial disputes in capitalism,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
and you need a good court to solve them.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Some people ask,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
why is the Chinese court

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
so biased?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Xi Jinping said that the court

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
should trust the party.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Everyone knows that

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Google sued Baidu,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and Baidu won.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Why is the development of

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Chinese capitalism so good?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Many people think that

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
the problem of foreign law

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
is not solved by the people's court,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
but you can entrust it to another

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
third party institution

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
that you believe in.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So I think that foreign law

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
can replace certain legal developments

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
at least in the commercial part,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
or the court is not so

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
healthy and credible.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
It can help attract investment

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
and people outside

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
can go to the court

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
with confidence.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
It can help attract investment

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
and people outside

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
can go to the court

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
with confidence.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
In terms of the form,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I don't think that

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
some countries

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
still have meat

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
or planets.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
In order to protect foreigners,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
in order to make foreigners

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
willing to invest in your country,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
in order to make foreigners

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
willing to travel to your country,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
in order to make foreigners

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
willing to travel to your country,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
you have to give them

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
some kind of protection of foreign law.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You can understand that.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
In fact, the most common foreign law

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
is applied to diplomats.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
If a diplomat breaks the law locally,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
he is not subject to the local laws

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and courts.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
This is part of the diplomatic privilege.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Of course, we believe that

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
there is still some foreign law

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
in respect of foreign history.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
But to me,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
it sounds like the reason

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
why foreign law should disappear.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
If in the ideal reality,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
we have a very fair third party,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
let's say it's a certain court

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
made up of 200 countries.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
If you want to deal with criminal matters,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
you can throw it to the criminal court.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
If you want to deal with civil matters,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
you can throw it to the civil court.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
This court can judge a person

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
fairly.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
For example,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
if a Singaporean comes to Taiwan

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
and does something similar,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
we don't need

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Singapore's foreign law

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
or Taiwan's foreign law in Taiwan,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
right?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I understand

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
why

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
the two questions are not interrelated.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Let's go back to

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
the definition of foreign law.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
In fact,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
when we talk about

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
foreign law,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
it means that foreigners are not

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
privileged by the local

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
legal courts.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
But it is not necessarily

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
in accordance with

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
the law of his motherland

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
or the law of the third party

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
or the jurisdiction of the third party.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
So when I just answered,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I went back to the original definition

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
of foreign law.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
But what you just discussed

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
should be said

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
that today a person

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
is not privileged by the local

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
legal courts.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
But I don't think

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
all cases

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
can find

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
a fair third party.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I understand.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
For example,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
in the case of criminal law,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I have not received any

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
legal or historical training.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
In my imagination,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
for example,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
if the British

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
come to Taiwan to commit a crime,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and then you want to say that

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
we British should have foreign law,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
we want to introduce it back to

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
the British trial,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
it seems to prove

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
why the British return to

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
the British trial

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
is better than

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
the trial in Taiwan.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
One of the cases is

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
that the legal system

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
of some African countries

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
has been changed.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
It is not easy to prove

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
that your national

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
legal system is worse than mine,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
so it should be introduced

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
back to my own country.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Yes.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
There are some standards.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
For example,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
because European countries

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
have abolished the death penalty,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
it will not be introduced

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
into a country that will be sentenced

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
to death in Taiwan.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It is quite obvious

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
in some extreme examples.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
For example,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
if Lin Keying is a murderer in Taiwan today,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
because murderers in Taiwan

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
will be sentenced to death,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
so when she returns to the UK,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
the UK will not introduce her

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
back to Taiwan.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
But this means that

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
the British have an assumption

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
that a country with a death penalty

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
or a death penalty

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
is a country with a death penalty.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
But I think this matter

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
also requires a process.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
If you want to have an extramarital law,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
you have to prove that

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
my legal system is better than yours.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
In some cases,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
this process may be easier,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
but in some cases

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
it may not be so easy.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Of course,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
now it happens

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
whether it is easy or not.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
If I don't want to give you a death penalty,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
you have to ask yourself

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
how strong or how weak

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
your country is.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
You have to ask yourself

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
whether you are strong

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
in international negotiations.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I used to think

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
that I could not prove

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
that extramarital law

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
is inefficient

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
in the way of economics.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
This is one of the things

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I might want to do in the future.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I think there are several levels of problems.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
The first one is whether

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
extramarital law is inefficient.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Extramarital law will cause

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
legal vacuum.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Legal vacuum is like

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Shanghai in the early 20th century.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
No one can do anything.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
This is what we don't want to see.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
From this perspective,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
extramarital law is inefficient.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
On the other hand,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
many extramarital laws

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
are competing in good systems.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
For example,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Tianjin is divided into

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
ten land laws.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Is it because everyone

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
wants to create a better land law,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
so Tianjin's land

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
is better or worse now?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Extramarital law may be efficient,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
but it may also

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
have other social norms

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
or social norms.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
For example,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
if you are too good

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
to your own country,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
you will be restricted.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
In the future,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I want to build a theory

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
that extramarital law

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
is inefficient or

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
has some advantages

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
and some disadvantages.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Or it has some

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
more important social norms

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
behind it.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I can also

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
make a point about this.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
For example,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
a country like the United States

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
sometimes

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
doesn't care

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
how much money

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
is worth.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
For example,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
if it happens between

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
China and the United States,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
the Americans think

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
this person must be extradited

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
or he may be treated

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
unfairly in China.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
In this case,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
the economic calculation

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
becomes very complicated.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But the Americans think

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
this $10 million is to

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
buy our face,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
so even if it is $100 million

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
or $100 million,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I should do it.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Of course,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
each case has its own considerations.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
However,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I think the extramarital law

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
in the end of the 19th century

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
or the beginning of the 20th century

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
is a more transparent case.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Of course,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Wang Dan was taken to the United States

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
from Qinchen Prison to Harvard to study PhD.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I believe this must have

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
his diplomatic image

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
or American idealistic

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
diplomatic policy considerations.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
However,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I think that

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
the extramarital law

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
in the end of the 19th century

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
is a good example

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
to respond to the issue

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
of institutional competition

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
or institutional competition

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
in the United States.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
For example,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
most American companies

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
are located in Delaware,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
which has the best

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
company law.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
However,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
is it really efficient

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
for each state

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
to adopt different

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
legal systems?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
To me,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
this is still

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
a question

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
that needs to be answered.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Thank you for your answer.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Thank you.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I have a question.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
I'm not sure

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
if it's too early

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
or not.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
If

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
the audience

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
at the scene

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
can leave

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
if there is a problem,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
the recording will continue

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
if the audience

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
can leave

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
if there is a problem.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
If you want to follow

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
the Q&A,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
you can watch the video later.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
If you can leave

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
now,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
you can continue

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
the Q&A.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I have two questions.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
The first one

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
is probably answered.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Let me ask you

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
one more time.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
The second question is

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
basically

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
a legal study.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Since it's a legal study,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
my understanding is

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
that it's a principle.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
We start from the principle

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
and discuss it.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
However,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
from another perspective,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
it's a very political

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
and valuable act.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
It's a diplomatic act.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I can give credit to others

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
to strengthen my control

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
or dominance over others.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
What do you think

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
about the economic

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
and diplomatic aspects

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
of extramarital law?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
You've answered a part of the question.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
This is my first question.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
My second question

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
is about

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
extramarital law.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
There is a word called

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
external.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
There are internal and external.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
How do you define

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
extramarital law?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Who is my citizen?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Who is not my citizen?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Who is my country?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Who is not my country?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Do you think

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
extramarital law

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
is enforced

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
or dilutes

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
the definition of a country?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Thank you.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
My first question

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
is

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
about extramarital law.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
You said that

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
extramarital law

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
is based on principles.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
For me,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
this is a more traditional

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
study of legal ethics.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
For example,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I have a theory

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
about what is justice

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
and what is fairness.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I have some principles

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and I apply them

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
in a logical way.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
This is a more empirical

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
study.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I hope to draw

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
some theories

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
or calculations

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
from the past

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
so that we can

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
have some new directions in the future.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
It is a more

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
social science method.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
There is a word

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
in mainland China

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
called social science law.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
In Taiwan,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I used to be an assistant

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
of Mr. Zhang Yong-cheng.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
He also published a book

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
called Social Science Law.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I think

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
from my point of view,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
any law

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
has politics in it.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
We cannot say

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
that the study of law

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
can be completely

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
excluded from

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
the diplomatic context.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
For me,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
the big question

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
in my study

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
is how the international law

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
can change the domestic politics.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
This is what I wrote

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
in my thesis.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
In 1945,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
the international law changed

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
the legal operation

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
and the domestic politics of the Republic of China.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I think

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
under the example of an

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
international law,

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
we should consider

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
the level of economics,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
politics,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and social science.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Under such conditions,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
how will it affect

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
the reasoning,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
logic,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
and interpretation of the law?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
What should we pay attention to

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
in the future

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
when there are

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
relevant systems

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
of international law?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I will try to convince him

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
that these are important backgrounds.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Your second question

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
is that

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I think in the near future,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
the international law

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
will certainly strengthen

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
the national boundary.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It is like

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
decoupling.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
For example,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
when foreigners enter Taiwan,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
they need to have

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
a negative vaccination certificate.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I do not need it

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
because I have a passport from the Republic of China.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
At this time,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
there is a difference

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
between you and me.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
If I see someone

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
who owes money like me

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
but he is subject to legal jurisdiction

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
and the law he uses is different,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
this kind of

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
internal and external distinction

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
will strengthen

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
our imagination

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
and views.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I think the international law

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
plays an important role

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
in the modernization

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
of China.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Thank you.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Thank you.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Thank you.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Do you have any questions?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I think

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
both the speech

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
and the Q&A are wonderful.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Thank you.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Excuse me,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
can I ask a question?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Go ahead.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I am from Indiana.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I am studying information science,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
which is the term used in Taiwan.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I have studied history,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
so I know a little bit about history.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I am curious about

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
legal pluralism and

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
international law.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Although there are

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
different contexts,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
for example,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
in the past,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
the rule of law

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
of the colonial motherland

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
was different but equal.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
In fact,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
it is not equal.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Is there any possibility

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
that the same concept

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
exists in the dispute

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
of international law?

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Is it the same

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
as the rule of law?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
If I remember correctly,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
it is the same as the rule of law.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
There are many questions.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
The first one is

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
the dispute between the rule of law

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and the national security law.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
In fact,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
not only China implemented

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
the national security law in Hong Kong,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Taiwan also discussed

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
whether to implement a national security law.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
It may already exist,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
but I wonder

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
if there is a common origin

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
or a common core

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
in the dispute.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
The last one is

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
if you know that

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
you have to study history for seven years,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
do you still want to study

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
a doctor of law?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
After you finish studying history,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
you can teach me in the history department.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Do you think that

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
the law history of the U.S.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
is a more

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
inclusive direction

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
under the system

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
of the U.S. Law School?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
There are many questions.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
You can pick the key answer.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Thank you.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
The first one is

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
the issue of multilateralism

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
and colonization

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
of the United States.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
The term

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
multilateralism

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
originated

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
from the study

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
of the Great British Empire.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
The Great British Empire

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
was famous

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
for its

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
high regard

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
for local officials

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
in every colony.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
In 1895,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
when the Japanese ruled Taiwan,

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
they did not use the Japanese Civil Code

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
or the Civil Code.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Taiwanese used old customs.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It was not until 1900

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
that it became a local colonization.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
The recent study of the empire

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
in the history department

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
is very popular.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
It re-evaluates

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
the methods of governance

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
of the previous empires,

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
such as Rome and China,

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
to see whether

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
the British Empire

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
did the same thing.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
The British Empire

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
was well-known

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
for its multilateralism.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
In Hong Kong,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
it used the old customs

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
as a part of the United States' law.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
My main question is

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
whether there is

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
such a situation

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
in the history department.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I think

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
foreign law

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
gives people

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
an impression that

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
foreign law is biased.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
However,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
foreign law

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
seems to cause

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
people to use

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
different laws

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
to achieve

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
unequal results.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Yes,

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
this is our impression

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
of foreign law.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
However,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I am not sure

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
about this.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Last December,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I went to

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
the Second National Archives

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
in Maryland.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
There were 10 boxes

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
of documents.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
One of the things

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I want to do

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
is to look through

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
these documents

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
and do some coding

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
and quantification analysis

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
to see whether

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
foreign law

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
is biased against Americans.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I don't think

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
there is such a situation

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
in Shanghai.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I think

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
this is a matter

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
of fact.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
We need more evidence.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
The second question is

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
why it was in 1868.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I think

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
the Tongchi Restoration

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
was established

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
by the

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Tongchi Center.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
After the Fourth War,

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
it sent more students

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
to Europe and America.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
They began to

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
learn more about

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
the concept of

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
sovereignty and

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
modern international law.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
They realized that

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Europeans used

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
the label

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
of an uncivilized country

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
to label China.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
The first person

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
who opposed it was

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Guo Songtao.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
He went to Europe

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
and became

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
a member of the

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Tongchi Restoration.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
There were many

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
religious crimes.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
One of the crimes

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
was that Chinese people

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
destroyed churches

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
and killed missionaries.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Why did this happen?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
In many cases,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
it was because

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
a Chinese person

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
believed in Christianity.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
The missionaries

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
applied for foreign passports.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
For example,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
British and French passports.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Later,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
many Chinese people

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
enjoyed foreign law

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
and committed crimes.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
This led to dissatisfaction

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
among the local people.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
The grassroots people

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
began to think that

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
there was a lot of

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
injustice in it.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
If you look at the documents

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
of the Xiamen Consulate,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
you can see that

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Taiwanese also enjoyed

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
foreign law in China in 1895.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Many people

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
from Chaozhou

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
went to Singapore

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
and obtained passports

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
from the British Empire.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
When they came back to China

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
to do business,

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
they advocated foreign law.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Many defendants

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
are still being investigated.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
What is their intention?

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Isn't it normal for a person

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
to have two passports?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I don't understand

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
why so many Taiwanese

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
have two passports.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
If everyone in Taiwan

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
has foreign law,

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
how can he have foreign law?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Next,

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
the issue of national security law

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
and foreign law.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
As I mentioned earlier,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I think Hong Kong

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
is like a

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
legal multidimensional state

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
to the People's Republic of China.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
However,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
it is a problem

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
whether a modern country

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
can tolerate

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
legal multidimensionality.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I think the common cause

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
is to expand

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
the judicial sovereignty

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
at the core of a sovereign state.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Therefore,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
there are many exceptions

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
in the national security law.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
For example,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Taiwan's jurisdiction

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
and so on.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
This is an interesting question.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I haven't figured it out yet.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I will share the results

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
with you later.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
I'm looking forward to it.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
The last one is

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
about teaching.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
This is an interesting question.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I'm studying

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
the history of Sino-US relations,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
but it doesn't mean

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I'm going to teach Sino-US relations

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
in law school.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
For example,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
a well-known American

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
tax law teacher

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
teaches law school

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
in Michigan.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
He is a Harvard History PhD

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
and a Harvard JD.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
PhDs need to have

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
academic training,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
such as writing papers

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
and publishing papers,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
and have a good background in knowledge.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
In the end,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
what you teach in law school

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
actually depends on

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
the field of representation

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
when you apply for a job.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Of course, it is difficult

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
to find a good teacher

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
in law school.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
In fact,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
American law schools

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
are very special.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
In history,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I know that

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
a law school

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
rents a whole hotel

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
in Washington DC

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
every December,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
and 200 law schools

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
in the United States

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
recruit new teachers.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So every year,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
there is a shortage of

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
law school teachers.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I heard that

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
there is a teacher

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
who has never been

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
fully recruited

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
in the United States.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I read a lot of

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
tax law books

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
because I thought

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
it would be easier to find a job

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
in law school.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
In fact,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
law school teachers

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
are very realistic.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
If you want to be fully recruited,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
your CV must be

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
in a fixed format.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
In the Northwest,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
a law school teacher

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
told me that

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I should print out

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
the blank form of my CV

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
and put it under my desk.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Every year,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I should reflect on

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
which part of my CV

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
that I should print out.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
So,

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
after reading for so long,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
should I continue to read?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
In fact,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
most people suggest

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
that I should finish

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
my 5-year history course

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
and finish my PhD

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
by the fifth year.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I should finish my PhD

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
by the seventh year

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
and finish my PhD

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
by the eighth year

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
and finish my PhD.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
In the U.S.,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
if you want to teach

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
in a law school,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
you need two years of experience.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
So, I should graduate from J.D.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
and become a lawyer in the U.S.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
and then apply for a job

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
in a law school.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Law school teachers

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
apply for a job

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
before 40 years old.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
So, I should finish my PhD

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
and become a lawyer

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
so that I can apply for a job in a law school.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
That's all.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Thank you so much.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Thank you.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
But,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
there is an interesting point.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Why are tax lawyers always dissatisfied?

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Because

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
tax lawyers in the U.S. make a lot of money.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
After being a tax lawyer for two years,

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
many people don't want to come back

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
to apply for a job.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
They make a lot of money.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
After all,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
a tax lawyer needs two years of experience.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
So,

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
the more money you make, the less people want to apply for a job.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
That's true.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Just like C.S. is always looking for a teacher.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
That's right.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
And,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
C.S. doesn't force you to have a lot of experience.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
In law school,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
you need to be a lawyer for two years before applying for a job.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
So, some people are very happy

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
and apply for a job right away.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
It's like your love for law school.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Law school is your true love.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
That's right.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Because of time constraints,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
as a host,

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I'd like to ask C.S.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
for a final answer.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Because this is a projectile speech,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
whether it's

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
the audience

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
here today or

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
in the future,

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I guess most of the people watching this video

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
are Taiwanese.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I'd like to ask C.S.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
to tell us

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
about your research

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
and how you connect with people

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
from different backgrounds

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
and fields.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Okay.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I think

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Taiwan is Taiwan,

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
but it's different

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
from China.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I think

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
the legacy of the Republic of China

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
has a great impact,

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
especially on the law.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Our Civil Law and Criminal Law

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
were established during the administration period.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
The main purpose of the Civil Law

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
and Criminal Law in Taiwan

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
at that time was to complete

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
the modernization of the law

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
and abolish foreign law.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So we still have a lot of legacy,

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
such as the LinkedIn case

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
or the Judiciary.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I always think

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
that we need to understand

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
the law of the Republic of China

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
in the mainland

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
in order to better understand

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
the law we use in Taiwan.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
You need to understand

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
why the Republic of China

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
has such a law,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
and its bigger background

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
is the contact

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
between the Qing and the West.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
From a legal perspective,

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
the biggest problem

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
is that the Qing Empire,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
the Beiyang Government,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
and the Communist Party of China

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
all want to abolish

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
foreign law.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
However,

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
because of this political context,

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
we have a lot of misunderstandings

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
about foreign law

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
and a lot of democracy.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
So I think

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
this kind of research

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
can be done

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
and we can

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
reflect on

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
what it means to us,

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
develop more theories,

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
take off our democracy glasses,

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
and re-understand

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
the background of the law

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
we use in Taiwan.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I think

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
this is what I want to do.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I think it's super exciting.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
As someone

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
who used to teach

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
at a law school,

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
now I'm a PhD student

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
in different fields

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
of law.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I'm looking forward

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
to your future

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
in history,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
and your

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
PhD career.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I also hope that

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
you can overcome

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
your eight-year PhD life

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
and get two J.D. and Ph.D.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
and become

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
the first person

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
at a law school.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Thank you for your time today.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
I'm going to end

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
the meeting now.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
After the recording,

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
you can share your thoughts

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
with your friends and family.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Welcome, Mingxi.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
We look forward to your research.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Thank you, Yiyan.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Thank you.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Bye-bye.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I'm going to end the meeting now.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
After the recording,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
you can share your thoughts

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
with your friends and family.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Thank you, Yiyan.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Bye-bye.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Thank you, Yiyan.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Bye-bye.
