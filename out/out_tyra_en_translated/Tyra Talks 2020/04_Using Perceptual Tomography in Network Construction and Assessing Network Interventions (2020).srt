1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
OK, thank you all for participating in our speech today, I am the host today, Zhang Yanping, I represent everyone with a warm applause to welcome our speaker today, Li Xuanwei teacher, Li Xuanwei teacher, OK, are you shooting yourself?

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:58,960
OK, before I introduce Mr. Xuanwei, let me tell you about some of the events of today's housekeeping, because later when the speaker is speaking, his screen will be a projection of his own projection, so he may not be able to see the dialogue window, if you have any questions, if you want to stick to the dialogue window, if you do not know what the dialogue window is,

3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:25,960
now everyone on the right hand side of the BlueJeans may be able to see a row of the audience, and then the second option chat can type, basically a chat window, if you have any questions, you can stick there, but because the speaker will not see, because he is looking at the powerpoint, so if you leave a message, it does not matter, everyone will leave, and then I will find a place to ask questions in time,

4
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:52,960
either to ask for everyone's behalf, or you can ask yourself, but just stay there, and then I will help the speaker to see, and then I will listen to the speaker today, this time is about 40 to 45 minutes, he will talk so much content, and then there will be 15 to 30 minutes of Q&A time in the back.

5
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:22,920
OK, so these are housekeeping, and then let me introduce today's speaker, I just said that Mr. Xuan Wei, he is called Li Xuan Wei, today's speaker is called Li Xuan Wei, and then his university is in the Taiwan University Department of State, and then he went to Zhengda Yingshu to read the master's degree, and then after reading the master's degree, his doctorate is in UNC,

6
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:34,920
the Department of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina, and then the specialized topic is Complex Network, and the topic of Social Network.

7
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:49,920
OK, after completing his doctorate in 2016, he went to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to do postdoc, and did it until 2018. Oh, by the way, if I say something wrong, you can correct me directly.

8
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
No, this is all public information.

9
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
OK, thank you.

10
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
I actually saw it on your website.

11
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:19,920
OK, and then after finishing the postdoc, in 2019, he returned to Taiwan and started his career as an assistant professor and assistant researcher at NTU Politics, NTU Society, and NTU Central Academy of Sciences until now.

12
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Your position should be in NTU Central Academy of Sciences, right?

13
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Yes.

14
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:34,920
In NTU Central Academy of Sciences, however, there are also students and teachers, and often come and go, on both sides.

15
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,920
In NTU Central Academy of Sciences, Wayne is in the Society, and part of NTU is NTU Politics and Social Peace.

16
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:51,920
OK, this is the background of today's speaker.

17
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,920
A fun fact is that Wayne likes to eat strawberry cake.

18
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
You have to laugh out loud.

19
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
That's right, I can testify.

20
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Didn't you get muted?

21
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Actually, this is what we are talking about.

22
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,920
I don't know if he really likes to eat strawberry cake, but if you buy him a strawberry cake, he will be very happy.

23
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,920
OK, let's leave today's event to Wayne.

24
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Let him introduce the topic to everyone.

25
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Let me clap on behalf of everyone again.

26
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,920
OK, thank you Wayne for the introduction.

27
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,920
I am very happy to be able to come to Terra today to share some of the research I did before.

28
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:50,920
It is also a fun fact that Wayne invited me to give a speech about two or three months ago.

29
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,920
I have heard of Terra before, and now I am very happy to have the opportunity to give a speech here.

30
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,920
It is quite related to Wayne.

31
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,920
We all graduated from UNC Chapel Hill, and we are still colleagues at the Central Academy of Sciences.

32
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
We also wrote an article together.

33
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I don't know where the article will be posted.

34
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,920
But I think the world is very small.

35
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,920
We have been in UNC Chapel Hill for three or four years.

36
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I didn't expect to come back to Taiwan and still be in the same place, which is the upper and lower floors.

37
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
I can still write articles now.

38
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
So things are hard to predict.

39
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,920
There are also many cross-field collaborations now.

40
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Maybe I will share my research here.

41
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Maybe everyone here has a degree or is studying for a degree.

42
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Maybe you are interested after seeing it.

43
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Maybe we can also start some cross-field cooperation in the future.

44
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,920
The time I want to share today is about 45 minutes.

45
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,920
It may be about 11 o'clock in Taiwan time.

46
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,920
I will stay for about 15 to 30 minutes to discuss with you.

47
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,920
If you have any questions, you can come here to discuss.

48
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Although I see 56 pages here, I should say that many of my videos are relatively fast.

49
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Because this is a compilation of two articles.

50
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,920
What I want to share today is within two articles.

51
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,920
So if you are interested, you can go directly to see the two articles.

52
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Whether it is model setting or mathematical inference, I only introduce the concept of these articles to everyone.

53
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,920
If you are interested, you can find articles to read directly.

54
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:43,920
You are welcome to ask questions, discuss, or write to me after reading the article.

55
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I am looking forward to interacting with everyone.

56
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Okay, let me start by introducing the title of this article.

57
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,920
The title of this article is ...

58
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,920
I have just been responded by two friends that my title is too long and I do not understand.

59
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,920
So I will slowly talk about what this title means.

60
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Using Perceptual Tomography

61
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,920
We want to use something called Perceptual Tomography.

62
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Perceptual is a perceptual thing.

63
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Tomography is a segmented scan.

64
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
We will see later why we use the term Tomography.

65
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Of course, we are not really using segmented scanning to do social science research.

66
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,920
We use this Perceptual Tomography to define later.

67
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
We want to build a network.

68
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
It is a subjective network.

69
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,920
It is not a traditional social network built by the majority of people.

70
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,920
It is a third-party recognition.

71
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
What should this group look like?

72
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
We ask other people.

73
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
We ask some people on the Internet.

74
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Do you think that A and B are related?

75
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,920
If A and B are related, are they close or do not know or are not familiar?

76
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Use this third-party recognition to restore a network.

77
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
It is the same as a general social network.

78
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
I am talking about the Internet and the Internet.

79
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Sociologists like to talk about the Internet.

80
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Maybe other field scientists like to talk about the Internet.

81
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
But it is the same.

82
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,920
We use this third-party recognition to restore a network.

83
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,920
We can try to compare this network in the future.

84
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:23,920
The way to restore the Internet is different from the traditional social network that everyone likes to use.

85
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,920
The second part is that we want to see if we are in a network environment.

86
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Do some intervention in the network environment.

87
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
This intervention may be some policy promulgation.

88
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Or what we are talking about here is a policy promulgation that promotes public health.

89
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,920
We want to measure how effective this intervention is.

90
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Can we use quantification to see how effective it is?

91
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,920
It is in a social network environment.

92
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
We can only find some people to participate in this intervention.

93
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
It's like giving them some public health education.

94
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,920
But we want to know if these interventions have spread out.

95
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,920
We want to see how effective it is in a community level network.

96
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Can we quantify it?

97
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
So this is probably the meaning of this topic.

98
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Then I will continue to go down.

99
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,920
This is the outline of today's speech.

100
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
I still divide it into three parts.

101
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,920
The first part is because I received a letter.

102
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I want to know that this may have nothing to do with the speech.

103
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,920
He wants to know why I went from mathematics to sociology.

104
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,920
So I will spend about five minutes to talk about what I am doing during my doctorate.

105
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,920
I originally studied mathematics as introduced by Yanping.

106
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Then I turned to sociology.

107
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,920
I want to talk about the turning point in the middle.

108
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
So it will take about five to ten minutes.

109
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,920
The remaining two parts are the introduction of two articles.

110
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,920
The first part is how to go from mathematics to social science.

111
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,920
So I want to talk about two concepts in this part.

112
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
The first is social dynamics modeling.

113
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
This is social dynamics.

114
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,920
How do we use modelization or form logic to study this matter?

115
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,920
We know that in the real world, there are actually a lot of interactions with people.

116
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Then it is very complicated, but it may be a lot of faces.

117
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Of course, there are ways to study this thing in various fields.

118
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Then we look at it from the perspective of mathematics and physics.

119
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,920
It is a very, very high-dimensional complex system.

120
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Because it interacts too much and has a lot of impact.

121
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Then the things you want to test can be infinite.

122
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
You can find things to test.

123
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
What should we do? How do we deal with this kind of thing?

124
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,920
We will try to model it.

125
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,920
The way to model is to do some simple simplifications.

126
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,920
You have to look at the most important thing in this system.

127
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,920
What are the driving forces that you care about?

128
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
We have to find it out.

129
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,920
The way we do it is to think of it as an atom.

130
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Economists may be called agents or social scientists may be called agents.

131
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,920
We use this very simple simplification to think of it as some examples with the same characteristics or agents.

132
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Then look at the interaction between these examples and agents.

133
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,920
At the same time, we also simplify a lot of things they can do.

134
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,920
For example, if it is an example, it may be left-handed or right-handed.

135
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,920
If it is an agent, it may be happy or unhappy.

136
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,920
This is a very simple two-point method, or it may be a lot of cutting.

137
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,920
We cut these examples.

138
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,920
If we present it in a complex system or on the Internet, it is a point.

139
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
We call nodes.

140
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
These nodes will have a state.

141
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,920
As I said, it may be a binary, or it may be a multi-state.

142
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,920
It may be that you are in a very bad mood today, and it is very good.

143
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:20,920
This kind of multi-state, or it may be continuous, may be a continuous change, may be a healthy state, may be a healthy state.

144
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Of course, it can also be multi-dimensional.

145
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,920
It depends on what you are interested in.

146
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,920
The other part we value is the structure of this system.

147
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,920
What kind of relationship do these people have with each other?

148
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,920
You can think of it as a social relationship, such as a family or a workplace.

149
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
You can also think of it as geographical.

150
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,920
It may be that if the distance between people is very close, there may be a risk of infectious diseases.

151
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,920
We have to look at these modes, these social networks, and the structure behind them.

152
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,920
How will it affect each of us in the above example or people?

153
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Of course, I listed some of the ways to form this structure.

154
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Systematic is that it has a system.

155
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
What we understand here is that it is determined.

156
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
It's like a person.

157
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,920
You may know that the grid has four neighbors.

158
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
It's like a barbecue net.

159
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
One person has about four neighbors.

160
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
This may be a systematic network.

161
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Or random.

162
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,920
You may have heard of a very simple random network model.

163
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,920
In the system, any two people have a certain probability of being linked together.

164
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Or heterogeneous.

165
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
It may be heterogeneous.

166
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Every point has a different way of being linked together.

167
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Or it can also change over time.

168
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,920
We can study the dynamic system or time series of this system that changes over time.

169
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Our new method is to build a simplified model in this complex system.

170
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,920
But this simplified model has to be able to capture one or two key things that we are most interested in.

171
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,920
As Einstein said, a model should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.

172
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,920
We have to simplify it to the point where we can no longer simplify it.

173
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:14,920
The tool I use is the network theory in the complex system.

174
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Network theory is a method of expression.

175
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
It is also a method of learning.

176
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
It is different from the previous research.

177
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,920
It is an interaction phenomenon that attaches more importance to the medium-length.

178
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
What is medium-length?

179
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,920
It is a length between micro and macro.

180
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:42,920
At the macro level, you can see all people as being able to interact with others.

181
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,920
For example, in a group, we see that everyone is the same.

182
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Let's say we have a class of students.

183
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Then we have to study how COVID-19 spreads in this place.

184
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Then we say that every student is the same.

185
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,920
And they can interact with other students at will.

186
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,920
This may be seen as a large group.

187
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,920
This is the macro level.

188
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
What about micro?

189
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Micro is another part of the macro.

190
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
It just sees everyone differently.

191
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,920
You have to emphasize that its personal characteristics are like its height, age and weight.

192
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
It may be different for everyone.

193
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,920
What we do at the network level is not this thing.

194
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
At the network level, we assume that everyone is the same.

195
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
Unless you want to eat different types of points.

196
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Of course, that can also be extended.

197
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
But our basic assumption is that everyone is the same.

198
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,920
What we care about is the structure of this system.

199
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Who has a connection with whom?

200
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Who will influence each other?

201
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Or who will get the message from which side?

202
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,920
So what we see is that the network is a medium-length research method.

203
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
It is between large and small.

204
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,920
The subject of my research is social networks.

205
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Of course, there are different kinds of social networks.

206
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Of course, there may be a lot of networks.

207
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:10,920
In the natural world, there may be biological networks, food chains, bacterial networks, or virus networks.

208
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,920
It may also be artificial, such as computer networks.

209
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Topology is how computers and birds are grouped together.

210
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Or triple-W network.

211
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Or some traffic networks.

212
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
In fact, there are many layers of network composition.

213
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
The main type of research I do is social networks.

214
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
What is the difference between social networks and other networks?

215
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Here I have listed three.

216
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
The first is that it has a phenomenon called homophily.

217
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Homophily is translated into Chinese as homogeneity.

218
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
You like people with the same characteristics as you.

219
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
You have this tendency.

220
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
You are also in a relationship with a person.

221
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
You would like to say that you are in a relationship with a similar person.

222
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
So it is a tree of spines.

223
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Or birds of a feather flock together.

224
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
This is the first phenomenon.

225
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
This may not be as common as other networks.

226
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
The second is high clustering.

227
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
What is the meaning of high clustering?

228
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
It is the ability to create or store data.

229
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
It can be classified as a network or a network.

230
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
It can be classified as a network or a network.

231
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
It can be classified as a network or a network.

232
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
The second is high clustering.

233
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
The second is high clustering.

234
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Watch out for'homoplasticity'.

235
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Watch out for'homoplasticity'.

236
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
It means that there may be many Gabrielian stars on the network.

237
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
It means that there may be many Gabrielian stars on the network.

238
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
What is small triangle?

239
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Devil's friends.

240
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
It may be that you know B.

241
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
B knows C.

242
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
If the two are in a strong relationship,

243
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
If the two are in a strong relationship,

244
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Usually there will be a relationship that is at least an identity of 3 to 4.

245
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Usually there will be a relationship that is at least an identity of 3 to 4.

246
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Therefore, in general social networks,

247
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Therefore, in general social networks,

248
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
abc is very rich in the network ratio.

249
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
abc is very rich in the network ratio.

250
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
abc is very rich in the network ratio.

251
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
abc is very rich in the network ratio.

252
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.

253
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.

254
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.

255
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
There are many such small triangles.

256
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
There are many such small triangles.

257
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Third, small world.

258
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Most of people may have heard of the principle of 6-degree approximation.

259
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Most of people may have heard of the principle of 6-degree approximation.

260
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
But in a system or in the world,

261
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
But in a system or in the world,

262
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
The distance between people may not be as far as you imagined.

263
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
The distance between people may not be as far as you imagined.

264
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
How?

265
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
How?

266
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,000
Influencers,

267
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,920
they come about 5 phase and 6 phase.

268
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,920
they come about 5 phase and 6 phase.

269
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Although they may not be aware of the shortest way,

270
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Although they may not be aware of the shortest way,

271
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
you can see the sky when you open your eyes.

272
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
you can see the sky when you open your eyes.

273
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
You and a person in Africa,

274
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.

275
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.

276
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.

277
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.

278
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.

279
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.

280
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
And that's why the world is much smaller than we thought.

281
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
And that's why the world is much smaller than we thought.

282
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
By small scale, I mean that your road is less long than you imagined.

283
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
By small scale, I mean that your road is less long than you imagined.

284
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
The way we talk here is the shortest way.

285
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
There are many shortcuts in the system.

286
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Make it very easy to get close to the goal.

287
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Make it very easy to get close to the goal.

288
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
And then we can see the state of the point.

289
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Let's take a simple example.

290
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Let's take a simple example.

291
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
You may see that your neighbor or friend

292
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
You may see that your neighbor or friend

293
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
has a high infectious disease.

294
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
has a high infectious disease.

295
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
People around him may need to stay away from him.

296
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
People around him may need to stay away from him.

297
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
You need to have social distancing.

298
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
You need to have social distancing.

299
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Or you let him be isolated.

300
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
If he is sick today,

301
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
If he is sick today,

302
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
this limit to his surroundings.

303
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
This limit to his surroundings.

304
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
the overlapping network will be significantly changing.

305
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
the overlapping network will be significantly changing.

306
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Because of the isolation,

307
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
for the time being, he has lost many connections.

308
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
His friends may have lost connections with his friend.

309
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
His friends may have lost connections with his friend.

310
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
His friends may find others to replace.

311
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Or he has more resources and more time for socializing.

312
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Or he has more resources and more time for socializing.

313
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
So when a person loses something,

314
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Or when a person loses something,

315
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
he is isolated,

316
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
But in society,

317
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
But in society,

318
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
there are many real-life information.

319
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
But we need to reverse the model.

320
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
But we need to reverse the model.

321
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
What is it?

322
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
What is it?

323
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
I don't know if it's a problem with engineering.

324
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
reverse engineering

325
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
or inverse problem

326
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
How can we measure

327
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
We want to know

328
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
how can we measure

329
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
So I'm going back to my model

330
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
I think the process is interesting

331
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
good

332
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
The first one I want to talk about is

333
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
indians

334
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
perceptual tomography

335
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,920
both of them

336
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
He is in the research

337
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Irish

338
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
aboriginal

339
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
He is looking for some

340
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
fishing village

341
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
some

342
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
small villages

343
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
That place

344
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
is Arab

345
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
them

346
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
That place is

347
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
next to the extreme

348
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
That is their Så

349
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Is long in summer

350
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Very short in winter

351
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Maybe one or two months

352
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Can't see the sun

353
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
That

354
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Our team

355
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
I did not go

356
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
But we have some

357
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Humanists

358
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Squatting there

359
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
They are there

360
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Visit these American aborigines

361
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Looking at their social network

362
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Just ask

363
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Who are you familiar with

364
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Then who is familiar with who

365
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
That

366
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
And some of them

367
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Psychological research

368
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
because

369
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
We know that

370
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
People near the extreme

371
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Their alcoholism rate is high

372
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Then their

373
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
The suicide rate of adult males is high

374
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
So we want to see

375
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
These

376
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Some negative features

377
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Or healthy behavior

378
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
He will

379
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Will it be affected by his social network

380
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Or will he turn around

381
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
To affect his social network

382
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
So we are from

383
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Humanists squatting to get information

384
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
To build a social network

385
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Then look again

386
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
It's them

387
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
The health behavior of these people

388
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Or some other behaviors

389
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
Like these people

390
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
Is there any resource

391
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Willing to help others

392
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Or

393
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Willing to provide other people with knowledge

394
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
We look at it from the perspective of social networks

395
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Look at the behavior of these people

396
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
it is good

397
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
The first thing to do

398
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
It's us

399
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Of course it is

400
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Get these people's network

401
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
We just ask

402
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Who are you friends with

403
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,920
How familiar are you with him

404
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Then this is usually

405
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
It's the way sociologists do it

406
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
In fact, social networks

407
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
From the perspective of sociologists

408
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
They started doing it very early

409
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Started doing it in the 1930s

410
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
They will draw a social graph

411
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
They asked a person

412
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Who are you familiar with

413
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Who is not familiar with

414
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
That

415
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Of course we did this part

416
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
The other way we did

417
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Is we want

418
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Look at it by sampling

419
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Can I just draw

420
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
In this village

421
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Maybe a part of the hundreds of people

422
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Maybe 5%

423
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
Maybe 10%

424
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Or 30%

425
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
If we only draw a part of the people

426
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Then we ask him

427
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Hey, you think

428
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Who is familiar with whom in this network

429
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Can we restore the entire network

430
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I don't ask everyone

431
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Who is he familiar with

432
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
And just do sampling

433
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
If you draw a sample

434
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Can you restore the entire network

435
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
But this may not be the same

436
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Because if you draw a sample

437
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
You may find people

438
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
He is to guess

439
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Other people's networks

440
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
He is

441
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
He is a subjective recognition

442
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Other people's

443
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Exchange status or relationship status

444
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Then we want to compare

445
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Is the difference between these two networks

446
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
One is your subjective

447
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Your own report

448
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
For example, I am with A or B

449
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
I am with these two people

450
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Who is a friend

451
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Who is not a friend

452
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Another angle is

453
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
The angle we use here is

454
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
I went to see

455
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
The first three people

456
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Then I went to see if they had a relationship

457
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
If there is a relationship

458
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
I report

459
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
If it doesn't matter

460
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
I also said they had nothing to do with it

461
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
So what we rely on is

462
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Third party report

463
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
That third party report

464
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
He can tell us

465
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Okay, these people are related

466
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Or these people have nothing to do with it

467
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
He may be

468
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Presence or absence of individual properties

469
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
And pairwise relationships

470
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
So he can tell us

471
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
These people are related or not

472
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
That

473
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
According to this third party report

474
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,920
We can build a network with direction

475
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
There are positive and negative networks

476
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,920
The positive network is the general social network

477
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
He is

478
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Two have a relationship

479
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Give him a positive connection

480
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
If it is a negative network

481
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
The two should have nothing to do with it

482
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
We'll give him a negative connection

483
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
And this negative connection is that we believe

484
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
These two people

485
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
From the perspective of the third party report

486
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
They should be relatively unrelated

487
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
So we call it robust

488
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
They don't have that

489
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Connection

490
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Okay, so this is how we do it

491
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,920
It's actually like I just said

492
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
We're on a network

493
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
We want to do sampling

494
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Of course, there are many ways to do it

495
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
I have a few here

496
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Like Respondent-Driven Sampling

497
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Snowball Sampling

498
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Or Convenient Sampling

499
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Or Web-based Sampling

500
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
It's all a way of sampling

501
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
So our way of sampling is

502
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
We are

503
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Uh, invite people to participate in the study

504
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
We're a little bit like a convenient sample

505
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
And then let these people come

506
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Provide them with their knowledge

507
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Of course

508
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Of course there will be some

509
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Problems with, uh, we're going to deal with

510
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
The first one is us

511
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Uh, it could be incomplete data

512
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
It's just that he might

513
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,920
Uh, this guy, he's coming to us

514
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Say he recognizes the social network

515
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
Maybe there is

516
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
There may be insufficient information

517
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
This person doesn't know

518
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Uh, I, we asked him

519
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Does D have anything to do with E?

520
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
He may not be familiar with D and E

521
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
He may not know

522
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Does D have anything to do with E?

523
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Or he may report errors

524
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Is that maybe

525
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
D and E have nothing to do with it

526
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
And then from the third party's point of view

527
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
He may be related

528
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Or he may be tired

529
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
He may have done too many of these questions

530
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Then his quality of information

531
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Or the concentration dropped

532
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
He might give us some wrong information

533
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
The other one we face

534
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
The main risk is

535
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Everyone's perception may be much worse

536
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
So this kind of information may be

537
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
There is a lot of this variability

538
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Then we have to deal with these problems

539
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Okay, so what we're going to do is

540
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Why are we called

541
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Perceptual Tomography

542
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
Tomography is a segmented scan

543
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Is that you see a object

544
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Then you can go from different angles

545
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
To do projection on it

546
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Then what you see may be different

547
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
So you see this object in the middle

548
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
It has four entities

549
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Then you cut from the angle of S1 and S2

550
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
It has two different pictures

551
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Then look at it from the angle of P

552
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
It also has different pictures

553
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
What we want to say

554
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
What we want to say is

555
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
In our hearts

556
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Uh, we might be in this system

557
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
There is a possible

558
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Real social network

559
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
A and B are related

560
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
B and C are familiar

561
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Then A and C do not know

562
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
This kind of real social network is this

563
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
We see these four objects

564
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
It is real

565
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
but

566
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
No one knows

567
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
What does this real network look like

568
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
It's a bit like blind imaging

569
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,920
You just look at it from a certain angle

570
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
What you see is what you imagine

571
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
So what we're going to do is

572
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Find a lot of people to see this thing

573
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
See what this social network looks like

574
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Look at it from different social positions

575
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Or look at it from different angles of the Internet

576
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
What does this object look like

577
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Then look at it

578
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Can we finally restore

579
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
The social network in everyone's mind

580
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
But this social network

581
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
It may be with

582
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Uh, the real social network is not very similar

583
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
One is subjective construction

584
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
One is a collective subjective construction

585
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
This is our current way

586
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
He is one

587
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Uh, a more subjective objective report

588
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Because this is my own subjective

589
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Okay, I'm with A

590
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
With A, with C, with D

591
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
This kind of subjective objective report

592
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
Then we want to compare these two ways

593
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
What's the difference in the network that was built

594
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Okay, so we're going to, uh, find these, uh, in Alaska

595
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,920
These people in the village come to participate in our research

596
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Then, uh, everyone comes to invite us

597
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Uh, we were invited by us

598
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
He will go and see the photos of other people

599
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Let's say there are about 400 people in this village

600
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Then we will show him about 40 photos

601
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,920
Is a person to say

602
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Do you know these 40 people

603
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Can you call his name

604
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,920
Do you know the relationship between these 40 people

605
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,920
If you say these people don't know these 40 people

606
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
He might not judge

607
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
The social status of these people

608
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
If you know

609
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Let's see how we should go

610
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Sort out some of these people's social networks

611
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
See which people are more, uh, related

612
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Some people are more irrelevant

613
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Okay, so the way we use it

614
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
It's the way we use this

615
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,920
It's the way we put these people's photos

616
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,920
We invite the audience to put them in different baskets

617
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,920
What are the conditions in the basket

618
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,920
The condition in the basket is that the audience should think

619
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
These people are in the same group

620
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
He just put it in the same basket

621
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,920
So, uh, let's say we give him five baskets

622
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,920
We later, uh, said, okay, so you

623
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Of these 40 people

624
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
You may know 30 of them

625
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
You put people you think are more familiar

626
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Put it in the same basket

627
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,920
If you think it's not familiar

628
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,920
You have to separate these people into different baskets

629
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,920
So this is the main way we use

630
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
We give different people

631
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Is to look at different 40 photos

632
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
And then ask them to put them in different baskets

633
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Okay, so, uh, what are our advantages

634
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
The advantage is that this method is very fast

635
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Is that we show them

636
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
A small part of the group

637
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Maybe 40 photos out of 400 people

638
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Then we don't have to let him judge

639
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Two out of 400 people

640
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Because that judgment doesn't matter

641
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,920
The function of the human brain processing capacity

642
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
Probably not so strong

643
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Then we only show him a small part of the paper collection

644
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
These social relations

645
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Then again, uh, he

646
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,920
It can be used in some, uh, more large-scale data collection

647
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Because we actually don't have too much burden on people

648
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
If this group is hundreds of people

649
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Uh, or, uh, thousands of people

650
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
Maybe you can do that

651
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
What are his shortcomings

652
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,920
One of his shortcomings is, uh, like I just mentioned

653
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Is that everyone's perception may be much worse

654
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Or they may have some mistakes in the middle

655
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Is that he may know

656
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,920
What he knows is different from other people's subjective judgment

657
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Like me, I might know, uh, the first one

658
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,920
But I don't think there's a link between D and E

659
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
They know, but they don't know

660
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Maybe, but D and E

661
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Maybe they actually know each other

662
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
I might make a mistake

663
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
That's another one

664
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,920
I'm from a lot of different, uh, participants

665
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
To report the relationship between D and E

666
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,920
There may be a lot of, uh, contradictions

667
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Or it's inconsistent

668
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Inconsistency may be very high

669
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,920
We have to find a way to, uh, create a model

670
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,920
To deal with these problems

671
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Okay, so this is what we, uh, are doing

672
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
This real-life study

673
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,920
We have, uh, human scientists squatting

674
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,920
A few small villages in Alaska

675
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,920
Their characteristics are, uh, the summer sun is long

676
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Winter sun is short

677
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
And then, uh, there's a lot of pressure

678
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
And then the alcohol problem is a little serious

679
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
And then their, uh, income

680
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Uh, it's probably not very high

681
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
That's just the connection between people

682
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,920
It's very strong

683
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Okay, we, uh, we found a village

684
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
To do this, uh, real-life study

685
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,920
That village is probably, uh, about 400 people

686
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,920
And then they're about 95% American

687
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
That their median income

688
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
The median annual income is about $30,000

689
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
So it's just not very rich

690
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
So what we want to see is

691
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Some of their mutual help

692
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Who will provide help

693
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Who will get help

694
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
And their suicide prevention

695
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
It's just over there

696
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I just mentioned that his adult male suicide rate

697
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Will be higher than other regions

698
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
Then we want to look at suicide prevention

699
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,920
Then we invited, uh, 170 people to join us

700
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Our research is actually easy to adopt

701
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
That they're probably half of the people

702
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Maybe 40% of the people to join this study

703
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Uh, uh, this data collection process

704
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
It took about seven days

705
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
And then every, uh, participant

706
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
It only takes 10 to 20 minutes

707
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
To judge some of the relationships between people

708
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Then we give him $20 each time

709
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Then they have a fee

710
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Okay, so this is very similar to what I just introduced

711
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Once we show him 40 people

712
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Or photos

713
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Then he has to do three things, uh, three types

714
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
The first one is this person

715
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Uh, he's a victim or a participant

716
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
He knows and is familiar

717
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,920
The second person is this victim

718
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
He knows, but not necessarily

719
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
The third person he doesn't know

720
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Then we, because the third person

721
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
In fact, this person can't judge

722
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
He doesn't know him at all

723
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,920
So now we're looking at the first and the second

724
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
The first person is familiar

725
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
The second person is not familiar

726
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,920
The first kind of people are usually family members

727
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Is your parents or siblings

728
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,920
This person, the first class, is much less than the second class

729
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,920
Then we think the first class of information is too strong

730
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Then we only use the second class of information

731
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
We ask these participants

732
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
Only the second class of people you know

733
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
But not very familiar

734
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,920
And then we put these people's photos

735
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,920
And then let the participants, the victims, come to the five categories

736
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
In five boxes or buckets

737
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
That's what we told him

738
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
The same bucket of conditions

739
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
It's these people

740
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
You think he's in the same social group

741
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Or you think these people are familiar

742
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Okay, so we've done it

743
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Put one and two together

744
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Know very familiar

745
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
He knows and is not familiar

746
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
I've also done it, just put two

747
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,920
These two results are similar

748
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Okay, so we're still

749
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Uh, to these people

750
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
He also took some of his characteristics

751
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,920
It's like he's not going to do this

752
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
The community has positive contributions

753
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
It's A1

754
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Will he help young people?

755
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
It's A2

756
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
Does he have a drinking problem?

757
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
Or is he causing trouble?

758
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Or is he doing something bad?

759
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,920
So what we're looking at now is

760
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,920
How do we build this social network?

761
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
That's the main way we build it

762
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,920
It's based on these victims

763
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
To divide people into five groups

764
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
This way to build a social network

765
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Our starting point is like this

766
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,920
If there are a lot of people today

767
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,920
He put both of them in the same box

768
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,920
We have a high degree of certainty

769
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
We'll take it

770
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
I think these two people should be very

771
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
It should be very likely to know

772
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,920
It should be very likely to have this positive relationship

773
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
So if today

774
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
A lot of people report that these two people

775
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
It doesn't matter

776
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
We divide it into different boxes

777
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Then we have a lot of confidence

778
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Say these two people should have nothing to do with it

779
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
If it doesn't matter

780
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
We'll give him a negative tie

781
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Negative tie

782
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
It's not that they have hostility

783
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
It's that they are

784
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
We have a lot of confidence

785
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
They should have nothing to do with it

786
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
So we're going to build this

787
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
The basis of the judgment

788
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Okay, so we're going to talk about it

789
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,920
We take it as a random comparison

790
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
If you say two people

791
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
We'll see

792
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
People put

793
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Uh, two people in the same box

794
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
What is the probability?

795
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
It's completely random

796
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
How much

797
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
And then we see

798
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
He

799
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Two people are put in the same box

800
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
How much is it different from random

801
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
So we're going to have a

802
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
If there's a no model

803
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Let's look at this

804
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
And then there's some calculation

805
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Is that people really put this two people

806
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
The probability of putting the same box

807
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
The probability of putting two people in different boxes

808
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
We can use some

809
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
The combination of mathematical methods to calculate

810
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Calculate his odds

811
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
And this is a false assumption

812
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
We want to compare

813
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
A reference standard

814
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
So we're looking at

815
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
How far is he from this standard

816
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
The farther away

817
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
That means we're going to

818
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
This matter

819
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
These things

820
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
They should have something to do with it

821
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Or it shouldn't have anything to do with it

822
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
This judgment

823
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
It's going to be more and more intense

824
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
Okay, and then it's the same thing

825
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
That's what we're looking at

826
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
What's the probability

827
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
So let's look at this example

828
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
There are 393 people in this village

829
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
And we've got 172 people

830
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Experimental research

831
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
That we

832
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
This B is equal to 50

833
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
We let him put five boxes

834
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
That K is equal to 40

835
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
They look at 40 photos at a time

836
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
Gamma is equal to 0.76

837
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
They know 76% of them

838
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
On average, one person knows

839
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
Of the 40 people

840
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Maybe 76% of the people

841
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,920
So we're going to look at one

842
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,920
This is from a false assumption

843
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
A no model

844
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,920
That's what he is

845
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
What we're looking at is

846
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
5% of the end odds

847
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
If there are two people, three people, four people

848
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Here's a 1.61, 0.1, 0.01 percentage

849
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
If he falls in

850
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Uh, more than two people, more than three people

851
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
More than four people

852
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
If you put it in the same box

853
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
We think

854
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,920
These two people have a lot to do with it

855
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Because this is from no model

856
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Let's compare

857
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
Let's look at 5% of the end odds

858
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,920
A point

859
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
That this is

860
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
There are up to 5% of the end odds

861
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
If it's more than two people

862
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
If you put them in the same box

863
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
We think

864
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,920
These two people have a positive relationship

865
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,920
Okay, the same way

866
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,920
We can also make another version

867
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
No model is

868
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
How many people are there

869
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Put these two people in different boxes

870
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
We'll say

871
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
These two people should have nothing to do with it

872
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Then we still take 5% as an end point

873
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Start counting from the back

874
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
From six people, five people, four people, three people

875
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Stop

876
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
That's less than 5%

877
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
So if there are three people

878
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Put two people

879
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Maybe it's D and E

880
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Put it in different boxes

881
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
We'll think

882
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Okay, that's it

883
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
Uh, these two people

884
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
D and E should be

885
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,920
There is a significant relationship

886
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
Or a significant lack of knowledge

887
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Ah, that's it

888
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
This is what we just talked about

889
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Is that you take 5% as an end point

890
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
Or 5% as an end point

891
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Then use the way of building the network just now

892
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,920
You can build two networks

893
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
The first one is a network with a positive relationship

894
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
The positive relationship is black

895
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
The second is a network with a negative relationship

896
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
We use red to show the negative relationship

897
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
So these points are the same

898
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Then we can build

899
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
It has two symbol networks

900
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
One is a positive network

901
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920
A negative network

902
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Then we have some data on these networks

903
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
The data is that it has

904
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
These two networks actually look very similar

905
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
That's because there are some points

906
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,920
It's not drawn

907
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
So there are fewer points on the negative network

908
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Then its density is very similar

909
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Then its average distance is very similar

910
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
Then its centrality is very similar

911
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
These two networks actually look very similar

912
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Ok, then we can still follow

913
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,920
Ah, the positive network and the negative network characteristics just now

914
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Sort the network groups

915
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Ah, you may have heard of some

916
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Is to group the points of the network

917
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
What does grouping mean

918
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Grouping is

919
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Ah, if you see a network

920
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
It has a lot of connections within a group

921
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,920
If there are very few connections between groups

922
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Then the result of this grouping should be good

923
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Just like

924
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,920
Ah, you can use their department to group college students

925
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Or use their hospital to group

926
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,920
The connection between groups should be

927
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Much less than the connection between groups

928
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Much less

929
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
So we have this positive network

930
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
If you have a negative network

931
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
We think

932
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,920
A reasonable classification is a group

933
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,920
There should be a lot of positive connections in the middle

934
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,920
There should be a lot of negative connections between groups

935
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
So if we have a positive and a negative network

936
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
Then we can group

937
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Then let's see

938
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
The final grouping result will be the best

939
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Ah, here

940
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
Ah, it turns out that the result of grouping six groups is the best

941
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Its balance score is the lowest

942
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,920
The lowest means that its grouping effect is the best

943
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Then we divide these networks into six groups

944
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
Ah, after dividing into six groups

945
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
It probably looks like this

946
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Ah, then we can

947
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
To these groups

948
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
Describe some of the characteristics

949
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,920
Because we just said

950
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
We asked these people

951
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
Ah, what are the characteristics

952
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,920
He is willing to help others

953
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
Then he

954
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,920
Ah, will there be some alcoholism or suicidal tendencies

955
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
Then we will do it to these six groups

956
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
Ah, like using multinomial

957
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
To see what characteristics they have

958
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
We will find one

959
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,920
The largest group as the baseline

960
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,920
As a benchmark

961
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Look at the other five groups and the benchmark

962
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
What are its characteristics

963
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,920
Ah, the third category is the largest

964
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
The third group is the largest

965
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
Then we can

966
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,920
Give some connections to other groups

967
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,920
If there is help, give him some connections

968
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
The first group of people is him

969
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,920
Ah, if he finds his friend

970
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
Ah, make some trouble

971
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
The first group of people will help him

972
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Ah, here are some of the characteristics of each group

973
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
Some groups have no characteristics

974
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,920
Like the fourth group of people

975
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Maybe it's the same as the third group

976
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
It's not on this

977
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,920
Okay, so this, uh, this part

978
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,920
We just look at

979
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
Use a network sampling method

980
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Use a third party report

981
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,920
To restore a well-known mainstream network

982
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
Then we look at this network

983
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
Objective response

984
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
Say this person is my friend

985
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
This person is not my friend

986
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,920
What is the difference between this network

987
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,920
Then we found that this relationship

988
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,920
About 50%

989
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
As for

990
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
Ah, what are the reasons

991
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
What are the reasons that make a person more accurate

992
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,920
More accurate judgment

993
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,920
What are the reasons that make a person more inaccurate judgment

994
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
This is what we need to study later

995
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Then we also put these people

996
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Ah, some of his characteristics

997
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
Ah, find it out

998
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Then we also put this subjective network

999
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
Do some classification

1000
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
Okay, this one

1001
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
Um, the plan can be extended

1002
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Ah, some of the possibilities that can be extended

1003
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,920
We can change his

1004
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
Sample size

1005
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Is to change the proportion of his sample

1006
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Ah, or the number

1007
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Then we can change

1008
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
The number of boxes

1009
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
We all have to say

1010
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
These conditions will be

1011
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Ah, what kind of impact will we have on the final result

1012
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
That

1013
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
We have to compare again

1014
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
Our subjective social network

1015
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
With the general traditional

1016
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,920
What is the difference between everyone's social network

1017
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Some people can see it

1018
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Some people can't see it

1019
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
These are the things that need to be studied later

1020
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
That

1021
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
His way of research

1022
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,920
He can also be extended to other circumstances

1023
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
He doesn't have to be in a village

1024
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,920
He can be

1025
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
Ah, some small groups

1026
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,920
Just like a company or a university

1027
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,920
About hundreds of people

1028
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,920
Then you give a part of the people

1029
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,920
To participate in this

1030
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,920
Investigation

1031
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
Show him dozens of people's photos

1032
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Then let him do similar things

1033
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
But

1034
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
He has this extent of restriction

1035
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
He may be in a city

1036
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
There is no way to do this

1037
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
So we are probably a small group

1038
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
We can do similar things

1039
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Okay, this is the first one I want to talk about

1040
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
That second part is

1041
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,920
I want to measure

1042
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,920
In this network

1043
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
We do some intervention measures

1044
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
I want to judge this intervention measure

1045
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Is there any effect of external spread

1046
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Or this

1047
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
This intervention measure is actually useless

1048
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,920
He is

1049
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Better than we expected

1050
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Okay, this intervention measure

1051
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,920
Uh, his feature is that he has a social network behind him

1052
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
That is, we already know that these people

1053
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
What does the social network look like?

1054
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,920
This social network is different from the social network we just talked about

1055
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Not everyone

1056
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
The third party judges the subjective social network

1057
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,920
It is the social network reported by everyone

1058
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
We know these people

1059
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Under the social network

1060
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
We want to see

1061
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
For these people

1062
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,920
Willing to come

1063
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,920
Uh, maybe improve your own health behavior

1064
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
We give him this intervention measure

1065
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
We want to see

1066
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
A few months later

1067
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
How strong is the effect of this intervention measure

1068
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Can we quantify this strength

1069
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,920
Okay, so

1070
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Uh, what we do is still

1071
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
This

1072
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
Uh, in this community

1073
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,920
We let these people participate in our

1074
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,920
This health behavior improvement measure

1075
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,920
What about this health behavior improvement measure?

1076
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
We are going to do some suicide prevention

1077
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Behavior

1078
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
That's what we want to say

1079
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,920
Hey, actually your mental state is very important

1080
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
And then you have to take care of others often

1081
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
Or you have to know

1082
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,920
Your own mental health

1083
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Is there any risk?

1084
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Is there any danger?

1085
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
You have to get some support from society

1086
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,920
it is good

1087
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
What is the way we use

1088
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,920
The way we use it is

1089
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,920
Uh, we first need to have a social network map

1090
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,920
Is that we have to know first

1091
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Say this

1092
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,920
The people in this village

1093
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
They, uh, people and people are each other

1094
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
How is it

1095
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,920
Uh, there is this social relationship

1096
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,920
Then again, we have to look at

1097
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,920
Uh, what are we measuring?

1098
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,920
What we want to measure is this intervention measure

1099
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
Does it work?

1100
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
Then we have to look at

1101
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,920
Hey, today I'm talking about

1102
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,920
Suppose I'm going to look at smoking

1103
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,920
I'll look at smoking

1104
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Uh, at the first time

1105
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
We look at everyone's smoking

1106
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
Then the second time

1107
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,920
Or, uh, other health behaviors

1108
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,920
Then look at the second wave

1109
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
The second time

1110
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
Have these people's health behaviors changed

1111
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
Through our intervention measures

1112
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
Then we have to know

1113
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,920
We can only do this

1114
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
Some of the points in the network

1115
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Interference in their behavior

1116
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,920
We might be with some of them

1117
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
To participate in this, uh,

1118
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,920
Some education on this bad behavior

1119
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,920
We hope to change their behavior

1120
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
Then we want to see

1121
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,920
These interventions

1122
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Did it spread to their neighbors?

1123
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,920
Because they're a pretty small group

1124
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
And it's a very tight group

1125
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,920
We want to see this intervention measure

1126
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,920
The spread effect on this network

1127
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,920
Okay, uh, just like I said

1128
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,920
We're doing this, uh, suicide prevention research

1129
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,920
Let's see

1130
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,920
Uh, the main thing is to look at the network

1131
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,920
The relationship between a pair of diets

1132
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,920
What is diet diet?

1133
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Um, if there's a link between A and B

1134
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,920
He's a diet

1135
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,920
If there's no link, it's a diet

1136
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,920
It's a pair of pairs

1137
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,920
It's a pair of pairs

1138
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,920
The main thing is to see if there's a relationship like this

1139
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
He's on the Internet

1140
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,920
His good behavior or bad behavior

1141
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
Is there any significant change?

1142
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
In every wave

1143
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,920
In two waves

1144
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
Is there any significant change?

1145
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Okay, uh, we're going to build this model now

1146
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,920
How to build this model

1147
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,920
Because, uh, we know

1148
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,920
We only have this part of the people on the Internet

1149
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
Give them this participatory research

1150
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
So what about the first variable A?

1151
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,920
The first variable A is, uh, we have a picture first

1152
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,920
It's on G

1153
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,920
G is the name of the network

1154
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,920
The meaning of the network is that he has a point V and a link E

1155
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,920
That A is a function of V

1156
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,920
That is, V is every point

1157
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Did he participate in our intervention measures?

1158
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,920
Or, uh, the suicide prevention of this behavior

1159
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
This lecture

1160
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,920
If he's involved, he'll give him E

1161
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
If you're not involved, give him 0

1162
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,920
Okay, what about the second part of B?

1163
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,920
B is looking at his behavior

1164
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,920
Is there any change in his state?

1165
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,920
So he has two time points

1166
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,920
He's at the zero point

1167
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,920
He's not yet, uh, he's not yet involved

1168
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,920
His behavior before this suicide prevention lecture

1169
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,920
If he has this behavior

1170
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,920
Is E

1171
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Maybe this behavior is a bad behavior

1172
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
It's like smoking

1173
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,920
Maybe there's a suicide tendency

1174
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,920
He's E

1175
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,920
So at the second time point

1176
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,920
Time point E is that they're already, uh, prevention

1177
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
The behavior has passed

1178
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
Intervention has passed

1179
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
But this person doesn't necessarily participate

1180
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
But he's still in this state

1181
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,920
Change

1182
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,920
Zero is not in this state

1183
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,920
E is in this state

1184
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,920
So we have six numbers

1185
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
To record the whole process

1186
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,920
The first one is A

1187
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,920
A is whether he participated in this intervention

1188
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,920
B is in under two times

1189
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,920
Is he showing this behavior?

1190
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,920
So he has four in B

1191
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,920
Uh, there are four divisions

1192
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,920
If A, there are two divisions

1193
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,920
So let's see

1194
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
He's under two points in time

1195
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
T0 and T1

1196
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
We're going to look at his

1197
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,920
Uh, all these diets

1198
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920
These pairs of

1199
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,920
His behavior changes

1200
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,920
So let's make some records

1201
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Because we're looking at every one of them

1202
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
It's diet

1203
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,920
It's X and Y

1204
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,920
Suppose we're looking at

1205
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,920
Uh, UV, this pair

1206
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,920
UV, he's on the Internet

1207
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,920
There are links

1208
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,920
He is

1209
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,920
U and V are friends

1210
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,920
Then they have a link in the middle

1211
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,920
Then we're going to look at

1212
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,920
In the way of this record

1213
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,920
His, uh, participation

1214
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,920
What is the value of this behavior?

1215
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,920
So the bottom is

1216
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,920
We're calculating this XY PQR

1217
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,920
PQRS

1218
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,920
What is XY?

1219
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,920
XY is this point

1220
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
Does he participate in this way?

1221
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
What is the y-axis?

1222
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,920
What is the y-division?

1223
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,920
The y-division is point B

1224
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,920
Did you participate in this way?

1225
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,920
What about P?

1226
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,920
P is point U

1227
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
He's in the zero time

1228
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,920
He has

1229
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,920
He has this behavior in the zero time

1230
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
That Q is point V

1231
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
Is there this behavior in the zero time?

1232
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,920
R is point U

1233
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Is there this behavior in T equals 1?

1234
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
S is point V

1235
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Is there this behavior in T equals 1?

1236
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,920
So let's do some

1237
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
The changes in the amount

1238
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,920
This is all

1239
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
This looks a little complicated

1240
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
But he's just a

1241
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Bookkeeping

1242
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
He's just recording

1243
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
XY PQRZ

1244
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
The amount of this thing

1245
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
X can be equal to 0

1246
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
It can be equal to 1

1247
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Y can be equal to 0

1248
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
It can be equal to 1

1249
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
S can be equal to 0

1250
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
It can be equal to 1

1251
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
So we're going to record

1252
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
The number of changes in these things

1253
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,920
Let's give an example

1254
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,920
The example is

1255
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,920
I'm looking at XY PQRS

1256
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,920
But I might be looking at a T

1257
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,920
What I'm looking at is a 1 0

1258
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,920
1 1 0 1

1259
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,920
What does this mean?

1260
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,920
This is XY

1261
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,920
What about this pair?

1262
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,920
X participates in the defense

1263
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
X is 1

1264
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,920
Y does not participate in the defense

1265
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,920
Y is 0

1266
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,920
X at T time

1267
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,920
He has this bad behavior

1268
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,920
Is 1

1269
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,920
Y at T equals 0 time

1270
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,920
He also has this behavior

1271
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,920
Is 1

1272
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,920
At T equals 1

1273
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,920
When T1

1274
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,920
X no longer has this behavior

1275
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,920
It becomes 0

1276
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,920
But Y still has this behavior

1277
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,920
He is 1

1278
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,920
Then we have to look at this

1279
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,920
How many pairs are there?

1280
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,920
So we just saw

1281
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
This has a total of

1282
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,920
The combination of 2 and 6 squares

1283
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,920
We have to look at 64 values

1284
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
How many changes does it have?

1285
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,920
Ok

1286
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,920
Then we can put

1287
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Just this thing

1288
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Make a table

1289
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
This is a map

1290
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
Then we can divide it into

1291
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,920
X participates

1292
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Y participates

1293
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,920
Or X did not participate

1294
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
Y did not participate in this combination

1295
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Then look again

1296
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,920
Do they have these bad behaviors?

1297
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
If there is a bad behavior, it is a black dot

1298
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,920
No bad behavior is a white dot

1299
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,920
Then we can put

1300
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,920
The total of 64 numbers

1301
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
Recorded on this

1302
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
Then we have to look at this

1303
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,920
64 numbers and time changes

1304
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
That

1305
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,920
Next is the social scientist

1306
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,920
Some values of concern

1307
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,920
The first one is

1308
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,920
We want to see

1309
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
This intervention

1310
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,920
For the participants themselves

1311
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Does it have positive results?

1312
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Is there a positive effect?

1313
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,920
It is direct treatment success

1314
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
In a social context

1315
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,920
Is in this social network

1316
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
We give it directly

1317
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,920
This intervention

1318
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,920
For this person

1319
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
Does it have a good result?

1320
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,920
The second is direct prevention

1321
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,920
In a social context

1322
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,920
If this person

1323
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,920
If there is no bad behavior

1324
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,920
We give him this intervention

1325
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,920
Can he continue to maintain

1326
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,920
He did not have this bad behavior

1327
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,920
The following m3 to m8

1328
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,920
Is similar to some

1329
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
Some of the values we see

1330
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,920
I will not go into details here

1331
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Ok, m1 is what I just said

1332
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,920
If this person participates in preventive measures

1333
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Will he

1334
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,920
At the next time

1335
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
Is to improve

1336
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,920
He may have this bad behavior

1337
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,920
There was no bad behavior later

1338
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,920
This is this person himself

1339
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
Then we have to look

1340
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,920
Corresponding to within those 64 brackets

1341
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,920
I have to look at these eight

1342
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,920
The change in the value

1343
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,920
The left side is red

1344
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
Deep red

1345
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
The right side is this pink

1346
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Plus the alignment

1347
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,920
I have to look at these two time points

1348
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,920
Within

1349
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
The difference between the two numbers

1350
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,920
Is there a difference?

1351
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,920
Is there a difference between this and no model?

1352
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,920
That this is m1

1353
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
This indicator

1354
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
That m2 indicator is

1355
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,920
If this person today

1356
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,920
He was at t equal to 0

1357
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,920
At the time

1358
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,920
He has no bad behavior

1359
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,920
That he is at t equal to 1

1360
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,920
After a period of time

1361
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,920
His bad behavior

1362
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,920
Is it continuous?

1363
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,920
Did not happen

1364
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,920
Then we have to look at the other two

1365
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,920
The difference in value

1366
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,920
This is the red one here

1367
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,920
Reduce the alignment here

1368
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
Pink this difference

1369
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,920
So we can put the eight questions just now

1370
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,920
All of them are drawn as a comparison between two

1371
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,920
What is no model?

1372
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,920
No model is now

1373
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,920
We call it Poisson binomial distribution

1374
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
It is Poisson binomial

1375
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,920
Poisson binomial

1376
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,920
It is a binomial

1377
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,920
A wide range of binary distributions

1378
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,920
That it is every point

1379
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,920
Every trial

1380
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Every test

1381
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,920
Its probability may be different

1382
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,920
So we know that the binary distribution

1383
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,920
It is every

1384
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,920
Distribute its test point

1385
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,920
Its probability is the same

1386
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
But Poisson binomial

1387
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,920
It may be different

1388
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,920
Then we take this model as our no model

1389
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,920
Then we do this bootstrap

1390
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,920
Bootstrap means that it is repeated

1391
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,920
We may

1392
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
For this no model

1393
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,920
We did this experiment a thousand times

1394
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,920
Then we look again

1395
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
What we really observed

1396
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,920
The value of M1 to M8 just mentioned

1397
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,920
It falls in our thousand repetitions

1398
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Did it fall at the end of 5%?

1399
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
If there is, we will say

1400
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Okay, this thing is conspicuous

1401
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,920
If not

1402
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Just say this thing is not conspicuous

1403
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,920
If it falls in the middle of 95%

1404
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,920
Just not conspicuous

1405
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,920
Falling at 5%

1406
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,920
Whether it is the front or the back

1407
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,920
We said it was conspicuous

1408
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,920
it is good

1409
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,920
So we are based on another

1410
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,920
Another village

1411
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,920
We do this thing

1412
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,920
In the end, we still have some

1413
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,920
We have to judge the characteristics

1414
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,920
It's very similar to the characteristics just now

1415
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,920
It's usually related to suicide prevention

1416
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,920
The question is whether he has a suicidal tendency

1417
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,920
Then will he help others?

1418
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,920
Will he talk about suicide?

1419
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,920
Does he have any wine at home?

1420
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,920
Do you have any weapons at home?

1421
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,920
Then we will follow the eight judgment methods just now

1422
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
Let's see

1423
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,920
They are in the 39 questions just now

1424
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,920
Is it clear that the change is good or bad?

1425
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,920
The red one is the direction of the change

1426
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,920
The blue triangle is in the direction of the change

1427
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,920
So some of the effects are external

1428
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
It's the opposite of the positive

1429
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,920
Some of the effects are bad

1430
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,920
It's the opposite of the bad direction

1431
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,920
So these can be seen from the model just now

1432
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,920
Okay, let's sum it up

1433
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,920
This is our second project

1434
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,920
He wants to look at

1435
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,920
A social network

1436
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,920
In the relationship of the group

1437
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,920
We give him an intervention

1438
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,920
Then we can measure

1439
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,920
This is a sociologist or a epidemiologist

1440
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,920
Or some of the public health scientists

1441
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,920
The values ​​they care about

1442
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,920
Is there any positive behavior?

1443
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,920
Is there any positive behavior?

1444
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,920
Is there any spread?

1445
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,920
We can all give a

1446
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
Analyze the amount

1447
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,920
There is a positive relationship

1448
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
Or no

1449
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,920
There is no obvious positive relationship

1450
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,920
Then we can see this

1451
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
Intervention measures

1452
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,920
Or the external effect of this public policy

1453
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,920
Or

1454
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,920
What we care about is

1455
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,920
Suicide prevention

1456
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,920
Self-protection

1457
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,920
The above is my sharing

1458
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
So I just shared

1459
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,920
Basically three things

1460
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,920
The first one is

1461
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,920
What I care about during my PhD

1462
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,920
Is a complex network

1463
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,920
A shared network

1464
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,920
The second is

1465
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,920
Can we have a third party to take the initiative

1466
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,920
To build a

1467
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,920
A collective subjective network

1468
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,920
The third is

1469
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,920
If we are on the Internet

1470
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,920
Do an intervention

1471
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,920
Can we find a way

1472
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,920
To measure the effectiveness of this intervention

1473
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,920
This is what I'm going to share with you today

1474
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
Some topics

1475
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,920
Thank you all

1476
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,920
Thank you for today's speech

1477
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
Then I represent everyone

1478
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,920
Let's give it up

1479
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,920
That one

1480
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,920
Okay, I have some here

1481
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,920
I have collected some

1482
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,920
When you were talking

1483
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,920
When you were talking

1484
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Some questions from the audience

1485
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,920
Then there are some here

1486
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
Is about the first study

1487
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,920
Some are about the second study

1488
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,920
What do you think

1489
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,920
I'm talking to you now

1490
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,920
How do you think it should be done

1491
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,920
Let's start with the first study

1492
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,920
Or from

1493
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Just turn it over

1494
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,920
Start with the second study

1495
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,920
See what you want

1496
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,920
All right

1497
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
In fact, we have no preference

1498
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
That's good

1499
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
Once

1500
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
It's just a discussion

1501
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
A study

1502
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
If it's the first study

1503
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
Answer together

1504
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Which one can start first

1505
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,920
Okay, let me start with the first study

1506
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,920
Just in the process

1507
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,920
I have two questions

1508
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,920
But wait

1509
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,920
Before I ask

1510
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,920
Do you want to ask yourself

1511
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,920
Because just now

1512
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,920
In fact, if you want to ask yourself

1513
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
You can also turn on the microphone

1514
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,920
Is that plus fish?

1515
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920
C H I A Y U N

1516
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,920
And Zhang Yong

1517
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,920
Two people have mentioned

1518
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,920
Two people have mentioned

1519
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,920
About the first study

1520
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,920
You can open the microphone

1521
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,920
Ask yourself if you want

1522
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,920
Or

1523
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,920
Or I can ask you

1524
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,920
See what you think

1525
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,920
So

1526
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,920
I don't really understand

1527
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,920
So what do you mean

1528
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,920
Do you mean to ask me to turn on the microphone now?

1529
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,920
Yes, just like this

1530
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,920
You can start asking

1531
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
Ok

1532
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,920
Ok, then

1533
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Then I will ask first

1534
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,920
Although I am actually the second

1535
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,920
I am also wrong

1536
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,920
Because that

1537
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,920
Is it plus fish?

1538
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,920
Sorry

1539
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,920
I don't know how to spell your name

1540
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,920
He should ask first

1541
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
But anyway

1542
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,920
Then I will ask first

1543
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920
Otherwise, I have already opened

1544
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,920
Just

1545
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,920
You are doing like this

1546
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,920
Because basically

1547
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,920
You can't draw the whole society

1548
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,920
Then you can only say

1549
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,920
You draw a part of the people

1550
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,920
Then go to build

1551
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,920
This part of the people

1552
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,920
Give you this network

1553
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,920
But

1554
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,920
We know that

1555
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,920
When doing network analysis

1556
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
In fact

1557
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,920
Where is the boundary of the entire network

1558
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,920
Then what is its boundary property

1559
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,920
Then there is its absolute

1560
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,920
Is the absolute dimension

1561
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,920
And the size of the entire network

1562
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
In fact, it will affect

1563
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
Some emergent property

1564
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,920
Even your

1565
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,920
Interaction between units

1566
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,920
All the same

1567
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,920
Then what do you think about this thing?

1568
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,920
If you can't draw the whole

1569
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,920
Everyone in the network

1570
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Any other questions?

1571
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,920
Still

1572
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,920
It's a question, right?

1573
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,920
Do I answer it once?

1574
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,920
Then I will ask by the way

1575
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,920
Plus fish

1576
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,920
Oh, I'm sorry

1577
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,920
I really don't know your name

1578
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,920
The question seems to be

1579
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,920
Because I think it's a bit related

1580
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,920
But his question

1581
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
More specific

1582
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,920
Then I will ask together

1583
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,920
Then you answer together

1584
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,920
His question is

1585
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,920
You set positive and negative

1586
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,920
Right? I didn't hear wrong

1587
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,920
When study one

1588
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,920
The first one

1589
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,920
Yes

1590
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,920
The question is

1591
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,920
Then why don't you use 1 and 0

1592
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,920
Is there or not

1593
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,920
Why do you want positive and negative 1

1594
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,920
So this is actually a

1595
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,920
I think it's an assumption

1596
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,920
So with

1597
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,920
Maybe it's a special case

1598
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,920
In the question of Zhang Yong

1599
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,920
Okay, let's answer it together

1600
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,920
Okay, I'm done

1601
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,920
it is good

1602
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,920
Thank you for the two questions

1603
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,920
I will answer the question of Yan Yong first

1604
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Is what you just said

1605
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
The question of network boundary

1606
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,920
Is doing social network

1607
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,920
A big area

1608
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,920
Many people are doing

1609
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,920
Network Boundary Research

1610
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,920
Because

1611
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,920
Network Boundary

1612
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,920
Actually look at your research

1613
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,920
The group of people who care

1614
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,920
Then this thing can be

1615
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,920
Uh, written

1616
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,920
Some things are not written

1617
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,920
But like

1618
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,920
The research we are doing

1619
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,920
Is written

1620
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,920
Is in this village

1621
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,920
Because it is between the village and the village

1622
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,920
It's just a long distance

1623
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,920
He won't have any

1624
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,920
Connections between villages

1625
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,920
Basically very few

1626
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,920
Then these people are

1627
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,920
Because they are all big

1628
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,920
Ah, these are big

1629
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,920
Then we are in this village

1630
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,920
Maybe 400 people

1631
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,920
Then this boundary is

1632
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,920
Very certain in comparison

1633
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,920
Then some research

1634
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,920
Boundary is very uncertain

1635
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,920
Just like

1636
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,920
Suppose my other research is doing

1637
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,920
New York City's population

1638
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,920
New York City's population

1639
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,920
Then this is quite uncertain

1640
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,920
That is to say, these people are in New York City

1641
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,920
Uh, have you been to New York City?

1642
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,920
Or he wants

1643
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,920
He lives outside New York City

1644
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
We don't know

1645
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,920
Or this kind of network boundary

1646
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,920
It's hard to define

1647
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,920
But like this research

1648
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,920
The network boundary is also very obvious

1649
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,920
Is that I live in this village

1650
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,920
Maybe more than 300 people

1651
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
400 people

1652
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
He is our research range

1653
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,920
Then we put everyone

1654
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,920
Get the photo or name

1655
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,920
And then look at this

1656
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,920
What should the network look like

1657
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,920
So you just mentioned the problem

1658
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,920
It's not going to happen

1659
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,920
On this research

1660
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,920
Then some, uh, network boundary

1661
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,920
It is also a very certain group

1662
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,920
He is an organization

1663
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
The people inside him may be like

1664
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,920
A department

1665
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,920
He may only accept 120 students

1666
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,920
Then this network boundary is also very close

1667
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,920
It's very, very, very obvious

1668
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,920
Just one grade

1669
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,920
Take 120 students

1670
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,920
Or, uh, a company

1671
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,920
He may have 200 employees

1672
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,920
This is also very certain

1673
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,920
Then we are in this kind of very certain network boundary

1674
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,920
To discuss this matter

1675
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,920
His grace is fixed

1676
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,920
His grace is his network

1677
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,920
Is fixed

1678
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,920
Then we do this model again

1679
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,920
So there won't be much boundary

1680
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,920
The second question is

1681
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,920
Why don't we use 1 and negative 1 to record

1682
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,920
We don't use 1 and 0 to record

1683
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,920
because

1684
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,920
The main problem is that our 0 is also used

1685
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,920
We 0

1686
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,920
I didn't make it clear just now

1687
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,920
Our 0 is that he

1688
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,920
This relationship is not obvious

1689
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,920
What does it mean not to be obvious

1690
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,920
Not obvious is that he

1691
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,920
There is a connection that is not obvious

1692
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,920
Or there is no connection that is not obvious

1693
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,920
He is

1694
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,920
Uh, it's kind of like we're not sure

1695
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,920
Is there a relationship

1696
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
But 1 and negative 1

1697
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,920
1 is that we are sure that we are very

1698
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,920
We have this relationship

1699
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,920
That negative 1 is that we are sure that this relationship is not

1700
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,920
So we actually used 1 0 and negative 1

1701
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,920
But we just saw in this picture

1702
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,920
Uh, I'm going back to look for it

1703
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,920
In this picture

1704
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,920
In fact, uh, the relationship of 1 is that the relationship of positive is black

1705
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,920
That red relationship is negative 1

1706
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,920
He is red

1707
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,920
As for the others that are not connected

1708
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,920
Their relationship is 0

1709
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,920
Because they are us

1710
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,920
They are us

1711
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,920
It's not obvious in the statistics

1712
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,920
He is

1713
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,920
We don't

1714
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,920
We are not sure he is positive

1715
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,920
Or is he

1716
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,920
He is a negative relationship

1717
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,920
So 1 0 negative 1

1718
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,920
We actually all have

1719
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,920
I just didn't make it clear

1720
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,920
The positive network I just talked about is the network of 1

1721
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,920
The negative network I just talked about is the network of negative 1

1722
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,920
Then these two networks

1723
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:41,920
Sorry

1724
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,920
Did you see my desktop

1725
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
It's empty

1726
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,920
What I see now is a blue base

1727
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,920
Hey, what about now

1728
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,920
I accidentally jumped out

1729
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,920
Hey, it still looks the same

1730
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,920
I can't go back a little

1731
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,920
I don't know why

1732
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,920
If you turn off the share screen and reopen it

1733
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,920
How about this

1734
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,920
Share screen

1735
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,920
Stop sharing

1736
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,920
Good

1737
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,920
Then reopen the share screen

1738
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,920
Review

1739
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,920
Oh yes

1740
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,920
Is there

1741
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,920
Hey now

1742
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,920
Uh, wait a minute

1743
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,920
Oh yes

1744
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,920
Good

1745
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,920
Sorry

1746
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,920
So uh

1747
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,920
Back to the question just now

1748
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,920
We actually have 0

1749
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
I just didn't make it clear

1750
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,920
0 is the relationship between the two

1751
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,920
We are not sure

1752
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,920
The statistics are not sure

1753
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
Ok

1754
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,920
I'll probably answer this

1755
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,920
If there are any further questions

1756
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,920
You can also continue to discuss

1757
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,920
That one

1758
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,920
Uh

1759
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,920
YUAN

1760
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,920
XIE YUAN

1761
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:47,920
Hey, Xiao Yuan

1762
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,920
OK

1763
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,920
Can you hear me

1764
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,920
Can you hear me

1765
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,920
Teacher

1766
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,920
Hey

1767
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,920
Hello

1768
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,920
Hi, long time no see

1769
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,920
Not long

1770
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,920
A few months ago

1771
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,920
A few months ago

1772
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,920
All right

1773
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,920
All right

1774
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,920
Everyone at home

1775
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,920
Thank you, teacher

1776
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,920
That was a great presentation

1777
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,920
I have a question

1778
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,920
It's about that

1779
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,920
Co-evolution of networks

1780
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,920
Using your tomography method

1781
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,920
Because I was thinking

1782
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,920
If we want to study

1783
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,920
The co-evolution of networks

1784
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,920
It takes several network snapshots

1785
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,920
If we use this method

1786
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,920
Because every time

1787
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,920
Participants may be different

1788
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,920
Even if we are the same

1789
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,920
Will also lead to

1790
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,920
Its node distribution is different

1791
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,920
Because I think the teacher's method

1792
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,920
It seems to be from binomial

1793
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,920
A node distribution evolved

1794
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,920
That's what you think

1795
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
If I use this method

1796
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,920
And then in several stages

1797
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,920
But the number of participants is not the same

1798
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,920
That way I can

1799
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,920
Compare several different networks

1800
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,920
Between

1801
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,920
Characteristics

1802
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,920
For example, the second stage

1803
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,920
Network transitivity

1804
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,920
With the first stage

1805
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,920
Network transitivity

1806
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,920
Can I do this

1807
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,920
Compare

1808
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,920
Do some co-evolution analysis

1809
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,920
Or does the teacher think

1810
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
No, there's no way to compare

1811
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,920
Yes, yes, yes

1812
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,920
Thank you

1813
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,920
OK

1814
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,920
Thank you, Xiao Yuan

1815
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,920
Question is

1816
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,920
Uh, this area is

1817
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,920
Uh, I know

1818
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,920
I don't know if you've heard of it

1819
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,920
Is multi-layer network

1820
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,920
Multi-layer network is

1821
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,920
In math or physics

1822
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:19,920
Dealing with

1823
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,920
This question just now

1824
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,920
Like a few waves

1825
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,920
Uh, network

1826
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,920
He gave a few snapshots

1827
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
Then he wants to see

1828
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,920
His multi-layer can be quite a lot

1829
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,920
One is

1830
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,920
Uh, every layer of the network

1831
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,920
It's all different

1832
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,920
Look at different variables

1833
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,920
Like this

1834
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,920
Uh

1835
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,920
Maybe it's the same time point

1836
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,920
One layer may be the mood

1837
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,920
One layer may be the result

1838
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,920
One layer may be healthy

1839
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,920
This

1840
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,920
Different layers

1841
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,920
The other one is

1842
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,920
It evolves over time

1843
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,920
That is

1844
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,920
He can be T from 1 to 10

1845
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,920
You give him a live broadcast

1846
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,920
Research

1847
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,920
Then he will

1848
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,920
T equals 1

1849
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,920
One layer T equals 2

1850
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,920
One layer T equals 10

1851
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,920
That

1852
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,920
People who study multi-layer network

1853
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,920
You'll see

1854
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
What's the relationship between cross-layers

1855
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,920
It's just that

1856
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,920
Maybe the members are the same

1857
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
Some members are the same

1858
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
But some members

1859
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,920
Leave or join

1860
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,920
That

1861
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,920
In the multi-layer network

1862
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,920
Under the general design

1863
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,920
You just mentioned

1864
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,920
These problems are all

1865
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,920
Uh, they have

1866
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,920
There are ways to deal with the domain

1867
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,920
Is to leave

1868
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,920
Or a new member

1869
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,920
That

1870
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,920
I just talked about this model

1871
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,920
I didn't deal with this problem

1872
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,920
Because I actually only have two waves of people

1873
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,920
Then my model is also very simple

1874
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,920
It's just that the network won't change

1875
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,920
And then this person

1876
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,920
Uh, it's just that the network won't change

1877
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,920
That means

1878
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,920
They don't have a new point

1879
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,920
There is no point to leave

1880
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,920
Then

1881
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:35,920
The structure of the network has not changed

1882
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,920
So I actually

1883
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,920
There are only a few months in the middle

1884
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,920
I just assume that his network has not changed

1885
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,920
Because we are looking at the relationship network

1886
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,920
That we

1887
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,920
The assumption is that the relationship between two people

1888
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,920
In a few months

1889
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,920
Will not change

1890
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,920
That

1891
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,920
Of course you can do different extensions

1892
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,920
You can say

1893
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,920
Suppose you want to do 10 waves

1894
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,920
That

1895
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,920
Sometimes someone leaves

1896
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,920
Someone comes in

1897
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,920
Then I'm thinking

1898
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,920
You have to use the multi-layer network

1899
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,920
Structure

1900
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,920
In that field

1901
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,920
Mathematicians and physicists also deal with this

1902
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,920
The problem you just mentioned

1903
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,920
They have dealt with

1904
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,920
That is, someone leaves

1905
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,920
Someone

1906
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
Someone new

1907
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,920
This is all

1908
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,920
Um

1909
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,920
Some of the scenarios they have dealt with

1910
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,920
So I don't think there will be too many problems

1911
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,920
Just look at it

1912
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,920
What is the study of the multi-layer network

1913
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
How to deal with

1914
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,920
Sorry

1915
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,920
Because I

1916
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,920
This model

1917
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,920
There is no such treatment

1918
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,920
But I

1919
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,920
As far as I know, this can be handled

1920
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,920
Can I ask a follow-up?

1921
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,920
No problem

1922
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,920
Because

1923
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,920
Multi-layer network

1924
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,920
Uh, I'm not very familiar with this part

1925
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,920
But I'm using

1926
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,920
Sienna's study

1927
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,920
This kind of joiner and lever

1928
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,920
Is a very common way

1929
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,920
That is to say, different waves

1930
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,920
Its members are different

1931
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,920
As long as there is an addition

1932
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,920
There are

1933
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,920
This is indeed a very common practice

1934
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,920
Just say

1935
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,920
I'm thinking about the teacher's method

1936
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,920
A more special way

1937
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,920
Because

1938
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:48,920
Usually when doing joiner and lever

1939
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:49,920
They

1940
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,920
He went to measure the network

1941
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,920
That

1942
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,920
Uh, the existence of the connection

1943
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:53,920
Usually use the same method

1944
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,920
That is to say

1945
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,920
For example, I name my friend

1946
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,920
That part is always

1947
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,920
It's always very fixed

1948
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,920
But I'm thinking

1949
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
Teacher

1950
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,920
Teacher, your method is to say

1951
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:02,920
You are through

1952
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,920
Comparison with a node distribution

1953
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,920
Indirectly to deduce

1954
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,920
It's these two nodes

1955
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,920
Does it have a connection?

1956
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
Then I was thinking

1957
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,920
That's why this is with

1958
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,920
General

1959
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,920
Uh, the general joiner and lever

1960
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,920
The problem is different

1961
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,920
The reason is

1962
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:19,920
It's right here

1963
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,920
That is to say, it is

1964
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,920
Through

1965
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,920
Comparison with a node distribution

1966
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,920
Then deduced

1967
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,920
Yeah, but I was thinking

1968
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,920
This

1969
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,920
Because it's in

1970
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,920
When different waves of people are different

1971
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,920
This node distribution will change

1972
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,920
Correct

1973
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,920
So

1974
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,920
Is that right?

1975
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,920
Directly above

1976
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,920
Compare

1977
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,920
Say different waves

1978
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,920
To infer

1979
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,920
Oh, these two people

1980
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:42,920
These two people are connected

1981
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,920
These two people are not connected

1982
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,920
Mainly want to ask

1983
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,920
This kind of part

1984
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,920
Yes

1985
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,920
Uh, I actually

1986
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,920
Uh, I'm not sure

1987
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,920
What you want to ask is

1988
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,920
My first research is

1989
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,920
Judging from the third party

1990
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,920
Is there any connection?

1991
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,920
Yes yes yes

1992
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,920
The part of the third party

1993
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,920
That's right

1994
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,920
That research

1995
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
It's just one wave

1996
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,920
That's what I just said

1997
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:00,920
My one

1998
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,920
Uh, participation

1999
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,920
Research

2000
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,920
Research time is only one week

2001
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,920
That is to say

2002
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,920
He

2003
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:06,920
He has only one wave

2004
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:07,920
His settings are only one wave

2005
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,920
That

2006
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,920
Uh, I think

2007
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,920
If you really want to do this

2008
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,920
Multi-layer words

2009
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:13,920
Then you have different waves

2010
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,920
Then come different

2011
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,920
Time to test

2012
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,920
Then do this network

2013
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,920
They

2014
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,920
The members of each wave may be different

2015
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,920
But I actually don't know

2016
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,920
Say cross-group

2017
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,920
This one

2018
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:24,920
How do i change

2019
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,920
In fact, I just

2020
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,920
This first study

2021
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,920
He actually only has one wave

2022
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,920
So he was originally a

2023
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,920
Just

2024
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,920
Under that setting

2025
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,920
He is a complete architecture

2026
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,920
But I didn't think about cross-group

2027
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,920
Comparison

2028
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,920
Is the problem of cross-time point comparison

2029
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,920
But

2030
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,920
Um

2031
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,920
You said you

2032
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,920
How will it be done in the relevant research?

2033
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,920
Or do you have any suggestions or questions?

2034
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,920
Actually, I'm not sure

2035
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,920
Because I just

2036
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,920
I thought you were talking about the second one

2037
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,920
Because the second one

2038
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:52,920
I just talked about the second study

2039
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,920
Only

2040
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,920
Only cross

2041
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,920
Comparison

2042
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,920
But the first study did not

2043
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,920
The first study is

2044
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,920
I find a time

2045
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,920
A week

2046
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,920
Then make this network

2047
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,920
What I want to compare is

2048
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,920
The third party's subjective recognition

2049
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,920
With our own

2050
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,920
Objective report

2051
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,920
What's the difference

2052
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,920
Um

2053
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,920
Yes, so I didn't think about it

2054
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,920
Do the first study

2055
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,920
Cross-group

2056
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,920
Maybe it can be

2057
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,920
But

2058
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,920
If that's the case

2059
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,920
These people

2060
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:19,920
He will be

2061
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,920
There are in and out

2062
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,920
Then

2063
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,920
Cross-group

2064
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:23,920
How do i cross

2065
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,920
Cross-time

2066
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,920
How do I divide

2067
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,920
Will also be a question

2068
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,920
Because what I just said

2069
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
Divide

2070
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,920
Divide at the same time

2071
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,920
OK

2072
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,920
Understand

2073
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,920
Thank you

2074
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,920
No no

2075
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,920
That

2076
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,920
Let me ask a few questions

2077
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,920
Because there is

2078
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,920
Just

2079
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,920
We are now

2080
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,920
To the second study

2081
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,920
Right

2082
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,920
Natural conversion

2083
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,920
So there were some friends just now

2084
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,920
There are some questions about the second study

2085
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,920
Then I

2086
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,920
Uh

2087
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,920
I'm here now

2088
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,920
I'm probably summary now

2089
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,920
Then ask

2090
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,920
Then if I ask

2091
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,920
What do you think

2092
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,920
I'm the one who asked the question

2093
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,920
I think I expressed it wrong

2094
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,920
Then you can turn on the microphone

2095
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,920
It doesn't matter

2096
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,920
Um

2097
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,920
It's about the second study

2098
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,920
Ah

2099
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:02,920
This Liu

2100
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,920
Asked to say

2101
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,920
I'll just read it

2102
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,920
The second case

2103
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,920
What is it

2104
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,920
Analyze method

2105
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:09,920
Analyze intervention

2106
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,920
What about the effect

2107
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,920
This is the first one

2108
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,920
Then

2109
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,920
A little bit related to this question

2110
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,920
Is this one

2111
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:15,920
There should be a surname

2112
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,920
Ning

2113
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,920
Ning said

2114
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:18,920
Is there

2115
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,920
Control

2116
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:20,920
This control group

2117
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,920
Or

2118
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,920
The so-called contrast group

2119
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,920
Because what you are analyzing

2120
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,920
Is the effect of the experimental group

2121
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,920
You can

2122
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,920
You can say that

2123
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,920
Then this is

2124
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,920
I think it's the first group

2125
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,920
problem

2126
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,920
Ah

2127
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,920
The second question is

2128
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,920
Zhang

2129
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,920
Is

2130
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:34,920
There will be a lot of groups

2131
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,920
Will there be a lot of groups

2132
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,920
No no no no

2133
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:37,920
In fact, only

2134
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:38,920
Only the second group

2135
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,920
The second group

2136
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:40,920
There is one more

2137
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,920
It's my own question

2138
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,920
But that

2139
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,920
If you don't have time, forget it

2140
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,920
Then there is another one

2141
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,920
Zhang Yong

2142
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,920
He asked

2143
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:47,920
Because your state

2144
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,920
Your notes

2145
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,920
The state is 1010

2146
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:50,920
He said

2147
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,920
He said

2148
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,920
Is there a mix state

2149
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,920
Then I'm not sure

2150
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,920
What does he mean

2151
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:57,920
Then if

2152
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,920
When you answer later

2153
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,920
Or he

2154
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:00,920
Uh

2155
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,920
He wants to clarify

2156
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,920
You can also say it like this

2157
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,920
Okay, that's it

2158
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,920
it is good

2159
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,920
it is good

2160
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,920
Ah

2161
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:07,920
Thank you for your feedback

2162
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,920
Then I want to talk first

2163
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:10,920
Is

2164
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,920
I think it's better

2165
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,920
Ah

2166
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,920
Good talk

2167
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,920
Is 0

2168
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,920
Like the last question

2169
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,920
Ah

2170
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,920
Yan Yong asked this

2171
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,920
Mix state question

2172
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,920
Because

2173
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,920
010

2174
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,920
The simplest thing we do

2175
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,920
One thing

2176
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,920
Is binary

2177
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,920
Always better than multi-state

2178
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,920
Do a lot

2179
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,920
So

2180
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,920
We only test

2181
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,920
Uh

2182
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,920
Binary

2183
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:31,920
Then

2184
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:32,920
Ah

2185
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,920
Let me pour this

2186
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,920
Is

2187
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,920
This is very similar to the first question

2188
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,920
How do we measure

2189
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,920
Say

2190
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,920
Does this intervention measure work

2191
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,920
So

2192
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,920
Let's look at the changes in bad behavior

2193
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,920
Bad behavior is

2194
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Maybe it's

2195
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,920
I asked 39 questions later

2196
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,920
Is

2197
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,920
Of the 39 questions

2198
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,920
Some of them

2199
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,920
If he answers

2200
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,920
Good

2201
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,920
Like

2202
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,920
Uh

2203
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:54,920
Do you have the idea of ​​suicide

2204
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,920
Do you often think of the idea of ​​suicide

2205
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,920
If he says yes

2206
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,920
We think it's a bad behavior

2207
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,920
It's like smoking

2208
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:02,920
Is a bad behavior

2209
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,920
That

2210
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:04,920
The way we record this

2211
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,920
Use 01 to record

2212
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,920
Of course you can be more complicated

2213
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,920
You can even make it

2214
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,920
Is a continuous extent

2215
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,920
But for us

2216
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:13,920
Is 01

2217
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,920
Is

2218
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:15,920
The first step to do

2219
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,920
If we don't do 01

2220
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,920
It will be more difficult later

2221
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,920
So

2222
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,920
We use 01

2223
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:21,920
This kind of binary

2224
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,920
Binary classification

2225
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,920
To divide this matter

2226
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,920
That

2227
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
The way to measure is

2228
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,920
I just said

2229
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,920
We have 39 questions later

2230
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:30,920
Ah

2231
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:31,920
Sorry

2232
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,920
There are 39 questions here

2233
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,920
That

2234
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,920
Every question

2235
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,920
Ah

2236
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,920
You can put

2237
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,920
Uh

2238
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:38,920
There is bad behavior called 1

2239
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,920
Then there is good behavior called 0

2240
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,920
Then we look at this

2241
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,920
At this point in time

2242
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,920
How many changes in 01

2243
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,920
You were originally 1

2244
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,920
Later maintained as 1

2245
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,920
It means that

2246
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,920
This person may not have improved

2247
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,920
It's all bad behavior

2248
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,920
At the time of 0

2249
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,920
At the first time

2250
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:53,920
Still bad behavior

2251
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,920
That

2252
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:55,920
If it changes from 1 to 0

2253
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,920
We think there is an improvement

2254
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:58,920
Under this question

2255
01:15:58,920 --> 01:15:59,920
He has improved

2256
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,920
He had bad behavior

2257
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,920
Then there was no bad behavior

2258
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:04,920
Then we also see

2259
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,920
Suppose a person

2260
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,920
He participated in this intervention

2261
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,920
Then his neighbor

2262
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,920
Is there any way for him to change from 1 to 0

2263
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,920
There was originally bad behavior

2264
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:14,920
Later it became no bad behavior

2265
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,920
We want to see the effect of his spread

2266
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,920
So we look at this unit

2267
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:19,920
Both

2268
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,920
Two of this

2269
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,920
Uh diet

2270
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:23,920
That is

2271
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,920
We

2272
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,920
Of course, you can continue to look at it

2273
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:27,920
That is to say

2274
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:28,920
Three layers of diet

2275
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,920
Triplet or triad

2276
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,920
Ah

2277
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,920
Or four layers

2278
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,920
But we just care

2279
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,920
We are most concerned about

2280
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,920
Can he spread to his direct neighbor

2281
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,920
So we all look at each one

2282
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,920
He is this kind of two pairs of this

2283
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,920
Uh

2284
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,920
Connection

2285
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:44,920
Okay

2286
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,920
Then

2287
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,920
This question is the control group's question

2288
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,920
Actually, uh, we didn't do that

2289
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,920
This is

2290
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,920
This is of course a

2291
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,920
It should be a pretty big problem

2292
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,920
This reviewer is also asking

2293
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,920
Then we are running directly

2294
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:58,920
He is

2295
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,920
Two networks

2296
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,920
Then the two networks

2297
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,920
We do the same thing

2298
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:03,920
So uh

2299
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:04,920
In fact, we

2300
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,920
There doesn't seem to be a good way to explain it

2301
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,920
But if

2302
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,920
Of course I believe

2303
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,920
If it's a good study

2304
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,920
He should be

2305
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,920
Bring

2306
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,920
Uh, there are a lot of control variables

2307
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,920
It's just that I might

2308
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,920
Uh, two

2309
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,920
Different villages do the same thing

2310
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:20,920
One is the experiment group

2311
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:21,920
One is the contrast group

2312
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,920
but

2313
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,920
Uh, our model is more like

2314
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,920
It's a return model

2315
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:27,920
It's us

2316
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,920
My model is bootstrap

2317
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,920
It's a re-draft

2318
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:31,920
And then look at him

2319
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,920
How much of this deviation from the re-draft

2320
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,920
If the deviation is very high

2321
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,920
We think this

2322
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,920
Uh, the phenomenon is

2323
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,920
Ah, it's obvious

2324
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,920
Or it's obvious

2325
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,920
That

2326
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,920
It's just that I have this

2327
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,920
Under the experimental framework

2328
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:43,920
He just didn't do it

2329
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,920
That's when I got the data

2330
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,920
I got the data first

2331
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,920
To start modeling

2332
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:49,920
I got the information

2333
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,920
Uh, both villages do the same thing

2334
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,920
Then I report this

2335
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,920
One of the villages is

2336
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,920
His results are better

2337
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,920
Then I directly take this village

2338
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:57,920
The result of the report

2339
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,920
But when we designed it

2340
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,920
It's just that there's no control

2341
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,920
Then we use the model

2342
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,920
It's not a return model

2343
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:05,920
We can put some variables

2344
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,920
Put it in to control

2345
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,920
Just the whole

2346
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,920
The whole structure is not the same

2347
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,920
I hope

2348
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:12,920
If of course agree

2349
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,920
If there is more control

2350
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,920
Maybe it's better

2351
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,920
But I'm not doing it

2352
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,920
Professional in this area

2353
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,920
It's just that we have this model

2354
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,920
No

2355
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,920
I'm sorry

2356
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:25,920
That's about it

2357
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,920
Okay

2358
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,920
So do you have any questions for

2359
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:33,920
Is there any question?

2360
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,920
For the first study

2361
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,920
Second study

2362
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,920
Or even a front one

2363
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,920
For your academic history

2364
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,920
Such a question

2365
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,920
Hello Wei

2366
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,920
I would like to ask again

2367
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,920
Is the second experiment

2368
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,920
What is the analysis method you use

2369
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,920
This is a more detailed process

2370
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,920
Ok

2371
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,920
Um

2372
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:55,920
Ok

2373
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,920
We are first

2374
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,920
Uh

2375
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,920
Then I might have to start from

2376
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,920
I'm thinking about where to start

2377
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,920
What we care about is

2378
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,920
A intervention

2379
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,920
Its effect

2380
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,920
Is there any way to extend it to this social network

2381
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,920
Friends in the middle

2382
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,920
Is that you give a person this intervention

2383
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:17,920
It's this intervention

2384
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,920
Is there any way to spread to a friend

2385
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,920
So we measure

2386
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,920
Is this intervention

2387
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,920
In different directions

2388
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,920
Is that we have different directions

2389
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:28,920
That's what I just said

2390
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:29,920
The 39 questions

2391
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,920
Is to commit suicide

2392
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,920
Suicide prevention-related 39 questions

2393
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,920
That every question

2394
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:34,920
We can say

2395
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,920
It has good results

2396
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,920
With no good results

2397
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,920
It's like smoking

2398
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,920
Smoking may be bad

2399
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,920
Smoking may be good

2400
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,920
That has this information

2401
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,920
This information is

2402
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,920
Uh, who participated

2403
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,920
We have these people's web map

2404
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:49,920
These people are

2405
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,920
Uh, we're sure this web map is true

2406
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,920
Then we know that there are some people

2407
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,920
Participate in our preventive research

2408
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,920
These intervention measures

2409
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,920
Then we also know

2410
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,920
These people are at two points in time

2411
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,920
His state in 39 questions

2412
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,920
Maybe 1 is a bad behavior

2413
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,920
Then 0 is no bad behavior

2414
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,920
So I follow this, uh, information

2415
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,920
I'm going to build a mathematical model

2416
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,920
The mathematical model is what we just talked about

2417
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,920
There are six aspects of this, uh, the amount of calculation

2418
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,920
The first two aspects are in this diet

2419
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,920
The relationship between x and y

2420
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,920
Or the relationship between u and v

2421
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,920
X or u

2422
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,920
Did he participate in this preventive behavior

2423
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:29,920
Did he participate in this preventive behavior

2424
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,920
This is the first two

2425
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,920
What about the last four

2426
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,920
At t equals 0

2427
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,920
This, uh, x and y

2428
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,920
Do they have this bad behavior

2429
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,920
The last two are t equals 1

2430
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,920
At this time

2431
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,920
Do u and v have this bad behavior

2432
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,920
So we're going to do these measurements

2433
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,920
It's just that we're going to look at this

2434
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,920
I just talked about this 011101

2435
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,920
He participated in x, y did not participate in x

2436
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,920
Bad behavior

2437
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,920
Bad behavior

2438
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,920
Bad behavior

2439
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,920
At t equals 0

2440
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,920
X has no bad behavior

2441
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,920
Y has bad behavior

2442
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,920
At t equals 1

2443
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,920
Let's see

2444
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,920
Then compare with random

2445
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:05,920
Random how to compare

2446
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,920
Random is that we put these things

2447
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,920
After calculating this value

2448
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,920
And then we look at it as a, uh, here's a

2449
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,920
It's a binomial distribution

2450
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,920
It's every experiment

2451
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,920
Its, uh, the probability of production may be different

2452
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,920
Then we can create it

2453
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,920
It's in every grid

2454
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,920
What is its expected value

2455
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:28,920
What is the expected value

2456
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,920
But we have the actual observed value here

2457
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,920
Because we are at t equals 0

2458
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,920
When t equals 1

2459
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:34,920
There are different observable values

2460
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,920
They took this value

2461
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,920
It's called M2, the real value

2462
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,920
Compare with a thousand random repeated experiments

2463
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,920
See if it's more obvious or less obvious

2464
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,920
If it's too obvious

2465
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:47,920
We say, okay, this aspect

2466
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,920
It has a positive result

2467
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,920
If it's not obvious

2468
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,920
We say, okay, no, it doesn't have a negative effect

2469
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,920
It doesn't, it has an obvious negative result

2470
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,920
So the final way to present it is

2471
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,920
39 questions

2472
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,920
There are eight aspects of our measurement

2473
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,920
Some of them are good

2474
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,920
You see the red one

2475
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,920
The bigger it is, the more obvious it is

2476
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,920
Some of them are negative

2477
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,920
The bigger it is, the more obvious it is

2478
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,920
So that's about the whole process

2479
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,920
I don't know

2480
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,920
I think there's no problem with the statistics

2481
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,920
You explained it very clearly

2482
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,920
But I want to know

2483
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,920
By the time of this page

2484
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,920
How to put these different factors

2485
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,920
Make a

2486
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,920
It's clear in terms of understanding

2487
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,920
Network or something

2488
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,920
It's a kind of narrative

2489
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,920
A description

2490
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,920
Yes, that's good

2491
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,920
If that's the case

2492
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,920
We can look at it based on one question

2493
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,920
Then we'll see

2494
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:41,920
I'll just say it here

2495
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:42,920
Suppose it's the 24th question

2496
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,920
We'll see

2497
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,920
I don't know if you can see my cursor

2498
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,920
I'll look at the 24th question

2499
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:47,920
Q24

2500
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,920
The first one is

2501
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,920
Diffusion of Prevention

2502
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,920
It's a big blue triangle

2503
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:53,920
It's negative

2504
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,920
That is to say

2505
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,920
If this person participates

2506
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,920
His M1 is a significant negative

2507
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,920
What is M1

2508
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,920
M1 is what I just said

2509
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,920
There are eight indicators here

2510
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,920
The M1 indicator

2511
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,920
We'll look at the definition of the M1 indicator

2512
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,920
The definition of the M1 indicator is

2513
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,920
You participate in this intervention

2514
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,920
Will it cause

2515
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,920
The change in your direct state

2516
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,920
Is from good to bad

2517
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,920
From bad to good

2518
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,920
This is from 1 to 0

2519
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,920
That's under this degree

2520
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:23,920
This is blue

2521
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,920
So this is a significant negative

2522
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:26,920
That is to say

2523
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:27,920
He himself

2524
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,920
He can't have this

2525
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,920
From 1 to 0

2526
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,920
The second problem is red

2527
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:34,920
The second face is red

2528
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:35,920
M2 is red

2529
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,920
The third and fourth are not significant

2530
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,920
The fifth is red

2531
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,920
The others are

2532
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,920
Sorry

2533
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,920
24 is the fifth significant

2534
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,920
The sixth is the small negative

2535
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,920
Then the seventh and eighth are not

2536
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,920
The conclusion of the statistical significance

2537
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,920
So we are all based on

2538
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,920
Let's understand the questions one by one

2539
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,920
Let's look at the eight indicators we just talked about

2540
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,920
The eight indicators are different

2541
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,920
Then I am in the article

2542
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,920
We have defined these eight indicators

2543
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,920
What are you measuring

2544
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,920
So the final interpretation is that you see

2545
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,920
There are 39 questions

2546
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,920
We measured 39 questions

2547
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,920
Within two waves

2548
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,920
Is there any significant improvement

2549
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,920
Or obvious retreat

2550
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,920
So I don't know if that's the case

2551
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:19,920
I want to ask

2552
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,920
Because you have 39 indicators

2553
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,920
Have you considered doing

2554
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,920
For example, factor analysis

2555
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,920
Or a multi-scale analysis

2556
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,920
Let the connectivity between the 39

2557
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,920
A clearer network context

2558
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,920
Actually, I think it's good

2559
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:37,920
I think we should do it

2560
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,920
Because 39

2561
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,920
We didn't do it

2562
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,920
but

2563
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:41,920
I think it's good

2564
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:42,920
Because of this 39 question

2565
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,920
There must be a lot

2566
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,920
There are many repeated

2567
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,920
There are many repeated parts

2568
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,920
That is

2569
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:50,920
But we

2570
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,920
We didn't do it on this issue

2571
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,920
We put this question

2572
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,920
These 39 are seen as independent 39

2573
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,920
In fact, the first question will not affect

2574
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,920
To the second question

2575
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,920
Will not affect the third question

2576
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,920
You can think of it as 39

2577
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:01,920
Indicators run together

2578
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:02,920
But I agree

2579
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:03,920
I totally agree

2580
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,920
Say you can do factor analysis

2581
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,920
Or decrease

2582
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,920
These are all possible

2583
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,920
But we haven't done that yet

2584
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,920
OK, thank you

2585
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,920
Thank you

2586
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,920
Thank you all

2587
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,920
Because of time

2588
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,920
We want to say

2589
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,920
This is the last question

2590
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,920
Then I will represent everyone

2591
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,920
Give this warm applause

2592
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:23,920
Very, very exciting

2593
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,920
Thank you all

2594
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:25,920
Thank you

2595
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:26,920
Thank you all

2596
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,920
Thank you

2597
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,920
OK, OK

2598
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,920
Before the end

2599
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,920
This is again

2600
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,920
Business time again

2601
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,920
We are still collecting

2602
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,920
More of this
