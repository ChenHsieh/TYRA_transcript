00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Recording has started.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
All right.

00:30.000 --> 00:50.000
In 2011 and 2015, he received his master's and Ph.D. degrees from the Narrow Engineering and Microsystems Institute of Tsinghua University.

00:50.000 --> 01:02.000
He also served as a postdoc researcher at the University of Illinois's Urban Champion.

01:02.000 --> 01:13.000
He is currently working as an assistant professor in the Department of Power and Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University.

01:13.000 --> 01:26.000
Today, Prof. Ming-Huang will be giving a presentation on RF Microdevices Based on the ThinFILM Lithium NeoBit.

01:26.000 --> 01:41.000
Prof. Ming-Huang, please give us a warm welcome and applause.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Thank you for your introduction. I am Prof. Ming-Huang Li.

01:46.000 --> 01:58.000
I am currently working as an assistant professor in the Department of Power and Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
My background is the same as what I just introduced.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I received my master's degree in mechanical engineering from Tsinghua University.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
After that, I completed my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
After completing my Ph.D. degree, I briefly served as a postdoc for a year in Taiwan.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I then looked for opportunities to work as a postdoc in the United States.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Later, I was able to successfully work as a postdoc in the ECE Department of UIUC.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
My main research topics are divided into two directions.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
The first one is a funding project for me.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
It is a DAPA Amoeba project.

02:37.000 --> 02:46.000
The goal is to develop a low-frequency mechanical rectifier that can be used in the military.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
At the same time, we have another project under execution.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
This is the topic I am going to talk about.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
This is the topic I am going to talk about.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
This is the topic I am going to talk about.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
My research interests are these.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Whether it is a static power supply or a power supply,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
As long as it is a microcomputing component or a supercomputer component,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
They are all in my area of interest.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Thank you.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
This is my outline today.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
First, I will start with our motivation.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
The motivation is divided into two parts.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
The first part is why we want to apply the sound wave component to the RF system.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
It has a very long history.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
But maybe everyone doesn't know why.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
So I will start from this point.

03:50.000 --> 04:00.000
Next, I will explain why lithium niobate is now considered to have a chance to become a star of the day.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
I will introduce a few classic components in the current field.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Then I will explain their characteristics one by one.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Finally, there are two simple case studies.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
The latter two parts are what I am doing.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
The first one is about the adjustment of the temperature coefficient.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
And its theoretical calculation and simulation.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
The second part is what I started to do after I returned to Taiwan.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Due to these small components,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Usually, you have to make it with a seamless device.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
If the device is not so useful,

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
In fact, the performance of the components will not be so ideal.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
So after returning to Taiwan, we hope to reduce the loading in the process as much as possible.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
So we developed all the thin-shaped lithium niobate components.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
After returning to Taiwan, we hope to use the same concept.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
We use surface-to-surface components to make.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
We have also achieved some results recently.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
The first part is my motivation.

05:07.000 --> 05:16.000
Just like all human life requirements,

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
We hope to obtain information quickly and conveniently.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
This is why the communication system has been improving.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
From 2G and 3G decades ago to 4G and 5G in recent years,

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
We all hope that the communication system can meet all our needs.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
It also includes high-speed transmission, low latency, and high reliability.

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
Based on this requirement, 5G communication is divided into three categories.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
The first is high-speed, the so-called ENBB part.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
It mainly uses high frequency bandwidth.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Because when the center frequency is higher,

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
The same ratio of bandwidth allows you to accommodate more communication channels.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
This can improve the transmission speed of your data.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
On the other hand, we also hope to have a low latency network.

06:23.000 --> 06:32.000
Low latency network is used for safety or special applications.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
For example, the network of a self-driving car.

06:34.000 --> 06:43.000
If the network is interrupted in the process of self-driving,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
It may not be able to receive important information.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
This will create some doubts about the safety of passengers.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
Therefore, this low latency and uninterrupted network is also an important part of 5G.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
In addition, in smart homes or smart cities,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
In the future, we will hope to build an Internet of Things system.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Therefore, we also hope to have some low-power transmission

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
To meet the applications of these sensor nodes.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
Since 5G divides our needs into three categories,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
It is impossible for them to operate on the same frequency band.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Because the frequency band is limited,

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
The number of channels or users that can be accommodated within the frequency band is also limited.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
So it is obvious that if we want to meet these three needs at the same time,

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
It must be distributed in different frequencies on the distribution of frequency bands.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
So we can see at the bottom of this picture,

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
In fact, 5G is divided into three parts.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Low-band is less than 1GHz,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Mid-band is between 1GHz and 6GHz,

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
High-band is between 6GHz and 100GHz.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Generally, Low-band and Mid-band are divided into FR1,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And MW is divided into FR2.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
Is there any difference between 5G frequency band, 4G and 3G?

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
In fact, there is a big difference.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
The main difference is that 5G hopes to

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
Use the limited frequency left by the communication system.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And hope to give them a new mission.

08:39.000 --> 08:47.000
So in addition to the existing 3G and 4G infrastructure in the 5G communication system,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
It also needs to insert these new frequencies in addition.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
The biggest challenge of these new frequencies is that

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
It is very different from the traditional 4G network or 3G communication.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
The frequency range of some bands is very large.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
For example, we have the so-called band N77 and band N79.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
These two frequencies may account for more than 10% of the frequency range.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
In terms of N77, it accounts for 24%.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
For higher frequency bands, such as band 258,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Its frequency range is about 10%.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
The size of the frequency range has a great impact on hardware design.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Because at present, most of the radio waves used in the current communication system,

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
Especially in mobile phones, are radio waves.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
The frequency range of these radio waves is limited.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
The frequency range of these radio waves is usually controlled by the characteristics of its voltage material.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
So for the current frequency range of 10% to 20%,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
It is very difficult to achieve with the current technology.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
So this is a new challenge from the system to the hardware design.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
We also believe that we can get some new opportunities in this new challenge.

10:10.000 --> 10:25.000
This graph shows the communication system architecture used by 3G, 4G, EET, and 5G carriers.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Compared with the traditional 3G and 4G,

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
It is obvious that 5G wants to have more applications,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
So it has more usable frequency bands.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
In order to properly process these signals, we need more filters.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
The filter is used to process a specific frequency band signal.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
For example, if the center frequency band of my filter is 1GHz,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
And the frequency band is 400MHz,

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
So I will probably go from 980MHz to 1020MHz.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
The frequency in the middle is allowed to pass.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
I will try to suppress the signal beyond this frequency band.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
So I can use these filters alone to select the communication frequency band I want,

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
And erase other signals.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
In this way, it will be more convenient for me to process the following signals,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
And the error rate will be lower.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Since the frequency band keeps increasing,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
As we described earlier,

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
When the frequency band increases, we need more filters.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
These filters also hope to have large frequency bands.

11:47.000 --> 11:56.000
Therefore, the characteristics of the filter and its size need to be precisely controlled.

11:56.000 --> 12:05.000
Especially if we want the phone to be able to use 5G communication properly,

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
So many filters have to be stuffed into the phone.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Therefore, the size of the filter is very strict.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
This brings us to the first topic today.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Why do we want to apply the frequency band software to 5G communication?

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Especially 5G communication with strict size restrictions.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
The reason is that the frequency band is lower than the battery band.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Therefore, the size of the frequency band will be smaller than the battery band.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
In the above picture,

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
We can compare the EM duplexer in the form of a battery band,

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
And the duplexer produced by the frequency band software.

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
The size of the duplexer is 10 times smaller than the battery band.

13:04.000 --> 13:16.000
Therefore, we can expect a frequency band to be 100 times smaller than the EM duplexer.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
In the same space, we can put more frequency band filters to meet our communication needs.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
The frequency band is a mechanical resonance component.

13:29.000 --> 13:39.000
In general, the quality of mechanical resonance will be higher than that of the EM duplexer.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Therefore, it usually has the characteristics of low insertion loss.

13:44.000 --> 13:55.000
The most important thing is that the EM duplexer still needs to go through the steps required by the general semiconductor manufacturing process.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
For example, exposure, salinity, time, etc.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
These technologies are very mature in the industrial world.

14:02.000 --> 14:12.000
Therefore, the EM duplexer can also be mass-produced and maintain a very stable salinity.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Sorry, I have a question.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Please go ahead.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
It's a bit of an outlandish question.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Because what I'm doing is resonator, but what I'm doing is superconductor.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
So, I don't understand.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
What is the reason for the fundamental physics?

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
The quality factor of the resonator will be higher and the loss factor will be lower.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Because it feels like it uses a lot of energy to vibrate something.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
It has the effect of EM in a space.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
I can't understand intuitively why its quality is better.

14:47.000 --> 14:56.000
In my opinion, this wave can be limited to a certain range.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Because mechanical vibration can be understood as

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
For example, I take a beam and let it vibrate.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Its boundary is very clear.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
Because my beam is a beam with a fixed length and height.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
So when it vibrates, it's like it's in this object.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It produces a beam.

15:18.000 --> 15:28.000
But if it's EM, I'm not sure if it has such a good boundary to limit its EM.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
It's the distribution of electromagnetic waves in space that produces a beam.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
But I do know that there are some high-quality EM resonators.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's like some dielectric resonators.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
It should be a transmission line mode.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Its Q can reach several hundred.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
But in terms of deep wave components,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
At present, commercial components,

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
We call it an amplifier component of a deep wave filter.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Its Q can reach about 4000 to 5000.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
So I think it still has a difference of one or two quantities.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh, I see. Okay, thank you.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Okay, I'll go on.

16:15.000 --> 16:24.000
At present, 4G LTE has a lot of communication frequency.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
Usually, there are about 3 to 4 wireless modules in a mobile phone.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
To meet the needs of different frequencies.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
For example, Wi-Fi has 2.4G and 5G.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
These two may be a module.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
The traditional GSM communication and CDMA communication may be another module.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
In such a module, it will contain a lot of active and passive components.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
For example, in terms of this package,

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
It contains 4 PA, which is the so-called power amplifier.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
To generate enough energy for long-distance transmission.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
It has 18 filters and 5 switch modules.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
There is also a collective circuit for communication.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
There is also a chip for impedance matching.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
So in such a module, it actually contains 18 filters.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
So we can imagine that if there are three such modules in our mobile phone.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
It has more than 50 filters.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
In the future, we hope that 5G can accommodate more bands.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
So we can expect that the number of filters will continue to increase.

17:41.000 --> 17:50.000
At the same size, we hope that these filters can be small and high-performance.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
So this is also the main challenge of the current filter design.

17:55.000 --> 18:07.000
The second part is to explain why we think that Li-Lian NIOBE is a material with a good prospect.

18:07.000 --> 18:18.000
Before the introduction of this LN, we can briefly review the three common transmitters.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
The first one on the left is the traditional transceiver.

18:24.000 --> 18:33.000
Its material is usually Li-Lian NIOBE or Li-Lian TENTALATE.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
These two materials are all man-made crystals.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
So they generally do not appear in the normal environment.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Because they are man-made crystals.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
Because the traditional transceiver uses a thicker base.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
So when we use a very small indexing electrode to stimulate the sound wave on the surface.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
It usually forms a surface wave.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
There are many forms of surface waves.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
But the most common ones are usually Rayleigh waves or Leaky waves.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
The Leaky wave has the opportunity to get a relatively large magnetic resonance.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
But its loss will also be relatively large.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
In terms of Rayleigh waves, its typical magnetic resonance factor is about 7%.

19:20.000 --> 19:28.000
In our field, we are used to using KT² or KEffective² symbols to represent magnetic resonance.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Its Q is about 1000.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
The second one is also the most popular model of transceiver at present.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
We call it FBAR.

19:40.000 --> 19:50.000
It is a transceiver with a film buck acoustic wave resonator.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
After a long search and research,

19:54.000 --> 20:03.000
we finally determined that aluminum nitride is the most suitable commercial application for FBAR.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Because other materials have more or less other problems.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
Its general magnetic resonance factor can give you about 6.5%.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Its Q is about 3000 in 2GHz.

20:16.000 --> 20:24.000
But there are already some companies, such as Brokon, which is the predecessor of Avago.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
In terms of Brokon, their Q should be able to do more than 45,000.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
In order to strengthen its magnetic resonance feature,

20:34.000 --> 20:43.000
some researches will use KONG element to dope it into aluminum nitride.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Generally, it is used to improve the transceiver.

20:47.000 --> 20:55.000
When aluminum nitride is sputtered, KONG element is used to dope it into aluminum nitride.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
The higher the content of KONG element, the higher its magnetic resonance factor will be.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
However, due to the increase in the defect of KONG element,

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
KONG element's magnetic resonance factor will decrease as time goes by.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
The third type is the so-called LAMP wave.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
It is usually made from aluminum nitride.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
It is a fairly good material now.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Its coupling is about 6.5%.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
Because its thickness becomes very thin,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
it is usually less than one wavelength.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
You can see that its electrode configuration is very similar to that of SOHL.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
However, what it triggers is not a surface wave, but a body wave.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
The body wave will be described by another set of equations.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
So it will have completely different characteristics from SOHL.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
Since the coupling of aluminum nitride itself is not particularly strong,

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
and its coupling will change according to the direction of the electrode and the form of the wave,

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
its coupling will generally be between 1% and 4.5%.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
The Q value is about 2000.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
By combining the above three different components,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
we can see that we are very concerned about its two characteristics.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
The first is its magnetic resonance.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
The second is the quality factor.

22:29.000 --> 22:39.000
The definition of magnetic resonance is probably the ratio of mechanical energy to total energy.

22:39.000 --> 22:49.000
Because we want to know how much energy is transferred from electricity to the mechanical field

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
when we give some energy to the electrode on the surface.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
So we generally use KT square as a very important indicator.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
The second indicator is the so-called quality factor.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Q has a lot of definitions,

23:04.000 --> 23:12.000
but the most widely known one is the ratio of the energy stored in our system

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
and the energy lost by each cycle of movement.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
So the higher the Q, the lower the energy loss.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
When the energy loss is lower, I have a chance to make a green wave that has a lower energy loss.

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
Because KT square and Q are very important,

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
we will define our performance indicator,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
which is to multiply Q by KT square.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
So we can use F bar as an example.

23:47.000 --> 23:55.000
Its performance indicator is probably between 100 and 200.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
This graph shows...

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Sorry, I have a question.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Can I go back to the last page?

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
You said that your excitation is at 2 GHz,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
but my question is that,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
for example, the受 is the surface wave,

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
or the lamp wave on the right is the body wave.

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
Is the excitation mode 2 GHz or not?

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
My question is, what is its phonon frequency?

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
It's 2 GHz.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Oh, so that's only a few million EVs.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Let me check the Planck constant.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
It should be.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Okay, I see. Thank you.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
In fact, according to the characteristics of IDT,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
it has a periodicity.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
So its complete cycle will be a wavelength.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
So we will also use the size of these wavelengths

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
and the relationship of IDT cycle to design a mode that suits them.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
That's how it works in practice.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Okay, so I just checked.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Okay, so I just checked.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I'm more used to the unit of energy.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Anyway, it's multiplied by h.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So what I mean is,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
I'm curious about one thing,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
that is, if 2 GHz is multiplied by Planck constant,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
it's less than 10 mEV.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
That is to say,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
if I give this device at least 10 mEV,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
it will have a signal.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
It will trigger a quantum, right?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
A quantum.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
I'm not so sure about the definition of physics.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Oh, okay.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
But basically, its mode is 2 GHz mode.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
That's for sure.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Okay, I see. Okay, thank you.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
This graph shows

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
the motion of these three different components.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Generally speaking,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
the Resonator of the Soul

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
is made on the surface of the crystal,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
so there is no boundary around it.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
So we will artificially add

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
the so-called Acoustic Reflector.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
It is made in the form of the so-called Block Reflector.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
That is, my grating,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
its cycle,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
is about a quarter of the wavelength.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
This method of stacking

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
to enhance its ripple on the boundary reflection.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
On the right,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
you can see the motion of its surface wavelength.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Its motion mode

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
has a ripple on the surface.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Then in the depth of the crystal,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
about a few lambda below,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
it is a non-moving state.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
So its ripple exists on the surface of the system.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
What is different from the surface wavelength

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
is that the two graphs below,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
which are FFAR and LandWave,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
they are vibrating the whole structure.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
FFAR is a longitudinal mode

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
in the center of the crystal.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
So its upper and lower surfaces

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
will move in different directions.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Then the center of this material

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
is the node of the movement,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
so its stress will be the greatest.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
On the right,

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
it is the so-called LandWave motion mode.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Although LandWave

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
also uses the IDT electrode as the trigger,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
its upper and lower surfaces are free surfaces,

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
so it generally has two different motion modes.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
The first is the so-called symmetrical motion,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
that is, the upper and lower surfaces

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
move in different directions.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
So its center plane

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
is a mirror mode.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
The second is the so-called asymmetric motion,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
that is, the upper and lower surfaces

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
move in the same direction.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
So it is more like a high-speed fractal mode.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
After understanding the basic components

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
and their motion and some of its characteristics,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
we can talk about

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
how to make a deep wave filter.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
In fact, when we generally analyze,

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
we will only look at its physical behavior

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
at the level of a device,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
that is, at the level of a single rectifier.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
But when it comes to designing a filter,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
we generally use

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
the so-called ladder filter circuit.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
With such a circuit,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
we can treat each rectifier

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
as an independent component,

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
so we use a simplified model to describe it.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
In terms of a rectifier system,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
it can be seen as a combination of

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
quality, resistance, and strength.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
On the circuit,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
we can find that

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
it has the same motion

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
as the connected

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
resistor, capacitor, and inductor.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
It has the same mathematical form.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
So we also tend to use

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
such a set of equivalent circuits

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
to describe it.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Because of this,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
we can directly use

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
the circuit design tools

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
to design and simulate.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
It will be more convenient.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
With such a set of equivalent circuits,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
it also has a C0

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
parallel to the main

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
motional branch.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
The meaning of this C0

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
is that it is a static capacitor

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
produced between the

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
rectifier capacitor

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
or the electrode

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Such a model

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
is usually called

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Modified Butterworth-Van Dyck model

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
or MVVD model.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Such a set of models

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
can be seen on the circuit

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
as a

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
rectifier and

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
a anti-rectifier model.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Its rectifier frequency

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
is mainly connected

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
by the connected

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
RLC.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
The parallel rectification

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
is determined by the

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
ratio of Cm and C0.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
After obtaining

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
a single rectifier

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
motion form,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
we can start

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
designing the filter.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
In the case of

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Ladder Filter,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
it has a series resonator

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
and a parallel resonator.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
In general,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
the wavelength of the parallel resonator

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
is slightly different from

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
that of the series resonator.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
We want to

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
match the

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
anti-rectifier frequency

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
of the parallel resonator

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
with the series resonator.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Through such a circuit,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
we can use

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
two parallel resonators

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
with different frequencies

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
to form the

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
passband of the filter.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
The passband can be controlled.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
As long as

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
we carefully select

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
the separation

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
of the resonator,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
the parallel resonator

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
and the anti-rectifier,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
we can achieve the effect of

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
controlling the wavelength.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
In theory,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
there seems to be a way to

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
make it.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
However,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
by observing such a circuit,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
we can find that

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
the K effective square

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
is limited by a factor.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
After some

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
deductions,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
we can find that

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
the K effective square

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
is related to

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Fp and Fs.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Another potential factor

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
is that it is related to

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
the opamp factor.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
On the other hand,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
the opamp factor

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
determines the size of

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
the K effective square

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
and affects the separation

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
between Fp and Fs.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
In order to meet the requirements

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
of 5G communication,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
such as 10% and 20%

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
frequency,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
we must find

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
the K effective square

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
as the basis of

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
the design of the resonator.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Therefore,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
let's look at

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
the material

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
lithium niobate.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
It is a material

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
with a long history.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It was probably

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
synthesized

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
30 or 40 years ago,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and it has a very

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
unique feature of

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
a three-dimensional

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
crystal structure.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Therefore,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
it has different

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
opamp characteristics

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
in different wave directions.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It has also been widely used

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
in the design of

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
this kind of

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
surface wave components.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
For general

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
surface wave components,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
its pixel speed is

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
about 4000mps.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Its effective coupling

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
is about 17%,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
and its Q is about 1000.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
However,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
we have always thought

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
that we did not fully

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
apply the characteristics of

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
this material,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
because its K effective square

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
is actually much lower

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
than the theoretical prediction value

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
of this material.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Therefore,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
about 20 years ago,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
there was a famous paper

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
that mainly analyzed

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
the coupling of

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
lithium niobate crystal

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
in three different directions.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Since lithium niobate

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
is a three-dimensional crystal,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
it has different characteristics

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
for its X-cut,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Y-cut and Z-cut.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
The so-called X-cut

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
refers to

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
the X-axis of the material

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
as the Y-axis of the crystal,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
and the wave transmission

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
will be on the YZ plane.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Similarly,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
the Y-cut and Z-cut

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
respectively represent

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
the wave transmission

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
on the ZX and XY planes.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
This article

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
mainly discusses

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
the thickness

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
of the three different

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
cuts and

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
the thickness of the different

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
waves.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
It can be seen that

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
whether it is X-cut or

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Y-cut,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
in terms of these three cuts,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
we target

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
two modes respectively.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
The first is the so-called SH0,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
which is the level-cut mode.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It can be seen that

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
there is almost no up-and-down movement

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
on the surface,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
and its movement occurs

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
in the shear inside the plane.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
The second mode

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
is the so-called S0 mode,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
which is similar to SH0.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
There is no up-and-down movement

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
on the surface,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
but its wave transmission

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
is in the shear inside the plane.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Based on the analysis

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
of these two modes,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
it can be found that

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
when you select the thickness

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
of the film properly,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
the K-square,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
that is,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
the thickness of the film,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
has a chance to reach 30%

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
or more than 40%.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
From this theory,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
it can be found that

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
when we

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
thin the film

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
from the thick wafer

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
to a very thin film,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
it actually has a chance

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
to get a very large

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
film thickness,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
which can meet

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
our demand for

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
high-frequency green wafers.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
As for this technology,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
why did it start to develop

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
around 2010,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
mainly because

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
lithium nitrate

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
itself is a material

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
that is not easy to process,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
and it has a very good

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
resistance to

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
all kinds of acids and alkynes.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
This threshold

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
was broken about 10 years ago,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
which is mainly the progress

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
of smart card technology,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
which allows us

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
to do research

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
at a relatively

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
cheap price

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
to obtain such a crystal.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
The method of smart card

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
is like this.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
We mainly prepare two wafers.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
One is the pressure crystal

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
we need,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
and the other is the

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
board we carry

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
the pressure film.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
So at the beginning,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
we put a very thin layer

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
of electrolyte

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
on the pressure crystal,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
and then,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
in addition to being used

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
for bonding,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
it can also be used

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
to resist

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
the depth of lithium nitrate

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
and can be used

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
for bonding.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So when we do smart card,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
we use the

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
lithium nitrate arrangement method

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
to inject a thin layer of

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
lithium nitrate

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
into a certain depth

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
on the surface of the crystal,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
and then,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
after a simple surface

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
cleaning and bonding,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
use a heat treatment method

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
to produce a stronger

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
heat resistance

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
and then crack

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
on that layer,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
separating the two layers of crystal.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
So finally,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
after the bonded crystal

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
is exposed to the surface,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
the surface is very smooth

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
and the pressure material

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
is very thin.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
This material is very suitable

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
for some subsequent processing

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
to get the lithium nitrate

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
we need.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Okay,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
do you have any questions?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
If not,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I will continue to the next part.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Before we

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
design the components,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
we will briefly

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
discuss these

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
thin boards

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
and their transmission behavior.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Generally speaking,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
there are two main modes

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
for thin boards.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
The first mode

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
is called Rayleigh-Lamb Wave.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
The second mode

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
is called Shear Horizontal Wave.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
These two modes

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
are completely different.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
However,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
both Rayleigh-Lamb

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and Shear Horizontal Wave

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
have the same feature

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
that they

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
have the so-called

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Shear Horizontal Wave.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
The Shear Horizontal Wave

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
can be simply understood as

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
the wavelength of the wave

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
for a certain mode.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Its wavelength

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
will actually

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
depend on

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
the thickness of the thin board.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
For this S0-Lamb Wave,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
when my board

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
is very, very thin,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
its wavelength

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
may be close to 10,000 ms.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
However,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
when I slowly

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
thicken my thin board,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
it will actually

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
transform from Rayleigh-Lamb Wave

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
to Rayleigh-Wave.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Therefore,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
their final frequency

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
will be close to the thin frequency.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Therefore,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
it can be clearly seen that

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
in these different waves,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
in addition to

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
the different waves,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
the frequency will also

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
be affected by the thickness.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Therefore, their frequency

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
is very important.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Since the frequency

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
has frequency,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
other features

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
and features

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
will also have frequency.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
For example,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
the Shear Horizontal Wave

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
is also a parameter

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
with frequency.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Next,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
we will use

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
the so-called

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
30° Rotated Y-Cut

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Lithium Niobate

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
as an example.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
This is a simulated

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
result.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Let's assume

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
that the surface of

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
the Y-X Lithium Niobate

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
is coated with

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
periodic IDT electrodes.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Through these electrodes,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
we can trigger

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
a frequency

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
called

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
a0s0

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and a1s1.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
In addition to

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
LandWave,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
there are other

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
so-called

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Shear Horizontal Wave.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
When the thickness of the electrode

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
is increased to a wavelength,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
almost all the

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
frequencies of the wave

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
will decrease.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Except for a special wave

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
called

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
a0s0 Shear Horizontal Wave,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
which is almost a parameter,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
other frequencies

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
will be significantly affected.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
In addition to the frequency,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
the periodic IDT

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
is also a parameter

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
that is very sensitive.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
So we can see that

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
these different modes

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
have a very big difference

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
in the thickness

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
of the electrodes

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
under different thicknesses.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
In this picture,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
with such a special section

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
and a specific

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
wave direction,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
we can find that

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
it actually has a lot of potential

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
because its periodic IDT

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
can be greater than 40%.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Therefore,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
such a material

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
with such a

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Shear Horizontal Wave

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
will obviously be

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
quite suitable for

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
wide-frequency wave design.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I have a question.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
This picture

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
is normalized by lambda,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
but if it is actually

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
a few gigahertz,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
is it one centimeter?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Is it millimeter scale?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
It should be

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
in micrometer scale.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Micrometer scale?

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Yes.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Because it is related to

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
the frequency,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
the frequency of each mode

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
is actually quite different.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
So for SH,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
it is about

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
4,000 to 5,000 meters per second.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
So if it is operated

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
at 1 gigahertz,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
its thickness should be

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
less than 1 micron,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
in order to achieve

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
such a high coupling.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I see.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Thank you.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I have a question here.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Sorry.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Does KT

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
square

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
equal 100%

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
have any special meaning?

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Does it mean that their energy can be exchanged?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
So far,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I have not seen 100%.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
But I think

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
in theory,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
in terms of definition,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
it is true.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
100% means that

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
if you add

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
1 mW RF,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
it will produce

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
1 mW phonon.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I don't know

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
if it can be directly

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
seen as phonon.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
We generally

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
see it as

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
an energy coin.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Because

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
its

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
K effective square

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
is equal to

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Cm divided by C0.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Cm represents

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
motional capacitance.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It is actually related to

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
my mechanical strength.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
C0 is my

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
capacitance,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
and Cm is my

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
actual capacitance.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
There are two kinds of energy.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
The first one is

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
1 mole

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
divided by

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
CmV square.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It is a

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
mechanical domain energy.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
The second one is

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
1 mole divided by

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
C0V square.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
It is an

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
electrical domain energy.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
It is 1 mole

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
divided by

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
CmV square.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
It is a

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
mechanical domain energy.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
If we imagine it as

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
a wave source,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
we can also use

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
the MCK system

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
to represent

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
the energy produced

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
by its spring energy

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
and my

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
actual transducer capacitance.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Can I use

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
your explanation?

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Yes.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
According to

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
their high coupling

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
characteristics,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
these articles

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
were published

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
in 2015.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
They are new

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
results.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
According to

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
their materials,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
they started

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
to look for

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
new components.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
The first article

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
is a

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
level-cut module.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
It

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
uses

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
two

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
pairs of capacitors.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
It is similar to

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
the form of a fingerprint capacitor,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
but it has only one pair.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
It is a

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
level-cut module.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
It uses

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
two pairs of

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
capacitors

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
to generate

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
SH0

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
by

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
coupling

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
the

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
current

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
and the

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
wave direction.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
According to

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
their

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
research,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
SH0

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
generates

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
SH0

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
by coupling

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
the current

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
and the wave direction.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
SH0

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
generates

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
SH0

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
by coupling

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
the current

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and the wave direction.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
We can also see that

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
when we set the frequency

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
to a relatively low range,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
because some special applications

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
do not require such a high frequency,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
for example, 50 MHz is enough,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
its Q can reach 5000,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
the coupling is also about 30%.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
The overall

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
performance indicator,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
which is KT square times Q,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
is about 1500.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
At present,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
the highest

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
coupling we have

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
is about this level.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Of course,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
we also find that

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
the Q value of the material

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
is quite related

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
to the thickness of

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
the thin film of

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
LN.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Because the

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
high-performance,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
high-Q, high-coupling,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and low-frequency capacitors

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
have a thickness of

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
about 2 microns,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
but the example on the right

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
is a study of

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
EPFL.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
What they use is very thin,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
only 400 nm

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
of LN.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
So,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
it can be seen that

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
even if it can reach a very high frequency,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
its Q

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
will drop from 5000

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
to 700.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
It can also reach

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
a very similar

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
electro-mechanical coupling

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
under the same

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
H over LN,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
that is,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
under the thickness of

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
normalization,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
which is about 30%.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
The third case is...

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Sorry,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I have a little problem

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
with the previous statement.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
My intuition is that

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
the effect of

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
LN is very large.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Is this right?

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Or is there another reason?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
This is our current guess.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Because we actually

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
used some AFN methods

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
to measure

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
some extremely thin

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
LN thin films.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
The roughness of those surfaces

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
is less than 1 nm.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
So we are not sure

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
why the Q

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
or other performance

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
will go up

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
as long as the film

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
is thin.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And when it is thin,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
the result will be worse.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Is there any reason

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
not to make it very thick?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Is it going to take a long time?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Is it expensive?

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Mainly based on

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
the previous picture.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
If my thickness is too thick,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I can't enjoy

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Oh, I got it.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Thank you.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
The third example

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
is the so-called

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
A1 mode resonator.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
This A1 mode

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
is a high-level LN wave.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
It looks like

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
it connects

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
many thickness-shear

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
waves together.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
So we can see

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
its movement

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
is horizontal

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
instead of vertical.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
The advantage of

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
such a resonator

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
is that

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
its feature size

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
is mainly controlled by

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
its thickness.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Because its thickness

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
direction becomes

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
its real 1 in 2 wavelength.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
So a very thin resonator

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
can achieve

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
a very high frequency

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
of coupling.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
So in this design,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
its Q is about

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
300-400.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
And its

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
operating frequency

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
is about 3.2 GHz.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
The coupling is about 40%.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
So by combining

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
the above demonstrations,

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
we can get

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
that S0, SH0

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
and A1 modes

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
are very potent

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
and can be applied

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
in high-level and high-coupling situations.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
However,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
there are

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
some relative

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
shortcomings.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
For example,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
due to the thinner membrane structure,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
it becomes unusually fragile.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
There may be

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
some problems

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
with the coupling.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Secondly,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
lithium niobate

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
is a material

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
with a very low thermal conduction rate.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Its thermal conduction rate

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
is only twice that of silicon oxide,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
which is about 1% or 2% of

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
metal.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
So it does not conduct heat very well.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
So when communicating

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
at high power,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
it can easily

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
have some negative effects.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Thirdly,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
its temperature factor

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
is quite high.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
So when the temperature

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
changes in the environment,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
when using mobile phones

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
in the suburbs

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
and in the northern and southern regions,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
the frequency will change

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
with the temperature.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
In this case,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
it is difficult to convince everyone

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
that it can do a good

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
and stable communication.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
So this is mainly

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
a few problems with this material.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
However,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
although it has some problems,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
some companies

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
and some research institutions

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
have also tried to use

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
such components to make

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
some durable and high-frequency

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
lithium niobate.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
The N79 filter above

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
satisfies the N79 band

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
mentioned earlier.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
The frequency is about 10% of the strict conditions.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
The center frequency is about 5GHz.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It uses

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
the so-called A1 mode

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
rectifier.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Below is what I did

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
with my colleagues at UIUC.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
It uses a higher mode

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
to make

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
a 10GHz filter.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Of course, it is a demo,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
so you can see that

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
its passband is not as beautiful

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
as the company's design.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Next,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I will quickly talk about

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
two case studies.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
The first one

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
is our goal

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
to reduce

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
the dependence of

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
this rectifier

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
on temperature.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Due to this temperature factor,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
it is mainly related to

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
the material.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
In terms of Ln,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
its temperature

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
factor is

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
about 70 to 90 ppm

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
per degree C.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
According to different

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
cutting surfaces,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
in order to

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
improve this performance

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
to be enough

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
for the filter

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
or rectifier to be used,

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
we would like to

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
reduce its TCF

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
from 60 to 70 ppm

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
to 20 ppm or less.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
In order to convince

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
others that

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
it is a candidate

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
for the future

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
wireless communication hardware.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Therefore,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
we do a simplified analysis

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
of its TCF source.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
TCF actually

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
refers to

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
the frequency,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
the normalized frequency

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
of temperature.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Therefore,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
in terms of mathematical form,

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
it is partial f, partial t

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
divided by its TCF frequency.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
After calculation,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
we can divide it into

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
three elements.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Since the frequency

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
is related to

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
the frequency of my wave

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
and the wave

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
is related to the

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
speed of my material

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
and its density,

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
the first element is

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
the frequency of my wave

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
with the change of temperature.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
The second element is

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
the frequency of my material

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
with the change of temperature.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
The third element is

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
the frequency of my material

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
with the change of temperature.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
In addition to these three elements,

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
there is another element

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
that is related to

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
the characteristics of

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
the pressure current.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Therefore,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
we need to understand

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
the characteristics of

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
its material first.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Traditionally,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
the method of temperature compensation

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
has been

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
in modern technology

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
for a long time.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
There is no better way

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
than this,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
which is to select

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
a material with

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
a perfect ratio.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
For example,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
the temperature factor of lithium niobate

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
is about negative 70 ppm per kelvin.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
However, silicon oxide,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
a very common material,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
has a positive temperature factor

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
of about 90 ppm per kelvin.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Therefore,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
if we can

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
perfectly

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
mix these two materials

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
with a perfect ratio,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
for example,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
silicon oxide,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
we can theoretically

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
reduce Tcf to zero.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
However,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
in the process of

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
such a production,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
we will find

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
that if we ignore

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
the wave

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
and its electric field

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
distribution

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
and its

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
motion distribution,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
it is actually

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
unpredictable.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Secondly,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
when the film becomes very thin,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
the metal electrode

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
on the top

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
will also have a certain degree of impact.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
In particular,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
the Tcf of the metal electrode

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
is generally quite large.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Therefore,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
when we want to

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
target some thin components

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
with high electromagnetic cohesiveness,

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
we must not ignore

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
the Tcf of the metal electrode.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
As early as 1985,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Professor Kenya Hashimoto

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
discussed

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
some deep-wave

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
temperature coefficients of delay

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
on different surfaces.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
For example,

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
a special op-amp material

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
has a free surface

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
with a metal electrode on the surface,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
but there is no power.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
It is an open-strip.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
The metal electrode on the surface

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
is short-circuited

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
and becomes short-strip,

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
or the whole surface is covered

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
with metal and grounded.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Every situation

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
will show that

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
their Tcf is different.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
In particular,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
in the two cases,

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
open-strip and short-strip,

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
the mechanical structure

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
of these two cases

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
has not changed.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
The difference is

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
whether the Tcf of the metal electrode

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
is grounded or not.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
It will also have a great impact

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
on the Tcf of the metal electrode.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
In conclusion,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
when we deal with

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
a material with

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
high Tcf,

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
we cannot ignore

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
the Tcf of the metal electrode.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
To solve this problem,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
we use

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
the so-called

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
multi-section model.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Since

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
our goal is

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
relatively simple,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
it is a deep wave

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
that only circulates in one dimensional space.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Therefore,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
we do not need to develop

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
too complicated 3D analysis.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
We hope to

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
transform

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
such a complex structure

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
with Tcf and metal

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
into a

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
multi-section model

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
with Tcf

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
and Tcf

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
in different areas

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
with different Tcf

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
and Tcf

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
in different areas

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
with different Tcf

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
and Tcf

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
and Tcf

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and Tcf

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
and Tcf

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and Tcf

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
and Tcf

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and Tcf

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and Tcf

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and Tcf

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
We also found that

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
in the case of

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
하대기

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
different areas

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
require different models.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
For example,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
we divide the graph into three zones.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
The first zone

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
is the free surface

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and the surface is open circuit.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That is, the surface has no electric field.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
The second zone

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
is the metal electrode

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
on the surface

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
and it gives a fixed voltage.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
It may be

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
a small signal

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
that is dc ground.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Its condition will become

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
a metallized surface

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
and a short circuit

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
boundary condition.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
The third zone is more complicated

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
because it is between two electrodes

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and it will

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
have a horizontal electric field

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
between the two electrodes.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
So we guess

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
when the metallization ratio

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
is very high,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
we should think

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
that the surface

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
has no electric field

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and it is a free surface

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
with a short circuit boundary.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
When the metal

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
is very small

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
and the two electrodes are

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
very far away,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
maybe we should use

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
the open circuit boundary

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
to describe it.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Based on this idea,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
we also use

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
the method of

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
finite element

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
to simulate

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
a thin film of

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
lithium niobate

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
to observe the temperature change

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and we can see

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
that its result

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
is quite similar

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
to what we just guessed.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
When the wavelength

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
is very long,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
it should be said

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
that it will

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
use the gap

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
as a boundary

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
of 2λ.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
When the wavelength

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
is less than 2λ,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
we generally

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
regard it as a short circuit

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
and if it is larger,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
we regard it as

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
an open circuit boundary.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Based on this hypothesis,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
we can simulate

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
the temperature coefficient

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
under three different cases

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
and then

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
combine it

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
with the mathematical formula

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
we just introduced.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Theoretically,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
we can predict

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
the temperature coefficient

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
of the uniformly distributed

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
resistors.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
In order to

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
do the experimental verification,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
we made

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
two different resistors.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
The first one

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
has a mechanical electrode

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and a capacitor.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
It can stimulate

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
the magnetic field of the resistors.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
The second one

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
has a capacitor and a capacitor

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
to stimulate the magnetic field

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
of the capacitors.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I have an idea.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Sorry.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Will it be published?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Well,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
you give it

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
a DC bias,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
VIN,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and GND.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Then you use the

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
SIO2 to

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
hold the material

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
you want.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
If you give it

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
a DC current,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
it will push

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
each other away.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
If you give it

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
a DC current,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
it will push

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
each other away.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
If you give it

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
a DC current,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
it will push

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
each other away.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Then you can use

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
the electrodes to

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
hold the substrate.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
You can use

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
the DC current

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
to resist

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
the temperature coefficient.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Is it feasible?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Let me think about it.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
The DC current

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
is from the VIN, right?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Yes.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I didn't say that.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I made a mistake.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
The two pictures

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
are the experimental

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
components.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
The picture on the left

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
has three electrodes.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Because it has

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
a capacitive electrode,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
it is suitable to

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
stimulate the osmosis.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
The picture on the right

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
has two electrodes,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
but it is arranged

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
as an array.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
The array

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
doesn't affect

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
the temperature coefficient.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
We use the array

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
to connect

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
all the electrodes

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
to enhance the output signal

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
for easy observation.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Then we can

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
process the components.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
First of all,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
we take a lithium-niobate wafer

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
use a low-temperature

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
layer of

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
oxidized gas

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
on the surface.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
We use the exposure

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
to define the

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
assembly shape of the components.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Then we use

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
a dry-etching method

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
to remove

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
lithium-niobate and

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
silicon oxide at the same time.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
The dry-etching

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
mainly uses

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
some gas from the filter,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
which has a stronger

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
activity relationship

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
to successfully remove

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
these two materials.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
After the assembly

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
of the components is completed,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
another exposure

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
is used

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
to apply

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
the metal electrode

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
using the lift-off method.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Finally, we use the

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
XF2 gas

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
to remove

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
the silicon oxide

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
at the bottom

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
to make the components.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
As you can see,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
there are two cuts

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
around the components.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
These two lines

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
not only define

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
the area around the components

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
with darker brown color,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
but also the area

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
where the silicon oxide

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
is removed.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
In the experiment,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
we measured

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
two different

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
electrode components.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
First of all,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
two electrode devices

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
will trigger

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
1,3,5,7,9 and so on.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Due to the high-strength

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
silicon oxide,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
it also produces

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
a lot of free smoke,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
so we don't

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
specifically discuss

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
those electrodes.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
We only discuss

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
the first three

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
electrodes of each design.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
For this device,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
its Q is 450,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
KT2 is 5.5

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
for free smoke,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
and TCF can also

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
be used.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Its displacement

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and shear stress

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
are different,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
but its electrode

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
won't change with the mode.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
these different modes

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
also have different

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
temperature factors.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
We can also observe

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
similar phenomena

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
from these three electrode devices.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
We trigger the so-called

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Q, which is around

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
1,000 or 3,000,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
KT2 is around 12%

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
for free smoke,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
and its three

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
temperature factors are also different.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
According to the previous theory,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
we can calculate

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
its

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
theoretical temperature factor

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and compare it with the experiment.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
What we can see

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
is that

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
the simulation of model

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
and finite element are quite similar.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Their error is less than 1%,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
but compared with the measurement,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
the error is around

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
3%.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Although

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
the expected result

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
is slightly worse than

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
the expected result,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I think

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
its accuracy

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
can be used

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
to design more detailed components.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Or,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
we don't need to rely on

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
finite element before

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
actually making the components.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
We can directly calculate

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
the value of our temperature factor

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
to assist designers

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
in the design of

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
compressors and filters.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
This is the conclusion.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
We use some methods

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
to calculate its temperature factor,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
and

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
its error is quite small

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
compared with the previous theory.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
The second case is

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
the research I did

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
after I came back to Taiwan.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The main reason is that

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
we encountered

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
a big problem

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
in the production of components.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It was found in the

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Lillian Nile Basin Fin Action.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
The RF power required

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
for this action

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
is quite large,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
about 800-900W.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Generally speaking,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
there is not much RF power

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
in the Lillian Nile Basin Fin Action,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
because the RF power

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
is quite old.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
before we start

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
the research on

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
RF components,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
we need to

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
pull back our research

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
to see the effect.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
At the same time,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
we hope to solve

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
the problem of

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
thermal conductivity.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
The thermal conductivity problem

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
of LN-SINFIN device

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
mainly comes from two reasons.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
The first one is

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
the high temperature factor,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
and the second one is

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
the poor thermal conductivity.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
So, when you drive

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
with high power,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
you will find that

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
the frequency starts to decrease

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
near the rectifier.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So, when the temperature

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
changes,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
the frequency starts to change.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Therefore,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
if there is no good thermal conductivity,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
the frequency will

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
decrease

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
as you drive

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
with higher power.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
So, there will be

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
a non-thermal phenomenon.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
If there is a non-thermal phenomenon

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
in the rectifier,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
it means that

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
there will be a non-thermal phenomenon

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
in the rectifier itself,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
which may cause

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
a distortion

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
when the signal is transmitted,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
or even increase

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
the error rate

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
of the code, etc.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So, in order to

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
solve this problem,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
there is a group of

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
ideas that

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
we can come back

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
and use the concept of SOHL

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
to bind the LN synth

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
to a substrate

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
with a block reflector.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
We can use

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
these reflectors

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
to virtually

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
create a floating resonator

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
that can

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
reproduce the

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
sound wave reflection

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
characteristics.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
In fact, it is directly

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
bound to the board.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
If it is directly

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
bound to the board,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
it can actually

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
enhance the efficiency of

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
heat transfer,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
so that it can theoretically

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
solve the problem of

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
temperature non-thermal.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
In fact, this idea

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
already had a series of

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
patents in 2004 and 2009,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
but it has not been

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
developed well.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Mainly because

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
there was not enough technology

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
to produce LN synths.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
However, it has become possible

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
in recent years,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
so this also forms

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
a new research direction.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
In particular,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
there are two professors

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
from the University of

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Tokyo, Japan,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Michio Katota and

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Shuji Tanaka.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
They use

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
the structure of

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
LN synths.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
They successfully demonstrated

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
that even if it is a

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
SO type resonator,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
my coupling can also be

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
greater than 40% and

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
operate at high frequency.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It is like the

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
newly introduced

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
release synth

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
resonator.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I don't release it,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
but I bound it to

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
the sound wave reflection layer

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
with a very strong boundary.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
It can be seen as a

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
release component.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
The same design concept

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
was also adopted by the company.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Murata called it

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
IHP-SOL,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Incredible High Performance-SOL.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Through some

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
designs,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
its coupling

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
can be maintained at

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
about 9%.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Mainly, the company uses

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
a relatively low coupling,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
but its Q can be greater than 3000.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Murata's idea is

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
that they don't want to

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
use so many layers of reflectors.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
For example, it needs

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
two materials,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
silicon oxide and

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
aluminum nitrate,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
to stack five or six layers

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
to make this reflector.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
From the perspective of the company,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
this design method is not economical,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
so they hope to use

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
a single silicon oxide layer

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
as the simplest

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
reflector.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
In fact,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
they have observed

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
a pretty good effect,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
because it raises the Q

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
to more than 3000.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Based on this idea,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
at least

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
at this stage

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
of my investment,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
no one has discussed

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Synthene Lithium Niobate

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
on silicon oxide

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
on silicon.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
So,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
we raise the Q

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
to this level.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
The wafers we use

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
are silicon

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
500μm,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
silicon oxide 2μm,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and the transfer Ln

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
is 0.7μm.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
We hope

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
to use the so-called

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
shear horizontal sole.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Its wave motion

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
is like the picture on the right.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It is a cut wave on the surface,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
so its motion

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
will decrease rapidly

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
in the substrate.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
So, we think it has a chance

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
to become a high-Q,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
high-coupling model.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
By inserting a layer of

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
oxide between

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Synthene Ln and silicon substrate,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
it should be able to effectively

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
reduce the leakage

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
to the substrate.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
For this structure,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
we study

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
its propagation direction.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
We use the Final Element

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
to simulate

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
its wave distribution

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
at different thickness

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
of lithium niobate

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
when it is

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
propagated on the

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
two-dimensional plane.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
By

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
setting the surface

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
of the crystal

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
as open

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
or short-circuit condition,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
based on the

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
so-called

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
outerless approach,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
we can calculate

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
the size of

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
its base

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
lithium niobate.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
So,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
we can see that

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
the SH sole

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
has a very large

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
difference in coupling.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
In order to get the highest coupling,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
the propagation direction

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
will be selected

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
at the angle of

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
10 degrees

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
backward on the y-axis.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
By combining

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
the simulation results

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
at different thicknesses

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
of lithium niobate,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
we can also find that

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
its lithium niobate

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
is also a

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
design parameter that

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
we can control.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
After understanding the

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
propagation direction,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
we start to study

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
its dispersion behavior.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It can be seen that

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
when there is no electric shock

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
on the surface,

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
such as the previous situation,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
when the thickness of lithium niobate

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
is greater than 0.15,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
the coupling will

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
decrease.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
This situation is

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
quite similar to

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
the plate wave of SH0.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
That is to say,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
the dotted line above

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
and the purple dotted line

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
below

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
have a similar

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
coupling reduction mode.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
However,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
we also find that

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
when we apply some electric shock

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
on the surface,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
especially the heavier metal,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
the higher the rate of increase.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Similarly,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
through simulation observations,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
we find that

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
when the metal on the surface

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
is heavier,

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
it can actually help

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
the horizontal wave

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
to concentrate

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
the strain energy

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
on the surface.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Since most of the strain energy

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
is concentrated in the opaque layer,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
it has a chance

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
to get a higher coupling.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
That is to say,

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
when the thickness

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
of the metal electrode

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
is limited,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
we should use

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
the heavier metal

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
to design

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
to get a higher coupling.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
For example,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
this is a comparison

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
between gold and aluminum.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
It can be seen that

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
when the thickness of gold

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
is 0.025 lambda,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
it can actually

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
increase the coupling to 40%.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
However,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
aluminum, which is a lighter material,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
needs a thicker electrode

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
to achieve a similar effect.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
The last part

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
is to discuss

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
the impact of different modes.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Since

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
we want to use SH

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
as a target,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
we compare SH

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
and Longitudinal Leaky Soul

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
to see

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
what is the difference

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
between the two modes.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Through analysis,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
it can be found that

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
SH Soul is more likely

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
to be affected

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
by the two-layer structure

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
of lithium niobate and silicon arsenide.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
However, Leaky Soul

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
has a larger position

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
than SH Soul,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
which means that

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
its wave is more likely

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
to be lost by substrate transmission.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Therefore,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
it can be seen that

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
the impedance ratio

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
of Leaky Soul

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
is about 20-30 dB higher

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
than that of SH Soul.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Therefore,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
it is not a good choice.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Finally,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
in order to verify

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
the effect of SH Soul,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
we use the

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
OnePort single-layer

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
SH Soul resonator

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
with traditional IDT electrode

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
and grating reflector.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
However,

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
unlike the traditional one,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
we use a

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Synthene-Lithium Niobate

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
on silicon arsenide

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
on silicon

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
as a reference point.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
This is the

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
one-port single-layer

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
SH Soul resonator.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
In addition,

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
SH Soul has a

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
smaller position

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
than SH Soul,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
which means

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
that

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
its wave

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
leakage is

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
relatively small.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Therefore,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
its wave

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
leakage is

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
relatively small.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
The picture in the lower right corner

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
is the actual

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
picture of the component.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
In this picture,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
its wave length is 8 microns.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Finally,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
this is the result of the experiment.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
We selected

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
3 different components,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Lambda,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
8, 6, and 4 microns

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
to compare.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
It can be seen that

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
the difference in Q

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
is relatively large.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Here we use

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
the definition of body Q,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
which is to use its group delay

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
and its S11

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
to calculate its Q value.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Its definition of Q is

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
similar to the traditional one,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
but through a new formula,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
which is the formula of body Q,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
it can equalize

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
every Q value

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
on this resonance scale,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
and it can be seen that

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
the highest Q value

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
of the resonator

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
we designed

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
is about 960,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
and the carbon

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
is about 25.5%.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Therefore,

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
FOM is about 245.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Compared with the traditional

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
F-bar resonator,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
its performance indicator

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
is between 100 and 200.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Therefore,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
more than 200

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
indicates that

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
the component we designed

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
has a certain performance.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
At least,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
it may outperform

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
some low-performance

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
F-bar components.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
We also

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
measured

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
the power handling

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
of this resonator.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
It can be seen

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
that

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
compared with

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
the previously released

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
SYNFIN

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
lithium-ion battery components,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
this SO-TYPE

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
resonator

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
does not have

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
any significant

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
fluctuation

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
after 10 dBm RF power.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Therefore,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
it can be further verified

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
that when I use

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
SO-TYPE components,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
it can dissipate heat

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
through the base plate,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
which can greatly improve

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
the power handling problem.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
At the same time,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
we also used the combination

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
of different thicknesses

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
of L-N and C-NR

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
to get a higher

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
capacitance coefficient

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
of more than 36%,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
but its Q is reduced

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
to about 250.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
This is a prediction

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
from the metal we used.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Due to the

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
absorption of

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
the acoustic of the metal,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
it is actually much

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
stronger than aluminum.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
In other words,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
the loss of the metal

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
is much greater than that

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
of aluminum,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
which is about 4-5 times higher.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Therefore, we estimate

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
that the Q of the components

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
is the effect of the metal electrode.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
However, this still needs further verification.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Through such a high-coupling

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
resonator,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
its coupling is about 38%-35%,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
we can use

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
such a resonator

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
to synthesize the filter.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
We used five

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
resonators to synthesize

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
the filter,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
and in the software,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
we made it

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
sound

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
and input

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
and output matching.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
We can find that

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
we can potentially

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
increase the frequency to 29%,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and the insertion loss is less than

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
the standard 3dB.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
This also verifies that

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
the higher the coupling of

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
my resonator,

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
we will have the opportunity to

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
make a wider filter to meet

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
the growing needs of

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
5G communication.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
So this is my

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
second part of the conclusion.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
We used

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Synthene Lithium Niobate

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
on Substrate to

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
make the SOHL components.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
We can increase the coupling

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
to more than 20% or 30%,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
and the Q can be nearly 1000.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And we also

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
verified that

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
using these high-coupling devices,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
we have the opportunity to get

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
a very large filter

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
and the insertion loss

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
can also meet the needs of

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
communication.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
The loss will be less than 3dB.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
In the future,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
we hope to

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
improve our

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
manufacturing capacity

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
and make the frequency

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
higher.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
In addition to

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
our manufacturing capacity,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
we will also need

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
to find

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
more interesting models

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
to support our research.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Finally,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
of course,

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
there is a projection.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Lithium Niobate

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
is a very strong

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
supply material.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
It also has a very interesting

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
optical feature,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
but I don't understand this part.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Now there are also several more

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
well-known groups

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
to invest and research

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
acoustic optical devices.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
For example, Stanford

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
and Harvard have

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
some teams

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
to discuss this.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Finally, I would like to

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
thank my founding

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
research, my students,

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
and my ex-bosses.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
My report ends here.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Thank you.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
OK, thank you Ming-Huang for

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
bringing us such a wonderful speech.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Let me see

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
if anyone has any questions.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
If you do,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
please turn on your microphone

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
or leave your question

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
in the chat dialog.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I can help you ask Ming-Huang.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I want to ask

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
a question.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Can you hear me?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yes.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Hello, my name is Shreff.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I am a PhD student

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
at Taitung University.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I have read

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
several of your papers.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Previously,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Rob Candler

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
from UCLA

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
came to visit.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I worked with him

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
at that time.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
However,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I was doing

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
fieldwork.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
The papers you wrote

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
were about piezoelectric radiation.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Now,

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I am also working on this.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I am glad

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
to hear

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
your speech today.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
It is rare

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
to find such advanced research in China.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
For example,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
there should be

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
no manufacturers

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
in Taiwan.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Yes.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I don't know

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
if there are any

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
in Taiwan,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
but there should be none.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I have read

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
your papers.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
For example,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
piezoelectric radiation

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
is done by UCLA

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
and Northeastern.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Piezoelectric radiation

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
is done by piezoelectric

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
and magnetic materials.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
It is a big topic.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I want to know

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
the difference between

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
piezoelectric radiation

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
and magnetic materials.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I think

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
there are many

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
deep

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
physical phenomena

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
to discuss.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
When we were

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
implementing the AMIBA project,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
our main competition

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
was a Stanford group.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Their papers were published

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
earlier than ours

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
in Nature Communication.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
You can read it.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
They used a stick-shaped lithium-ion battery.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
It should be

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
8 or 10 cm long.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
It was a

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
metal stick.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
They used

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
some suspension

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
to float it in the air

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and make it vibrate

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
to radiate electromagnetic waves.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
There were

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
several difficulties

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
that they didn't overcome.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
First,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
the surface of the battery

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
was exposed

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
to electromagnetic radiation

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
near the electrode.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
It means

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
the battery

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
lost a lot of energy.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Second,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
its Q was too high.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I think it was

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
between 100,000 and 1 million.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
It ran down very slowly.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
It seemed

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
that such a system

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
was not suitable

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
for communication.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
It took a long time

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
to go from 1 to 0.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
So they could only

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
use frequency modulation.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Frequency modulation

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
may also be affected

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
by its high Q.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
If you are interested,

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I think you can read

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
their papers.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
We decided to use

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
PZT later.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
We found a PZT manufacturer

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
that could provide

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
high-quality buck PZT.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Its Q was over 1,000.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
It was very rare.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
We used PZT.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
But PZT had its own problem.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Its dielectric constant was too high.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
So it

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
had almost no so-called

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
field-to-field effect.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
It went from the moment

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
it left Resonator

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
to its original state.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
But I think

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
PZT was not suitable

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
for communication.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Especially for measuring.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
We measured it for a month or two.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
But we found

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
that it was wrong.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Actually,

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I used

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Urban Nitride.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
But I asked

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
UCL to make it.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
They measured

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
the resistance

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
of the resistor.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So we couldn't measure anything.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
PZT is made of

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
resin material.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
So it's not that easy.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Yes.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I saw

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
they made

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
some other

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
alloy materials.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Not PZT.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Yes.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
In this field,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
you know

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
they made

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
PZT.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
They have a

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
very strong

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
material team in

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Northeast University.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Otherwise,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
they are not

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
specialized in materials.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
So I think

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
it's not that easy.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Another question

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
about architecture.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I don't have the answer yet.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
For example,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
they call it

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
mechanical antenna.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Mechanical antenna.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
You can find

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
some articles

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
about it.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
For example,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
about radiation efficiency

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
and size,

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
we talked about

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
due limit.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I read some articles

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
that say

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
mechanical antenna

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
but I

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
don't understand it.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
I don't understand it.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Yes.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
When I was in the US,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
our boss

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
told us about it.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
He thought it could

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
go beyond the limit.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
He wanted us to write

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
a theoretical paper.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But later,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
he wanted to meet

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
DAPA's schedule.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
So we just ignored it.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
It doesn't seem

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
to have any new results.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Yes.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I'm not sure

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
whether it can

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
go beyond the limit.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
But I think

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
we can calculate it

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
from a theoretical point of view.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
It might be a great

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
theoretical paper.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
But we thought

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
we couldn't handle it.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
The last question

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
is a small one.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I'm curious.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
For example,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
when you simulate

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
the design of

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
multi-modem

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
or two-sided,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
if it's complicated,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
how do you

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
analyze it?

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Because you can't

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
just recognize it.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
From simulation?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
I'll start from

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
a so-called

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
periodic session.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I'll go back to the beginning.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
For example,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
with this IDT-type

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
resonator,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
we mainly

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
trigger some modes

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
with a horizontal capacitor.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
These modes are

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
non-linear.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
So we usually

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
start with a

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
periodic structure.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
The advantage of a periodic structure

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
is that it won't be affected

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
by the boundary.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Its modes are beautiful.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
For example,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
with this A1 resonator,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
the upper part

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
contains an electrode

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
and its boundary simulation.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
The lower part

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
contains an electrode.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
So I don't have a boundary.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
You can clearly recognize

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
that this is A1 mode.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
With this simulation,

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
you can roughly

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
grasp the position of

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
resonance frequency

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
and the shape of

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
its mode.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Then you can do a complete simulation.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Then you can probably

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
find out from the comparison

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
of frequency.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Basically, they are the same.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Then you can easily

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
find the corresponding mode.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
This is my own approach.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
If you do a complete

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
device simulation,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
you may not

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
think that

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
this is the mode you want to design.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
When I was doing

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
research,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I would simulate

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
a Bach resonator.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Sometimes its mode

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
is quite complicated.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
If I do a very simple simulation,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
it will be difficult to identify

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
whether it is the mode I want to design.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
If you use eigenfrequency,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
it will be more complicated.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Because eigenfrequency lists

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
all possible mechanical modes.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
So I would suggest that

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
when you confirm your electrode configuration,

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
you can do frequency sweeping.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
This is the so-called frequency

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
response simulation.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Although many mechanical modes

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
exist,

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
they can't be triggered by your electrode.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
They can't be received by your electrode.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
So many modes will disappear.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Only a few

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
are enough

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
to be received

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
by these electrodes.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
In this way,

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
you can reduce a large part of

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
the work.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Thank you for your answer.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I am also working on

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
this field now.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
It is a difficult topic.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I hope to have more opportunities

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
to communicate in the future.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
If there is a chance,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
you can

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
write an email to me

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
or make an appointment

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
to discuss.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Thank you.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Due to time constraints,

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
today's speech ends here.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
You can turn on your microphone.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Let's applaud

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Professor Ming-Huang's

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
wonderful speech.
