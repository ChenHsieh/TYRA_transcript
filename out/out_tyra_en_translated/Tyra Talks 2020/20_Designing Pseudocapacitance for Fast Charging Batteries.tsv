0	10000	You can find the recording online a week and a half later.
10000	16000	If you have any questions during this process,
16000	18000	you can leave a comment in the chat box.
18000	24000	We will have Q&A time at the end for everyone to ask questions.
24000	27000	Let's get started.
31000	35000	Thank you everyone for listening to my presentation.
35000	39000	Hello everyone, I'm Lai Jun-Hai.
39000	41000	You can call me Matt.
41000	47000	First of all, I would like to thank Tyra for inviting me to share my research.
47000	50000	Let me introduce myself.
50000	52000	I'm from Yonghe, Hsinchu.
52000	55000	I graduated from National University of China.
55000	60000	I worked as an engineer for a year and a half at BASF in Taiwan.
60000	64000	Then I went to UCLA to study engineering.
64000	66000	I graduated in 2017.
66000	71000	I am currently working at Startup Battery Streak.
71000	74000	At the same time, I am also a visiting scholar at UCLA.
74000	80000	My main work is focused on the development and mass production of new battery materials,
80000	83000	as well as the transfer between the company and UCLA.
84000	87000	Today's topic is
87000	92000	Designing pseudo-capacitance for fast-charging batteries.
92000	97000	That is, how to apply the mechanism of solid-state batteries to fast-charging batteries.
97000	102000	First of all, why do we need fast-charging batteries?
102000	106000	The first motivation is the accumulation of electromagnetic traffic.
106000	111000	Charging stations are currently set up in three levels.
111000	114000	The first level is the plug-in that everyone puts at home.
114000	117000	It can charge 3 to 6 kilometers per hour.
117000	120000	The second level is the charging station in the parking lot.
120000	124000	It can charge 20 to 30 kilometers per hour.
124000	129000	The third level is the fastest Tesla charging station.
129000	136000	It can charge 5 kilometers per minute.
136000	141000	Interestingly, the current charging station is still far less than the gas station.
141000	146000	But it is almost impossible to see such a long queue at the charging station.
146000	149000	Not everyone has an electric car,
149000	155000	but 5 kilometers per minute is still too slow compared to the time required for gas.
155000	162000	The second application of fast-charging batteries is the popularization of renewable energy.
162000	167000	As of last year, renewable energy has reached one-third of the global power generation.
167000	173000	50% of the power generation comes from renewable energy.
173000	178000	Other European countries also reach 20 to 30% of renewable power.
178000	185000	We all know that when wind and solar energy are converted into electricity,
185000	187000	they must be paired with suitable batteries.
187000	191000	However, these batteries can't be charged quickly,
191000	193000	so they are inefficient.
193000	196000	For example, when the wind speed is fast,
196000	198000	there will be a momentary large current.
198000	201000	The batteries that can't be charged at low power
201000	204000	will become waste heat and reduce the life of the battery.
204000	212000	So basically, this concept is the same as the concept of fast-charging batteries paired with aging cell phones.
212000	216000	The third application of fast-charging batteries is plant-based medical equipment.
216000	223000	Generally, the supply of such equipment is made up of a battery paired with a capacitor,
223000	228000	which is in the box at the bottom left.
228000	235000	Generally, the battery is used to monitor the function of low power for a long time,
235000	239000	while the capacitor is used to respond to high power in a short time.
239000	244000	Due to the limited size of the equipment and the need for different organ parts,
244000	249000	a single high-power battery is used to replace the two-in-one mode.
249000	254000	This has always been the trend in the development of this type of equipment power supply.
254000	258000	Of course, in addition to the above three applications,
258000	259000	there are other applications.
259000	261000	I won't go into detail here.
261000	263000	So in this main speech,
263000	268000	it mainly introduces how to improve the power density and energy density of the storage components using the materials of the capacitor.
269000	271000	As shown in the picture on the left,
271000	274000	the x-axis is the energy density,
274000	276000	and the y-axis is the power density.
276000	284000	First, I will briefly introduce the materials of the storage components and the techniques required for analysis.
284000	293000	Then, the first part will start with the high-power supercapacitor material in blue.
293000	298000	Then, the high-power characteristics will be achieved by using a non-oxidized carbonate residue.
298000	301000	The second part will start with the lithium battery.
301000	306000	Here is an example of fluorine,
306000	308000	L-NBOPF,
308000	312000	which achieves high power density by nanomerizing the battery material.
315000	319000	Generally, batteries or supercapacitors are basically composed of two terminals.
320000	327000	The positive terminal and the negative terminal are placed on the aluminum foil and copper foil respectively.
327000	330000	The two terminals are separated by a multi-hole separator,
330000	333000	which is the middle part of the separator,
336000	337000	to avoid short-circuit.
337000	339000	When charging the battery, the lithium battery moves in the capacitor,
339000	342000	and the battery material produces an oxidation reaction.
342000	346000	At the same time, the battery moves in the external circuit to achieve the balance of the electric current.
346000	350000	The electric current is the main focus of our discussion today.
350000	355000	It is mainly composed of the storage material, carbon, and the high-voltage supercapacitor.
355000	358000	The electric current needs to have a certain vacuum.
358000	359000	It is like a sponge.
359000	361000	It must contain enough electrolysis.
361000	366000	At the same time, it must have enough conductivity to be a high-voltage supercapacitor.
368000	371000	Although the structure of the battery and the capacitor are the same,
371000	373000	the storage mechanism is completely different.
373000	376000	The mechanism of the capacitor is absorbed by the lithium.
376000	381000	In the external circuit, the aluminum foil and the copper foil are separated and absorbed by the surface of the battery.
381000	384000	Because the lithium is absorbed by the surface for a short time,
384000	386000	this mechanism is most conducive to fast charging.
386000	389000	The disadvantage is that its surface area is limited,
389000	392000	so the density of energy is generally low.
392000	395000	In contrast, the storage method of the battery
395000	399000	uses the oxidation reaction inside the material.
399000	403000	In this case, the lithium can enter the material,
403000	405000	and its energy is far greater than that of the capacitor.
405000	408000	However, since the lithium moves very slowly inside the material,
408000	412000	it is therefore unable to do high-speed charging.
414000	417000	Next, we will introduce how to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.
417000	420000	Basically, it is based on electrical chemistry analysis.
420000	423000	We will make the pre-analyzed material into an electrolyte
423000	425000	and test it in the same electrolyte solution.
425000	428000	Generally, the device to be tested
428000	434000	has a single-phase electrolyte test on the upper left,
434000	439000	and a double-phase torque battery test on the lower left.
439000	441000	There are two main methods of testing.
441000	445000	The first method is the cyclic voltammetry,
445000	447000	which is abbreviated as CV.
447000	450000	The principle is to change the speed of voltage change
450000	452000	to measure the change in current.
452000	454000	The second method is the DC voltage test,
454000	456000	which is abbreviated as GC.
456000	459000	In the case of DC voltage charging,
459000	462000	it measures the change in voltage of the battery
462000	464000	and makes a diagram of the voltage.
468000	472000	Now we use GC and CV to get the diagram
472000	474000	to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.
474000	476000	They are two different storage mechanisms.
476000	479000	The capacitor on the left can be seen that
479000	483000	the CV is a rectangle,
483000	486000	while the GC is basically a diagonal.
486000	489000	The battery on the right is composed of a set of peaks,
489000	494000	while the GC is mainly composed of a horizontal line.
494000	496000	Now that we know how to judge the material of the battery
496000	497000	and the material of the capacitor,
497000	500000	we can look for the material of the fast charging battery.
500000	503000	What characteristics do we hope the fast charging battery has?
503000	507000	We hope it has the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry on the left,
507000	510000	which allows it to be a fast charging battery.
510000	513000	It also has the characteristics of the material on the right,
513000	515000	which increases the density of energy
515000	518000	by storing energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.
518000	521000	This is the material we are looking for.
521000	523000	The material of the capacitor
523000	528000	not only has a rectangle CV,
528000	532000	but also a diagonal GC,
532000	537000	and it stores energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.
539000	543000	Next, I will talk about the main character I will introduce today,
543000	545000	which is the T-Phased,
545000	547000	Orphohombic Phased,
547000	548000	NB205.
548000	551000	Next, I will call it NIOVIA.
551000	555000	In addition to having the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry,
555000	558000	its energy density
558000	564000	is equivalent to the energy density of lithium carbon dioxide,
564000	568000	which is in the lithium-ion battery.
568000	573000	Its energy density is 10 times that of the capacitor.
573000	575000	Its power density,
575000	578000	which is the power of its fast charging,
578000	581000	can also reach 10 times that of the battery.
581000	583000	Its only drawback is that
583000	589000	it is still oxygen-chloride,
589000	591000	so its power consumption
591000	598000	is the first topic we are going to fix.
598000	600000	The first part
600000	606000	is to mix carbon with NIOVIA
606000	609000	to improve the properties of NIOVIA.
609000	612000	We need to deduce a good NIOVIA,
612000	614000	and we will eventually deduce
614000	617000	what kind of properties a good NIOVIA battery needs
617000	622000	to show the characteristics of its lithium-ion battery.
622000	626000	A good NIOVIA battery
626000	628000	basically needs two parts.
628000	630000	The first is the high-voltage part,
630000	635000	and the second is the part that can have a high pore density.
635000	637000	In this study,
637000	639000	we mainly used three materials.
639000	642000	The first material is our protagonist, NIOVIA.
642000	646000	The second material is our chemical-capable
646000	650000	Reduced Graphene Oxide, also known as RGO.
650000	654000	Its purpose is to provide short-term conductivity.
654000	656000	The third material
656000	658000	is the one on the far right,
658000	661000	Carbide Derived Carbon, also known as CDC.
661000	665000	It is a kind of carbon dioxide.
665000	667000	Its main purpose is that
667000	671000	it has a polypore structure
671000	675000	and its size is in the micrometer level,
675000	678000	so it can provide long-term conductivity.
681000	683000	The way we prepare the battery
683000	687000	is to first plant NIOVIA on RGO.
687000	692000	Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO with CDC
692000	696000	to get NIOVIA RGO CDC,
696000	698000	also known as NRC.
698000	702000	Finally, we make NRC
702000	706000	into a commercial-grade battery
706000	708000	and test it to prove that
708000	710000	it has a high-power and high-density
710000	712000	storage characteristics
712000	714000	at the right pore density.
716000	720000	This slide shows the details of the material equipment.
720000	723000	The main equipment is
723000	727000	the water-heating method.
727000	729000	We put the precursor
729000	733000	into the autoclave
733000	735000	and heat it up to 180°C
735000	738000	for 12 hours.
738000	742000	Next, we wash the particles
742000	747000	and dry them.
747000	749000	After drying,
749000	752000	we heat it up to 500°C
752000	755000	to get the body structure we want,
755000	757000	which is T-phase,
757000	759000	or ophiobic phase.
759000	765000	Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO
765000	767000	with CDC.
767000	769000	The main purpose is to
769000	770000	make this composite material
770000	772000	in the form of surface electrolysis.
772000	775000	Next, we make it into a battery
775000	777000	and test it.
779000	783000	We have 20% NIOVIA,
783000	785000	40% NRC20,
785000	789000	and 60% NRC20.
789000	791000	The BET on the right
791000	793000	is the analysis of the surface electrolysis.
793000	796000	It shows that
796000	799000	the surface electrolysis of the material
799000	802000	increases with the
802000	804000	composition of the CDC.
804000	806000	This means that
806000	808000	this composite method
808000	811000	does not cause the CDC to lose its surface area,
811000	814000	or the CDC to be less airtight,
814000	816000	or its structure to collapse.
816000	818000	Therefore, we can use
818000	820000	a simple ratio to
820000	823000	achieve the airtightness we need.
823000	826000	There are also two black dots on the picture.
826000	828000	These two black dots
828000	830000	are where we directly plant NIOVIA
830000	832000	on the CDC.
832000	834000	If we
834000	836000	do not use
836000	838000	this composite method
838000	840000	but use
840000	842000	the water-heat method
842000	844000	to directly plant it on the CDC,
844000	846000	at high temperature,
846000	848000	the CDC's
848000	850000	surface area
850000	852000	will...
852000	854000	Because the surface area is too large,
854000	856000	the surface area will decrease
856000	858000	at high temperature.
858000	860000	We want to use the CDC
860000	862000	to improve the airtightness
862000	864000	of the electrode.
864000	866000	This is the idea.
868000	870000	Next, we need to
870000	872000	use the CV to judge the electrode.
872000	874000	Let's see if it is like a battery material
874000	876000	or an electric material.
876000	878000	In the case of changing the minority,
878000	880000	we can get the corresponding current.
880000	882000	Therefore, we use the current
882000	884000	to make judgments with the change of the minority.
884000	886000	If the
886000	888000	material is like a battery,
888000	890000	the change of the current
890000	892000	will be multiplied by the minority.
892000	894000	If the material
894000	896000	is like a capacitor,
896000	898000	the current
898000	900000	will be multiplied by the minority.
900000	902000	In other words,
902000	904000	when the minority is doubled,
904000	906000	the current will be doubled.
906000	908000	Combining these two formulas,
908000	910000	we can get
910000	912000	the following formula
912000	914000	from the experiment.
914000	916000	The current is equal to the magnitude
916000	918000	multiplied by the minority.
918000	920000	This is called
920000	922000	B-value analysis.
922000	924000	We want the material
924000	926000	to be as fast as the capacitor.
926000	928000	Therefore, we want the B-value
928000	930000	to be as close to 1 as possible.
932000	934000	This proves that the material
934000	936000	can do high-speed charging.
938000	940000	Next,
940000	942000	the NRC
942000	944000	can store different
944000	946000	current
946000	948000	at different speeds.
948000	950000	On the left,
950000	952000	we use the minority
952000	954000	to burn the NRC.
954000	956000	The lowest value
956000	958000	is 100% Cdc.
958000	960000	The way
960000	962000	we control the minority
962000	964000	is from the slowest 30-minute
964000	966000	charging point on the left to the
966000	968000	90-second charging point on the right.
968000	970000	The y-axis is the energy generated by me.
970000	972000	As time goes by,
972000	974000	the energy generated by me
974000	976000	will be reduced.
976000	978000	We want the line to be as flat as possible.
978000	980000	This means that the material
980000	982000	can do high-speed charging
982000	984000	as well as low-speed charging.
984000	986000	The lowest value is 100% Cdc.
986000	988000	As the amount of niobia increases,
988000	990000	the density of the NRC
990000	992000	will also increase.
992000	994000	Up to 40%, the increased current
994000	996000	will not be affected by the minority.
996000	998000	From 0% to 20% to 40%,
998000	1000000	the current will remain as flat.
1002000	1004000	Up to 60%,
1004000	1006000	from the NRC 60,
1006000	1008000	we can see that
1008000	1010000	the current is lower than
1010000	1012000	40% at 90 seconds.
1012000	1014000	The highest value is 100%.
1014000	1016000	Although the amount of
1016000	1018000	niobia is
1018000	1020000	higher than 40%,
1020000	1022000	we can expect that
1022000	1024000	according to the trend,
1024000	1026000	when the charging time is less than 90 seconds,
1026000	1028000	the NRC 40 will increase.
1030000	1032000	On the right is the B-value
1032000	1034000	introduced in the previous page.
1034000	1036000	When the curve
1036000	1038000	is closer to 1,
1038000	1040000	we mainly do CV
1040000	1042000	for different materials.
1042000	1044000	Then we do the
1044000	1046000	B-value analysis.
1046000	1048000	The result of the analysis is in the lower right corner.
1048000	1050000	When the curve is closer to 1,
1050000	1052000	it means that the charging speed is faster.
1052000	1054000	By this, we can judge
1054000	1056000	that the charging speed of
1056000	1058000	NRC 40 is faster than
1058000	1060000	NRC 60 and 100% niobia.
1060000	1062000	This also proves that
1062000	1064000	when there is 60% CVC
1064000	1066000	stored in the electrode,
1066000	1068000	the electrode has sufficient airtightness
1068000	1070000	to accommodate sufficient electrolysis
1070000	1072000	to show the characteristics of
1072000	1074000	niobia lithium-ion battery.
1076000	1078000	Finally,
1078000	1080000	we combine the NRC 40
1080000	1082000	with the traditional lithium-ion electrode
1082000	1084000	to form a full electrode
1084000	1086000	to do
1086000	1088000	CV and GC analysis.
1090000	1092000	In terms of CV,
1092000	1094000	we can get
1094000	1096000	the characteristics of lithium-ion,
1096000	1098000	which is a rectangular CV.
1098000	1100000	In terms of the
1100000	1102000	GC,
1102000	1104000	we also get a
1104000	1106000	oblique GC.
1106000	1108000	At the same time,
1108000	1110000	because of the combination of niobia,
1110000	1112000	we not only
1112000	1114000	increase the energy density
1114000	1116000	at low power,
1116000	1118000	but also increase the energy density
1118000	1120000	at high power.
1120000	1122000	At the power of
1122000	1124000	3000W per kg,
1124000	1126000	we can store
1126000	1128000	up to 23W
1128000	1130000	per kg of energy density.
1134000	1136000	Next,
1136000	1138000	I will use the picture on the right to summarize.
1138000	1140000	The first part
1140000	1142000	is that we use the amount of Cdc
1142000	1144000	to adjust the airtightness and
1144000	1146000	electrolysis of the NRC composite material.
1146000	1148000	At the same time,
1148000	1150000	the electrode has high energy
1150000	1152000	and fast charge characteristics.
1152000	1154000	In other words,
1154000	1156000	we use Cdc as the starting point
1156000	1158000	to mix different niobia
1158000	1160000	to increase its energy density.
1160000	1162000	By maximizing airtightness and electrolysis,
1162000	1164000	we can increase
1164000	1166000	the overall
1166000	1168000	energy density of the electrode
1168000	1170000	and preserve
1170000	1172000	the high power characteristics of Cdc.
1178000	1180000	The second part
1180000	1182000	I want to share is
1182000	1184000	the LNVOPF material
1184000	1186000	as a medical equipment energy supply application.
1188000	1190000	Speaking of medical equipment energy supply,
1190000	1192000	I will use
1192000	1194000	an implantable
1194000	1196000	cardioverter
1196000	1198000	defibrillator
1198000	1200000	ICD
1200000	1202000	as an example.
1202000	1204000	Its Chinese name is
1204000	1206000	implantable defibrillator.
1208000	1210000	It basically
1210000	1212000	detects your heart beat.
1212000	1214000	When your heart beats abnormally,
1214000	1216000	it will use
1216000	1218000	high current to stimulate your heart beat.
1218000	1220000	For example,
1220000	1222000	when your heart stops beating,
1222000	1224000	it will stimulate your heart beat.
1226000	1228000	I am not a medical background,
1228000	1230000	so I only understand
1230000	1232000	the basic concept of this device.
1232000	1234000	The main usage method
1234000	1236000	is still left to the doctor.
1238000	1240000	ICD
1240000	1242000	mainly uses
1242000	1244000	high current and low current output.
1244000	1246000	The low current part
1246000	1248000	is mainly responsible for the battery.
1250000	1252000	The high current part
1252000	1254000	is responsible for the circuit board.
1258000	1260000	There is also a device size
1260000	1262000	at the bottom.
1262000	1264000	The size is about one-fourth of the heart.
1264000	1266000	Most of the area
1266000	1268000	is actually from the low-voltage circuit.
1272000	1274000	Another
1274000	1276000	medical device
1278000	1280000	is
1280000	1282000	DBS
1282000	1284000	Deep Brain Stimulator.
1284000	1286000	Deep Brain Stimulator.
1288000	1290000	This type of device
1290000	1292000	has the same principle,
1292000	1294000	but the current demand
1294000	1296000	is smaller than ICD.
1298000	1300000	DBS mainly stimulates
1300000	1302000	the brain nerve.
1302000	1304000	DBS mainly stimulates
1304000	1306000	the brain nerve.
1306000	1308000	DBS mainly stimulates
1308000	1310000	the brain nerve.
1312000	1314000	The power supply
1314000	1316000	is also made up of
1316000	1318000	a battery and a circuit.
1318000	1320000	When we want to
1320000	1322000	put this medical device
1322000	1324000	in the body,
1324000	1326000	we hope that
1326000	1328000	its size can be smaller and better
1328000	1330000	to save more space.
1330000	1332000	When we find the material,
1332000	1334000	it has the characteristics
1334000	1336000	of a battery and a circuit.
1336000	1338000	So,
1338000	1340000	we can use a single device
1340000	1342000	to make a circuit
1342000	1344000	or a battery.
1344000	1346000	We prefer the battery
1346000	1348000	because the battery size is smaller.
1348000	1350000	A single storage device
1350000	1352000	will provide the supply of
1352000	1354000	the current.
1354000	1356000	We can save more
1356000	1358000	the power supply
1358000	1360000	of medical equipment.
1364000	1366000	This material
1366000	1368000	is
1368000	1370000	L-NBOPF.
1370000	1372000	NBOPF
1372000	1374000	comes from
1374000	1376000	NASKON,
1376000	1378000	which is a transformer.
1378000	1380000	When it is mixed,
1380000	1382000	the voltage
1382000	1384000	of this material
1384000	1386000	will increase
1386000	1388000	with time.
1388000	1390000	This means it can store more energy.
1390000	1392000	And
1392000	1394000	when I
1394000	1396000	use it,
1396000	1398000	the voltage
1398000	1400000	will
1400000	1402000	decrease
1402000	1404000	with time.
1404000	1406000	This means
1406000	1408000	the material
1408000	1410000	will last longer.
1410000	1412000	The storage density
1412000	1414000	is the same as
1414000	1416000	the lithium carbon dioxide
1416000	1418000	in the battery.
1418000	1420000	Most importantly,
1420000	1422000	this material has
1422000	1424000	the characteristics of a battery
1424000	1426000	and a circuit.
1426000	1428000	Next,
1428000	1430000	we will introduce another way
1430000	1432000	to distinguish a battery from a circuit.
1432000	1434000	We will use X-ray
1434000	1436000	diffraction
1436000	1438000	to judge
1438000	1440000	whether the material
1440000	1442000	is
1442000	1444000	changing
1444000	1446000	with the
1446000	1448000	structure of the crystal.
1448000	1450000	This is what we call
1450000	1452000	X-ray diffraction.
1452000	1454000	X-ray diffraction
1454000	1456000	occurs when the battery is charged.
1456000	1458000	X-ray diffraction
1458000	1460000	occurs when the battery is charged.
1460000	1462000	X-ray diffraction
1462000	1464000	occurs when the battery is charged.
1464000	1466000	Let's analyze
1466000	1468000	NBOPF.
1468000	1470000	NBOPF has two peaks
1470000	1472000	that are opposite to each other.
1472000	1474000	The peak at low voltage
1474000	1476000	is parallel.
1476000	1478000	The peak at high voltage
1478000	1480000	is not parallel.
1480000	1482000	This means that
1482000	1484000	the material can be used
1484000	1486000	as a battery at low voltage
1486000	1488000	and as a circuit at high voltage.
1488000	1490000	However,
1490000	1492000	this is not that simple.
1492000	1494000	The material
1494000	1496000	is charged twice
1496000	1498000	per hour
1498000	1500000	Let me introduce
1500000	1502000	a little bit.
1502000	1504000	When we talk about charging,
1504000	1506000	we use a unit called C-ray.
1506000	1508000	We use a unit called C-ray.
1508000	1510000	C-ray
1510000	1512000	has several Cs.
1512000	1514000	This means that it can charge several times
1514000	1516000	in an hour.
1516000	1518000	When this material
1518000	1520000	charges twice per hour,
1520000	1522000	when this material charges twice per hour,
1522000	1524000	which is the part of 2C,
1524000	1526000	it can store
1526000	1528000	80-90% of the power.
1528000	1530000	However,
1530000	1532000	when you shorten the charging time
1532000	1534000	to 3 minutes,
1534000	1536000	it can only charge 8%.
1536000	1538000	The reason is that
1538000	1540000	during the charging process,
1540000	1542000	it will charge the battery first.
1542000	1544000	Then it will charge the capacitor.
1544000	1546000	However, the charging speed of the battery
1546000	1548000	is too slow,
1548000	1550000	so I can't even charge the capacitor.
1550000	1552000	So,
1552000	1554000	it's a bit like this.
1554000	1556000	The main reason is that the charging speed of the battery
1556000	1558000	is too slow,
1558000	1560000	resulting in a decrease
1560000	1562000	in the overall charging speed.
1562000	1564000	What we are going to do next
1564000	1566000	is to
1566000	1568000	use the material
1568000	1570000	as a nanometer
1570000	1572000	to shorten the time
1572000	1574000	and distance
1574000	1576000	of the particles in the material
1576000	1578000	to increase the charging speed
1578000	1580000	of the material.
1580000	1582000	Next,
1582000	1584000	we are going to synthesize
1584000	1586000	this nanometer NVOPF
1586000	1588000	and discuss the size
1588000	1590000	and characteristics of fast charging.
1590000	1592000	First,
1592000	1594000	the way we make it is
1594000	1596000	to put all the materials
1596000	1598000	in the
1598000	1600000	solvent thermal
1600000	1602000	to synthesize.
1602000	1604000	We also put it in the pressure suit.
1604000	1606000	Then,
1606000	1608000	after 12 hours,
1608000	1610000	after 185°C,
1610000	1612000	we take the material out
1612000	1614000	and clean it.
1614000	1616000	We will dry it.
1616000	1618000	Next, we use
1618000	1620000	XRD, X-Ray Diffraction, to confirm the material.
1620000	1622000	After confirming that
1622000	1624000	there is no problem with the material
1624000	1626000	and there is no impurities in it,
1626000	1628000	we will make an electrode
1628000	1630000	for electromagnetic testing.
1632000	1634000	Here,
1634000	1636000	we can get
1636000	1638000	different types of
1638000	1640000	NVOPF
1640000	1642000	based on
1642000	1644000	the ratio of the material
1644000	1646000	and the temperature of the synthesis.
1646000	1648000	Basically, NVOPF
1648000	1650000	is a rectangular body.
1650000	1652000	We usually get
1652000	1654000	brick-shaped
1654000	1656000	and if it is longer,
1656000	1658000	it becomes rod.
1658000	1660000	If it is shorter,
1660000	1662000	it becomes pellet.
1662000	1664000	We will discuss
1664000	1666000	the shape of the
1666000	1668000	NVOPF
1668000	1670000	and the impact of its size
1670000	1672000	on its reaction rate.
1672000	1674000	Next,
1674000	1676000	we will use bValue
1676000	1678000	to analyze
1678000	1680000	the properties of the fast charge.
1682000	1684000	In the first step,
1684000	1686000	we make different
1686000	1688000	cVs for the material.
1688000	1690000	From these four peaks,
1690000	1692000	we can get
1692000	1694000	individual bValue.
1696000	1698000	Then, we make
1698000	1700000	bValue with different
1700000	1702000	aspect ratio
1702000	1704000	and its size
1704000	1706000	to see
1706000	1708000	how it changes.
1712000	1714000	On the left is
1714000	1716000	the NVOPF pellet.
1716000	1718000	On the right,
1718000	1720000	we change
1720000	1722000	the rod
1722000	1724000	to reduce
1724000	1726000	the aspect ratio
1726000	1728000	to the brick
1728000	1730000	and the pellet.
1730000	1732000	We can see that
1732000	1734000	the bValue
1734000	1736000	decreases as the aspect ratio decreases.
1736000	1738000	This means that
1738000	1740000	when we decrease the aspect ratio,
1740000	1742000	the characteristics of the fast charge
1742000	1744000	will be more and more like the current.
1744000	1746000	It can become
1746000	1748000	the material
1748000	1750000	for the fast charge.
1752000	1754000	On the other hand,
1754000	1756000	we also
1756000	1758000	compare the
1758000	1760000	particle size
1760000	1762000	to the bValue.
1762000	1764000	We combine
1764000	1766000	the microns
1766000	1768000	and microns
1768000	1770000	to reduce the nanometers.
1770000	1772000	The nanometers
1772000	1774000	are reduced to a few tens of nanometers.
1774000	1776000	We can see that
1776000	1778000	when the size decreases,
1778000	1780000	the bValue also increases.
1780000	1782000	The increase in bValue means
1782000	1784000	that the smaller the particle,
1784000	1786000	the more suitable it is
1786000	1788000	for the fast charge.
1788000	1790000	The more suitable it is
1790000	1792000	for the fast charge.
1796000	1798000	The focus here is
1798000	1800000	on the microbrick.
1800000	1802000	Its peak bValue
1802000	1804000	is close to 0.5.
1804000	1806000	0.5 means that it is
1806000	1808000	like a battery.
1808000	1810000	When we make a nanoparticle,
1810000	1812000	all of its
1812000	1814000	oxidation-reduction reactions
1814000	1816000	have a bValue
1816000	1818000	of 0.7 or higher.
1822000	1824000	Next,
1824000	1826000	we will do a charge-electric charge test.
1826000	1828000	The nanoparticle
1828000	1830000	of the microbrick
1830000	1832000	can charge up to 90%
1832000	1834000	in 2 hours.
1834000	1836000	in 2 hours.
1836000	1838000	This means that
1838000	1840000	the bValue of the
1840000	1842000	NBOPF
1842000	1844000	has increased
1844000	1846000	significantly
1846000	1848000	after the nanoparticle
1848000	1850000	has been nanoparticle.
1850000	1852000	The bValue of the
1852000	1854000	bValue of the
1854000	1856000	bValue of the
1856000	1858000	bValue of

2076000	2078000	compared to the current specifications
2078000	2080000	our current current

2084000	2086000	greater than these specifications
2086000	2088000	our frequency
2088000	2090000	because of the device
2090000	2092000	on the device
2092000	2094000	we can only measure
2094000	2096000	a few microseconds
2096000	2098000	so we only measured
2098000	2100000	50Hz
2100000	2102000	50Hz
2102000	2104000	also covers some
2104000	2106000	function frequency
2110000	2112000	next
2112000	2114000	I will use this graph
2114000	2116000	to make a brief summary
2116000	2118000	the second part
2118000	2120000	we use nanoparticle
2120000	2122000	to convert this
2122000	2124000	NBOPF
2124000	2126000	to fast charge
2126000	2128000	in addition
2128000	2130000	we also proved
2130000	2132000	the feasibility of
2132000	2134000	NBOPF
2136000	2138000	finally
2138000	2140000	I will make a brief summary
2140000	2142000	what is
2142000	2144000	the so-called
2144000	2146000	Taekwondo Message
2146000	2148000	first, I hope everyone
2148000	2150000	knows what is a nanoparticle
2150000	2152000	nanoparticle
2152000	2154000	is actually a storage mechanism
2154000	2156000	it has the power of the nanoparticle
2156000	2158000	and the density of the battery
2158000	2160000	and
2162000	2164000	the second point
2164000	2166000	is how we can judge a nanoparticle
2166000	2168000	of course, through
2168000	2170000	the method of electromagnetic
2170000	2172000	we have such a CV
2172000	2174000	we have such a oblique
2174000	2176000	GC
2176000	2178000	and in the process of my oxygenation
2178000	2180000	the material did not change
2182000	2184000	finally
2184000	2186000	how do we design a nanoparticle
2186000	2188000	mainly
2188000	2190000	here I demo three points
2190000	2192000	the first is
2192000	2194000	the first is the conductivity
2194000	2196000	and the airtightness
2196000	2198000	I control the conductivity and airtightness of my electrode
2198000	2200000	to make my
2200000	2202000	NBOPF optimized
2202000	2204000	the second
2204000	2206000	is to make the material nanoparticle
2206000	2208000	and adjust its phase change
2208000	2210000	to make our general battery material
2210000	2212000	it is not affected
2212000	2214000	by
2214000	2216000	the transfer of ions
2216000	2218000	too slow
2218000	2220000	let it
2220000	2222000	in the part of the battery
2222000	2224000	can reach the high speed charge point
2224000	2226000	the effect
2230000	2232000	thank you
2234000	2236000	thank you
2236000	2238000	if you have any questions
2240000	2242000	please let me know
2242000	2244000	thank you
2244000	2246000	thank you Matt
2246000	2248000	now we can
2250000	2252000	start the Q&A
2252000	2254000	in the chat box
2254000	2256000	there are some questions
2256000	2258000	do you want to unmute
2258000	2260000	and ask your question
2266000	2268000	I want to ask
2268000	2270000	what is the electrolyte used
2270000	2272000	when you start to make your battery
2272000	2274000	it should be organic electrolyte
2274000	2276000	right
2276000	2278000	yes
2278000	2280000	I use
2280000	2282000	LIPF-6
2282000	2284000	ECDMC
2284000	2286000	the general
2286000	2288000	electrolyte used
2288000	2290000	so we can understand
2290000	2292000	why the lowest voltage
2292000	2294000	should be around 1.2V
2294000	2296000	another question
2296000	2298000	what is the
2298000	2300000	diagonal direction of
2300000	2302000	the nitrogen oxide
2302000	2304000	nitrogen oxide
2304000	2306000	not supercapacitor
2306000	2308000	it should be
2308000	2310000	interesting
2310000	2312000	or important
2314000	2316000	basically
2316000	2318000	the diagonal direction
2318000	2320000	is between
2320000	2322000	1.2V to
2322000	2324000	1.2V to 3V
2324000	2326000	this is
2326000	2328000	here
2328000	2330000	here
2330000	2332000	the diagonal direction
2332000	2334000	is 1.2V to
2334000	2336000	1.2V to 2.5V
2336000	2338000	this is
2338000	2340000	the nitrogen oxide
2340000	2342000	the capacity
2342000	2344000	should be
2344000	2346000	200
2346000	2348000	from 1.2V to
2348000	2350000	2.5V
2350000	2352000	90% of the voltage
2352000	2354000	comes from here
2354000	2356000	it means
2356000	2358000	when it is below 1.2V
2358000	2360000	2.5V will be disconnected
2360000	2362000	when it is below 1.2V
2362000	2364000	the electrolyte will be disconnected
2364000	2366000	the material will not be disconnected
2366000	2368000	when it is above 2.5V
2368000	2370000	you can't see
2370000	2372000	the current
2372000	2374000	the current will be
2374000	2376000	close to 0
2376000	2378000	like this picture
2378000	2380000	sorry
2380000	2382000	the CV is the same
2382000	2384000	it will be
2384000	2386000	no current
2386000	2388000	basically no current
2388000	2390000	ok
2390000	2392000	you just showed this slide
2392000	2394000	so I want to ask the following question
2394000	2396000	how do you calculate the B-value
2396000	2398000	and the voltage graph in the lower right corner
2398000	2400000	now we have
2400000	2402000	different CVs
2402000	2404000	each CV
2404000	2406000	has a current
2406000	2408000	in each voltage
2408000	2410000	so every current
2410000	2412000	will be analyzed
2412000	2414000	for the change
2414000	2416000	does the B-value have to use the peak current
2416000	2418000	or does it have to be any current
2418000	2420000	so today in pseudo-capacitance
2420000	2422000	pseudo-capacitance
2422000	2424000	basically
2424000	2426000	it has many
2426000	2428000	continuous
2428000	2430000	redox reactions
2430000	2432000	so when you produce a box
2432000	2434000	you can't
2434000	2436000	only analyze
2436000	2438000	the peak current
2438000	2440000	you are not fair to
2440000	2442000	the other currents
2442000	2444000	so
2444000	2446000	basically
2446000	2448000	in pseudo-capacitance
2448000	2450000	you can use this formula
2450000	2452000	on all the voltage graphs
2452000	2454000	to draw the continuous curve
2454000	2456000	another story
2456000	2458000	behind this
2458000	2460000	is that the redox
2460000	2462000	happens below 2V
2462000	2464000	so it doesn't have redox
2464000	2466000	so what do you see
2466000	2468000	you see EDLC
2468000	2470000	what does EDLC mean
2470000	2472000	EDLC is the
2472000	2474000	reaction rate
2474000	2476000	on the surface of the electrode
2476000	2478000	so EDLC
2478000	2480000	from the electrode
2480000	2482000	far away
2482000	2484000	to the surface of the electrode
2484000	2486000	what do you mean by diffusion control
2486000	2488000	yes
2488000	2490000	so here we increase
2490000	2492000	the density of Cdc
2492000	2494000	so the vacuum of the electrode
2494000	2496000	increases
2496000	2498000	so when there is no redox
2498000	2500000	the kinetics
2500000	2502000	increases
2502000	2504000	so when there is
2504000	2506000	redox
2506000	2508000	the kinetics increases
2512000	2514000	any other questions
2514000	2516000	ok thank you
2516000	2518000	the last one is later
2518000	2520000	so if you have any questions
2520000	2522000	I will ask later
2522000	2524000	any other
2524000	2526000	questions
2526000	2528000	hello
2528000	2530000	hello
2530000	2532000	I want to ask Matt
2532000	2534000	some questions
2534000	2536000	please
2536000	2538000	Matt thank you for your speech
2538000	2540000	my main question is
2540000	2542000	on your first project
2542000	2544000	you were doing
2544000	2546000	I want to ask
2546000	2548000	how big is the particle size
2548000	2550000	of Nairobia
2550000	2552000	the particle size is
2552000	2554000	here
2554000	2556000	you can see on the upper right
2556000	2558000	the size is
2558000	2560000	20-30 nm
2560000	2562000	20-30 nm
2562000	2564000	so you
2564000	2566000	reduce graphene oxide
2566000	2568000	and Cdc
2568000	2570000	to increase
2570000	2572000	the conductivity of short-circuit and long-circuit
2572000	2574000	yes
2574000	2576000	Cdc also provides the vacuum
2576000	2578000	ok
2578000	2580000	I was doing research on
2580000	2582000	hierarchical porous carbons
2582000	2584000	and
2584000	2586000	there are small
2586000	2588000	micropores
2588000	2590000	and big macropores
2590000	2592000	so I was thinking
2592000	2594000	if you combine
2594000	2596000	other porous materials
2596000	2598000	does it increase the
2598000	2600000	potential of the capacitor
2600000	2602000	yes
2602000	2604000	because
2604000	2606000	I have enough porosity
2606000	2608000	my particles
2608000	2610000	can be
2610000	2612000	I can
2612000	2614000	absorb more electrolyte
2614000	2616000	so I can
2616000	2618000	there is a slide
2618000	2620000	I didn't show
2620000	2622000	because I have some time
2622000	2624000	so you can see
2624000	2626000	why Nairobia
2626000	2628000	needs big porosity
2628000	2630000	basically
2630000	2632000	it comes from
2632000	2634000	ok
2634000	2636000	basically this slide
2636000	2638000	I was doing different
2638000	2640000	this is the result from consul
2640000	2642000	so
2642000	2644000	basically it comes from Nernst equation
2644000	2646000	and Poisson
2646000	2648000	equation
2648000	2650000	Poisson equation represents
2650000	2652000	how much
2652000	2654000	the dielectric constant is
2654000	2656000	so under different voltage
2656000	2658000	how many particles are on the surface
2658000	2660000	so when the voltage
2660000	2662000	moves to
2662000	2664000	in the middle of the graph
2664000	2666000	basically
2666000	2668000	it represents
2668000	2670000	how many particles are on the surface
2670000	2672000	but when it
2672000	2674000	moves to
2674000	2676000	below a certain level
2676000	2678000	Nairobia starts to react
2678000	2680000	I need a lot of
2680000	2682000	particles to enter the material
2682000	2684000	so when it needs a lot of particles
2684000	2686000	to enter the material
2686000	2688000	it will cause the surface porosity
2688000	2690000	the surface porosity
2690000	2692000	is the reason why
2692000	2694000	Nairobia's kinetics
2694000	2696000	so
2696000	2698000	this is the reason why
2698000	2700000	this material needs
2700000	2702000	high porosity
2702000	2704000	so that
2704000	2706000	it can maintain
2706000	2708000	the characteristics of the dielectric
2708000	2710000	or the characteristics
2710000	2712000	of the dielectric
2712000	2714000	I want to
2714000	2716000	follow up
2716000	2718000	how did you come up with
2718000	2720000	reducing graphene oxide
2720000	2722000	plus Cdc
2722000	2724000	reducing graphene oxide
2724000	2726000	has another advantage
2726000	2728000	on the synthesis
2728000	2730000	basically if you want to
2730000	2732000	grow oxide
2732000	2734000	graphene oxide
2734000	2736000	the ligand of oxygen
2736000	2738000	can be the nucleation site
2738000	2740000	of these synthesis
2740000	2742000	no matter if you want to grow metal particles
2742000	2744000	or oxide particles
2744000	2746000	basically it can easily grow on top
2746000	2748000	because it has a lot of sites
2748000	2750000	the particles you grow
2750000	2752000	are small
2752000	2754000	so
2754000	2756000	graphene oxide
2756000	2758000	is like an additive
2758000	2760000	it can make your particle size very small
2760000	2762000	second, it also increases
2762000	2764000	the conductivity
2764000	2766000	for graphene oxide
2766000	2768000	there are several ways
2768000	2770000	for example, you do filtration
2770000	2772000	you filter it
2772000	2774000	it is
2774000	2776000	a two-dimensional structure
2776000	2778000	so when you do filtration
2778000	2780000	when you do filtration
2780000	2782000	it will become
2782000	2784000	a very dense electrode
2784000	2786000	if it is very dense
2786000	2788000	the electrode can't get in
2788000	2790000	so we want to
2790000	2792000	find a structure
2792000	2794000	like Cdc
2794000	2796000	this
2796000	2798000	structure
2798000	2800000	of graphene oxide
2800000	2802000	to mix in
2802000	2804000	but we don't want to mix too much
2804000	2806000	because
2806000	2808000	the density of the energy
2808000	2810000	is relatively low
2810000	2812000	I understand, thank you
2816000	2818000	any other questions?
2824000	2826000	if not
2826000	2828000	I will ask my last question
2828000	2830000	after talking about ZMath
2830000	2832000	I mentioned
2832000	2834000	how to distinguish
2834000	2836000	between solid electrolyte and
2836000	2838000	solid electrolyte
2838000	2840000	but now
2840000	2842000	there is a popular topic
2842000	2844000	solid electrolyte
2844000	2846000	or solid electrolyte
2846000	2848000	I want to see
2848000	2850000	the difference between
2850000	2852000	solid electrolyte and
2852000	2854000	other two
2854000	2856000	how to distinguish
2856000	2858000	how to judge
2858000	2860000	actually
2860000	2862000	I didn't do the
2862000	2864000	because I talked about
2864000	2866000	the second topic
2866000	2868000	solid electrolyte
2868000	2870000	yes, it was
2870000	2872000	solid electrolyte
2872000	2874000	but we took it
2874000	2876000	basically
2876000	2878000	we just changed its structure
2878000	2880000	then we took it as an electrolyte
2880000	2882000	basically
2882000	2884000	solid electrolyte
2886000	2888000	yes
2888000	2890000	I don't know much about this
2890000	2892000	what I know about solid electrolyte
2892000	2894000	is
2894000	2896000	its conductivity
2896000	2898000	it must be very thin
2898000	2900000	because its conductivity is not as fast as liquid
2900000	2902000	although it is solid electrolyte
2902000	2904000	but it is not as fast as liquid
2904000	2906000	another thing
2906000	2908000	everyone says
2908000	2910000	solid electrolyte
2910000	2912000	it doesn't
2912000	2914000	we can
2914000	2916000	avoid the SEI reaction
2916000	2918000	but actually
2918000	2920000	this is a loss
2920000	2922000	actually solid electrolyte
2922000	2924000	in its first cycle
2924000	2926000	its SEI
2926000	2928000	has a big impact
2928000	2930000	in our group
2930000	2932000	in addition to high-speed charge
2932000	2934000	another part is
2934000	2936000	3D battery
2936000	2938000	3D battery is
2938000	2940000	the structure of the battery
2940000	2942000	to make it a satellite battery
2942000	2944000	that part
2944000	2946000	in solid electrolyte
2946000	2948000	of course we want to use solid electrolyte
2948000	2950000	because solid electrolyte
2950000	2952000	its density
2952000	2954000	is much higher than liquid
2954000	2956000	so we can save a lot of liquid
2956000	2958000	needed volume
2958000	2960000	but they found that in the first cycle
2960000	2962000	this SEI
2962000	2964000	actually still occurs
2964000	2966000	and after it occurs
2966000	2968000	because it is solid
2968000	2970000	so it is very difficult to solve
2970000	2972000	basically your material
2972000	2974000	at first it is a tight connection
2974000	2976000	it will separate
2980000	2982000	thank you
2986000	2988000	anyone else have questions?
2994000	2996000	if no questions
2998000	3000000	Max, do you have your email?
3000000	3002000	yes
3002000	3004000	I put it in the last slide
3008000	3010000	if you have any questions
3010000	3012000	you can
3014000	3016000	email me
3020000	3022000	thank you
3022000	3024000	for coming
3024000	3026000	and thank you Max
3026000	3028000	for giving us such a wonderful speech
3028000	3030000	this recording
3030000	3032000	you can watch it again
3032000	3034000	in a week
3036000	3038000	and you can continue
3038000	3040000	to discuss with Max
3040000	3042000	related research
3042000	3044000	so I will stop recording now
