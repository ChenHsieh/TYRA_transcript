00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello everyone, I am today's keynote speaker, Jason Hong.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
I am now a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
I am also a Project Taira staff member.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
Project Taira stands for the Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.

00:32.000 --> 00:47.000
The purpose of today's event is to provide suggestions and feedback.

00:48.000 --> 01:00.000
We hope that Project Taira will continue to grow and improve.

01:00.000 --> 01:11.000
At the beginning, I would like to talk about what Project Taira is currently doing,

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
and what questions we would like to ask.

01:16.000 --> 01:32.000
This video is the summary of Project Taira.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
We hope to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
to connect with Taiwanese academics from all over the world,

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
to communicate about the development, results, and trends of overseas and Taiwan academic circles,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
and to provide each other with an effective platform for communication.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
This is basically the purpose of Project Taira.

01:55.000 --> 02:05.000
We hope that young Taiwanese academics from all over the world can come to this platform,

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
and share information with each other.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Our organization currently has two websites.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
The first is our blog, where we publish our weekly speeches.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
The second is our Facebook page, where you can find our information.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
Let me talk a little bit about what Project Taira has been doing in recent years.

02:36.000 --> 02:46.000
The first thing we are doing is to prepare a regular speech every week.

02:46.000 --> 02:55.000
We have been doing this speech from 2017 to now, about 4 to 5 years.

02:56.000 --> 03:11.000
If you go to our blog, the page will tell you what the topic of our next week's speech is.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
There are many topics, and it will tell you the main time.

03:17.000 --> 03:28.000
We hope that the main time will be around 6 to 7 p.m. in the west coast of the United States.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
This time will be around 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the east coast of the United States.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
If you are in Taiwan, you may hear this speech at 10 a.m.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
We mainly do this on weekends, such as Saturdays and Sundays.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
We hope that you can take the time to listen to our speech.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
We hope that you can take the time to listen to our speech.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Every week, our speech will be recorded and posted on our blog.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
If you have listeners who want to find the previous speech,

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
you may find some important information in the previous speech,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
and you may go there to find it.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
We hope that every week we can record the speech and put it in this space.

04:25.000 --> 04:34.000
Sometimes, if the speech has not been published yet,

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
we can postpone the upload time.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
According to our previous results,

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
we have found speakers from various fields.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
This is a small part.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
This may be related to air pollution, biology, astronomy,

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
or computer science.

05:13.000 --> 05:23.000
We will share the information of the speech every week.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
We use e-mail and the blog I just mentioned.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
We will share it on Facebook.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
We will also share it on the Facebook page of major alumni associations.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
Finally, if you are a speaker and you give a speech,

05:50.000 --> 05:59.000
we will send you an Amazon gift card at the end of the year.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
It depends on our budget.

06:04.000 --> 06:13.000
The above is our regular talk.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
The second important thing we do is the summer special activities.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
In the summer, because everyone is on vacation,

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
there is usually less time in the middle to give a speech.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
In the middle, we will invite some people from outside to give us some speeches.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Some special and interesting speeches.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
In 2018, we invited Liu Junlin to tell us

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
how to use some academic speech or presentation software.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
For example, how to use LaTeX, how to use DeepLeaf.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I don't know what these are.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
In 2019, we made some changes.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
Our main focus was the ZR development symposium.

07:08.000 --> 07:18.000
We invited two professors and an industry person

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
to share with us their experience in finding a job.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
I believe this is a topic that many people are interested in.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
This symposium has a very high attendance rate.

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
In 2020, two weeks ago,

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
we continued to do academic work and development symposium.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
This event is co-organized with the Professor Association of Taiwan in North America.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
This year, we invited them to co-organize the symposium.

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
We hope that we can get more information from the professor.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
This year, there are some other activities.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
For example, the annual member's meeting.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Two or three weeks later,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
there will be a research project on Taiwan's first rocket.

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
Finally, there will be a symposium on the reform of higher education.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
I think this symposium is quite interesting.

08:27.000 --> 08:37.000
We invited the former president of the Research Student Association,

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
as well as some legal assistants and researchers from the Policy Research Center.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
I hope that more people can participate in this symposium.

08:51.000 --> 09:01.000
This symposium is very hard-earned by Professor Yan Yong, one of our staff members.

09:01.000 --> 09:12.000
There are two important things that Taira has done so far.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
There is a weekly speech and a special symposium or speech in the summer.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
Let's take a look at the growth data.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
You can give us some suggestions for reference.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
The first graph shows the number of members and the time.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
As you can see, we had a member system since the end of 2017.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
It has continued to grow.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
It looks pretty linear.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
I hope we can continue to maintain it in the future.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
So far, we have almost 300 members.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
We held a total of 122 speeches.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
If you look at our Facebook page, there are more than 2,000 members.

10:04.000 --> 10:14.000
The graph on the right is the breakdown of our speech.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I divided it into several categories.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
Because the topic is very complicated and diverse, I roughly divided it into several categories.

10:24.000 --> 10:34.000
It's probably math, physics, chemistry, biology, other sciences, engineering, and humanities.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
You can take a look at it.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
So far, physics and biology seem to be the most popular.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Engineering is also quite a lot.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
The number of members is actually the most in these categories.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
But the number of speeches is not very clear.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
The number of speeches seems to be the most in biology.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Next, if you add physics, it is also the most.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
This is our breakdown.

11:12.000 --> 11:26.000
The following is the IP address of the audience.

11:26.000 --> 11:35.000
70% of the audience is from the United States.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
About 20% of the audience is from Taiwan.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
The rest are from Japan and some European countries.

11:45.000 --> 11:56.000
The number of people on the line seems to be smaller and more professional.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
So the number of people on the line is about 10 people.

12:03.000 --> 12:13.000
Unless there is a symposium, the number of people on the line may exceed 50 or 40.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
These 40 or 50 people are usually in a symposium.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
This is a special event in the summer.

12:26.000 --> 12:33.000
Finally, I would like to mention that there are organizations that cooperate with us and support us financially.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
As mentioned earlier, we have some financial support.

12:40.000 --> 12:50.000
These funds come from the Ministry of Education and TACO.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
We also found some partners.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
This is the Taiwan University Graduate Association and the North American and Taiwanese Professor Association.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
There are also some activities from the Ministry of Science and Technology.

13:05.000 --> 13:14.000
Unfortunately, we can't hold activities with them this year, but we hope to hold activities with them in the future.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
We would like to hear some opinions from the ministers and scientists.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
I hope to leave more time for meeting discussion.

13:31.000 --> 13:40.000
I have listed some things that we want to discuss with you.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
There are four main parts.

13:43.000 --> 13:52.000
Membership rights, PR team, seminar team, and IT team.

13:53.000 --> 14:02.000
As for the membership rights, the priority is higher.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
We hope to change some membership rights and obligations.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
We also hope to change some conditions and frequency for speeches.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Let's take a look at the following slide.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
You can take a look at it.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
In our blog, we mentioned the membership rights.

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
This is for doctoral students and post-doctoral students working in public or private institutions.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
The main problem is the membership obligations.

14:35.000 --> 14:46.000
In our previous membership obligations, there is a rule that members should give a speech every two years and share recent research results.

14:46.000 --> 14:55.000
This rule is because a long time ago, the TARA group was actually a very small organization.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
There were more than ten people at that time, and we had to give speeches in turns.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
But now there are too many members, and it has become a big organization.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
We hope to discuss how we should upgrade our speeches in the future.

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
What rights should we have as members?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
How should TARA upgrade its speeches?

15:29.000 --> 15:39.000
One of our proposals is to eliminate this obligation.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
We don't need to give a speech every two years.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
Giving a speech is your right.

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
In the future, we will try to find members who have a membership status.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
We will try to find speakers from the members so that you can share your speech.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
It's also a chance to practice speaking.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
This is a change.

16:12.000 --> 16:28.000
In addition, there are some job openings opportunities in universities and Taiwan.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
They will provide us with job openings information.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
We will forward this information to the members.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
This is a new membership right.

16:41.000 --> 16:49.000
According to these conditions, what we hope to do in the future is this.

16:49.000 --> 17:02.000
If you are not a member and you are a non-member, you will go to a non-member registration form.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
You need to fill out a form.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
If you are a member, you will receive our letters on a regular basis.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
You don't have to do anything. You just need to go online and participate in the speech.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
In the future, we hope to change it to this.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
We will make two Google Groups.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
Basically, it's a group of non-members.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
A group is responsible for the information of TeraTalks.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
Every week, TeraTalks will be sent out by this letter.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
You can freely choose whether you want to join or quit.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
It's like a subscribe function.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
You just need to subscribe.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It doesn't matter if you are a member or not.

17:54.000 --> 18:02.000
For this reason, all members or non-members have to sign up for the speech.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
You need to fill out a form to participate in the speech.

18:05.000 --> 18:13.000
The second thing the Google Group does is to send the information of TeraTalks to everyone.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
However, this is limited to the rights of members.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
So far, we hope to make such a change.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Please listen to it.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
There are other things we can discuss.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
For example, the PR group.

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
One important thing is that TeraTalks has no official logo.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
So we hope everyone can provide a logo.

18:40.000 --> 18:48.000
Or we can hold a logo presentation.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
We need to do something like this.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
If you want us to work together, you can suggest it later.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
We will have Q&A time later.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
You can make a suggestion at that time.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
Another thing is that the number of registrants we have seen so far.

19:07.000 --> 19:16.000
If there are 30 people, only 15 people will participate in the speech.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
It's weird. Where are the other 15 people?

19:21.000 --> 19:30.000
For the seminar group, if you want us to make some adjustments in the field of speech.

19:30.000 --> 19:39.000
Or if you want us to do something special in the summer.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Everyone can make a suggestion.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
If you want to open a journal club, or want to do a forum in your field.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
You can also discuss with us.

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
For the IT group, we mainly want to know the experience of using BlueDreams.

19:58.000 --> 20:06.000
We want to know if there are any benefits of other online meeting software.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
It is very, very necessary.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
OK.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
My report is about to end.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
I hope everyone can, whether it's on this topic.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Or if you have anything else you want to discuss, you can mention it later.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
This is our current staff.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Let me read the names.

20:32.000 --> 20:41.000
Zhang Jianyuan, Zhang Yanping, Hong Shisan, Xu Youzhen, Wei Qunshu, Zhang Yanyong, Zhou Zhixian, Zhu Haoran, Su Yiyan, and Yang Jiayin.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
OK.

20:43.000 --> 20:56.000
We will have about 20 to 30 minutes of Q&A.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
After that, we will have a small presentation for recruiting staff.

21:03.000 --> 21:13.000
If you want to join our Taira organization, you are welcome to stay.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Our Taira organization needs new blood.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
We need new blood.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
The reason we founded this organization is that there are a group of young scholars.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Everyone can share with each other.

21:28.000 --> 21:36.000
As you know, if there is a professor here, a professor who may be 40 or 50 years old, everyone will feel uncomfortable.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
So we really want young scholars to join us.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Then we can finish this project together.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
OK.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
Let's start the discussion.

21:52.000 --> 22:00.000
Does anyone have any comments?

22:00.000 --> 22:19.000
Hello? I can't hear you.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
There seems to be a serious echo.

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
Hello?

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
Sorry, there was a problem with my microphone.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
I just told you that your video is gone.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And now it's back.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
You are not playing, but it's back.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
So what should we discuss now?

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
Should we discuss one group at a time or all at once?

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
Let's start with the membership rights.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
This is what we want to know the most.

23:01.000 --> 23:14.000
Do you have any questions about the membership rights or membership obligations?

23:15.000 --> 23:23.000
Let me talk about why we proposed this.

23:23.000 --> 23:34.000
Jason and I were mainly collecting speeches and then arranging them into annual schedules.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
Then we found that there are too many people now.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
If you calculate a little, there are more than 42 weeks a year, right?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
No, sorry, there are more than 50 weeks.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Then deduct the holiday, we have to arrange 30 speeches a year.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
But we have more than 200 people, so we just have to say that we want to collect speeches.

23:56.000 --> 24:05.000
Even if we only limit the number of members to give speeches, we will usually line up far more than this year's slots.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Then it will be too much.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
So we were a bit like a compulsory.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
That is, we ask everyone to give a speech every one to two years.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
This thing basically does not exist.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Because everyone is forced to give a speech, otherwise you will line up for three years.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
This is also a strange thing.

24:23.000 --> 24:31.000
Instead, many people come to ask if I can use this platform to share my speech.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Let me find potential partners.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
Or let people who are interested in the same field as me get to know each other.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Then we can discuss.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
It becomes a kind of benefit.

24:48.000 --> 24:58.000
Basically, everyone who comes to participate now means that you are already members.

24:58.000 --> 25:06.000
In theory, you can give your opinion on our policy.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
What do you think?

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
Or do you have any other thoughts on this part?

25:13.000 --> 25:23.000
Everyone is very silent.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Everyone seems to be very silent.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Yes.

25:27.000 --> 25:43.000
If not, let's ask everyone else's opinion first.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Everyone may have no feeling for this.

25:46.000 --> 26:00.000
Do you want to adjust the field of our speech?

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
Or do you have any interesting summer activities that you want to provide?

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
I can't see the chat.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
I saw a lot of comments on the chat just now.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
No, the chat is not important.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
The chat is self-introduction.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
It has nothing to do with what I told you.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
OK.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Let me talk about this part.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
It's the same as me and Jason.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
We are having a speech.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
We first found a problem.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
In fact, there are quite a few people who have given us suggestions.

26:39.000 --> 26:47.000
You may find that a very large part of TARA is focused on the speech in the field of science and technology.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
This is not our intention.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
We don't want to be biased in this way.

26:55.000 --> 27:09.000
In fact, we really want to have humanitarian research, or even various kinds of research, to enter our organization.

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
Because the ultimate goal is to connect young people around the world to engage in research.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
But the reason is simple.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
Our network is very polite.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
So our friends spread out like this.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Then TARA becomes a very polite organization.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
There are even other similar academic exchanges.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
They all say, aren't you just a polite academic organization?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
They think we are positioned like this.

27:44.000 --> 27:54.000
We found that when we start to give others such an impression, positive feedback will continue to make us more like this.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
Then we have no way to break through the humanistic part.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
So I don't know what you think.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
This is the first one.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
The other one is similar.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
We are a very American-based organization.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
This is also because the founders are all in the United States, so our circle of friends is also in the United States.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
But we have always wanted to enter, that is to say, we can connect with European Taiwanese.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
But this has always been a bit of a difficult thing.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
I don't know what you think about this.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Or what do you think? Or what can we do?

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
Or if you want to provide a speaker specifically, you can also hope that he will give a speech.

28:36.000 --> 28:43.000
Hello is my name is Zhong Boting, and I just joined the first time to attend this meeting.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
And then I had not heard of any of your speeches at all.

28:46.000 --> 28:53.000
And then I just a little bit, I have a little look at your previous speech, is the head of the head of the head.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
And then I am a background in science and engineering.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
And then I feel from the start it seems to be quite professional.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
I do not know the content because I did not go to see the content, but just from the beginning to look at it, I feel very professional.

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
And then even if I am a science and engineering, I will have a little bit of rejection.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Because I do not understand the title at all.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
And then I think this may be more for those of you who are talking about other fields.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Maybe those who are not science and engineering are not science and engineering.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
They may be a little bit more sure.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
So I was thinking, is it possible to give some more general?

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
Just from the title, it looks like a more general, everyone can participate.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
It will be more interesting.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Oh, I see.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Yes, this is my feeling.

29:43.000 --> 29:50.000
But I just joined the first time, so I just looked at the title of the previous talk very quickly.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
Yes, I can understand this thing.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
Yes, but the current title is actually written by the speaker.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
We will not make any changes.

30:01.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm not sure if your goal is to make it easier for everyone to understand and be interested.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
Then there may be more people who really participate.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
There is a chance to attract more people.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Sorry, can you hear my voice?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
You go first.

30:24.000 --> 30:34.000
Our current approach is that when the speaker comes, we will suggest that you can give a 10 to 20-minute background review.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
It's about the general audience.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
But we can't control what the speaker is going to do.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Some speakers will do it, some will not do it.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
This is not something we can control.

30:49.000 --> 30:59.000
I think maybe in the future we can discuss the topic and content with the speaker.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
In this case, can we make him more generous?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
What do you think, Yanyong?

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
I have a different opinion, but Zhang Yiping just said something.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Yes.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Zhang Yiping, don't talk first.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I told him not to talk first.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
OK, I'll speak first.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
No, Zhang Yiping, you go first.

31:20.000 --> 31:29.000
I want to talk about what Zhang Yiyong just said.

31:29.000 --> 31:36.000
I think our number of people, although it seems that if you compare, there are more volunteers.

31:37.000 --> 31:46.000
But if you compare the number of people in the research institute, in Taiwan, especially in the United States,

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
I don't think we are particularly humanistic.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Because there are very few people who are humanistic.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
So maybe...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
You don't think there are many volunteers?

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
I don't think there are many volunteers because there are very few people who are humanistic.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
So our people are relatively humanistic.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
That's what I think.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
There are not many, but I don't think this is a mistake.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Of course, if your interpretation is that everyone has to do 50% or 55%,

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
it may look like that, but this is actually a mistake.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
I think this is a mistake.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
I can add to Zhang Yiping.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
It's about 5 to 1.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
Hello everyone, I'm Yi An, and I'm a staff member.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
I think in the past five years, from the doctoral students who graduated from North America,

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
there are about 500 to 600 so-called science majors every year,

32:36.000 --> 32:43.000
and about 100 are humanities or humanities.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
It's about 5 to 1.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
If you look at the number of doctoral graduates from North America.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Another thing you just said,

32:52.000 --> 32:59.000
Zhang Yiping just talked about the number of people in different regions.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I think there are very few people in Europe.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
I guess there's a reason.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Maybe it's because their time is really not ideal.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
In the United States and Taiwan, one in the evening, one in the morning.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
The European time zone is 2 o'clock in the middle of the night.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
That's really difficult.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
So maybe it's a barrier.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Let me interrupt you.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
I don't know if I can interrupt your point of view.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
We are now chatting.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
There are different people with different problems.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
We will discuss one by one.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
But let's finish the discussion now.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
So everyone just wait patiently.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
What I'm going to talk about next is about the topic.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
How broad or narrow the topic is.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
I guess what Zhang Yiping is going to tell me is about the same.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Because I don't think ...

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
First of all, I am Zhang Yiping.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I am studying social psychology.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
So I guess I am ...

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I'm not completely humanities.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
But I should be relatively social science.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
But from my point of view,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
I don't think the current topic is too special.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
The reason is ...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The reason is ...

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
I don't think ...

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
At least my understanding is that Tyra's goal is not to do science.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
We are not TED.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So ...

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
And we didn't force everyone to attend many times.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
So it seems that social science people have to sign up for a few things.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
He obviously doesn't understand.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
This is not ...

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
This is a free participation.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Then our goal is actually more professional.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
This ...

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Establish academic links with each other.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
So it was originally a professional academic link.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
If I see that topic, I don't know at all.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
He wrote a few mathematical symbols on it.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Even this ...

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
The symbol of the physical example has nothing to do with me.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I just don't want to go.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
On the contrary, such a more professional topic can actually help ...

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
The speaker and the audience will go to establish a link.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Instead of them talking ...

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
They ...

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
The speaker and the original professional audience feel very shallow.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
They don't know what they are doing here.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Then I go ...

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
I finished listening.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
I think it's very interesting.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
But when I go home, it has nothing to do with my academics.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
I think ...

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I think it's more of a difference.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
So I ...

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
I don't think the topic is too short now.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Let me talk about that ...

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Zhang Jiaming just said.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
That is ...

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
In fact, I think there is a point.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Just ...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Jason is not very correct.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
That is, we can't control the speaker.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
In fact, we are communicating with the speaker.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
When is the speech?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
How do we usually arrange a process?

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
How much time do you need to do the introduction?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
How long does it take to talk about the professional part?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
But ...

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
We ...

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
At least I personally ...

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
If I do it ...

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I am doing some speeches.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
If it's my field of chair.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I will tell them that ...

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
We hope it can really be in ...

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Academically, it has enough impact on you.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
That is to say ...

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
You can get a network that is useful to you.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Or a partner.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
So if you come and give a ...

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Like ...

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
If you give a speech like a YouTuber ...

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
It may make everyone feel very fruitful.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
But in fact, for our organization ...

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Or for ...

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
The impact we really want to have.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
May not be the best.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Because you go ...

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah, it's TED Talk.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Just listen to TED Talk.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
So I personally ...

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Usually positioned in this part.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Then I will tell them that ...

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
What academic speech do you want to say?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
You really let ...

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
This thing can be played.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
That ...

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
He himself will not come.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
We do not mind a speech.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Only ten people.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Or I do not mind.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
But in fact, I know ...

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Jason is actually more inclined to do ...

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
More ...

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Interdisciplinary.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Or ...

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
More ...

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Lighter.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
But a wider speech.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Then I think this is a ...

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Discussable direction.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
That is to say ...

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Everyone to our ...

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
What do you think of the scope?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
This way.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I do not necessarily want to do ...

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Lighter speech.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
I hope that ...

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
That is ...

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Speakers ...

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
In fact, you can ...

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Spend ten to twenty minutes to talk about the background.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
That is to say ...

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
His field ...

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
That is ...

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Current development ...

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
What is the current situation?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
How?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
That is ...

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
But later ...

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
He can say that ...

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
He ...

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
What is he really doing?

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
I would think ...

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
If this is the case ...

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I think this is actually ...

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
A large part is the current situation.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Is not it?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
I think ...

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
If this is the case, I think ...

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
I quite agree.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
I think ...

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Sure.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
If you really want to produce this ...

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Cross-field cooperation ...

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
You do not tell people ...

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
You are in ...

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
What is your big picture?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
In fact, it is very ...

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
It is a hindrance.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
So I think ...

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
This ...

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Yes.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
But there is ...

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
I think ...

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
The audience just said ...

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
A good point is that ...

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
This is your name ...

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
It can be better.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
You can write better.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Yes, I think my ...

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
My idea should just say ...

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Because you just discussed ...

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
How to let ...

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Some ...

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Different audiences ...

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Participate.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Maybe I did not hear very clearly.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
But I just want to say ...

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Maybe you can ...

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
How to attract people.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
So I just feel from ...

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Title or ...

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Advertising ...

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
You can attract people.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Because ...

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Maybe you have discussed the content ...

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Background.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
But because I ...

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I do not know these things.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Yes.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
OK.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Yes.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I think his meaning should be like this.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
That is ...

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
We should be advertising ...

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Promotion.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Or ...

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Title should be at least ...

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Clear.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Clear.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
And I think ...

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I do not know if this is too much trouble.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
But I think maybe ...

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Can be divided a little bit.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Because like now ...

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Someone mentioned ...

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
I just mentioned that ...

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
We can be divided into areas.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Or ...

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
But I think maybe ...

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
You can be divided a little bit.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
There are some talks ...

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Maybe some ...

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Speakers would like to talk ...

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
General ...

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
A little bit.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Or more ...

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Background part.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Some of them may be ...

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
More professional ...

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Want to discuss with each other.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
But I think ...

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
This may be a little bit ...

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
To distinguish.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
This may also be helpful ...

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
To digest ...

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
That is ...

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Speech requirements.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
I ...

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
I ...

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I want to follow this suggestion.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
My own position is more like ...

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Leave this freedom to the speaker.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Let me give an example.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Like ...

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Uh ...

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
The freedom I'm talking about is ...

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
How deep, how much money, how much money.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
This freedom.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Let me give an example.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Suppose I am doing this today.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Quantum computing.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Then I did it very well.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
I am ...

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
I am Zhang Taide.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
I am very professional.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
I am very good.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Then I'm going to find another one.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
With me ...

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
To ...

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
This ...

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Co-PI of a ...

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
I am now looking for a co-PI.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Then do a very professional thing.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
So I talked about a very professional speech.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
I wrote a very professional title.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Others do not understand.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Is ...

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
They just go to die.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
This is my freedom.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Then my goal is ...

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
This way.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Then I also do this.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
I also achieved.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
I actually feel that there is no problem.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
But suppose I am doing today.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Quantum computing.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Then I want to go to the TSMC to ask for money.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
This way.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Then I obviously can not write ...

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Such a title.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
So I will ...

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Uh ...

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
I ...

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
I predict who the audience is.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
So I wrote a relatively clear title.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Then focus on not so much math.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Maybe not so much math.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Then write some ...

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
The future possibilities of these.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Then I may even be ...

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Write Chinese, etc.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
So I will be more inclined to ...

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Uh ...

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
The speaker ...

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I think this is the responsibility of the speaker.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
They ...

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Want to know their own ...

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Predict the audience.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Who do they want the audience to be?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Then go ...

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Cooperate with the audience.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Control their depth.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Achieve the goal they want to achieve.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
I will be more inclined to ...

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Leave this part to the speaker.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Then if you really want the speaker ...

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
There is no no.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Yeah, I ...

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
I fully understand you.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I mean ...

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
The speaker can of course decide for himself.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
But it should be said ...

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Maybe your platform can ...

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Is that you can ...

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Maybe on the website.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Or what can you say?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Oh, we have ...

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
These ...

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
That is, we may ...

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
You can give these ...

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Types of ...

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
That ...

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Speech.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Then you can ...

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Just think about it.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Which part are you more inclined to?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
That ...

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
You can tell us first.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Then we are doing advertising.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Or in classification.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Or when arranging.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
We are more able to ...

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Just ...

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Help you classify well.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Or help you promote.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Of course there is a speaker.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Decide for yourself first.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
What type does he want to give you?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
It's not that we ...

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I did not say what to ask the speaker to give.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Just say you are probably ...

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Just in advertising.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Or classification.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Or just ...

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
When giving everyone options.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Just say, oh, we have these choices.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
This feeling.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Yeah.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Yeah.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Ok.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Understand.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
This may be in the future.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Just ...

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
To the speaker's ...

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Uh ...

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Instructions.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Because I was thinking ...

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
You just ...

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Yeah.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
You just said ...

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Maybe you want to classify or classify.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Then I just want to say ...

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
This may be ...

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Just ...

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
You can try it.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Just ...

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Because I have participated in it.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
I'm not sure.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
No, no.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I think this suggestion is very good.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Just ...

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I think we might have to think about it.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Is ...

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Sure.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Our speech content.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
There is probably no problem.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
This is the 20-minute, 40-minute distribution.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Then the depth of distribution.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
But we are ...

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Let others see this.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
When people see this announcement.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Unless you are really doing that thing.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Or you will not know.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
What is this doing?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
That is either.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
We can make the speech.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
The title can be set.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
It is easier to understand.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Otherwise, we are.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
We, for example, Facebook.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
That article in the post.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
There should be one.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
For example,

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
What kind of this is.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Or say this thing.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
One word clearly said.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
What is this doing?

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
This is so that you can know.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
I think this may have to think about it later.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
I think this may have to think about it later.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
I think this may have to think about it later.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
I think this may have to think about it later.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
I wrote it down.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
End of discussion.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
We can write a difficulty index.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Then every time.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
That is, you know.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
1 star is a textbook speech.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
5 stars.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
You may have to do academic discussion.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
You may have to do academic discussion.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
We can have one like this.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
We can have one like this.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Logo.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
What is the type.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
OK.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
That was Zhang Yan-yong.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
That was Zhang Yan-yong.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
I am not sure.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
I am not sure.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
There is no.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
It's me.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
But I was just...

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
But I was just...

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Settings.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
I finished.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
I finished.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
I finished.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
And then...

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Er...

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
So I think just now,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
The summary of Zhang Yan-yong is good.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

43:43.000 --> 43:44.400
In this speech,

43:44.400 --> 43:45.500
In this speech,

43:45.500 --> 43:47.000
Because of, for example,

43:47.000 --> 43:47.000


43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Because of, for example,

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Because of, for example,

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
Because of, for example,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
Because of, for example,

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
Because of, for example,

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
Because of, for example,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
Because of, for example,

44:13.000 --> 44:21.000
Because of, for example,

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
Because of, for example,

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
Because of, for example,

44:30.000 --> 44:40.000
Because of, for example,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
Because of, for example,

44:43.000 --> 44:49.000
Because of, for example,

44:49.000 --> 44:56.000
Because of, for example,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
The development of your career may be similar at that age.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
The development of your career may be similar at that age.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
That's probably what I am talking about.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Well that's the answer to your question.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
Last time when I was looking for a job as a novice professor

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
I found that most of the professors are very active.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
But I don't know if they are active when I am in a deeper speech.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
But I don't know if they are active when I am in a deeper speech.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Or maybe they are not participating.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I found that they may have been doctors at that time.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
I found that they may have been doctors at that time.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
But they are now in the workplace.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Their contribution and their needs are different.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
But we didn't follow them or update them.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
But we didn't follow them or update them.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
When we want to find a partner,

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
we can't find them.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
Another thing I want to mention is the scope.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
In public health,

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
there is a committee of North American public health scholars.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
The committee is very detailed.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
We have a group about health policy on Facebook.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
We have a group about health policy on Facebook.

46:13.000 --> 46:19.000
If the members are willing to work with other professional groups,

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
If the members are willing to work with other professional groups,

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
it will increase the scope of their work.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
But now I heard that the speech is all about science and technology.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
I participated in a few times.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I participated in a few times.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I really don't understand other things.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I really don't understand other things.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Who are you and what are you doing?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Who are you and what are you doing?

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Who are you and what are you doing?

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
I don't think there is a way.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
If your profession has a special organization

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
that has been established for a long time

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
and has developed into a good platform,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
I don't think we need to recruit people like that.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
I don't think we need to recruit people like that.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
We can find a Taiwanese public service organization in North America

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
and hold a speech with them.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I think this is the best way to cooperate.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
For public service scholars,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
they can speak on our platform.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
They can speak to non-public service people.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
They can speak to non-public service people.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
In this way, they may be able to reach people

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
they usually can't reach.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
I think this is a way to cooperate.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
I think I can only agree with this.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I just want to say

48:15.000 --> 48:21.000
in our administrative experience,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
in fact,

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
I know there is a Taiwanese Biological Society in Boston.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
They are in South California now.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
They are in San Diego.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Professional societies like this

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
have contacted us.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
There are also other societies

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
that are similar to Taiwanese

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
in certain academic fields overseas.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Many of them have contacted us.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
We do want to cooperate with them.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
We are also very welcome

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
if there is a practical plan

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
to discuss with us

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
or if you are interested in joining the staff.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Because we don't have a lot of people.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
This is also a problem.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Another problem is that

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
we are thinking about how to do it better.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
If you have any opinion,

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
we are very welcome.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Obviously, everyone has this idea.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
We also have this idea.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
This is a good suggestion.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I don't know what you think.

49:15.000 --> 49:29.000
Otherwise, we can go through the questions.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
I have a small question.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
Everyone,

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
for our actual system experience,

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
what I want to ask is

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
if you join the membership,

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
we will add you to the list of members.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
All the members are on the list.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
We will send out all the emails

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
using the mailing list.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Basically, everyone will receive all the messages.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
I know that for many people,

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
this is not the best way.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Some people may only want to receive

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
the membership information.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
They don't want to receive

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
a speech announcement every week.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Some people only want to receive

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
the speech announcement.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
They don't want you to contact them

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
to update their rights.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Whatever.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
I can accept it anyway.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I just want to know the speech information.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Some people only want to receive

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
the information like

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
where the job openings are,

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
or where people are competing.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
This kind of information.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
For this more detailed system operation,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I don't know how your experience is,

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
or what kind of changes you want to see,

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
or what kind of upgrades you want to see.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Do you have any opinions?

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Or share your feelings.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Zhang Anping said,

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
you want to classify the mailing list

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
into several themes.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Is that what you mean?

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
This may be a way.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
But how do you actually do it?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Does anyone have similar experience?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Or a better suggestion?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
You can share.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
I don't know how to do it backstage.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
But I think the front desk part

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
seems to have a lot of websites

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
that say you go in

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and there are several different themes

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
of newsletters you can book.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Then you tick what you want.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
It's like this.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
I think we have a little bit like this now.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Because the main list of staff

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
and the members are actually separate.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
So for me,

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
there are already two options.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
I can tick both.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
That kind of feeling.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
I don't know how to do it backstage.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Or you can divide it by frequency.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
For example,

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
the type of work,

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
maybe several times a month.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Or the type of speech,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
several times a month.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
By frequency.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
What you said is

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
a pretty interesting idea.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
In fact, this idea is like

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
you subscribe to some main list.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Then you can say,

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
don't send it to me.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
You help me monthly digest.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Then send it all to me.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Similar concept, right?

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
OK.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Let me write it down.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Are we talking about the same thing?

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
You go ahead.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Just now, Lin Gaoxian

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
left a comment in the chat.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
He said,

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
is it possible to divide the members into areas?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Then each group has a person to gather.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Each person gathers to give a speech.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Each group may have

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
different areas at the same time.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
It can consume a lot of speech demand.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
This feels a bit like

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
the question just now.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
That is to say,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
we have to divide into different areas.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Then each create a group.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
In fact,

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
this is what we have thought about

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
in the staff part.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
There is a problem.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
For example,

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
every week,

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
from carrying one speech

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
to carrying two speeches,

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
the number of staff we basically need

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
is to first order to multiply by 2.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
But we don't have enough people.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
This is a problem.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
But

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
we have recruited new staff this year.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
If new staff are interested

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
in this direction

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
to produce such a project,

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
we can try it.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
I think we can try it.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
I am optimistic.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
There is nothing wrong with it.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
The actual details may be

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
what the staff

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
might want to do

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
when arranging it.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
This is a good suggestion.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
I think most of the suggestions

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
are similar to this.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
There is a guest

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
who said

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
there is a

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
e-news platform.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
I clicked on it.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
He said

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
MailChimp.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
I know this.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
It can help you make e-news.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
You Zhen is our IT team.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
She said

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
thank you for considering this platform.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Let me add something.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I actually quite like this platform.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
But because

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
currently we

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
discussed it before.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
We hope

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
the new staff

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
can

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
see the previous

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
work opportunities

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
or

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
the speech

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
announced this week

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
but it hasn't happened yet.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
This kind of information.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Something like this.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
You can look back.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
That's why we want to use

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Google Groups.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
It can be like

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
you can see the website.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
There is a website interface.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
You can receive it

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
from e-mail.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
That's why we consider this.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
MailChimp

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
is an e-news platform.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
So we can't do this.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
This is the reason

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
we don't consider it.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
But it is good management.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Thank you for your advice.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Does anyone have any questions

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
about logo?

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Or does anyone want to...

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Do we need a draft?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Pause.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Does anyone want to ask

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
where the Facebook logo came from?

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Sorry.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
This is my personal question.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
You can explain.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
When I

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
created it 2 years ago,

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
I thought

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
there is no logo now.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I should put my son's photo.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
To protect his

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
portrait rights,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I didn't put my son's photo.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
It's okay.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
What do you think

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
about logo?

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
I think

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
we should

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
see

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
if there is

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
a person who is good at

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
art.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
If there is,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
we can create our logo.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
I don't think

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
there is

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
any

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
opinion.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
I don't think

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
there is much opinion.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Okay.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Does anyone

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
have any

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
questions?

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
If you don't,

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
let's move on

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
to the next part.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Okay.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Let's

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
stop

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
the Q&A

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
part.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Okay?

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Next,

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
let's talk about

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Project Hira.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
We hope

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
there will be

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
new people

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
joining us

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
next year.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Next,

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
let's move on

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
to the recruitment.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Okay.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Basically,

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
we hope

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
we can

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
find

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
some

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
new people

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
to recruit.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
We hope

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
we can

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
find

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
the past

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
to join us.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
We hope

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000

find

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
more people

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
to join us.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Next,

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
let's move on

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
to the

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
hiring.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
We hope

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
we can

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
find

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
more people

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
We also

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
We also

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000

find

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
more people

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000

And

the most

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000

communal

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880
conference,

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880
we

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880
try to

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880
capture

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.880
what

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880
is

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880
happening

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880
with

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880
different

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.880
problems

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880
and

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880
what

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:19.880
we

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.880
have

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.880
to

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.880
talk about

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.880
in

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.880
that

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880
series

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880
Okay,

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.880
then

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.880
next is the last

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.880
is about

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880
these above

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880
speeches

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.880
above

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.880
reports

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.880
there is no problem

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:35.880
and

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.880
in fact

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880
I think we can

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880
invite those who

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.880
have come to sign up

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880
a little

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880
out of the sound

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880
can we

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880
actually

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.880
we

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880
that application form

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.880
before sending out

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.880
some people have already

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880
come to fill in

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.880
it

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.880
do not be so

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.880
silent it

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880
is that I believe

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880
now participate in

01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.880
more than 20 people

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.880
there should be a lot of

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880
people who have

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880
already filled in

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.880
before this meeting

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880
to join the

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880
staff

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880
right

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880
I can

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880
I can

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880
say that

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880
you are already

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880
a staff

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880
so

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.880
I'm not

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.880

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.880

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:16.880

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.880
I'm

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.880
really

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.880
the first time

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.880
to participate in

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880
this meeting

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.880
I was just

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.880
two weeks

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.880
before the

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880
association

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.880
gave the

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.880
job

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.880
seminar

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880
when I

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.880
knew

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.880
your association

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.880
and then I

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.880
went online

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.880
to see

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.880
and then fill in

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880
that form

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880
but

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.880
this is really

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.880
my first time

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.880
to join

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880
so I

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.880
actually

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.880
have no experience

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.880
and then

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880
I have not heard

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880
seminars

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880
but

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880
now

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880
I can

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880
introduce myself

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.880
is that

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880
I have been

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880
at home

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880
during the pandemic

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880
so

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880
I started

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880
to look at

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880
these things

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880
and I'm quite

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880
interested in

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880
joining

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.880
if there is a

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.880
chance

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880
oh

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.880
ok

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.880
ok

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.880
welcome

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880
then

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880
which

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880
aspect

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880
are you doing

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880
I am doing

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880
my own background

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880
is a graduate

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.880
of the

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.880
atmosphere

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.880
so I

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.880
am doing

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880
some research

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880
on climate

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880
so

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880
I am

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880
a graduate

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880
of the

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880
science

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880
so you

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880
may know

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880
ok

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
that's

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880
about it

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880
chat

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880
chat

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880
ask

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880
from the

same

my

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.880
classmate

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880
but we

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880
don't

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.880

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.880

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880
I am

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880
surprised

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.880
that

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880
if

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.880

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.880

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.880

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:16.880

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.880
they

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.880
are

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.880
basically

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.880
we

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.880
are
