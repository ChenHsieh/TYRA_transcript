00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tarot Talk. I am the host today, Zhang Yanyong.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We are very honored to invite Dr. Zeng Sihao, a colleague at my school, to tell us about the topic of his research on the Internet today.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
His research focuses on the parallel and variable traffic engineering of re-adjusting latency.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let me introduce Dr. Sihao.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Dr. Sihao majored in Electrical Engineering at NTU.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
He then went to Cornell to study ECE, Electrical Engineering.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He then came to Caltech to study Computer and Mathematical Science.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He then studied Engineering and Applied Science.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's give the floor to Dr. Sihao.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you, Yanyong, for the introduction.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This topic is actually a bit long and difficult to understand.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
However, when Yanyong invited me to give a talk, I thought that since it is a talk,

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
why not talk about a topic that is actually related to my research?

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I took the ICMP paper that I submitted last year.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Today I will try to make it as simple as possible.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Although this topic looks very difficult, you don't have to worry too much.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Its English title is Perseverance-Aware Traffic Engineering in Rate-Adaptive Networks with Reconfiguration Delay.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I just translated the English title into Chinese.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
As for what each term means, we will see later.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you have any questions in the middle, please feel free to interrupt me at any time and ask me questions.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In addition, Caltech has a special system called Computing and Mathematical Science.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This system is actually under Engineering.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Although C stands for Engineering, the department seems to be under it.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It seems that the relationship between division and department is not quite the same,

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but it is actually not very important.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So why do we want to study this topic?

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
My research topic is mainly about the Internet.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What is the Internet? The Internet is actually a bunch of things connected together.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why do we want to connect a bunch of things together?

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Basically, we want to communicate with each other.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We send some things, some information from one end of the Internet,

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and we hope to get this information on the other end.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Or we want to send some goods, such as a logistics network.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
For example, we want to transport fruits from Chiayi to Taipei.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is also a network.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
In fact, most of my research is on the Internet of information,

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that is, the Internet of communication between some electronic products or electronic devices using electronic signals.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How are these networks usually transmitted?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That is to say, how is this information transmitted on the Internet?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Usually, for example, we will have our own personal equipment.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
For example, today's lecture is the same.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We may use a computer or a tablet or a mobile phone.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We will connect to the Internet.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What does it mean to connect to the Internet?

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In fact, we are sending a piece of information to a place called an exchanger, a router.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sometimes this router also has a wireless exchanger,

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
such as AP, Access Point.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is for wireless networks.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Sometimes you will also use a base station to receive these things.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
After these terminals receive the message,

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
they will send it through an exchanger to a space.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Then we will be on the other side of the space.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Maybe someone else uses another device to get this information.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is basically how the whole network works.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In this case,

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
because we use an exchanger to connect a lot of different devices,

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
we may put our information into an exchanger

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and then go to another place to get something else.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In order to get a specific thing,

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
we have to establish a point-to-point connection with it.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is actually quite important.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In the early days, the Internet was a bit like a telephone line.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
At that time, there was a connection god.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
When the two of us wanted to communicate,

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
there must be a line in the middle to communicate with us.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But today, the Internet is not necessary.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Today, the Internet actually sends a lot of different traffic

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
in various ways, using this kind of exchanger,

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
one by one to our target destination.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
These terminals can be various things.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
For example, you can be a so-called cloud terminal,

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
a server at the far end.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Or when we play games with others,

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we may have a server.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We may also receive messages from others.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
For example, the 5G network, which is very popular recently,

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
is actually talking about the communication at the wireless terminal.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Obviously, no matter how we get the information at the far end,

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
we have to go through these exchangers in the middle

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
or through the network in the middle

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to help us pass the information from one end to the other.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So even if we have 5G now,

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
5G means that

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
5G is very fast from our wireless device to our base station.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But after it gets to the base station,

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
no matter what you do,

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you still have to go through the network in the middle to help you.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So this network is the main focus of my network research.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is called the broadband network.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Broadband network means that

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
there is a great distance between the two terminals.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Relatively speaking, if we are only in a local area,

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
this is called LAN,

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
which stands for Local Area Network.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Actually, I don't know how to say it in Chinese,

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
but it's a local network.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So what's the problem with broadband networks?

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Because these broadband networks are connected to very far places,

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
we know that

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
when we use telecommunications to send things,

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
electricity is actually very easy to consume.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So how do we send them?

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We have to use a very special kind of wire.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We definitely can't use the kind of wire that we usually use to plug breadboards.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We must use a very special kind of wire to send.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So how do we send these things?

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We will send them from one terminal to the other.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There must be a very special wire in the middle.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This actually requires cost.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But this cost is sometimes justifiable.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It can be accepted.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If the service I want to provide can make me earn more money,

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
then of course I am willing to spend a lot of money

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
to build this kind of expensive link.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You can think of it as these lines in the middle

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to connect to two very far places.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
For example, many big companies do this.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For example, Microsoft or Google.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Because they usually provide some cloud services.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
For example, you may sometimes use

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Google Sheets, Google Gmail,

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
or Microsoft Hotmail,

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
like this kind of thing,

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
or all kinds of different services,

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
such as YouTube.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They just store the data all over the world.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They will let you get the data very quickly.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
For example, they will build their own broadband network.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What are the benefits of this?

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you have this broadband network,

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can effectively adjust

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
how I want to use these lines.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If I can effectively use these lines,

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have a better chance of reducing my costs

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and making more money.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Basically like this.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So now most companies

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
are investing a lot in building their own network.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Instead of purely using some more traditional Internet.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For example, we may sign a contract with AT&T

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
or we sign a contract with Taiwan Cable.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They actually provide the network,

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
but the network is not under the control of these companies.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Sometimes you can't adjust

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
how to use your connection in the middle.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So these big companies usually

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
will build their own network,

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and then they will operate these networks themselves

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to achieve higher performance.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We just mentioned that

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the network is so far away.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
These lines in the middle are actually quite special.

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What kind of lines are these lines?

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They are not ordinary blue lines.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Of course there are ordinary blue lines,

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
but the amount of blue lines that can be passed is limited.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And it's more expensive.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So most of the time we use

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
cheaper blue lines with higher economic value.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is actually not a blue line.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is a blue line that uses optical technology

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
to transmit signals through this light wire.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This light wire is actually cheaper.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And then there is a lot of information that can be transmitted by the light wire.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because you use light.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Compared to electrical signals,

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
you have all kinds of different frequencies.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It can also be used.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And the speed of light is also quite fast.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It doesn't need to use electronic signals

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to receive it first and then transmit it.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They just enhance the strength of light

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and then continue to transmit.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So it actually has a lot of benefits.

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That is to say,

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
most of these big companies

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
will use some light wires

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to transmit signals far away,

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and then turn it into electrical signals

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
at the end point.

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Then we communicate with electrical signals.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
These light wires are actually

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
better than ordinary blue lines.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That is to say, it has a higher economic value.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But how do you say on this broadband network,

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
no matter how cheap it is,

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you have to pull a few hundred kilometers,

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it will be expensive right away.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So no matter,

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and you are in maintenance,

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or in operation,

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
it's actually not cheap.

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So these light wires on the broadband network

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
are actually a kind of expensive equipment.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Usually we don't want to say

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that our light wires can't be used.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What does it mean not to be used?

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That is to say, light wires are actually usable.

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That is to say,

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
my signal can go through this light wire.

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That is to say, after I go through this light wire,

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can get my signal.

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's use a simple example here.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How do we send a signal

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
from one end to the other?

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You can imagine that

207
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
we are on both ends of the light wire.

208
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We can actually send it,

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
we can send it at its frequency.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If we think of a white paper,

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we can draw a dot on the white paper.

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then we put this paper through the light wire.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The light wire will pass this paper to the other side.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then I look at this paper.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Ah, what is your signal?

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If the other person can interpret your signal,

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
that means your signal has been successfully passed.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So let's use this simple example to see.

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Suppose I have a big white paper now.

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I can send this white paper to the other side.

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then I can tell the other person

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
a similar code.

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Say, if you see me

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
put a dot on the left, it's 0.

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Put a dot on the right, it's 1.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In this case,

227
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
we can use this code to send information.

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
As long as you have 0 and 1,

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you can generate a lot of different information

230
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
in this sequence.

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The problem is,

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
this actually sounds pretty good.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Then we keep sending this.

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
For example, my left, right,

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
right, left, left, right, right.

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then we can quickly send out the signal.

237
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Isn't that great?

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But what is reality?

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Reality is that all signals follow the message.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That is to say, everyone is sending something.

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In the past, it was not so beautiful

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
in the middle of the opposite.

243
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
In the middle, there must be some

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
battery signal or light signal interference.

245
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's take a simple example today.

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Suppose we have a message.

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It will draw this thing on the paper.

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
For example, I draw this dot.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Shake it left and right.

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
When we get to the other side,

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
we look like

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
For example, I received a signal of shake.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
For example, like this.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's a little bit off.

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But it's still roughly on the left.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So in the middle of this case,

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
we can say that this is still zero.

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I probably know it's zero.

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Anyway, although there is a little bit of noise,

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
but it's roughly the signal on the left.

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I know it's zero from my code.

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then it is possible that noise

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
may also put your signal

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
a little bit in a different direction.

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
In this case,

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you are probably also quite confident that

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
this signal is actually on the left.

268
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So it's zero.

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But if I give you a signal like this today,

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Is it on the left or on the right?

271
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It seems to be a little bit on the left

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and a little bit on the right, right?

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So it's not easy to judge.

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If we draw a line,

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
that is to say,

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
we separate the original left and right

277
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and draw the line out a little bit.

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's actually still on the left.

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So I know this signal

280
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
is probably still zero.

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But sometimes it's just not so lucky.

282
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
For example, this noise is actually very big.

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It pushed my signal to the very right.

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How do you know

285
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it's zero or one at this time?

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Then we might say

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
your original signal is one.

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But in fact,

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the original signal I sent was zero.

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So in this situation,

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
my signal is actually

292
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
unable to successfully send to the opposite side.

293
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That is to say,

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
in this case,

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
if the noise is very big,

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I can't actually successfully

297
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
send the message I want to send

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
through the light to the opposite side.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So in this case,

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
we can say that

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
this light can't be used.

302
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because you can't successfully

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
send the signal to the opposite side.

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's use an example to see

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
if this kind of situation

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
is actually very rare,

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
then it doesn't matter.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
For example, I might have

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
a million times, ten million times,

310
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
a hundred million times,

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I only happen to have

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
a very unfortunate

313
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
case of my signal being intercepted.

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Then I just throw it away.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I might just ask the other side

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
to re-send it again or something.

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There's probably no problem.

318
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If we take these two,

319
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
for example,

320
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I either send zero

321
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
or send one,

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
the signal that is disturbed by the noise

323
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
will be drawn out to take a look.

324
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
For example,

325
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
it might look like this.

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That is to say,

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
if I send zero,

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
we use red to show

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
the situation when I send zero.

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
After sending zero,

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
it may be disturbed by the noise.

332
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The signal I see

333
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
at the receiving end

334
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
may look like this,

335
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
scattered everywhere.

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Similarly,

337
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
if I originally send one,

338
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
it is the green signal one

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
that I originally sent,

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
it may also be disturbed by the noise

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and scatter like this.

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But even in this situation,

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
although we can see

344
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
that some signals

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
may be misjudged,

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but generally speaking,

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
most of the signals

348
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
are still distinguishable.

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
In this situation,

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
this light wire

351
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
can still be used

352
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
because most of the signals

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
are actually fine.

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There is no problem in judgment.

355
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But if today's situation

356
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
is like this,

357
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
in today's situation,

358
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
the noise

359
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
scatters my signal

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to such an extent

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
that most of the red

362
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and green signals

363
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
are actually mixed together.

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
In this case,

365
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
it is easy for me to make a misjudgment.

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Even if I send one at the beginning,

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I may have a big chance

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
to be judged as zero.

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Even if I send zero,

370
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I have a lot of chances

371
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
to be judged as one.

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
In this situation,

373
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
it is difficult for you

374
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
to say that

375
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
you can't use this light wire

376
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
because its noise

377
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
is far greater than

378
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the signal energy of your signal.

379
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
In this situation,

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
we have to separate

381
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
these two

382
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
original zeros and ones.

383
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If we separate them,

384
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
we have a chance

385
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to be judged as one.

386
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
At that time,

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
you will consume

388
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
more energy.

389
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Or,

390
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
in this situation,

391
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you may reach

392
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the level of energy

393
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
your machine can send

394
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
every time

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
you lower the width

396
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
of the white paper.

397
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Then you may say

398
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
that this thing cannot be used.

399
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So this is the signal

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
that will be affected

401
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
by the intensity

402
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
of the noise signal

403
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
to cause

404
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
whether this light wire

405
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
can be used

406
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
or not.

407
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Of course,

408
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
sometimes it is

409
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
a more unfortunate situation.

410
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But,

411
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
in fact,

412
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
sometimes we are

413
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
very lucky.

414
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Because when we

415
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
operate the light wire,

416
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
we usually

417
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
separate these two signals

418
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
very widely.

419
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is the so-called

420
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
conservative operation.

421
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
In this situation,

422
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
there are not so many

423
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
noise signals.

424
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Even if there are noise signals,

425
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
we will see that

426
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
these two groups

427
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
are actually

428
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
quite widely separated.

429
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That is to say,

430
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
if I give you

431
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
zero at the beginning,

432
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
then I will

433
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
probably

434
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
have no problem

435
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
to easily

436
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
determine that

437
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
this is zero.

438
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Similarly,

439
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I can easily

440
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
know that

441
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the group on the right

442
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
is probably one.

443
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
In this situation,

444
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
in fact,

445
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
we will now say

446
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that this light wire

447
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
can be used.

448
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's really good.

449
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But in fact,

450
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
at the same time,

451
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
we can find that

452
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
there are still a lot of blanks here.

453
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
In fact,

454
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
we can

455
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
make this white paper

456
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
more efficient.

457
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What should we do?

458
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We not only give zero,

459
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but we can also

460
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
give some other...

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We can also

462
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
subdivide this

463
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
white paper

464
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
into four equal parts.

465
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Let's say

466
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
if I see

467
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
this dot on the far left,

468
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
then I actually

469
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
want to tell you that it's zero.

470
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I want to

471
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
say one zero

472
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
on the far right.

473
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Similarly,

474
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
we can see

475
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
these dots in the middle.

476
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I just say zero one.

477
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If this signal

478
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
is actually not

479
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
disturbed by noise,

480
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
then in fact,

481
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
we can still

482
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
successfully

483
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
receive these signals.

484
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Because

485
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
these signals

486
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
are still

487
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
roughly in

488
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
their original positions.

489
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Since they are

490
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
roughly in

491
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
their original positions,

492
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
we can still

493
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
easily judge that

494
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
if I see

495
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
a signal here today,

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
then I probably know

497
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
that there is no problem.

498
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Its original signal

499
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
is actually

500
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
zero.

501
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Its original signal

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
is zero.

503
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Like this.

504
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So,

505
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
at the same time,

506
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
how many signals

507
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
can we send

508
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
with a piece of white paper?

509
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's not just

510
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
related to

511
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
the size of this piece of white paper.

512
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's also related

513
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
to the noise

514
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
it receives.

515
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So this is

516
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the so-called

517
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
noise ratio,

518
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
SNR.

519
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So,

520
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the bigger my piece of white paper is,

521
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
the more

522
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can send

523
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
messages.

524
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
At the same time,

525
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can not only say

526
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
zero or one,

527
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can also say

528
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
zero zero,

529
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
zero one,

530
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
one zero one.

531
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That means

532
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the messages I can send

533
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
at the same time

534
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
are more.

535
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The more,

536
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that means

537
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
my frequency is higher.

538
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What about SNR?

539
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Of course,

540
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
at the same time,

541
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
if you have a lot of noise,

542
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
then you can

543
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
do less things.

544
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Because although

545
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
your piece of white paper is big,

546
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
at the same time,

547
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the amount of messages

548
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
you can receive

549
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
is not that much.

550
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The messages you can successfully

551
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
see on the other side

552
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
are not that much.

553
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Now,

554
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
if we consider

555
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the transmission of

556
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
signals,

557
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it's like this.

558
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If we want to

559
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
send a signal

560
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
from the left

561
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to the right

562
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
via a light

563
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
to the right,

564
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
we can think that

565
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
our signal

566
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
is a bit like

567
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
a piece of white paper.

568
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Then we

569
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
decide

570
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
the code

571
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
between each other.

572
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
For example,

573
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
if I see on the left,

574
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
this is zero zero,

575
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
zero zero,

576
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
zero one,

577
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
one one,

578
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
one one zero,

579
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
like this,

580
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
this is called

581
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
modulation.

582
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Modulation

583
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
means

584
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
adjusting

585
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
the relationship

586
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
between

587
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
your changes

588
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and your

589
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
signal.

590
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What is this

591
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
modulation?

592
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If the other side

593
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
also knows

594
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
this modulation,

595
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
after you send

596
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the signal,

597
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the other side

598
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
can interpret

599
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
your signal.

600
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's a bit like

601
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
if I say

602
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the leftmost point

603
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
is zero zero,

604
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
zero zero,

605
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
like this.

606
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then we can

607
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
send the signal

608
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
from one side

609
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
of the light

610
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to the other side.

611
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Of course,

612
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
it's not that good.

613
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If there is no

614
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
modulation interference,

615
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
of course it's good.

616
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In fact,

617
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
we can

618
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
put a lot of points,

619
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
but because of

620
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
the modulation,

621
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
like the example

622
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
we just saw,

623
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
because of the modulation,

624
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
so we actually

625
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
see the signal

626
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
at the receiving end

627
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
here,

628
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
the signal

629
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
is a bit

630
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
not the original position,

631
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
it may be a little bit

632
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
off,

633
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but if it's not

634
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
off a lot,

635
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
we can still

636
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
successfully know

637
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
what the original

638
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
signal looks like.

639
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If you see

640
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
the signal is probably

641
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
in this area,

642
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
then we know

643
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it was originally

644
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
this point.

645
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then we can

646
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
check our meter

647
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and say

648
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
this is zero zero.

649
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
After this,

650
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
we can actually

651
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
not need

652
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
these colors

653
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
to mark them,

654
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
right?

655
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That is to say,

656
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
what is my

657
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
modulation?

658
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
How do I

659
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
divide this white paper

660
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
into several

661
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
different areas

662
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and then I use

663
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
each point

664
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
to represent

665
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
a signal.

666
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If I say

667
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
there is not

668
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
much noise

669
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
on the other side,

670
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I can say

671
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
it's probably

672
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
in this area

673
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and it corresponds

674
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
to this point.

675
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This point

676
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
represents a signal.

677
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So this is

678
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
what we

679
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
generally call

680
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
constellation,

681
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
that is,

682
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
if I see

683
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
this point,

684
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
what is

685
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
the signal?

686
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Usually,

687
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
at the receiving end,

688
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
we will

689
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
make a judgment

690
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
based on

691
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the message

692
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
to see

693
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
which signal

694
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is more similar

695
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
to the original one.

696
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Then we will

697
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
interpret the

698
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
original signal.

699
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So we can

700
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
also see that

701
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
this noise

702
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
actually

703
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
depends on

704
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the strength of

705
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the noise

706
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
is related to

707
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
the frequency of

708
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
our signal.

709
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Sometimes we

710
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
say

711
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
why we can

712
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
say

713
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
we buy a line today

714
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and we say

715
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
its frequency is

716
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
10 GB

717
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
or we say

718
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
it is 100 GB.

719
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In fact,

720
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
the frequency of

721
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
this line

722
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
is related to

723
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
noise.

724
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The reason is

725
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
because

726
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
we generally

727
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
operate these lines

728
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
in a conservative way.

729
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
For example,

730
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
these lines

731
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
may have

732
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
expected

733
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
noise

734
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
in the natural world

735
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
which is

736
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
something like

737
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
this.

738
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Then we will

739
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
give a very strong

740
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
signal

741
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
to separate it.

742
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
In this way,

743
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
we can

744
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
ensure that

745
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
we can

746
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
always

747
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
restore

748
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the

749
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
original

750
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
signal.

751
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Then we say

752
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
this line

753
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
probably has

754
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
capacity.

755
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
In fact,

756
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
when we actually

757
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
send a signal,

758
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
we are not

759
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
only

760
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
a blank sheet.

761
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We are not

762
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
only one-dimensional.

763
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Sometimes we

764
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
use multiple dimensions

765
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
or in this case

766
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
we use two-dimensional

767
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
to show.

768
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
For example,

769
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I have a

770
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
two-dimensional signal

771
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and we will

772
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
also be

773
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
disturbed by

774
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
noise.

775
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
These signals

776
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
scatter

777
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and we

778
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
can see that

779
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
the degree of

780
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
scattering is

781
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
not much.

782
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So we can

783
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
still clearly

784
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
tell if

785
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
this signal

786
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
is in this area

787
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and its

788
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
original signal

789
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
is here.

790
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So it

791
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
can still

792
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
successfully

793
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
pull our

794
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
signal from

795
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
one side

796
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
to the other.

797
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The advantage of

798
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
two-dimensional,

799
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
three-dimensional

800
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
or multiple dimensions

801
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
is that

802
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
we can

803
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
expand this

804
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
blank sheet

805
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
so we

806
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
can see that

807
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
the width of

808
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
this line

809
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
is actually

810
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
the ratio

811
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
of the signal

812
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
to its

813
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
noise.

814
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The noise

815
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
ratio

816
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
has a

817
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
very strong

818
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
relationship.

819
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Generally speaking,

820
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
most of

821
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the time,

822
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
as we

823
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
just said,

824
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
although

825
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
this line

826
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
is 50

827
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Gbps,

828
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
which is

829
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
50 x

830
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
10

831
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
9

832
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
square

833
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
bits,

834
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
we can

835
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
still

836
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
clearly

837
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
tell

838
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
if

839
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
this

840
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
noise

841
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
is

842
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
in

843
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
this area

844
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and

845
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
its

846
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
original

847
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
signal

848
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
is here

849
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and

850
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
its

851
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
noise

852
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
ratio

853
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
is here.

854
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So

855
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
this

856
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
noise

857
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000

858
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is

859
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
about

860
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
this much.

861
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So

862
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
we can

863
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
clearly

864
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
tell

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000

866
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000

noise

868
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
is

869
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
in

870
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
this

871
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
area

872
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and

873
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000

876
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
is here

877
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and

878
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
its

879
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
original

880
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
noise

881
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
ratio

882
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
is here

883
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and

884
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
its

885
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
original

886
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
signal

887
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
is here

888
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and

889
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
its

890
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
original

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
signal

892
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
is here.

893
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So

894
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I can

895
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
modify

896
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
the

897
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
modulation

898
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
code.

899
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
If I

900
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
modify

901
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
the

902
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
modulation,

903
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I can

904
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
send more

905
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000

906
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
other side

908
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000

909
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
same time.

910
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So

911
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
this

912
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
effectively

913
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
improves

914
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
my frequency.

915
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So

916
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
even though

917
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
we still

918
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
receive the

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I can

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000

927
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So

928
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I can

929
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000

933
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and

934
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
light source

1187
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
now,

1188
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
we can

1189
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
modify

1190
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
the

1191
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
code

1192
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
to

1193
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
increase

1194
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the

1195
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
frequency.

1196
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But

1197
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
the

1198
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
signal

1199
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
can't

1200
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
be

1201
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
very

1202
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
noisy.

1203
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So

1204
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
this is

1205
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
the

1206
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
architecture

1207
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
that

1208
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Microsoft

1209
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
has

1210
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
proposed.

1211
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Or

1212
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
there

1213
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
is a

1214
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
drawback.

1215
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's not a

1216
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
drawback.

1217
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's a

1218
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
trade-off.

1219
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes,

1220
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
what we

1221
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
just said

1222
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
was

1223
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
great.

1224
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
If

1225
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
we

1226
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
can

1227
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
use

1228
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
different

1229
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
constellation

1230
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
maps

1231
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
to

1232
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
achieve

1233
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
better

1234
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
frequency.

1235
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But

1236
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
the

1237
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
problem is

1238
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that

1239
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
you

1240
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
need to

1241
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
reconfigure

1242
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
the

1243
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
map

1244
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to

1245
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
achieve

1246
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
good

1247
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
frequency.

1248
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
If

1249
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
you

1250
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
have

1251
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
a

1252
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
new

1253
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
map,

1254
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
you

1255
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
need to

1256
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
reconfigure

1257
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
it.

1258
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You

1259
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
need to

1260
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
reconfigure

1261
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it.

1262
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So

1263
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I

1264
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
need to

1265
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
reconfigure

1266
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
it.

1267
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So

1268
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
we

1269
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
need to

1270
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
reconfigure

1271
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
the

1272
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
map

1273
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
to

1274
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
achieve

1275
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
good

1276
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
frequency.

1277
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So

1278
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I

1279
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
need to

1280
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
reconfigure

1281
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
it.

1282
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So

1283
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I

1284
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
need to

1285
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
reconfigure

1286
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
it.

1287
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So

1288
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I

1289
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
need to

1290
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
reconfigure

1291
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
it.

1292
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So

1293
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I

1294
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
need to

1295
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
reconfigure

1296
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
it.

1297
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So

1298
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I

1299
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
need to

1300
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
reconfigure

1301
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
it.

1302
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So

1303
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
if we

1304
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
suddenly

1305
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
reconfigure

1306
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
the

1308
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
the

1309
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000

1310
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
will

1311
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
suddenly

1312
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
break.

1313
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The

1314
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
broken

1315
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
map

1316
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
will

1317
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
cause

1318
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the

1320
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000

1321
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
caused

1322
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
by

1323
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
the

1324
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000

1325
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
sending

1326
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000

1327
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
the

network.

1329
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So

1330
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
the

1331
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000

1332
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000

1333
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000

1337
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So

1338
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the

1342
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
For

1343
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
example,

1344
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
if you

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000

1355
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
it

1356
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
will

1357
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000

1367
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So

1375
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000

1383
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000

1391
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000

be

1396
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000

1397
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000

1398
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000

1399
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The

1400
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000

1401
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
will

1402
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
be

1403
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000

1405
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000

1407
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000

broken.

1412
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So

1413
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the

1414
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
so.

1424
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So

1425
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the

traffic

1478

1479
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000

1482

1483
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
traveling

1484
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
by

1485
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
running

1486
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
or

1487
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
traveling

1488
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
express

1489
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The traffic may be slightly affected by the movement of the network,

1490
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
but it is not directly affected by the movement of the network.

1491
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
This is similar to

1492
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
what the paper said

1493
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
in the past.

1494
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
If we want to

1495
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
change the

1496
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
traffic,

1497
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
we should change the concept in stages.

1498
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
This is the update of the multi-step.

1499
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So,

1500
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
we can see the difference.

1501
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
If we use the original proposal,

1502
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
which is to cut it off directly,

1503
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and then restore it,

1504
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
we may cause a huge

1505
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
churn.

1506
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But if we have several steps now,

1507
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
what should we do?

1508
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
What should we do

1509
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
in each step?

1510
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This is what we want to do.

1511
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
In this paper,

1512
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
what kind of update

1513
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
do we want to do?

1514
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
In fact,

1515
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I try not to interfere with

1516
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
so much

1517
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
network traffic

1518
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
in each step.

1519
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This sounds quite intuitive.

1520
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If I can

1521
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
get to my

1522
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
final destination today,

1523
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and in each step,

1524
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I will not

1525
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
let my

1526
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
original network traffic

1527
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
be cut off.

1528
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It may only lose a little,

1529
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
but not too much.

1530
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
For me,

1531
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
the less loss,

1532
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
the better.

1533
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
If the best situation is that

1534
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I do not lose any traffic at all,

1535
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I can get to the end.

1536
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But because you have to adjust,

1537
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
you have to

1538
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
have some lines that cannot be used.

1539
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So, you will definitely lose a little,

1540
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
but you do not lose too much.

1541
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
This should be

1542
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
a conceptually

1543
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
better

1544
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
adjustment plan.

1545
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
The concept of

1546
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
not losing too much

1547
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
is called perseverance.

1548
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Perseverance

1549
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
is the so-called

1550
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
consistency.

1551
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That is,

1552
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
this traffic,

1553
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
originally,

1554
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
for example,

1555
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
if it is 1,

1556
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
it can be conservative.

1557
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It can not

1558
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
lose much.

1559
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Its loss

1560
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
may be less than

1561
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
how much.

1562
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We call it

1563
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
perseverance level.

1564
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Of course,

1565
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
we hope that

1566
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
this perseverance level

1567
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
is

1568
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
the higher,

1569
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
the better.

1570
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Perseverance

1571
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
is originally

1572
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
1.

1573
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
How much

1574
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
do I need

1575
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
for the rest?

1576
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
For example,

1577
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
0.9,

1578
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
0.8,

1579
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
like this.

1580
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Like this.

1581
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So,

1582
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
what is

1583
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
our final

1584
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
plan?

1585
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Our plan

1586
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
becomes that

1587
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
we want to

1588
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
get to the end

1589
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
as soon as possible,

1590
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
but we do not want

1591
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
to lose too much

1592
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
traffic

1593
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
in each step

1594
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
in the middle.

1595
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It becomes that

1596
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
we look for

1597
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
the so-called

1598
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
perseverance way,

1599
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
which is

1600
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
to consider

1601
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
the consistency of

1602
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
traffic engineering.

1603
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
The consistency of

1604
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
traffic engineering

1605
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
means that

1606
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
we want to

1607
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
get to the end

1608
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
as soon as possible,

1609
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
but we do not want to

1610
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
lose too much

1611
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
traffic

1612
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
in each step

1613
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
in the middle.

1614
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
This is

1615
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
what we

1616
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
proposed

1617
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
in the middle

1618
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
of this paper.

1619
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We want to

1620
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
do this

1621
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
new proposal.

1622
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We think

1623
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
this is

1624
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
actually better

1625
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
than the

1626
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
original

1627
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
churn-based

1628
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
proposal.

1629
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Why?

1630
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Because

1631
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
in the churn-based

1632
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
proposal,

1633
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you cut off

1634
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
most of the

1635
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
traffic,

1636
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
so you will

1637
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
get a

1638
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
very serious

1639
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
network interference.

1640
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This is

1641
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
actually the

1642
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
so-called

1643
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
perseverance level

1644
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
zero.

1645
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Between

1646
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
the two

1647
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
steps,

1648
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
what can

1649
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I lose the most?

1650
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I can lose

1651
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
all my traffic.

1652
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
All traffic

1653
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
can be cut off,

1654
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
which is

1655
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
perseverance level

1656
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
zero.

1657
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
However,

1658
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
if we

1659
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
keep a

1660
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
higher

1661
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
perseverance level,

1662
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
for example,

1663
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
0.5,

1664
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
there are

1665
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
two middle

1666
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
steps in

1667
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the update

1668
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
plan.

1669
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
In each

1670
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
plan,

1671
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I lose

1672
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
at most

1673
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
half of the

1674
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
traffic.

1675
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
For example,

1676
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
if my

1677
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
traffic was

1678
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
from the

1679
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
left to the

1680
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
right,

1681
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
all my

1682
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
lines were

1683
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
used up.

1684
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
In the first

1685
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
step,

1686
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I pulled

1687
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
the traffic

1688
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
from the

1689
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
top line

1690
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
down

1691
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and cut

1692
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
them

1693
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
off.

1694
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
In this way,

1695
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I keep

1696
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
at least

1697
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
half of

1698
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
my

1699
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
traffic.

1700
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
In the

1701
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
entire

1702
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
update process,

1703
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Can you

1704
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
go back

1705
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
to the

1706
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
last page?

1707
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes,

1708
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
it's in the

1709
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
last page.

1710
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's in the

1711
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
last page.

1712
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
There are

1713
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
several pages

1714
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
in the

1715
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
last page.

1716
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
This one?

1717
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yes.

1718
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's a bit

1719
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
laggy.

1720
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yes,

1721
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
this page.

1722
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I don't know

1723
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
if this is

1724
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
practical.

1725
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
For example,

1726
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
you show

1727
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
a step,

1728
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
the first

1729
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
version,

1730
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and then you

1731
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
propose

1732
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
unstep.

1733
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The next

1734
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
thing I think of

1735
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
is why

1736
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
don't you

1737
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
make it

1738
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
infinite?

1739
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
This

1740
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
line becomes

1741
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
a smooth

1742
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
function.

1743
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
A very

1744
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
good question.

1745
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Your

1746
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
limitation

1747
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
is not

1748
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
how big

1749
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
a step

1750
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
is,

1751
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
right?

1752
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But what

1753
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
does every step

1754
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
mean?

1755
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Every step

1756
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
needs at

1757
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
least one

1758
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
line,

1759
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
right?

1760
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But the

1761
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
network is

1762
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
made up

1763
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
of limited

1764
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
lines,

1765
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
so you

1766
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
can't have

1767
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
infinite steps

1768
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
because you

1769
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
need at

1770
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
least one

1771
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
line every

1772
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
time.

1773
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So you

1774
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
can only

1775
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
have n

1776
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
lines,

1777
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
so you

1778
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
can only

1779
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
have

1780
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
one

1781
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
line every

1782
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
time.

1783
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
For

1784
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
example,

1785
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
if I

1786
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
want to

1787
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
make a

1788
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
better

1789
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
step,

1790
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
but

1791
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
it

1792
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
gets

1793
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
bigger

1794
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
in the

1795
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
middle,

1796
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I

1797
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
don't

1798
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
enjoy

1799
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
anything.

1800
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I

1801
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
lose

1802
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
some

1803
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
frequency.

1804
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So

1805
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
we want

1806
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
the process

1807
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
to be

1808
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
as short

1809
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
as

1810
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
possible.

1811
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We

1812
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
can't do

1813
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
that in

1814
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
reality.

1815
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The

1816
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
second

1817
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
thing is

1818
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
that even

1819
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
if we

1820
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
consider

1821
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
an infinite

1822
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
network,

1823
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
we

1824
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
don't want

1825
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
to do

1826
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
that because

1827
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
we want

1828
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
to get

1829
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
to the

1830
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
new

1831
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
state as

1832
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
soon as

1833
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
possible

1834
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
so that

1835
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
we

1836
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
can have

1837
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
more

1838
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
flexibility.

1839
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
For

1840
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
example,

1841
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
we can

1842
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
ask a

1843
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
few

1844
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
questions.

1845
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
We

1846
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
call this

1847
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
a

1848
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
re-adaptation

1849
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
planning

1850
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
problem.

1851
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
How

1852
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
do I

1853
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
adjust

1854
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
this

1855
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
variable

1856
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
network

1857
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
plan?

1858
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
How

1859
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
many

1860
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
steps

1861
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
do I

1862
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
need to

1863
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
do?

1864
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The

1865
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
first

1866
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
question is

1867
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
how

1868
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
do I

1869
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
solve this

1870
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
problem?

1871
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Is

1872
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
there

1873
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
a way

1874
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
to

1875
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
solve it?

1876
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Unfortunately,

1877
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
this is

1878
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
a very

1879
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000

called

1882
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
NP-hard.

1883
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
This

1884
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
is a

1891
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's

1892
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
basically

1893
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000

2116
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,060
王

2117
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,060
王

2118
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,060
王

2119
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,060
王

2120
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,060
王

2121
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,060
王

2122
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,060
王

2123
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,060
王

2124
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,060
王

2125
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,060
王

2126
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,080
So, did our proposal really cut off the traffic?

2127
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:57,080
Did we really avoid this from happening?

2128
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,080
And then,

2129
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,080
we said that we have heuristics.

2130
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,080
Is this heuristic easy to calculate?

2131
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,080
Or is it actually difficult to calculate?

2132
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,080
If it's also difficult to calculate,

2133
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,080
we didn't mention one thing,

2134
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
and then we have to calculate for a long time,

2135
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,080
for example, for ten minutes,

2136
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,080
we can only update our link.

2137
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,100
If we update our link,

2138
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,100
and then the traffic changes,

2139
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,100
then we won't have enough time.

2140
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,100
So, we hope that it can be calculated soon.

2141
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,100
So, we did some experiments.

2142
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,100
We first used

2143
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,100
Microsoft's Microsoft Swan

2144
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,100
and Google's Beeple

2145
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,100
to do the experiment.

2146
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,100
And then our

2147
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,100
Skynet design heuristic,

2148
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,100
we call it ALG.

2149
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
And OPT,

2150
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,120
we call it the best solution.

2151
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,120
So, let's answer the first question.

2152
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,120
After we add this

2153
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,120
heuristic condition,

2154
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,120
can we get

2155
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,120
a better rating?

2156
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,120
The conclusion is yes.

2157
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,120
This row equal to one,

2158
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,120
if we call this heuristic

2159
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
as 1,

2160
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
we can never

2161
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
lose any rating.

2162
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,140
That means we basically

2163
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,140
don't update our links.

2164
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,140
We can never

2165
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,140
lose any network traffic.

2166
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,140
The simplest way is

2167
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,140
we don't move,

2168
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,140
and we will never lose any traffic.

2169
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,140
The original overall rating

2170
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,140
is like this,

2171
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,140
the column on the far left.

2172
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,140
The column on the far right

2173
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,140
is the solution

2174
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,140
proposed by Microsoft.

2175
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,140
If we lose in the middle,

2176
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,140
how much can we get in the end?

2177
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,140
We can see that

2178
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,140
even if we add

2179
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,160
this perseverance limitation,

2180
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
we still,

2181
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
whether it's the best solution

2182
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,160
or our heuristic,

2183
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,160
in the end,

2184
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,160
they can be the same

2185
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
as the solution

2186
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,160
proposed by Microsoft.

2187
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Basically the same.

2188
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
That is to say,

2189
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
although we have perseverance limitation,

2190
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,160
we are more smooth

2191
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,160
than the original proposal

2192
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,160
proposed by Microsoft.

2193
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,160
But we can't get

2194
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
the best rating

2195
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,160
because of that.

2196
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,160
In fact,

2197
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,180
we can't get

2198
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,180
the same rating

2199
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,180
as Microsoft.

2200
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,180
So,

2201
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,180
this is the answer

2202
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,180
to the first question.

2203
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,180
The second question is

2204
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,180
what kind of number

2205
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,180
should we set

2206
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,180
as our perseverance level?

2207
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,180
That is,

2208
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,180
what kind of loss

2209
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,180
can we accept?

2210
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,180
We can see

2211
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,180
what the second picture

2212
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,180
is about.

2213
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,180
That is,

2214
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,180
the process of update,

2215
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,180
the process of overall rating increase.

2216
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,180
If we start with

2217
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,180
a 0.5 perseverance,

2218
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
0.5 perseverance,

2219
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
that is to say,

2220
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
I can accept

2221
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,200
that I only have 0.5 left.

2222
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Of course,

2223
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
we give the system operator

2224
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,200
a lot of space

2225
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
to adjust these lines.

2226
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,200
So we can reach

2227
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,200
our final level very quickly.

2228
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,200
Of course,

2229
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
the less loss I am willing to accept,

2230
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,200
that is to say,

2231
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,200
the higher the perseverance limitation I require,

2232
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
the less links

2233
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
I can update every time.

2234
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Because if I cut off a lot of links,

2235
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,200
I can't ensure

2236
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
that the original

2237
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,220
load flow

2238
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,220
can still reach

2239
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,220
the original 0.9 level.

2240
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,220
That is to say,

2241
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,220
it will be slower.

2242
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,220
This requires more steps

2243
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,220
to reach the final level.

2244
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,220
So the higher the perseverance limitation,

2245
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,220
of course,

2246
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,220
the slower you will be.

2247
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,220
Then we will ask,

2248
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,220
if there is a perseverance limitation,

2249
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,240
what is the relationship

2250
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,240
with my

2251
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,240
converge time?

2252
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,240
Of course,

2253
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,240
if you are willing to

2254
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,240
accept more interference,

2255
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
that is to say,

2256
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
if you are willing to accept more disturbance,

2257
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
the faster you will

2258
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,240
get to your final state.

2259
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
This is the same as the picture just now.

2260
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,240
This is a more detailed picture.

2261
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,240
That is to say,

2262
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,240
we ran 1000 random cases,

2263
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
and we found that

2264
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
of course,

2265
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
the higher the perseverance level,

2266
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,260
the more time it takes to converge.

2267
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,260
We can find that

2268
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,260
most of the time,

2269
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,260
your perseverance level

2270
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,260
is between 0.5 and 0.7.

2271
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,260
That is to say,

2272
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,260
it will converge pretty fast.

2273
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,260
It will converge pretty fast.

2274
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,260
It won't converge

2275
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,260
when it is set to a very high level.

2276
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,260
So our best choice is this.

2277
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,260
That is to say,

2278
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,260
we can converge

2279
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,260
in 3 to 5 steps.

2280
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,260
At the same time,

2281
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,260
we keep the original

2282
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,280
flow rate between 0.5 and 0.7.

2283
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,280
That's actually not bad.

2284
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,280
At least 7 steps.

2285
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,280
Compared to the original

2286
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,280
that we threw away directly,

2287
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,280
we still have 5 to 7 steps

2288
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
to throw away.

2289
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,280
We originally

2290
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,280
argued that

2291
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,280
this perseverance level

2292
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
can make the whole process

2293
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,280
smoother.

2294
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,280
That is to say,

2295
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
we won't throw away a lot of traffic.

2296
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,280
Is that so?

2297
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,280
Let's take a look at

2298
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,280
the degree of vibration

2299
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,280
in the update process.

2300
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,300
The more vibration,

2301
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,300
the more to the right.

2302
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,300
The less vibration,

2303
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,300
the more to the left.

2304
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,300
Can you see

2305
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,300
that we have introduced

2306
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,300
these two methods

2307
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,300
of perseverance limitation?

2308
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,300
Its vibrations are very few.

2309
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,300
It's not very few.

2310
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,300
Its vibrations are smaller

2311
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,300
than the original

2312
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,300
Microsoft Red1 method.

2313
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,300
That is to say,

2314
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,300
our perseverance limitation

2315
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,300
does help

2316
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,300
the whole update process

2317
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,300
to be smoother.

2318
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,300
The last question

2319
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,300
we want to answer is that

2320
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,320
this is great.

2321
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,320
We are very smooth.

2322
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,320
But how long

2323
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,320
does it take to get it?

2324
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,320
If it takes a long time,

2325
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,320
it will be lost.

2326
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,320
Let's take a look at

2327
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,320
the computation time.

2328
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,320
The computation time

2329
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,320
is how long

2330
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,320
it takes

2331
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,320
to find

2332
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,320
a solution.

2333
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,320
The time on our watch

2334
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
is millisecond.

2335
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,320
That is to say,

2336
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
millisecond.

2337
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
If we want to find the best solution,

2338
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
it can't be calculated

2339
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
in a very short time.

2340
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,340
But in fact,

2341
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,340
if your network is very small,

2342
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,340
this thing can be solved by force.

2343
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,340
You just force

2344
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,340
to find all the possible solutions.

2345
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,340
In fact,

2346
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,340
it can be calculated quite quickly.

2347
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,340
For example,

2348
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,340
if you want to find the best solution,

2349
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,340
it takes 67 milliseconds.

2350
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,340
If you have a bigger network,

2351
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,340
a bigger network,

2352
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,340
it takes more seconds.

2353
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,340
Until you have this,

2354
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
for example,

2355
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,340
this is a Google network.

2356
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,340
Google network,

2357
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,340
you have to spend

2358
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,340
1.2 times 16 times

2359
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,360
milliseconds to find one.

2360
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,360
How much is that?

2361
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,360
This is about

2362
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,360
more than 1,000 seconds

2363
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
to calculate

2364
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,360
the process of updating once.

2365
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,360
After you finish the calculation,

2366
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,360
after 1,000 seconds,

2367
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,360
you may have changed the message again.

2368
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,360
Then you just

2369
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,360
wasted your time.

2370
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,360
In contrast,

2371
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,360
our algorithm,

2372
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
our heuristic,

2373
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,360
only takes more than 300 milliseconds

2374
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,360
to calculate.

2375
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,360
That is to say,

2376
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
in less than a second,

2377
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,360
we can tell the entire network

2378
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,360
how to adjust.

2379
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,360
This efficiency is very high.

2380
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,380
The speed of our calculation

2381
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,380
is very fast.

2382
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,380
And we can also

2383
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,380
let this

2384
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,380
be found in the previous

2385
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,380
few experiments.

2386
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,380
In fact, the algorithm we proposed

2387
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,380
is not much different from the best solution.

2388
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,380
Although we can't prove

2389
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,380
that they are always close to each other,

2390
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,380
because we just said

2391
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,380
that this thing can't be

2392
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,380
done on this mirror.

2393
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,380
But in fact,

2394
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,380
in terms of real things,

2395
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,380
the solution we calculated

2396
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,380
is not much different from the best solution.

2397
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,400
And our algorithm

2398
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
is very fast.

2399
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
This is the benefit

2400
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,400
of our new solution.

2401
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,400
To sum up,

2402
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,400
what is this paper

2403
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
talking about?

2404
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,400
This paper says

2405
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
that instead of cutting

2406
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
all the lines directly

2407
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
and then update them,

2408
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
and then we use

2409
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
a higher frequency

2410
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,400
to send new traffic,

2411
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,400
we should consider

2412
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
consistency.

2413
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,400
That is, we need to make sure

2414
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,400
that the network traffic

2415
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,400
is not lost too much

2416
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,420
in the process of traffic.

2417
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,420
Considering this consistency,

2418
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,420
it won't cause too much burden.

2419
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,420
Because we have

2420
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,420
a very good algorithm.

2421
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,420
It can quickly

2422
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,420
solve this problem.

2423
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,420
It can quickly approach this problem.

2424
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,420
It's not a solution,

2425
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,420
but it can quickly

2426
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,420
find a solution.

2427
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,420
And this solution

2428
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,420
is actually pretty good.

2429
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,420
It's not much different

2430
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,420
from the best solution.

2431
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,420
It's not much different

2432
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,420
from the performance

2433
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,420
of cutting directly.

2434
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,420
But it's very

2435
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,420
smoother than

2436
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,440
cutting directly.

2437
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,440
Of course, we also admit that

2438
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,440
in addition to consistency,

2439
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,440
system operators

2440
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,440
can also consider

2441
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,440
more different aspects.

2442
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,440
For example,

2443
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
in the middle of the network,

2444
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,440
in the middle of the update,

2445
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,440
we hope that

2446
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,440
these traffic

2447
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,440
are not lost too much.

2448
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,440
We may also hope that

2449
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,440
they have some other

2450
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,440
characteristics.

2451
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,440
For example,

2452
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,440
each traffic

2453
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,460
cannot be less than

2454
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,460
the absolute traffic.

2455
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,460
For example,

2456
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,460
I must be greater than 10Mbps,

2457
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,460
I must be greater than 20Mbps.

2458
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,460
It may not be a percentage,

2459
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,460
but an absolute traffic.

2460
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,460
We must maintain

2461
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,460
how much traffic.

2462
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,460
Otherwise,

2463
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,460
I won't,

2464
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,460
for example,

2465
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,460
I won't feel a lot of delay

2466
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,460
in the middle of playing video games.

2467
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,460
How much traffic do I need at least?

2468
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,460
For example, like this.

2469
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,460
So this system operator

2470
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
can actually adjust

2471
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,460
their requirements

2472
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,460
for the network.

2473
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,480
And then,

2474
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
let this network

2475
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,480
operate more effectively,

2476
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,480
more efficiently.

2477
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,480
And they can,

2478
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,480
in the end,

2479
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,480
get a better balance.

2480
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,480
That's all

2481
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,480
for my speech today.

2482
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,480
If you have any questions,

2483
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,480
please feel free to ask.

2484
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,480
Thank you for listening.

2485
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
This topic,

2486
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,480
this topic

2487
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,480
is a little bit harder.

2488
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,480
So,

2489
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,480
if you have any questions,

2490
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,480
please feel free to ask.

2491
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,480
Let me welcome,

2492
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,480
let me give a round of applause

2493
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,480
on behalf of everyone.

2494
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,480
Yeah.

2495
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,480
Okay,

2496
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,480
do you have any questions?

2497
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,480
Do you have any questions?

2498
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,480
Let me ask.

2499
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
Yes.

2500
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,480
For example,

2501
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,480
if you are now

2502
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,480
changing

2503
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,480
their,

2504
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
for example,

2505
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,480
the two ends of the fiber.

2506
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,480
For example,

2507
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,480
the way they receive

2508
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,480
modulation.

2509
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,480
Yes.

2510
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,480
So,

2511
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,480
on the hardware,

2512
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,480
will this thing need to be changed for a long time?

2513
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
For example,

2514
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,480
you were,

2515
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,480
for example,

2516
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,480
you said green light, red light, blue light.

2517
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
Maybe it was only red and yellow.

2518
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,480
Then you added

2519
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,500
green light into it.

2520
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Yes.

2521
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,500
Will it work

2522
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
on the hardware?

2523
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
This is a very good question.

2524
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,500
Yes,

2525
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,500
it works.

2526
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Then how long does it take?

2527
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,500
At the time of RedOne,

2528
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
in 2018,

2529
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
it took

2530
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds.

2531
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Every step,

2532
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,500
a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds.

2533
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Of course,

2534
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,500
we can consider,

2535
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,500
if you say

2536
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds,

2537
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,500
there is no difference, right?

2538
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,500
But if you consider

2539
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,500
these are broadband networks,

2540
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
these broadband networks

2541
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
carry a lot of traffic.

2542
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,520
It may have a few terabytes of traffic

2543
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,520
or a few thousand terabytes.

2544
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
Multiplied by a few hundred milliseconds,

2545
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,520
that is a very objective

2546
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,520
traffic loss.

2547
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,520
But,

2548
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,520
how did it work before?

2549
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,520
It used to be like

2550
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,520
you said,

2551
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,520
what if you want to add red light,

2552
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,520
add blue light?

2553
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,520
It is to turn off both sides first.

2554
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,520
Because your laser needs to be adjusted again.

2555
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,520
After you adjust the laser again,

2556
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,520
you let it send out the laser again.

2557
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,520
So,

2558
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,520
turning it off and restarting

2559
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,540
is actually very slow.

2560
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,540
Now,

2561
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,540
why does it need a few hundred milliseconds?

2562
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,540
It was mentioned

2563
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,540
in the original RedOne paper.

2564
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,540
They said,

2565
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,540
if we say

2566
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,540
turning it off and restarting

2567
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,540
is a major factor

2568
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,540
in causing this delay,

2569
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,540
we can try not to turn it off and restart.

2570
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,540
If you don't turn it off and restart,

2571
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,540
they can't make it work

2572
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,540
at that time.

2573
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,540
But they estimate that

2574
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,540
if you don't turn it off and restart,

2575
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,540
it may only take

2576
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,540
a microsecond

2577
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,560
to reach

2578
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,560
the goal of re-adjustment.

2579
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,560
If we say

2580
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,560
our future network

2581
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,560
can be seamless,

2582
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,560
that is,

2583
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,560
if I want to re-adjust,

2584
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,560
I can re-adjust immediately.

2585
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,560
Then,

2586
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,560
of course,

2587
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,560
our research

2588
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,560
has nothing

2589
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,560
to do with

2590
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,560
their original research.

2591
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,560
Because we basically

2592
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,560
don't lose anything.

2593
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,560
So,

2594
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,560
I think this question is very important.

2595
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,560
In the end,

2596
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,560
how is it done on hardware?

2597
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,560
Can it be done?

2598
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,560
Yes, it can be done.

2599
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,580
Is there any other

2600
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,580
research requirement on hardware?

2601
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,580
Yes,

2602
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,580
that is,

2603
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,580
how do we adjust

2604
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,580
this modulation

2605
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,580
dynamically?

2606
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,580
In fact,

2607
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,580
there are many ways

2608
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,580
that can be thought of.

2609
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,580
For example,

2610
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,580
we can send the modulation

2611
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,580
in advance,

2612
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,580
right?

2613
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,580
Then I will tell the other person

2614
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,580
when I start

2615
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,580
to use this new modulation.

2616
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,580
In the middle,

2617
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,580
it may need

2618
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,580
some ways

2619
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,580
to let the two sides communicate.

2620
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,580
For example,

2621
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,580
you want to use a clock.

2622
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,580
That is,

2623
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,580
you want to make

2624
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,600
the timing

2625
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,600
good enough.

2626
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
For example,

2627
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
I will immediately switch

2628
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
both sides at 7 o'clock.

2629
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,600
This is actually quite difficult

2630
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,600
because you have to

2631
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,600
synchronize both sides.

2632
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,600
That is to say,

2633
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,600
your time is consistent.

2634
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
In fact,

2635
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
sometimes it's not that easy.

2636
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Another way is

2637
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,600
you send some

2638
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,600
this packet,

2639
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,600
send some information.

2640
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,600
That is,

2641
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,600
in addition to your

2642
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,600
information,

2643
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,600
send some

2644
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,600
control messages

2645
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,600
to the other side

2646
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,600
and tell him

2647
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,600
I want to start using it.

2648
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Then,

2649
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,600
which packet

2650
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,600
do I start using?

2651
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,600
For example,

2652
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,620
it's a little more complicated.

2653
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,620
Because the current

2654
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,620
system is not designed like this.

2655
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,620
Their original system

2656
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,620
may have imagined

2657
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,620
that once you turn it on,

2658
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,620
what is the modulation?

2659
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,620
Just keep using it.

2660
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,620
So, in the middle,

2661
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,620
there are actually

2662
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,620
a lot of research that can be done.

2663
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,620
Does this answer your question?

2664
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,620
Yes.

2665
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,620
So, you said

2666
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,620
Microsoft

2667
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,620
changed

2668
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,620
the modulation method like this.

2669
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,620
How many times can it be improved?

2670
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,620
Or how many percent?

2671
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,640
How many times can it be improved?

2672
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,640
Its improvement

2673
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,640
is actually pretty good.

2674
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
Let me find

2675
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,640
its original paper.

2676
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,640
I don't know if you can see

2677
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,640
the original.

2678
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,640
It's not good for me to show the paper directly.

2679
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,640
But it doesn't matter.

2680
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,640
Let's take a look.

2681
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,640
When you show it,

2682
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,640
before you finish,

2683
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,640
you swipe to its title page

2684
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,640
and show the author.

2685
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,640
The author.

2686
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,660
Do you know why?

2687
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,660
Does it mean you can see the author?

2688
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,660
Yes.

2689
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,660
If you look at its original paper,

2690
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,660
it's actually...

2691
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,660
Let me see.

2692
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,660
It can actually improve

2693
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,660
a lot of traffic.

2694
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,660
Or it can

2695
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,660
avoid traffic drop.

2696
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,660
But because their original

2697
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:16,660
paper

2698
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,660
talks about

2699
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,660
a pretty simple

2700
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,660
network.

2701
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,660
It only has four points.

2702
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:23,660
These four points

2703
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,660
are in California.

2704
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,660
So this

2705
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,660
is just a prototype.

2706
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:29,660
So

2707
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,660
when it's actually used,

2708
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,660
we can only say

2709
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,660
it has a lot of potential.

2710
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,660
But in the end,

2711
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,660
when it's actually used,

2712
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,660
it's not sure

2713
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,660
if it's good or not.

2714
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,660
But this idea

2715
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,660
has a lot of potential.

2716
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,660
This is the paper.

2717
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,660
Whatsoever published this paper.

2718
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,680
Whatsoever published this paper.

2719
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
The purpose of this paper

2720
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,680
is to say

2721
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,680
this idea is pretty good.

2722
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
But

2723
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
our update

2724
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
doesn't need to be so crude.

2725
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
It can be more detailed.

2726
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,680
This concept.

2727
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,680
Of course, if we have better

2728
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,680
hardware in the future,

2729
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,680
then...

2730
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,680
Go ahead.

2731
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,680
My question is this.

2732
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,680
When you're doing

2733
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,680
your simulation,

2734
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,680
basically,

2735
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,680
you have to have some assumptions

2736
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,680
about disturbance.

2737
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,700
Yes.

2738
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,700
What kind of

2739
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,700
situation are you in

2740
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,700
to compare?

2741
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,700
So your disturbance

2742
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,700
is like,

2743
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,700
Google,

2744
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,700
what do they do?

2745
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,700
Or how do you

2746
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,700
generate

2747
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,700
the disturbance

2748
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,700
in your simulation?

2749
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,700
This is a good question.

2750
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,700
So

2751
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,700
what I actually generate

2752
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:32,700
is not disturbance.

2753
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,700
What I generate is

2754
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:35,700
this link

2755
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,700
the current state

2756
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,700
and the next state.

2757
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,700
So I actually

2758
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,700
added a layer

2759
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,700
of assumption.

2760
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,700
That is to say,

2761
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,720
let's assume that

2762
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,720
my current link

2763
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,720
can only send

2764
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,720
50 gigabytes per second.

2765
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,720
50 Gbps.

2766
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,720
And then

2767
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,720
because

2768
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,720
the noise has dropped

2769
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,720
I can send 100 Gbps now.

2770
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,720
How should I update?

2771
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,720
So

2772
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,720
in the middle

2773
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,720
I put the

2774
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,720
relationship between

2775
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,720
noise and signal

2776
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,720
in there.

2777
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,720
In fact,

2778
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,720
in operation,

2779
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,720
of course,

2780
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,720
there are

2781
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,720
other restrictions.

2782
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,720
In fact,

2783
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:12,740
there is also in the paper.

2784
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:13,740
But I don't want to

2785
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,740
show this paper again.

2786
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,740
That is to say,

2787
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:16,740
the adjustment of our screen width

2788
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,740
is actually

2789
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,740
not continuous.

2790
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,740
That is to say,

2791
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,740
the screen width

2792
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,740
we can use

2793
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:22,740
is not continuous.

2794
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,740
For example,

2795
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,740
25 Mbps,

2796
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,740
50 Mbps,

2797
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,740
100 Mbps,

2798
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,740
150,

2799
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:28,740
like this.

2800
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,740
So,

2801
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,740
you are actually

2802
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:31,740
choosing these kinds.

2803
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,740
No matter how much noise you have,

2804
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:33,740
when it reaches

2805
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:34,740
a certain point

2806
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,740
you can probably

2807
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:36,740
adjust it up.

2808
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,740
You can adjust it

2809
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,740
from 100 to 150

2810
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,740
or 150 to 200.

2811
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,760
But in fact,

2812
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,760
why can you adjust

2813
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,760
the principle

2814
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,760
is what I just said

2815
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,760
about the noise.

2816
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,760
So, in fact,

2817
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,760
how is it measured?

2818
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,760
I don't have

2819
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,760
this information.

2820
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,760
I just

2821
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,760
make an assumption

2822
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,760
based on the range

2823
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,760
it can adjust.

2824
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,760
So, my assumption

2825
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,760
is that

2826
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,760
the original link

2827
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,760
may be

2828
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,760
in this

2829
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,760
100 Gbps

2830
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,760
mode.

2831
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,760
Because

2832
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,760
my

2833
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,760
noise

2834
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,760
may be reduced,

2835
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:09,780
so now

2836
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,780
suddenly this link

2837
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,780
can reach 200 Gbps.

2838
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,780
If it is

2839
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:13,780
in this situation,

2840
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:14,780
how do we

2841
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,780
go from 100 to 200 Gbps?

2842
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,780
So, a better way

2843
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,780
is

2844
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,780
you have already

2845
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,780
assumed

2846
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,780
your work goal

2847
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:23,780
is to adjust like this.

2848
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,780
But you tell it

2849
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,780
how to be smarter.

2850
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,780
Not that

2851
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,780
it's not

2852
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:28,780
that

2853
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,780
it's not like

2854
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,780
at the analog level

2855
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:31,780
that

2856
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,780
the noise pattern is like this,

2857
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:33,780
so we should

2858
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:34,780
decide

2859
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,780
what state to adjust.

2860
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:36,780
That is already

2861
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,780
a given

2862
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,800
assumption.

2863
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,800
Yes, a given.

2864
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,800
So, let's say

2865
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,800
my device tells me

2866
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,800
this thing.

2867
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,800
I see.

2868
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
My research

2869
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,800
is usually

2870
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
at a higher level.

2871
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,800
So, let's say

2872
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,800
the device tells me

2873
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
these things,

2874
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
how do I plan

2875
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
this thing?

2876
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Okay, anyone else

2877
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
have any questions?

2878
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Okay, if not,

2879
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
let's

2880
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
give another round of applause

2881
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,800
to Shihai.

2882
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,800
Thank you, everyone.

2883
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:05,820
Thank you.

2884
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:07,820
Okay, that's all

2885
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,820
for today's lecture.

2886
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,820
I'll...
