00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello everyone, welcome everyone to today's Tire Talk, we are very honored to invite Dr. Hong Shaoming today, he is now a post-doctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology, and he is my colleague.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He brought us today's speech topic is unconscious visual information processing, from sensory cells to language. If I'm not mistaken, most of the content of today's speech has been published recently.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:42,000
First of all, let me introduce Shaoming to you. Dr. Shaoming got his medical school degree from Duke University and the University of Singapore.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When he was a doctor, his main job was to study the unconscious process. After he got his Ph.D., he came to Caltech.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:20,000
His current boss is Shinsuke Okada. His main job is to continue his Ph.D. research on the unconscious process. His main tools are psychophysics, fMRI, EEG, and eye tracking.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One thing that is different from the usual speech is that we now applaud and thank Shaoming for bringing us the speech, but we have to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear everyone's applause.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thank you for your introduction. I am Shaoming Hong. Thank you all for joining today's speech.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Today I want to talk about a research topic that I am very interested in, which is unconscious information processing. I will focus on the visual level.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
As you can see from the title, there are two extremes, one is perception and the other is language. I want to tell you that unconscious language processing may cover a very large range.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
From perception, from light information to telemetry information, that is the first level of our visual and external world interaction.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All the way to language, we usually think that language is a higher-level and more integrated message in the whole visual process. For example, you have to understand a sentence, you have to know the meaning of the words between them, and you have to know how different strokes work.

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Today I want to convey a message to everyone, that is, unconscious information processing may exist in different levels of visual information processing, which may cover a very wide range.

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What is consciousness? Until now, scientists have not been able to give a very good scientific definition. In this speech today, most people in the field of consciousness science use the definition that consciousness has sensory content.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
For example, you can see the words on my slide now, which are in your visual consciousness. For example, you can hear my voice now, which is in your auditory sensory content.

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We say that you are aware of these auditory or visual stimuli and have sensory content.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is there any content? Do not be confused with the state of consciousness. What is the state of consciousness? For example, if you are too bored to talk about it, you may fall asleep and enter an unconscious state.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What we are talking about today is not the state. What I am talking about today is the state of unconsciousness without sensory content.

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Is there any sensory content? You may often hear a metaphor. You can see the picture below. You may have seen it on the poster, which is a simple picture I drew myself.

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Consciousness and unconscious processing seem to be just a corner of the iceberg. From the perspective of message processing, this may not be a big problem.

20
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Because we receive a lot of messages every minute and every second, but only a small part of the message is really presented in our consciousness.

21
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The rest of the messages that are not presented in our consciousness have always been a subject of research that I have been interested in.

22
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What happened to these messages? Did our brain ignore these messages and ignore them? Or can these messages still affect our brain and further affect our behavior?

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There are three main questions to discuss today. The first question I want to ask is the question that I have been interested in since I was a classmate.

24
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What kind of information can be processed unconsciously? We can have a very simple paradoxical hypothesis.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The first is that simple, single-digit, and low-level messages can be processed in an unconscious situation.

26
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
On the contrary, another hypothesis may be more complex, integrated, and high-level messages. These messages are more difficult to process, so they cannot be processed in an unconscious situation.

27
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Or they can be processed. These are two opposing hypotheses.

28
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The second question I want to ask is whether unconscious processing is equivalent to automated processing.

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What does this mean? Once this process starts, it will not be disturbed by other external processes.

30
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We can have a very simple paradoxical hypothesis here.

31
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The first is that unconscious processing will not be affected by the difficulty of what we do consciously, or how we use our attention.

32
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
On the contrary, another hypothesis may be that what we consciously process is more difficult, or what we do will interact with the unconscious message processing.

33
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
These are two different hypotheses.

34
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Finally, I want to turn to a completely different angle and discuss with you the neural basis of unconscious processing with the study of nucleus resonance and brain imaging.

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Without further ado, let's move on to the first study.

36
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The first study I want to discuss with you is the integration relationship between sound and shape.

37
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We want to know if this integration relationship can be produced in an unconscious situation.

38
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If you look at the title, the title is actually a bit mysterious.

39
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What we want to say is that this word can sound round or sharp before we understand it.

40
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What does this mean?

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If we want to answer this question, we may have to take a few steps back and think about what we originally wanted to ask.

42
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What we want to know is how we name an object.

43
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Imagine, for example, that 100,000 years ago, we may have some very basic language systems, but we do not have such complex grammar and structure as we do now.

44
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
When we go out to hunt, I see some objects, such as the stone on the left or the crystal on the right.

45
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
When I go back to the group, I want to tell my master that the two things I see today are object A and object B.

46
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I must use two different sounds to express these two objects.

47
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
In this case, what sound should we use to express these objects?

48
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:44,000
A very famous contemporary linguist, Arthur Shearer, said that the process of using what sound or what object to express external objects is very likely to be arbitrary.

49
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
In other words, I use sound A to express the stone on the left, and sound B to express the crystal on the right.

50
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Perhaps another possibility is that different tribes or people with different languages ​​have a common connection.

51
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
They all tend to use a certain type of sound to represent the round object on the left, and then use another sound to represent the pointed object on the right.

52
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This means that there is a very strong connection between our sound and shape.

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Does psychology have any evidence to support such a connection?

54
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In fact, we have a very famous cross-sensory sound and visual correspondence called Bubakiki Effect or Bubakiki Phenomenon.

55
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What is Bubakiki Phenomenon?

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Those who have a background in psychology may be very familiar with it.

57
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If you don't have a background in psychology, imagine that you are an experimenter today.

58
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You walk into the lab and the experimenter tells you that what you are going to do today is very simple.

59
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We will show you two pictures, the round picture on the left and the pointed picture on the right.

60
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
These two pictures are two words used by a remote African tribe.

61
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
One of the words is called Bubakiki and the other is called Kiki.

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Your job is very simple.

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Your job is to tell us which one is Bubakiki and which one is Kiki.

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Even if you haven't heard of this phenomenon before, you may be able to guess what sound most people use to express the object on the left and what sound to express the object on the right.

65
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In fact, the answer is that people use a softer sound to express the round object on the left and a sharper sound to express the pointed object on the right.

66
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is a phenomenon corresponding to sound and shape.

67
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This phenomenon is highly consistent.

68
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why do I say it is highly consistent?

69
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It is highly consistent that it can exceed the age.

70
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What does this mean?

71
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In an experiment, they took a group of adults and a group of children under the age of three.

72
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They used different shapes on the right, round shapes, pointed shapes, and these words.

73
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The homework is the same as the homework you just did.

74
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They asked these children and adults to use these words to describe these shapes to name these shapes.

75
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They found that children under the age of three have a very similar pairing pattern with us.

76
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They also use a softer sound to describe these round shapes and a sharper sound to describe these pointed shapes.

77
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This means that the corresponding time between sound and shape can be very early, even before these children have a complete language training or a complete cultural experience.

78
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is the first evidence.

79
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The second evidence is that this phenomenon is even a cross-language phenomenon.

80
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What does this mean?

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It means that regardless of whether your mother tongue is Chinese or Mandarin, English or German, the results of the experiment on different species are very similar.

82
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We use the sound of the round shape to represent the round shape, and vice versa.

83
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The real problem of our research is here.

84
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why does this happen?

85
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Here I provide two very intuitive hypotheses.

86
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The first hypothesis is that this is a conscious association.

87
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This consciousness is not the same as our whole speech to discuss consciousness.

88
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This means that we intentionally connect some things together.

89
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What does this mean?

90
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It means that when I hear this thing, it sounds sharp and sharp.

91
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So this pattern is also sharp.

92
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I want to connect these two things together.

93
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The original thing means the same.

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
In other words, the reason why there is a connection between sound and shape is because everyone intentionally connects sound and shape together.

95
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is a possibility.

96
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But this possibility does not seem to be able to explain these past data very well.

97
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why are there such similar connections between children and adults?

98
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Or why do people who cross-language have such a connection?

99
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The second hypothesis is that perhaps the correspondence between sound and shape happened before these stimuli material entered our conscious state.

100
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So it is a very early processing process.

101
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This early processing process may be very common.

102
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So it can explain that we have seen these studies in adults and children, or in different languages.

103
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can find this Bubakiki effect.

104
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This whole study is used to test whether the Bubakiki effect can really occur in the unconscious state.

105
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So at the beginning, our research question is very simple.

106
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We want to know if the Bubakiki effect can occur in the unconscious state.

107
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The first experiment we did was very easy.

108
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We found some, for example, this round shape, and then paired with the word Bubu.

109
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then the pointed shape is paired with the word Kiki.

110
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
These are the pair or congruent pairs we talked about.

111
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:44,000
When you compare the word, the sound, and the shape, you will have an inconsistent pair.

112
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The question we want to ask is very simple.

113
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If we can make the receiver not see these pairs, and then we look at their reaction to these pairs.

114
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If it's still different, does that mean that they can still deal with sound and shape when they can't see these pairs?

115
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The next question is, how do we make the receiver unable to see these pairs?

116
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Our approach is a technique called Continuous Flash Suppression.

117
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The concept is like this.

118
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
In this case, if one eye shows you a very bright square, like these colorful squares, we call them Mondrians.

119
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When one eye looks at this colorful square, if the other eye lets you see a very bright square,

120
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,000
it usually takes a few seconds for you to see the object on the other eye.

121
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
In these few seconds, the object is basically unconscious to you or the visual material to you.

122
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What do we do at this time?

123
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We put the congruent and incongruent pairs into your other eye.

124
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Then we measure how long it takes for the receiver to see.

125
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Our assumption is that if the congruence of sound and shape can be processed unconsciously or subconsciously,

126
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
the time when they see the higher congruence pair and the incongruence pair may be different.

127
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is our assumption.

128
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll go into more detail about time.

129
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You'll see three different visual representations later.

130
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Basically, one corresponds to their non-priority vision, one is the priority vision, and the other is the image that is closer to what they really see.

131
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
At the beginning, there will be a random SOA.

132
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
After the end, we'll show him two colorful flickering squares.

133
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What we're going to do is put a pair of congruence or incongruence in the other eye on the left or right.

134
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What they're going to do on this assignment is when they see any part of this pair,

135
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
press a button and we'll record the time it responds.

136
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So this is a detection task.

137
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We measure the time and we call it suppression time.

138
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It means that this pair can be suppressed.

139
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How long can we keep it out of our consciousness?

140
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Our assumption is that if the correspondence of sound and shape can exist before they enter our consciousness,

141
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
congruent pair and incongruent pair will spend different amounts of time.

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
In order to make sure that the receiver has a good time doing this,

143
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
they see the stimulation material and then react, not just press a button.

144
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
At the end of each trial, we also added a location task.

145
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Basically, we just said,

146
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, you saw it.

147
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Where did you see it?

148
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is it on the left or right?

149
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's just to make sure that our receiver is a good receiver.

150
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You can see that the average accuracy rate is quite high here.

151
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
When we analyze, we only analyze the trials that respond correctly.

152
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Back to the question, what exactly did we find?

153
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This is the 20 receivers we received in this experiment.

154
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
There are a lot of things in this graph.

155
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let's look at the first column first.

156
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You can see a orange dot, which means that this is one of the receivers.

157
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The orange dot is the time it spends in incongruent pairs.

158
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The dark blue dot at the bottom is the time it spends in congruent pairs.

159
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The bar at the bottom is the difference between the two.

160
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Its y-axis is on the right.

161
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So in other words,

162
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
this receiver needs to spend more time to see incongruent pairs.

163
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What we're doing here is very simple.

164
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We put these individual data together and make an average.

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Then we see that this is the average of all people's data.

166
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Then it's a positive bar.

167
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What does this mean?

168
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We call it a congruency benefit.

169
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
When the shape of the word and the outer circle is more consistent,

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
they will enter the state of consciousness of our receivers earlier.

171
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This means that the correspondence between the sound and the shape

172
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
seems to have been dealt with before entering the state of consciousness.

173
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So in the first study,

174
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
we pointed out to some extent that

175
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
it seems to occur before or before consciousness.

176
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Then we found something called congruency benefit.

177
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
When the sound and the shape are consistent,

178
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
it will enter our state of consciousness earlier.

179
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
For people who are more sensitive to experimental design or experiments,

180
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
they immediately feel that it doesn't seem right.

181
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Let's take a step back and look at the relationship between the word and the shape.

182
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What we've been claiming is that the sound of the word,

183
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
the phonology of the sound, and the shape will have a congruency effect.

184
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
When they are consistent, it's easier for you to see them.

185
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But the relationship between the word, the shape, and the inner circle

186
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
is the relationship between the word's word form, orthography, and shape.

187
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So in other words, if you look at these congruent pairs in our first experiment,

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
they are not only correspondent between sound and shape,

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
they are also correspondent between shape and shape.

190
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
In other words, the congruent pair looks more like it visually.

191
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In other words, we may have found some kind of integration phenomenon.

192
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But this integration phenomenon may not be cross-sensory,

193
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but only exists in the visual domain.

194
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So in other words, when the word looks very similar to the shape of the outside,

195
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the receiver will see it earlier.

196
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
When it's not, the receiver will see it later.

197
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
In order to prove that the sound really plays a very important role,

198
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
we made some changes in the next experiment.

199
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We used some so-called neutral symbols or neutral text.

200
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
These things look neither far nor near.

201
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What we do is that we train the receiver to put the sound on these symbols.

202
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So the receiver will call these symbols bubu or kiki.

203
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Then let's see if the symbols they trained

204
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
can produce the congruency benefit we just saw with a higher consistency shape.

205
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's still a bit abstract, so I'll go straight into the details of our experiment.

206
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This time we really chose two languages from Africa,

207
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
called bi-language.

208
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You can see that there are two different texts on the left.

209
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why did we choose this language?

210
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why did we choose these two different letters?

211
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because in another study,

212
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
our collaborators found that

213
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
if you ask the receiver to pair the two different words on the left and right

214
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
with different sounds,

215
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the receiver basically has no preference.

216
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If you ask them to pair with a sharp sound or a round sound,

217
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
their response is usually chance, 50%.

218
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So we defined these as neutral letters.

219
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's neither round nor sharp.

220
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What we do is very simple.

221
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We ask the receiver to connect this to the sound of kiki or bubu.

222
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's take a sip of water.

223
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There are two stages in this experiment.

224
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The first one is the training session.

225
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What we do in the training session is to let them do a very simple matching task.

226
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
At the beginning, they will hear a sound.

227
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You can see that in the upper right corner, they hear the sound of bubu or kiki.

228
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Then they see one of the words in the two words.

229
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What they have to do is tell us that this is matched or unmatched.

230
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
At the end of each trial, we will tell them that what they did was right or wrong.

231
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So we didn't really tell them what was matched and what was unmatched.

232
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's up to them to figure out what the composition between them is at the end of each trial.

233
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Through this training method,

234
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
if they answer 20 questions in a row,

235
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
we assume that they have learned which word and which sound should be paired.

236
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
In other words, in this experiment,

237
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the consistency of things depends on what word is paired with what sound.

238
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
For example, we collected two experiments here, two groups of subjects.

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
In 2A, we asked them to pair this word with bubu and this word with kiki.

240
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In other words, these two pairs are congruent in 2A.

241
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
In 2B, we collect another group of subjects and reverse the pairing relationship.

242
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
At this time, the pairs in the lower right corner become incongruent pairs.

243
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
As I just said,

244
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
the congruency depends entirely on what the word represents.

245
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
After the training, these subjects will move on to the next stage.

246
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Basically, it's exactly the same as the experiment we did before,

247
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but now we use these neutral symbols.

248
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What did we find?

249
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let me recap for you.

250
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
In the first time, we found this congruency benefit.

251
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
When the shape of the word and the outside is more consistent,

252
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.

253
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
In 2A and 2B, we also found a very similar phenomenon.

254
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
In other words, the point is not the shape of the word, but the sound represented by the word.

255
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
As long as the sound and the shape of the outside are more consistent,

256
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.

257
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
After this experiment,

258
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
we found that a short training can cause a very similar unconscious phenomenon.

259
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That is, if the shape of the word is consistent with the outside,

260
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.

261
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you follow this stage carefully,

262
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
you will find that there is no sound element in the formal experiment.

263
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
How does our sound element come from?

264
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Let's assume that after it sees the word,

265
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
it will extract the sound of the word.

266
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If the sound is consistent with the shape of the outside,

267
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.

268
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If the sound is inconsistent with the shape of the outside,

269
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
it will move on to our conscious state later.

270
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So the sound is a bit like we assume that they will read the sound of the word.

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So in the next experiment,

272
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
we want to directly introduce the sound component.

273
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
If we directly introduce the sound component,

274
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
according to the results we found before,

275
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
this sound should help a shape you couldn't see originally.

276
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If they are consistent,

277
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
it should help you see the shape you couldn't see originally.

278
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
At this time, we turn to another paradigm,

279
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
which is called the masking paradigm.

280
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This approach is like this.

281
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We will present a visual shape.

282
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This situation is also a pointed shape or a round shape.

283
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The presented time is only 33 milliseconds.

284
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So if you use a 60Hz monitor,

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
it's about two frames.

286
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The time is actually quite short.

287
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Before and after this time,

288
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
we will put some noisy patterns.

289
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
These noisy patterns are to make you unable to see the shape.

290
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In fact, the whole experiment is that the receiver will answer,

291
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
oh, I saw it or I didn't see it.

292
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
In the process of their answer,

293
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
we will do some staircasing to adjust the brightness of this thing.

294
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So what we want to know is

295
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
what is the threshold for the receiver to see this shape?

296
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
How high or low do we want to adjust the brightness?

297
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The receiver will just see this shape.

298
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The important thing at this time is that

299
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
we will play a sound at the same time,

300
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
or 150 milliseconds before or after.

301
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This sound may be consistent with this pattern or inconsistent.

302
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
According to our previous results,

303
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
if this sound is consistent with this pattern,

304
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
it should help the receiver see this pattern.

305
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Is that true?

306
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The answer is that this is true.

307
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We found that if the sound is played

308
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
at 150 milliseconds before the shape,

309
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the receiver will have a significant threshold reduction phenomenon.

310
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
yx is the threshold.

311
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You can think of this as

312
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
how many luminance they need to see the shape.

313
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So the lower it is, the easier it is to see the shape.

314
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So when the sound is played at 150 milliseconds before,

315
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
if the sound is consistent with the shape,

316
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
the receiver will be easier to see the shape.

317
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Again, it means that

318
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the integration between the sound and the shape

319
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
is very likely to occur in a preconscious state

320
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
or unconscious state.

321
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Through this series of studies,

322
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the first thing we found was that

323
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
the effect of boobakiki

324
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
can occur in an unconscious state

325
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
or in a conscious state.

326
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We also explained that

327
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the important thing is what the word itself represents,

328
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
what the sound is,

329
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
not what the shape of the word is.

330
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Finally, we found that

331
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
if you use a sound directly,

332
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
it will help a shape

333
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that should have been hidden by the mask

334
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to be seen more easily.

335
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So again, it proves that

336
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
the correspondence between sound and shape

337
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
is very likely to occur

338
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
before the conscious threshold.

339
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This is the first part of the experiment.

340
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Do you have any questions?

341
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
If it's too fast or too slow,

342
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
you can tell me.

343
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If you have any questions,

344
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
you can type next to me,

345
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and I will help you ask.

346
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You can also turn on the microphone yourself to ask.

347
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But we set the microphone to silent.

348
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So if you didn't notice,

349
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
you have to turn on the microphone

350
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
to ask questions.

351
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I have a question.

352
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Sorry.

353
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Go ahead.

354
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
In the picture of the contrast,

355
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
does the contrast mean

356
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
that 22% and 23%

357
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
are gray and black?

358
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The contrast is actually the alpha value.

359
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
OK.

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Isn't 22% and 23% very different?

361
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I can't see it with my naked eye.

362
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes, it's very different.

363
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The unconscious effect is usually very small.

364
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
One of the reasons is that

365
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
in the process of doing these experiments,

366
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
we want to make the audience unable to see.

367
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
For example, there are two ways.

368
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The first is to make it very dark.

369
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The second is to use masking or CFS

370
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
to make people unable to see.

371
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So we intentionally or unintentionally

372
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
make the amount of information very small.

373
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Usually the effect will not be very large.

374
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Of course, this is statistically significant.

375
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But it's hard to tell the difference

376
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
between the two.

377
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But this is actually the point.

378
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The point is that

379
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
in your consciousness,

380
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
you can't tell the difference.

381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
OK.

382
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
But maybe your eyes

383
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
can still tell the difference.

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But we consciously eliminated it.

385
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So I can't feel it.

386
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You can say that.

387
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
OK. Thank you.

388
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
OK.

389
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Let's move on to the next research.

390
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
If you have any questions,

391
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
we can come back and discuss.

392
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
OK.

393
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
In this experiment,

394
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
we will explain to you that

395
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
the integration between sound and shape

396
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
can occur in the unconscious state.

397
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The next research I want to talk to you about is...

398
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Sorry.

399
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Someone has a question.

400
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
He's next to me.

401
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
OK.

402
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
His question is this.

403
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
He said he wanted to ask

404
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
how to test the difference between

405
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
the dominant eye

406
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and the dominant eye.

407
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What part of the experiment will it affect?

408
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
OK.

409
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This is a good question.

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't have the official results

411
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
to support the second question.

412
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But if I remember correctly,

413
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
the dominant eye is

414
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
when you put the design material

415
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and what you want the other person to see,

416
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
which we call the suppressor,

417
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
in which eye?

418
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I remember doing it.

419
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The results are similar.

420
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So it's a bit like a convention.

421
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
We put the suppressor on the dominant eye

422
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
because it's usually easier for you

423
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
to see what's on the other eye.

424
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Because it's your superior eye.

425
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So relatively speaking,

426
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
if what's on that eye is very salient,

427
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
it's even harder for you to see

428
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
what's on the other eye.

429
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
This is the reason.

430
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So how do we know the dominant eye?

431
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
There are many ways to test it.

432
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The simplest way is that

433
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
you can, for example,

434
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
form a small hole.

435
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You can stretch out your hand

436
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and look at something through the hole.

437
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Both of your eyes have to open.

438
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
At this time,

439
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you close one of your eyes,

440
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and you'll find that

441
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
only one eye can see

442
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
what you're looking at.

443
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That eye,

444
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
we usually call it the dominant eye.

445
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
When I force you to use one eye,

446
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
which eye will you look at?

447
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You can try it later.

448
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Excuse me.

449
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Can I ask a question?

450
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Go ahead.

451
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
My name is Wen Wen.

452
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm from the University of Tokyo.

453
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Hello.

454
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'd like to ask,

455
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
will there be a discussion later

456
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
about why there's this

457
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
congruence benefit?

458
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Why do consistent things

459
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
enter the conference earlier

460
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
than inconsistent things?

461
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Because in different fields,

462
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
sometimes inconsistent things

463
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
may be more salient.

464
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And consistent things

465
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
are not very attractive.

466
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Why do consistent things

467
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
in perception

468
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
have a more attractive position?

469
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's a good question.

470
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And I've been facing this question myself.

471
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because in my different experiments,

472
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
sometimes consistent things

473
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
enter the state of consistency earlier,

474
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and sometimes inconsistent things

475
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
enter the state of consistency earlier.

476
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'll come back.

477
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'll come back to this question

478
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
after all three of my research is done.

479
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Okay, thank you.

480
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't know how you control your time,

481
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
but I have a question.

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If you think this is too much,

483
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
we can ask together at the end.

484
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Okay, I'll speak faster.

485
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
How do you control

486
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the age and gender of the audience?

487
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
There's no control in this study.

488
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So we basically collect young people,

489
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
18 to 35 years old.

490
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
This is a visual study.

491
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It's a bit of a conventional convention.

492
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And gender is balanced.

493
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Age is that period.

494
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Gender is balanced.

495
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Okay, I'm going to move on to the next study.

496
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So in the next study,

497
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm going to talk about a

498
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
unconscious science.

499
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Everyone is relative.

500
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Unconscious science is not a very popular science.

501
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But in unconscious science,

502
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
of course, there are also more popular things.

503
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That is,

504
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
unconscious meaning or language processing.

505
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Okay, I want to tell you that

506
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
this language processing

507
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
will still be controlled by

508
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
the high and low difficulty of what we do.

509
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Okay, like I said,

510
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Unconscious meaning or language processing

511
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
has always been a

512
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
prominent field in this field.

513
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Why?

514
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
In fact, intuitively speaking,

515
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
if we find that there is unconscious processing today,

516
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
the first thing I will be interested in is

517
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
that when I didn't see this word

518
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
or didn't hear this word,

519
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
can I understand what it means?

520
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is actually a pretty intuitive

521
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and everyone wants to know the problem.

522
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That's true.

523
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This field has been studied for decades.

524
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Everyone in different visual paradigms,

525
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
including Mr. Ye Su-lin of the Taiwan Psychological Department,

526
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
also found that

527
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the meaning of a word,

528
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
even if you don't see it,

529
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
can also be read by you.

530
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It will even affect the judgment of another word.

531
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Okay, as you can see,

532
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
in the third Continuous Flash Suppression,

533
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
this is the paradigm we used

534
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
in the first experiment.

535
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay, under this paradigm,

536
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
unfortunately or even luckily,

537
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
in fact, its results have not been stable.

538
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Some experimenters found that

539
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
the meaning of the word can indeed

540
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
survive under this paradigm.

541
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Even if the recipient can't see the word,

542
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
the meaning of the word seems to be able to be extracted

543
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and then affect their judgment of another task.

544
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Some of the experiments

545
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
did not work.

546
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Okay, this experiment,

547
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
this study,

548
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
the initial intention

549
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
is actually to know

550
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
why there is this difference.

551
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We want to make a big assumption

552
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
that maybe in different paradigms,

553
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
everyone uses the same paradigm,

554
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
but some people find it,

555
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
some people can't find it.

556
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The reason is actually something else.

557
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The reason we want to mention here is

558
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
whether it is related to the difficulty of the task.

559
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What does this mean?

560
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It means that

561
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
we assume that there is conscious processing

562
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and unconscious processing.

563
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Conscious processing

564
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
actually shares the same resources.

565
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You can think of it as attention.

566
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
If they share the same resources,

567
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
then conscious processing,

568
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
if the task is more difficult,

569
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
then you spend all the resources.

570
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Your unconscious processing

571
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
can't be produced.

572
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
In other words,

573
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
if you do this conscious task now,

574
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
it's actually quite simple.

575
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Then you have more resources

576
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
that can be distributed to unconscious processing.

577
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Next, we want to discuss this study

578
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
with everyone

579
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
to see if this hypothesis is true.

580
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
In order to test this hypothesis,

581
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
we made a paradigm called

582
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Double Stroke Paradigm.

583
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What is this paradigm?

584
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
For example, I will show you two words now.

585
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You may be very intuitive to read red and blue.

586
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Of course, there are other reasons

587
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
why people don't read blue and red.

588
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But one of the reasons is

589
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
if I ask you to read the colors of these words now,

590
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the left is blue and the right is red,

591
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
you will find that reading colors

592
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
is much more difficult than reading words.

593
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Why?

594
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Because when we read colors,

595
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
we are easily disturbed by words.

596
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
This is a famous

597
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Stroke phenomenon.

598
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You don't have to worry that

599
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
our readers will not read red and blue,

600
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
because we are doing research in English.

601
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So in the case of reading colors,

602
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
as I just said,

603
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
usually the reader will have a higher

604
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
level of language interference,

605
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
so they want to read words.

606
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Because reading words is a stronger process,

607
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and it is usually relatively automated.

608
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
On the other hand,

609
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
when they read words,

610
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
they usually read better.

611
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Because the color here

612
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
has a weaker effect.

613
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If there is an effect,

614
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
it is usually called the Reverse Stroke Effect.

615
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Let's define these two different conditions

616
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
as high-low and low-low.

617
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
In the case of reading words,

618
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
it is relatively simple, it is low-low.

619
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But in the case of reading colors,

620
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
it is more difficult, it is high-low.

621
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What we want to know is

622
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
if we put another word

623
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
before they react to this word

624
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
so that they can't see it,

625
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
will the consistency between the two words

626
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
affect their judgment of this word?

627
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If it does,

628
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
what should it be in?

629
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Should it be in a high-difficulty situation

630
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
or a low-difficulty situation?

631
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I will go into the details of our research.

632
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The same is used here

633
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
is the paradigm of double-eyed reading.

634
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So you will still see

635
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
three different strings later.

636
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
At the beginning,

637
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
we just try to

638
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
keep the first word from being seen.

639
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
This is a bit different from before.

640
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Before, we wanted to measure

641
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
how long that thing would be seen.

642
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
In this experiment,

643
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
we don't want it to be seen.

644
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So let's show you again.

645
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
This is actually a

646
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
slightly different paradigm.

647
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You will find that the way it flashes

648
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
is a bit different.

649
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
If you want to know the technical details,

650
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
we can discuss it later.

651
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
What we want to do

652
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
is just to make the receiver see this word.

653
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So the receiver in this process,

654
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
when we put the first word

655
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
prime,

656
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
it can actually react.

657
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
If it says, oh, I saw it,

658
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
they press a button,

659
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
we will label this trial

660
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
as a conscious trial.

661
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
These trials

662
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
will not be analyzed later.

663
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
What we are interested in

664
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
is when they can't see this word,

665
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
how do they affect the next word?

666
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
In this process,

667
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
they say they can see it.

668
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
In the process of not seeing it,

669
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
we will adjust the brightness of this word

670
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
to keep this word

671
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
always almost visible

672
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and a little bit invisible.

673
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
If they don't see the word

674
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
in this situation,

675
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
we will move on to the next stage.

676
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We will present a word with color.

677
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
We will teach it

678
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
to read words in some experiments.

679
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
In some experiments,

680
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
we teach it to read colors.

681
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
That's the case of low difficulty

682
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and high difficulty.

683
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
In the first layer,

684
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
when we say,

685
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
oh, it can actively report

686
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
that it has seen

687
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
or has not seen the word,

688
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
that is a subjective report

689
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that they have not realized this word.

690
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
We also want to establish

691
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
an objective standard

692
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that when it really

693
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
didn't see this word,

694
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
what would happen?

695
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What we do is

696
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
we add a location task.

697
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What is this?

698
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
At the end of each trial,

699
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
we ask it to judge

700
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
and ask it to guess

701
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
that you just didn't see that word,

702
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
that prime.

703
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Please guess

704
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
whether the word

705
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
is above or below.

706
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That's the logic.

707
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
If it really didn't see that word,

708
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
then its performance on this task

709
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
should be chance,

710
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
because it didn't see that word.

711
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Indeed, across several experiments,

712
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
we found in this study

713
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
that their performance

714
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
on the location task

715
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
is about chance,

716
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and there is no difference

717
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
with 50%.

718
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So we want to establish

719
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
that subjectively and objectively,

720
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
it really didn't see that word.

721
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
In the case that it didn't see

722
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
that word,

723
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
if the two words

724
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
are not the same,

725
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
will it affect you

726
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
to read words or read colors?

727
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The answer is yes.

728
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This is the case of reading words.

729
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The case of reading words

730
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
is a relatively low-difficulty situation.

731
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You can see that the left corner

732
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
is our result.

733
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This is when the two words

734
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
are the same,

735
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
it is congruent.

736
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
This is the case where the two words

737
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
are inconsistent.

738
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
In an inconsistent situation,

739
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
they will take about 5% of the time.

740
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
This is a standardized

741
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
normalized RT,

742
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
because we put a lot of

743
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
blank trials

744
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
at the same time

745
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
in this experiment,

746
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
that is,

747
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
in the case

748
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
where the word should be put,

749
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
the word should be put,

750
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
we sometimes

751
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
didn't show anything.

752
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So that's our baseline.

753
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So compared to the baseline,

754
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
if the two words are inconsistent,

755
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
they will take

756
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
about 5% of the time.

757
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This is a relatively simple

758
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
case of reading words.

759
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
In the case of reading colors,

760
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
this is a high-low,

761
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
a more difficult situation.

762
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
We found that this effect

763
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
disappeared.

764
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So at least so far,

765
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
this seems to indicate that

766
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
unconscious processing

767
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
does not seem to be so automated.

768
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Because the exact same design

769
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
is in one situation,

770
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
there will be

771
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
unconscious interference.

772
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
In another situation,

773
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
there will be

774
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
unconscious interference.

775
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What happened?

776
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Just like we just said,

777
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
we just assumed at the beginning

778
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
that this was related to

779
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the difficulty of the task,

780
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
the high and low.

781
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
If it really has

782
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
something to do with

783
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
the difficulty of the task,

784
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
then think about it.

785
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This is a

786
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
reading color is

787
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
a relatively difficult task.

788
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
If I keep training

789
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the collector to do this task,

790
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
let him do it for a long time,

791
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
do it to a level

792
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
that he becomes very powerful.

793
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
In theory,

794
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
this high-difficulty task

795
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
becomes simpler and simpler,

796
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
becoming a low-difficulty task.

797
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
When this high-difficulty task

798
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
becomes a low-difficulty task,

799
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
if we follow our theory,

800
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
it should have more resources

801
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
that can be distributed to

802
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
unconscious information processing.

803
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
At this time,

804
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
interference should be re-generated.

805
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
If you have participated in

806
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
visual research,

807
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you will find that

808
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
visual scientists love to

809
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
do a lot of trials.

810
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
In fact,

811
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
at this time,

812
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
we have also

813
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
taught everyone to do

814
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
about 350 trials.

815
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So they did

816
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
a total of

817
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
30-40 minutes.

818
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The first thing we want to do

819
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
is to see

820
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
if there is a difference

821
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
in the performance of the

822
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
previous trial and the

823
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
subsequent trial.

824
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Compared with the

825
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
previous quarter trial

826
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and the subsequent quarter trial,

827
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
they are faster

828
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
in the subsequent quarter trial.

829
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
We found that

830
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
this may mean that

831
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
the difficulty of this task

832
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
has relatively

833
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
become lower

834
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
because they do better and better.

835
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
At this time,

836
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
let's look at

837
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
the first

838
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
quarter trial.

839
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Basically,

840
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
their performance

841
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
is very similar

842
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
to that of all

843
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
trials.

844
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
They will not be

845
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
interfered with

846
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
by

847
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
this

848
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
unconscious word.

849
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
In the subsequent

850
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
quarter trial,

851
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
we found that

852
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
the original interference

853
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
phenomenon

854
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
was produced

855
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
when we

856
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
saw the

857
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
interference

858
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
phenomenon

859
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
when we

860
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
read the

861
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
words.

862
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
At this time,

863
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
it conforms to

864
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
our assumption

865
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
that

866
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
when the

867
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
first

868
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
quarter trial

869
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
occurs,

870
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
the

871
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
second

872
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
quarter trial

873
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
occurs.

874
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The

875
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
combination of

876
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the two

877
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
experiments

878
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
at least

879
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
explains

880
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
one thing,

881
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
which is

882
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the

883
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
unconscious

884
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
prime

885
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
that

886
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
they can't

887
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
see,

888
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and

889
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
the

890
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
unconscious

891
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
target

892
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
that

893
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
they

894
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
are reacting

895
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
to.

896
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
When the

897
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
first

898
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
quarter trial

899
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
occurs,

900
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
they are

901
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
more likely

902
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
to be

903
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
interfered with

904
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
by

905
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
this

906
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
unconscious

907
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
word.

908
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
When the

909
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
second

910
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
quarter trial

911
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
occurs,

912
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
they are

913
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
more likely

914
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
to be

915
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
interfered with

916
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
by

917
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
this

918
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
unconscious

919
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
word.

920
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
When the

921
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
first

922
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
quarter trial

923
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
occurs,

924
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
they are

925
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
more likely

926
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
to be

927
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
interfered with

928
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
by

929
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
this

930
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
cold

931
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
object

932
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
or

933
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
subconscious

934
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
object.

935
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
When the

936
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
second

937
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
quarter trial

938
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
occurs,

939
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
they

940
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
are

941
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
more likely

942
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
to be

943
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
interfered with

944
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
by

945
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
this

946
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
unconscious

947
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
object before

948
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
the

949
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
first

950
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
trial.

951
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
In fact,

952
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
we call the

953
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
observer to pay

954
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
attention to the

955
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
meaning of the

956
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
word, so

957
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
we ask him to

958
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
pay attention to

959
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
the phenomenon

960
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
that we want

961
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
to see.

962
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That is a

963
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
speech interference

964
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
phenomenon.

965
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
These two

966
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
things are

967
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
consistent,

968
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
so we

969
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
say that

970
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
it is

971
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
cognitive

972
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
set

973
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
align or

974
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
task set

975
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
align.

976
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
On the

977
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
contrary,

978
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
when we

979
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
see this

980
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
phenomenon,

981
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
it is

982
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
likely that

983
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
it is not

984
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
a task

985
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
difficulty

986
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
adjustment,

987
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but a

988
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
different reason

989
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
for the

990
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
nature of

991
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
their

992
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
work.

993
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This

994
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
explanation

995
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
can also

996
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
explain

997
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
our

998
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
results.

999
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Another

1000
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
question you

1001
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
may ask

1002
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
is what

1003
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
is the

1004
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
consistency

1005
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
that

1006
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
causes

1007
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
their

1008
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
work

1009
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
to

1010
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
become

1011
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
slower or

1012
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
faster?

1013
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
We have

1014
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
just mentioned

1015
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that it is

1016
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
actually related to

1017
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the conflict

1018
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
between the

1019
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
meanings of

1020
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
the two

1021
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
words.

1022
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Another

1023
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
possibility is

1024
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
that our

1025
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
prime word

1026
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
is always

1027
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
blue and

1028
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
red,

1029
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and our

1030
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
target word

1031
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
is always

1032
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
blue and

1033
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
red.

1034
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Maybe it's

1035
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
related to

1036
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
the conflict

1037
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
between

1038
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
the two

1039
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
words.

1040
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
In order to

1041
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
solve these

1042
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
two problems

1043
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
at the same time,

1044
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
we did

1045
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
two things

1046
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
in the

1047
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
following two

1048
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
experiments.

1049
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
The first

1050
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
thing is that

1051
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
we replaced

1052
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
the target

1053
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
word with

1054
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
these two

1055
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
words,

1056
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Navy and

1057
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Scarlet.

1058
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
These two

1059
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
words still

1060
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
have a consistent

1061
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
or inconsistent

1062
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
relationship

1063
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
with the

1064
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
original

1065
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
word

1066
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
meaning.

1067
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
A very

1068
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
interesting phenomenon

1069
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
is that when we

1070
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
use these two

1071
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
words as

1072
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
target words,

1073
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
when we ask

1074
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
the user to

1075
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
read the

1076
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
color or

1077
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
read the

1078
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
words,

1079
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
their difficulty

1080
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
is completely

1081
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
reversed.

1082
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
At this time,

1083
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
when we

1084
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
ask him to

1085
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
read the

1086
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
color,

1087
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
he will not

1088
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
be disturbed

1089
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
by the

1090
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
color.

1091
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
This is actually

1092
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
also reported

1093
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
in the text

1094
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
file.

1095
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
In other

1096
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
words,

1097
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
in this

1098
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
experiment,

1099
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
if we

1100
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
find any

1101
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
interference,

1102
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
it will

1103
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
come from

1104
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
the word

1105
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
meaning.

1106
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
If we

1107
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
find interference

1108
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
coming from

1109
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
this new

1110
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
low-difficulty

1111
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
task,

1112
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
that is,

1113
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
the task of

1114
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
reading the

1115
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
color,

1116
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
it means that

1117
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
the important

1118
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
thing is

1119
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
the difficulty

1120
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
of the

1121
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
task.

1122
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
If the

1123
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
difficulty

1124
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
of the

1125
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
task is

1126
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
easy to

1127
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
be disturbed,

1128
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
it means that

1129
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
the important

1130
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
thing is that

1131
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
the thing

1132
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
done by the

1133
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
receiver is

1134
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
consistent with

1135
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
the interference

1136
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
we want to

1137
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
see,

1138
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
that is,

1139
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
the

1140
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Cognitive

1141
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Set is

1142
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
aligned.

1143
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
What do

1144
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
we find?

1145
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
We found

1146
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
no effect

1147
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
in the

1148
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
task of

1149
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
reading the

1150
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
word.

1151
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
This is a

1152
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
new,

1153
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
simple task.

1154
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
This is a

1155
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
simple task.

1156
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
In this case,

1157
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
without the

1158
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
effect,

1159
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
we found

1160
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
a very similar

1161
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
interference phenomenon

1162
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
as before.

1163
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
When the

1164
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
meaning of

1165
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
these two

1166
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
words is

1167
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
different,

1168
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
its reaction

1169
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
will be slower.

1170
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Through

1171
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
these two

1172
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
experiments,

1173
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
we can

1174
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
tell everyone

1175
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
that

1176
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000

alone

1180
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
can make

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
the receiver

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000

We can
