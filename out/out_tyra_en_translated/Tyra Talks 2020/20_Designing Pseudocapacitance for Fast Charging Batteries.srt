00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You can find the recording online a week and a half later.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you have any questions during this process,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you can leave a comment in the chat box.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We will have Q&A time at the end for everyone to ask questions.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's get started.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you everyone for listening to my presentation.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello everyone, I'm Lai Jun-Hai.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can call me Matt.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
First of all, I would like to thank Tyra for inviting me to share my research.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let me introduce myself.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm from Yonghe, Hsinchu.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I graduated from National University of China.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I worked as an engineer for a year and a half at BASF in Taiwan.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then I went to UCLA to study engineering.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I graduated in 2017.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I am currently working at Startup Battery Streak.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
At the same time, I am also a visiting scholar at UCLA.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My main work is focused on the development and mass production of new battery materials,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
as well as the transfer between the company and UCLA.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Today's topic is

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Designing pseudo-capacitance for fast-charging batteries.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That is, how to apply the mechanism of solid-state batteries to fast-charging batteries.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
First of all, why do we need fast-charging batteries?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The first motivation is the accumulation of electromagnetic traffic.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Charging stations are currently set up in three levels.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The first level is the plug-in that everyone puts at home.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It can charge 3 to 6 kilometers per hour.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The second level is the charging station in the parking lot.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It can charge 20 to 30 kilometers per hour.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The third level is the fastest Tesla charging station.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It can charge 5 kilometers per minute.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Interestingly, the current charging station is still far less than the gas station.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But it is almost impossible to see such a long queue at the charging station.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Not everyone has an electric car,

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but 5 kilometers per minute is still too slow compared to the time required for gas.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The second application of fast-charging batteries is the popularization of renewable energy.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
As of last year, renewable energy has reached one-third of the global power generation.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
50% of the power generation comes from renewable energy.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Other European countries also reach 20 to 30% of renewable power.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We all know that when wind and solar energy are converted into electricity,

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
they must be paired with suitable batteries.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
However, these batteries can't be charged quickly,

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
so they are inefficient.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
For example, when the wind speed is fast,

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
there will be a momentary large current.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The batteries that can't be charged at low power

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
will become waste heat and reduce the life of the battery.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So basically, this concept is the same as the concept of fast-charging batteries paired with aging cell phones.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The third application of fast-charging batteries is plant-based medical equipment.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Generally, the supply of such equipment is made up of a battery paired with a capacitor,

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
which is in the box at the bottom left.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Generally, the battery is used to monitor the function of low power for a long time,

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
while the capacitor is used to respond to high power in a short time.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Due to the limited size of the equipment and the need for different organ parts,

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
a single high-power battery is used to replace the two-in-one mode.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This has always been the trend in the development of this type of equipment power supply.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Of course, in addition to the above three applications,

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
there are other applications.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I won't go into detail here.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So in this main speech,

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
it mainly introduces how to improve the power density and energy density of the storage components using the materials of the capacitor.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
As shown in the picture on the left,

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the x-axis is the energy density,

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and the y-axis is the power density.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
First, I will briefly introduce the materials of the storage components and the techniques required for analysis.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then, the first part will start with the high-power supercapacitor material in blue.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then, the high-power characteristics will be achieved by using a non-oxidized carbonate residue.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The second part will start with the lithium battery.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Here is an example of fluorine,

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
L-NBOPF,

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
which achieves high power density by nanomerizing the battery material.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Generally, batteries or supercapacitors are basically composed of two terminals.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The positive terminal and the negative terminal are placed on the aluminum foil and copper foil respectively.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The two terminals are separated by a multi-hole separator,

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
which is the middle part of the separator,

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
to avoid short-circuit.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
When charging the battery, the lithium battery moves in the capacitor,

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and the battery material produces an oxidation reaction.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
At the same time, the battery moves in the external circuit to achieve the balance of the electric current.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The electric current is the main focus of our discussion today.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It is mainly composed of the storage material, carbon, and the high-voltage supercapacitor.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The electric current needs to have a certain vacuum.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It is like a sponge.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It must contain enough electrolysis.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
At the same time, it must have enough conductivity to be a high-voltage supercapacitor.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Although the structure of the battery and the capacitor are the same,

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the storage mechanism is completely different.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The mechanism of the capacitor is absorbed by the lithium.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In the external circuit, the aluminum foil and the copper foil are separated and absorbed by the surface of the battery.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because the lithium is absorbed by the surface for a short time,

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
this mechanism is most conducive to fast charging.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The disadvantage is that its surface area is limited,

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
so the density of energy is generally low.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In contrast, the storage method of the battery

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
uses the oxidation reaction inside the material.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In this case, the lithium can enter the material,

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and its energy is far greater than that of the capacitor.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
However, since the lithium moves very slowly inside the material,

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it is therefore unable to do high-speed charging.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Next, we will introduce how to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Basically, it is based on electrical chemistry analysis.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We will make the pre-analyzed material into an electrolyte

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and test it in the same electrolyte solution.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Generally, the device to be tested

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
has a single-phase electrolyte test on the upper left,

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and a double-phase torque battery test on the lower left.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There are two main methods of testing.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The first method is the cyclic voltammetry,

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
which is abbreviated as CV.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The principle is to change the speed of voltage change

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to measure the change in current.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The second method is the DC voltage test,

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
which is abbreviated as GC.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In the case of DC voltage charging,

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
it measures the change in voltage of the battery

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and makes a diagram of the voltage.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Now we use GC and CV to get the diagram

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They are two different storage mechanisms.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The capacitor on the left can be seen that

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the CV is a rectangle,

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
while the GC is basically a diagonal.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The battery on the right is composed of a set of peaks,

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
while the GC is mainly composed of a horizontal line.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Now that we know how to judge the material of the battery

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and the material of the capacitor,

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
we can look for the material of the fast charging battery.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What characteristics do we hope the fast charging battery has?

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We hope it has the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry on the left,

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
which allows it to be a fast charging battery.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It also has the characteristics of the material on the right,

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
which increases the density of energy

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
by storing energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is the material we are looking for.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The material of the capacitor

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
not only has a rectangle CV,

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but also a diagonal GC,

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and it stores energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Next, I will talk about the main character I will introduce today,

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
which is the T-Phased,

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Orphohombic Phased,

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
NB205.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Next, I will call it NIOVIA.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In addition to having the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry,

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
its energy density

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
is equivalent to the energy density of lithium carbon dioxide,

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
which is in the lithium-ion battery.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Its energy density is 10 times that of the capacitor.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Its power density,

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
which is the power of its fast charging,

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
can also reach 10 times that of the battery.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Its only drawback is that

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
it is still oxygen-chloride,

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
so its power consumption

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is the first topic we are going to fix.

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The first part

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is to mix carbon with NIOVIA

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
to improve the properties of NIOVIA.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We need to deduce a good NIOVIA,

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and we will eventually deduce

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
what kind of properties a good NIOVIA battery needs

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to show the characteristics of its lithium-ion battery.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A good NIOVIA battery

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
basically needs two parts.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The first is the high-voltage part,

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and the second is the part that can have a high pore density.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
In this study,

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
we mainly used three materials.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The first material is our protagonist, NIOVIA.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The second material is our chemical-capable

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Reduced Graphene Oxide, also known as RGO.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Its purpose is to provide short-term conductivity.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The third material

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is the one on the far right,

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Carbide Derived Carbon, also known as CDC.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It is a kind of carbon dioxide.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Its main purpose is that

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
it has a polypore structure

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and its size is in the micrometer level,

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
so it can provide long-term conductivity.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The way we prepare the battery

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is to first plant NIOVIA on RGO.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO with CDC

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
to get NIOVIA RGO CDC,

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
also known as NRC.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Finally, we make NRC

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
into a commercial-grade battery

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and test it to prove that

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it has a high-power and high-density

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
storage characteristics

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
at the right pore density.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This slide shows the details of the material equipment.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The main equipment is

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the water-heating method.

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We put the precursor

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
into the autoclave

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and heat it up to 180°C

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
for 12 hours.

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Next, we wash the particles

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and dry them.

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
After drying,

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
we heat it up to 500°C

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to get the body structure we want,

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
which is T-phase,

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
or ophiobic phase.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
with CDC.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The main purpose is to

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
make this composite material

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
in the form of surface electrolysis.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Next, we make it into a battery

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and test it.

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We have 20% NIOVIA,

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
40% NRC20,

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and 60% NRC20.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The BET on the right

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
is the analysis of the surface electrolysis.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It shows that

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the surface electrolysis of the material

220
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
increases with the

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
composition of the CDC.

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This means that

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
this composite method

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
does not cause the CDC to lose its surface area,

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
or the CDC to be less airtight,

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
or its structure to collapse.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Therefore, we can use

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
a simple ratio to

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
achieve the airtightness we need.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There are also two black dots on the picture.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
These two black dots

232
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
are where we directly plant NIOVIA

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
on the CDC.

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If we

235
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
do not use

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
this composite method

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
but use

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the water-heat method

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to directly plant it on the CDC,

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
at high temperature,

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the CDC's

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
surface area

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
will...

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Because the surface area is too large,

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
the surface area will decrease

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
at high temperature.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We want to use the CDC

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to improve the airtightness

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
of the electrode.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is the idea.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Next, we need to

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
use the CV to judge the electrode.

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's see if it is like a battery material

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
or an electric material.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
In the case of changing the minority,

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
we can get the corresponding current.

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Therefore, we use the current

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to make judgments with the change of the minority.

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If the

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
material is like a battery,

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the change of the current

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
will be multiplied by the minority.

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If the material

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
is like a capacitor,

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the current

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
will be multiplied by the minority.

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
In other words,

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
when the minority is doubled,

269
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the current will be doubled.

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Combining these two formulas,

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
we can get

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
the following formula

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
from the experiment.

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The current is equal to the magnitude

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
multiplied by the minority.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is called

277
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
B-value analysis.

278
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We want the material

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to be as fast as the capacitor.

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Therefore, we want the B-value

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to be as close to 1 as possible.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This proves that the material

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
can do high-speed charging.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Next,

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the NRC

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
can store different

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
current

288
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
at different speeds.

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
On the left,

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
we use the minority

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to burn the NRC.

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The lowest value

293
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
is 100% Cdc.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The way

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
we control the minority

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
is from the slowest 30-minute

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
charging point on the left to the

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
90-second charging point on the right.

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The y-axis is the energy generated by me.

300
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
As time goes by,

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
the energy generated by me

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
will be reduced.

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We want the line to be as flat as possible.

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This means that the material

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
can do high-speed charging

306
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
as well as low-speed charging.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The lowest value is 100% Cdc.

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
As the amount of niobia increases,

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the density of the NRC

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
will also increase.

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Up to 40%, the increased current

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
will not be affected by the minority.

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
From 0% to 20% to 40%,

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the current will remain as flat.

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Up to 60%,

316
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
from the NRC 60,

317
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
we can see that

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
the current is lower than

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
40% at 90 seconds.

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The highest value is 100%.

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Although the amount of

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
niobia is

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
higher than 40%,

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
we can expect that

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
according to the trend,

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
when the charging time is less than 90 seconds,

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the NRC 40 will increase.

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
On the right is the B-value

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
introduced in the previous page.

330
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
When the curve

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
is closer to 1,

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
we mainly do CV

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
for different materials.

334
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Then we do the

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
B-value analysis.

336
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The result of the analysis is in the lower right corner.

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When the curve is closer to 1,

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
it means that the charging speed is faster.

339
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
By this, we can judge

340
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that the charging speed of

341
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
NRC 40 is faster than

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
NRC 60 and 100% niobia.

343
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This also proves that

344
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
when there is 60% CVC

345
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
stored in the electrode,

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the electrode has sufficient airtightness

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
to accommodate sufficient electrolysis

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to show the characteristics of

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
niobia lithium-ion battery.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Finally,

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
we combine the NRC 40

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
with the traditional lithium-ion electrode

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
to form a full electrode

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to do

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
CV and GC analysis.

356
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In terms of CV,

357
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
we can get

358
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the characteristics of lithium-ion,

359
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
which is a rectangular CV.

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
In terms of the

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
GC,

362
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
we also get a

363
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
oblique GC.

364
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
At the same time,

365
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
because of the combination of niobia,

366
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
we not only

367
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
increase the energy density

368
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
at low power,

369
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
but also increase the energy density

370
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
at high power.

371
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
At the power of

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
3000W per kg,

373
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
we can store

374
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
up to 23W

375
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
per kg of energy density.

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Next,

377
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I will use the picture on the right to summarize.

378
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The first part

379
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
is that we use the amount of Cdc

380
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to adjust the airtightness and

381
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
electrolysis of the NRC composite material.

382
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
At the same time,

383
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
the electrode has high energy

384
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and fast charge characteristics.

385
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
In other words,

386
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
we use Cdc as the starting point

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to mix different niobia

388
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
to increase its energy density.

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
By maximizing airtightness and electrolysis,

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
we can increase

391
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the overall

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
energy density of the electrode

393
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and preserve

394
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the high power characteristics of Cdc.

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The second part

396
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I want to share is

397
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the LNVOPF material

398
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
as a medical equipment energy supply application.

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Speaking of medical equipment energy supply,

400
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I will use

401
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
an implantable

402
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
cardioverter

403
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
defibrillator

404
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
ICD

405
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
as an example.

406
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Its Chinese name is

407
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
implantable defibrillator.

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It basically

409
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
detects your heart beat.

410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
When your heart beats abnormally,

411
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
it will use

412
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
high current to stimulate your heart beat.

413
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
For example,

414
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
when your heart stops beating,

415
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it will stimulate your heart beat.

416
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I am not a medical background,

417
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
so I only understand

418
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the basic concept of this device.

419
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The main usage method

420
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
is still left to the doctor.

421
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
ICD

422
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
mainly uses

423
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
high current and low current output.

424
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The low current part

425
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
is mainly responsible for the battery.

426
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The high current part

427
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
is responsible for the circuit board.

428
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There is also a device size

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
at the bottom.

430
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The size is about one-fourth of the heart.

431
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Most of the area

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
is actually from the low-voltage circuit.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Another

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
medical device

435
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
is

436
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
DBS

437
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Deep Brain Stimulator.

438
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Deep Brain Stimulator.

439
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This type of device

440
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
has the same principle,

441
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
but the current demand

442
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
is smaller than ICD.

443
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
DBS mainly stimulates

444
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the brain nerve.

445
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
DBS mainly stimulates

446
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
the brain nerve.

447
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
DBS mainly stimulates

448
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
the brain nerve.

449
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The power supply

450
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
is also made up of

451
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
a battery and a circuit.

452
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
When we want to

453
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
put this medical device

454
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
in the body,

455
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
we hope that

456
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
its size can be smaller and better

457
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
to save more space.

458
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
When we find the material,

459
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
it has the characteristics

460
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
of a battery and a circuit.

461
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So,

462
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
we can use a single device

463
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
to make a circuit

464
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
or a battery.

465
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We prefer the battery

466
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
because the battery size is smaller.

467
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
A single storage device

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
will provide the supply of

469
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the current.

470
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We can save more

471
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the power supply

472
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
of medical equipment.

473
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This material

474
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
is

475
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
L-NBOPF.

476
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
NBOPF

477
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
comes from

478
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
NASKON,

479
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
which is a transformer.

480
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
When it is mixed,

481
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the voltage

482
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
of this material

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
will increase

484
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
with time.

485
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
This means it can store more energy.

486
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And

487
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
when I

488
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
use it,

489
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
the voltage

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
will

491
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
decrease

492
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
with time.

493
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
This means

494
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the material

495
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
will last longer.

496
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The storage density

497
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
is the same as

498
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
the lithium carbon dioxide

499
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
in the battery.

500
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Most importantly,

501
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
this material has

502
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
the characteristics of a battery

503
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and a circuit.

504
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Next,

505
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
we will introduce another way

506
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
to distinguish a battery from a circuit.

507
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We will use X-ray

508
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
diffraction

509
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
to judge

510
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
whether the material

511
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is

512
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
changing

513
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
with the

514
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
structure of the crystal.

515
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is what we call

516
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
X-ray diffraction.

517
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
X-ray diffraction

518
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
occurs when the battery is charged.

519
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
X-ray diffraction

520
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
occurs when the battery is charged.

521
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
X-ray diffraction

522
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
occurs when the battery is charged.

523
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Let's analyze

524
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
NBOPF.

525
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
NBOPF has two peaks

526
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
that are opposite to each other.

527
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The peak at low voltage

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
is parallel.

529
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The peak at high voltage

530
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is not parallel.

531
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This means that

532
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the material can be used

533
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
as a battery at low voltage

534
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and as a circuit at high voltage.

535
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
However,

536
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
this is not that simple.

537
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The material

538
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is charged twice

539
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
per hour

540
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let me introduce

541
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
a little bit.

542
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
When we talk about charging,

543
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
we use a unit called C-ray.

544
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We use a unit called C-ray.

545
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
C-ray

546
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
has several Cs.

547
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
This means that it can charge several times

548
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
in an hour.

549
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
When this material

550
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
charges twice per hour,

551
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
when this material charges twice per hour,

552
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
which is the part of 2C,

553
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it can store

554
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
80-90% of the power.

555
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
However,

556
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
when you shorten the charging time

557
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
to 3 minutes,

558
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
it can only charge 8%.

559
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The reason is that

560
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
during the charging process,

561
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
it will charge the battery first.

562
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Then it will charge the capacitor.

563
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
However, the charging speed of the battery

564
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
is too slow,

565
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
so I can't even charge the capacitor.

566
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So,

567
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
it's a bit like this.

568
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The main reason is that the charging speed of the battery

569
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
is too slow,

570
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
resulting in a decrease

571
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
in the overall charging speed.

572
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What we are going to do next

573
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
is to

574
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
use the material

575
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
as a nanometer

576
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
to shorten the time

577
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and distance

578
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
of the particles in the material

579
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to increase the charging speed

580
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
of the material.

581
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Next,

582
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
we are going to synthesize

583
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
this nanometer NVOPF

584
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and discuss the size

585
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and characteristics of fast charging.

586
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
First,

587
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the way we make it is

588
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
to put all the materials

589
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
in the

590
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
solvent thermal

591
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
to synthesize.

592
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We also put it in the pressure suit.

593
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Then,

594
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
after 12 hours,

595
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
after 185°C,

596
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
we take the material out

597
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and clean it.

598
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We will dry it.

599
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Next, we use

600
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
XRD, X-Ray Diffraction, to confirm the material.

601
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
After confirming that

602
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
there is no problem with the material

603
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and there is no impurities in it,

604
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
we will make an electrode

605
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
for electromagnetic testing.

606
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Here,

607
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
we can get

608
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
different types of

609
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
NVOPF

610
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
based on

611
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
the ratio of the material

612
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and the temperature of the synthesis.

613
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Basically, NVOPF

614
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
is a rectangular body.

615
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
We usually get

616
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
brick-shaped

617
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and if it is longer,

618
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
it becomes rod.

619
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If it is shorter,

620
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
it becomes pellet.

621
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We will discuss

622
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the shape of the

623
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
NVOPF

624
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and the impact of its size

625
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
on its reaction rate.

626
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Next,

627
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
we will use bValue

628
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
to analyze

629
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
the properties of the fast charge.

630
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
In the first step,

631
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
we make different

632
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
cVs for the material.

633
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
From these four peaks,

634
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
we can get

635
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
individual bValue.

636
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Then, we make

637
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
bValue with different

638
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
aspect ratio

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and its size

640
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
to see

641
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
how it changes.

642
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
On the left is

643
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
the NVOPF pellet.

644
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
On the right,

645
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
we change

646
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
the rod

647
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
to reduce

648
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
the aspect ratio

649
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
to the brick

650
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and the pellet.

651
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
We can see that

652
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
the bValue

653
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
decreases as the aspect ratio decreases.

654
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
This means that

655
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
when we decrease the aspect ratio,

656
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the characteristics of the fast charge

657
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
will be more and more like the current.

658
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It can become

659
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
the material

660
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
for the fast charge.

661
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
On the other hand,

662
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
we also

663
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
compare the

664
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
particle size

665
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to the bValue.

666
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We combine

667
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the microns

668
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and microns

669
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
to reduce the nanometers.

670
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The nanometers

671
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
are reduced to a few tens of nanometers.

672
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We can see that

673
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
when the size decreases,

674
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
the bValue also increases.

675
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The increase in bValue means

676
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
that the smaller the particle,

677
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the more suitable it is

678
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
for the fast charge.

679
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The more suitable it is

680
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
for the fast charge.

681
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The focus here is

682
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
on the microbrick.

683
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Its peak bValue

684
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
is close to 0.5.

685
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
0.5 means that it is

686
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
like a battery.

687
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
When we make a nanoparticle,

688
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
all of its

689
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
oxidation-reduction reactions

690
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
have a bValue

691
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
of 0.7 or higher.

692
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Next,

693
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we will do a charge-electric charge test.

694
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The nanoparticle

695
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
of the microbrick

696
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
can charge up to 90%

697
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
in 2 hours.

698
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
in 2 hours.

699
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This means that

700
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
the bValue of the

701
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
NBOPF

702
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
has increased

703
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
significantly

704
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
after the nanoparticle

705
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
has been nanoparticle.

706
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The bValue of the

707
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
bValue of the

708
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
bValue of the

709
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
bValue of

710
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
bValue of

711
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
bValue of

712
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
bValue of

713
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
bValue of

714
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
bValue of

715
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
bValue of

716
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
bValue of

717
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
bValue of

718
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
bValue of

719
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
bValue of

720
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
bValue of

721
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
bValue of

722
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
bValue of

723
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
bValue of

724
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
bValue of

725
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
bValue of

726
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
bValue of

730
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
bValue of

731
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
bValue of

732
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
bValue of

733
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
bValue of

734
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
bValue of

735
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
bValue of

736
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
bValue of

737
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
bValue of

bValue of

757
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
bValue of

758
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
bValue of

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
bValue of

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
bValue of

802
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
cV meters

803
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
compared to the current specifications

804
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
our current current

805
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
is greater than

806
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
greater than these functions

807
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
greater than these specifications

808
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
our frequency

809
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
because of the device

810
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
on the device

811
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
we can only measure

812
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
a few microseconds

813
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
so we only measured

814
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
50Hz

815
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
50Hz

816
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
also covers some

817
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
function frequency

818
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
next

819
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I will use this graph

820
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
to make a brief summary

821
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the second part

822
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
we use nanoparticle

823
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
to convert this

824
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
NBOPF

825
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
to fast charge

826
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
in addition

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
we also proved

828
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
the feasibility of

829
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
NBOPF

830
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
finally

831
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I will make a brief summary

832
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
what is

833
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the so-called

834
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Taekwondo Message

835
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
first, I hope everyone

836
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
knows what is a nanoparticle

837
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
nanoparticle

838
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
is actually a storage mechanism

839
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
it has the power of the nanoparticle

840
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and the density of the battery

841
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and

842
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the second point

843
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
is how we can judge a nanoparticle

844
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
of course, through

845
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
the method of electromagnetic

846
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
we have such a CV

847
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
we have such a oblique

848
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
GC

849
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and in the process of my oxygenation

850
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the material did not change

851
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
finally

852
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
how do we design a nanoparticle

853
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
mainly

854
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
here I demo three points

855
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
the first is

856
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the first is the conductivity

857
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and the airtightness

858
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I control the conductivity and airtightness of my electrode

859
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
to make my

860
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
NBOPF optimized

861
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
the second

862
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
is to make the material nanoparticle

863
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and adjust its phase change

864
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
to make our general battery material

865
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
it is not affected

866
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
by

867
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
the transfer of ions

868
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
too slow

869
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
let it

870
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
in the part of the battery

871
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
can reach the high speed charge point

872
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
the effect

873
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
thank you

874
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
thank you

875
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
if you have any questions

876
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
please let me know

877
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
thank you

878
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
thank you Matt

879
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
now we can

880
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
start the Q&A

881
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
in the chat box

882
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
there are some questions

883
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
do you want to unmute

884
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and ask your question

885
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I want to ask

886
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
what is the electrolyte used

887
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
when you start to make your battery

888
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
it should be organic electrolyte

889
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
right

890
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
yes

891
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I use

892
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
LIPF-6

893
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
ECDMC

894
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
the general

895
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
electrolyte used

896
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
so we can understand

897
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
why the lowest voltage

898
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
should be around 1.2V

899
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
another question

900
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
what is the

901
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
diagonal direction of

902
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the nitrogen oxide

903
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
nitrogen oxide

904
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
not supercapacitor

905
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
it should be

906
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
interesting

907
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
or important

908
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
basically

909
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
the diagonal direction

910
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
is between

911
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
1.2V to

912
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
1.2V to 3V

913
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
this is

914
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
here

915
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
here

916
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the diagonal direction

917
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
is 1.2V to

918
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
1.2V to 2.5V

919
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
this is

920
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the nitrogen oxide

921
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
the capacity

922
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
should be

923
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
200

924
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
from 1.2V to

925
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
2.5V

926
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
90% of the voltage

927
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
comes from here

928
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
it means

929
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
when it is below 1.2V

930
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
2.5V will be disconnected

931
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
when it is below 1.2V

932
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the electrolyte will be disconnected

933
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the material will not be disconnected

934
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
when it is above 2.5V

935
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you can't see

936
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
the current

937
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
the current will be

938
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
close to 0

939
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
like this picture

940
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
sorry

941
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
the CV is the same

942
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
it will be

943
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
no current

944
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
basically no current

945
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
ok

946
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
you just showed this slide

947
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
so I want to ask the following question

948
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
how do you calculate the B-value

949
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and the voltage graph in the lower right corner

950
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
now we have

951
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
different CVs

952
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
each CV

953
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
has a current

954
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
in each voltage

955
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
so every current

956
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
will be analyzed

957
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
for the change

958
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
does the B-value have to use the peak current

959
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
or does it have to be any current

960
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
so today in pseudo-capacitance

961
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
pseudo-capacitance

962
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
basically

963
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
it has many

964
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
continuous

965
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
redox reactions

966
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
so when you produce a box

967
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
you can't

968
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
only analyze

969
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
the peak current

970
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
you are not fair to

971
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
the other currents

972
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
so

973
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
basically

974
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
in pseudo-capacitance

975
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
you can use this formula

976
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
on all the voltage graphs

977
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
to draw the continuous curve

978
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
another story

979
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
behind this

980
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
is that the redox

981
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
happens below 2V

982
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
so it doesn't have redox

983
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
so what do you see

984
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
you see EDLC

985
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
what does EDLC mean

986
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
EDLC is the

987
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
reaction rate

988
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
on the surface of the electrode

989
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
so EDLC

990
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
from the electrode

991
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
far away

992
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
to the surface of the electrode

993
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
what do you mean by diffusion control

994
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
yes

995
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
so here we increase

996
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
the density of Cdc

997
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
so the vacuum of the electrode

998
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
increases

999
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
so when there is no redox

1000
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
the kinetics

1001
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
increases

1002
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
so when there is

1003
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
redox

1004
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the kinetics increases

1005
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
any other questions

1006
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
ok thank you

1007
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
the last one is later

1008
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
so if you have any questions

1009
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I will ask later

1010
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
any other

1011
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
questions

1012
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
hello

1013
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
hello

1014
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I want to ask Matt

1015
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
some questions

1016
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
please

1017
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Matt thank you for your speech

1018
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
my main question is

1019
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
on your first project

1020
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
you were doing

1021
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I want to ask

1022
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
how big is the particle size

1023
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
of Nairobia

1024
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
the particle size is

1025
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
here

1026
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
you can see on the upper right

1027
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
the size is

1028
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
20-30 nm

1029
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
20-30 nm

1030
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
so you

1031
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
reduce graphene oxide

1032
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and Cdc

1033
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to increase

1034
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the conductivity of short-circuit and long-circuit

1035
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
yes

1036
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Cdc also provides the vacuum

1037
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
ok

1038
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I was doing research on

1039
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
hierarchical porous carbons

1040
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and

1041
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
there are small

1042
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
micropores

1043
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and big macropores

1044
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
so I was thinking

1045
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
if you combine

1046
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
other porous materials

1047
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
does it increase the

1048
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
potential of the capacitor

1049
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
yes

1050
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
because

1051
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I have enough porosity

1052
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
my particles

1053
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
can be

1054
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I can

1055
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
absorb more electrolyte

1056
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
so I can

1057
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
there is a slide

1058
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I didn't show

1059
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
because I have some time

1060
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
so you can see

1061
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
why Nairobia

1062
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
needs big porosity

1063
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
basically

1064
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
it comes from

1065
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
ok

1066
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
basically this slide

1067
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I was doing different

1068
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
this is the result from consul

1069
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
so

1070
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
basically it comes from Nernst equation

1071
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and Poisson

1072
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
equation

1073
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Poisson equation represents

1074
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
how much

1075
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
the dielectric constant is

1076
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
so under different voltage

1077
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
how many particles are on the surface

1078
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
so when the voltage

1079
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
moves to

1080
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
in the middle of the graph

1081
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
basically

1082
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
it represents

1083
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
how many particles are on the surface

1084
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
but when it

1085
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
moves to

1086
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
below a certain level

1087
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Nairobia starts to react

1088
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I need a lot of

1089
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
particles to enter the material

1090
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
so when it needs a lot of particles

1091
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
to enter the material

1092
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
it will cause the surface porosity

1093
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the surface porosity

1094
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
is the reason why

1095
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Nairobia's kinetics

1096
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
so

1097
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
this is the reason why

1098
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
this material needs

1099
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
high porosity

1100
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
so that

1101
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
it can maintain

1102
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
the characteristics of the dielectric

1103
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
or the characteristics

1104
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
of the dielectric

1105
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I want to

1106
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
follow up

1107
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
how did you come up with

1108
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
reducing graphene oxide

1109
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
plus Cdc

1110
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
reducing graphene oxide

1111
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
has another advantage

1112
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
on the synthesis

1113
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
basically if you want to

1114
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
grow oxide

1115
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
graphene oxide

1116
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
the ligand of oxygen

1117
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
can be the nucleation site

1118
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
of these synthesis

1119
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
no matter if you want to grow metal particles

1120
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
or oxide particles

1121
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
basically it can easily grow on top

1122
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
because it has a lot of sites

1123
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
the particles you grow

1124
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
are small

1125
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
so

1126
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
graphene oxide

1127
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
is like an additive

1128
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
it can make your particle size very small

1129
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
second, it also increases

1130
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
the conductivity

1131
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
for graphene oxide

1132
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
there are several ways

1133
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
for example, you do filtration

1134
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
you filter it

1135
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
it is

1136
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
a two-dimensional structure

1137
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
so when you do filtration

1138
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
when you do filtration

1139
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
it will become

1140
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
a very dense electrode

1141
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
if it is very dense

1142
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
the electrode can't get in

1143
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
so we want to

1144
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
find a structure

1145
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
like Cdc

1146
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
this

1147
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
structure

1148
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
of graphene oxide

1149
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
to mix in

1150
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
but we don't want to mix too much

1151
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
because

1152
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
the density of the energy

1153
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
is relatively low

1154
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I understand, thank you

1155
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
any other questions?

1156
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
if not

1157
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I will ask my last question

1158
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
after talking about ZMath

1159
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I mentioned

1160
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
how to distinguish

1161
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
between solid electrolyte and

1162
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
solid electrolyte

1163
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
but now

1164
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
there is a popular topic

1165
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
solid electrolyte

1166
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
or solid electrolyte

1167
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I want to see

1168
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
the difference between

1169
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
solid electrolyte and

1170
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
other two

1171
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
how to distinguish

1172
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
how to judge

1173
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
actually

1174
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I didn't do the

1175
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
because I talked about

1176
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
the second topic

1177
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
solid electrolyte

1178
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
yes, it was

1179
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
solid electrolyte

1180
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
but we took it

1181
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
basically

1182
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
we just changed its structure

1183
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
then we took it as an electrolyte

1184
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
basically

1185
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
solid electrolyte

1186
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
yes

1187
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I don't know much about this

1188
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
what I know about solid electrolyte

1189
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
is

1190
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
its conductivity

1191
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
it must be very thin

1192
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
because its conductivity is not as fast as liquid

1193
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
although it is solid electrolyte

1194
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
but it is not as fast as liquid

1195
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
another thing

1196
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
everyone says

1197
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
solid electrolyte

1198
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
it doesn't

1199
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
we can

1200
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
avoid the SEI reaction

1201
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but actually

1202
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
this is a loss

1203
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
actually solid electrolyte

1204
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
in its first cycle

1205
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
its SEI

1206
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
has a big impact

1207
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
in our group

1208
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
in addition to high-speed charge

1209
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
another part is

1210
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
3D battery

1211
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
3D battery is

1212
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
the structure of the battery

1213
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
to make it a satellite battery

1214
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
that part

1215
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
in solid electrolyte

1216
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
of course we want to use solid electrolyte

1217
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
because solid electrolyte

1218
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
its density

1219
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
is much higher than liquid

1220
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
so we can save a lot of liquid

1221
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
needed volume

1222
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but they found that in the first cycle

1223
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
this SEI

1224
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
actually still occurs

1225
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and after it occurs

1226
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
because it is solid

1227
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
so it is very difficult to solve

1228
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
basically your material

1229
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
at first it is a tight connection

1230
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
it will separate

1231
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
thank you

1232
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
anyone else have questions?

1233
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
if no questions

1234
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Max, do you have your email?

1235
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
yes

1236
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I put it in the last slide

1237
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
if you have any questions

1238
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
you can

1239
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
email me

1240
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
thank you

1241
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
for coming

1242
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and thank you Max

1243
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
for giving us such a wonderful speech

1244
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
this recording

1245
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
you can watch it again

1246
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
in a week

1247
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and you can continue

1248
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
to discuss with Max

1249
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
related research

1250
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
so I will stop recording now
