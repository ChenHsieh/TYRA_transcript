00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's 9.19 Taira Talk. I am the host today, Hong Shi-an.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We are very honored to invite Liao Kun-yan to speak for us today.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Liao Kun-yan is currently a Ph.D. student in the Materials Engineering Department at Tokyo University.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Previously, he obtained a master's and master's degree from the German University of Munich.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He is mainly interested in electronic microscope and neutron scattering material analysis technology.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He is mainly interested in the structure of inorganic glass, the high-angle crystal, and the origin-density spectrum.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Today, he is going to talk about EELS, Electron Energy Low Spectroscopy.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's give him a round of applause to welcome him to give us today's talk.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Everyone, please turn on your microphones.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We'll leave the time to you.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll start now.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The topic of my talk today is EELS.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to talk about why it is thought to be a synchrotron in electronic microscopes.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In addition to the introduction just now, let me introduce the department I am in now.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Our department is a department that attaches great importance to electronic microscopes.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We have about 20 electronic microscopes in our department.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We have about four or more electronic microscopes.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Our field includes instrument development, ceramic interface, crystal defects, and quasicrystal crystal.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Our department specializes in EELS and DFT calculation.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In order not to be the same as them, we specialize in non-static, liquid, and gas.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In the past, we have done a lot of liquid and gas EELS.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But this is a special instrument, so I won't talk about it in this talk.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My own research is that I am very interested in glass.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In addition to the fact that most of the glass you see on this screen is transparent and well-balanced material,

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
if you look at the inside of the glass from a nanometer perspective,

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
it may have a very small domain.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is because of the domain caused by its phase separation.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It will also cause it to have different shapes and colors.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It will have different structures and textures.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My first year is mainly to study this.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Today's talk will also talk about some.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This year, my own theme is to adjust to the dopan in the glass.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Is the dopan in the glass a cluster or a particle?

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Or is it a dopan that is separated from one atom by one atom?

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What impact does it have on the quality of the glass?

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is my own theme.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I won't talk about this today.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Another thing I will mention is that I have measured the thermal expansion coefficient of some crystal surfaces.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I may have a chance to mention it today.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is related to optical characteristics and PLASMO.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will mention it later.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Basically, this is the outline of today's speech.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I will first tell you why we want to make electronic microscope.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How do we see the origin?

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Finally, I will talk about EOS.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It may take a lot of time in the first half.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
After all, I'm not sure what the audience's background is.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So I will talk about what the electronic microscope is doing.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Basically, all microscopes, no matter what particle you use,

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The earliest microscope should be the optical microscope invented by Hucke in 1665.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hucke is the most familiar with its spring, Huckelo.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But in fact, he also did a lot of things.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
One of them is the optical microscope.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then he went through a very simple observation of what the cells and insects look like.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then he drew it down and got some new knowledge from it.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But this is in 1665.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Of course, for the people at the time, this may be a very incredible research.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Then he really told us a lot of things.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But if you only have optical microscopes,

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In fact, it is not enough today.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The reason is that if you only have optical microscopes,

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You won't know what happened to us this year.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That is, if you don't have an electronic microscope,

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In fact, you can't see the virus.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then you can't see the coronavirus.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You won't know what happened this year.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This photo is from the Institute of Health in the United States.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Photos of the coronavirus, electronic microscope photos.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then the one on the right is the structure of the virus.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Photos of the electronic microscope.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It was also published this year.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The electronic microscope seems to have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It is also a very popular field.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But I won't mention it because I'm doing it completely.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So we won't discuss the electronic microscope today.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But it is also a powerful tool.

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So seeing this kind of small-scale thing,

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It is an advantage that makes electronic microscopes unique.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So if you look at it from the perspective of a microscope,

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because what I learned myself is material science.

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Material science is a very complicated subject.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The reason is that it is a cross-level problem.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
For example, I used to do metal materials.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Suppose you want to design a metal material.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You have to consider a lot of things.

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have to consider what happens to its surface at the level of a microscope.

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is there a crack?

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You have to find out how many phases are there in the material.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What is its texture?

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is there any adsorption?

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Finally, return to the characteristics of the metal material.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
To deal with such a problem,

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In fact, we need a lot of different tools in different systems.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
For example, if we need EBSD for the level of a microscope,

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We need some mechanical tools to measure.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
At the level of a microscope, we need high-resolution TEM.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Even if you need a very high-resolution spectrum like AtomPROP

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
To confirm your chemical composition.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
On the other hand, if you are doing simulation,

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You will find that the people of mechanics

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The most important simulation they do is called Finite Element Method.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Finite Element Method simulates some of the characteristics of mechanics.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But in the Finite Element Method,

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You still have to have physical properties.

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So you have to do some molecular mechanics,

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Modicaro, and even DFT, Programme Mechanics.

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So simply put,

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If you really want to fully understand material science,

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You have to have all of these things.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
In comparison, the level of a microscope

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In fact, the knowledge we currently have in technology

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In fact, it is already very sufficient.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Basically, there is nothing you don't know.

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Most of the problems on the level of a microscope can be solved.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But at the level of a microscope,

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We will have a lot of difficulties just measuring.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's why I want to talk about this today.

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
In particular,

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If you look at it from a physical point of view,

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In fact, we deal with these problems.

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There is a tool called Large-Scale Facility.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That just happens to be STEM, Singleton Radiation, and Neutron Source.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have done these three experiments.

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I also want to briefly talk about their differences.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
In general, Taiwan currently has the middle one and the left one.

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Some universities in Taiwan have the left one.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The middle one is Neutron Radiation.

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Taiwan's Neutron Source.

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It is the third generation of Neutron Radiation.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It is also a very powerful method.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There is a big difference between them.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
In addition to the type of radiation you use,

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This one uses electrons, this one uses light, and this one uses neutrons.

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Their sample duration is actually very different.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
For example, if you look at a microscope,

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The property you get, the amount you get,

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Or the area you observe,

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's actually a very small range.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Simply put, there is a saying,

141
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
See the tree but not the forest.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can only see the tree, but you ignore the forest.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
A microscope is a bit like looking at a tree.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So your resolution is around nanometers.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's great.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But if you want to go to a higher resolution,

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In fact, Neutron Radiation is a more suitable tool.

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Because what you see in your Neutron,

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The size of your crystal sample is about micrometers.

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If you want to study more industrial problems,

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
To the size of millimeters, centimeters, or even meters,

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Neutron Radiation is a very good choice.

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Because you can put a centimeter sample in.

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
When I was at Muniher,

155
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
At that time, there were some BinLine.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Muniher is the headquarters of BMW.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They can put a whole car engine

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Put it in the BinLine of Neutron Radiation.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
To see some images of its engine.

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
In addition to the sample size,

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Its interaction with matter is also very different.

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Neutron, whether you are magnetic radiation or nuclear scattering,

163
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's all very weak.

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It doesn't destroy your sample.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But electrons are easy to destroy.

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Or change your sample.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This is also something we need to pay attention to.

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If you say so,

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There is a big difference.

170
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The middle and the far right,

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They are all user facilities.

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That is, you don't need to know anyone in there.

173
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You just need to apply for your project.

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If your project passes, you can do the experiment.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Even if you have nothing to do with it.

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But it's a pity that in the electronic microscope,

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
In fact, there are not so many user facilities.

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So most electronic microscopes are still owned by a small number of people.

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If you want to do a similar experiment,

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You have to know someone.

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There are some user facilities.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
At the end of the speech, we will tell everyone.

183
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If you want to do it, you don't know anyone.

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can go there and do it.

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It will be put at the end of the speech.

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What kind of user facilities can be used?

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
In fact, people in the past have never thought about

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
To turn electronic microscopes into

189
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Such a public instrument such as neodymium magnets or copper radiation.

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
One of the reasons is because

191
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Electronic microscopes were not so powerful at the time.

192
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It can't do so many things.

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But recently, it can really do a lot of things.

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If you are interested, you can look at this paper.

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why neodymium magnets in electronic microscopes

196
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It really causes electronic microscopes to become a single-chrome radiation.

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If you are interested, you can refer to it.

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The biggest problem I want to talk about today is

199
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Between me and the audience

200
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Maybe a lot of people have different views on electronic microscopes.

201
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Of course, some people have similar views.

202
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If you are from the Microscopic Society, you may have a closer view.

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The first thing I want to talk about is

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How do we see atoms?

205
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
In fact, this topic has won awards in 2011 and 2020.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wolf Prize, Cavalier Prize, and Nano Prize

207
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I showed a picture here.

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It is a high-resolution TEM image.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Its material is iron.

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Iron is a popular topic.

211
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you don't know much about electronic microscopes,

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think you can ask three questions.

213
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I want to answer these three questions in the next section.

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The first thing is how to see such an image.

215
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you have the opportunity to use an electronic microscope,

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Is it easy or difficult to see such an image?

217
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This is the first question.

218
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The second question is if you observe this image

219
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If you look at its atoms, it will have yellow, orange, and blue atoms.

220
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If you look at the left and right, you will find that the orange atom is at the top of the blue atom.

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The orange atom is at the bottom of the blue atom on the right.

222
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You will find that we can observe the deviation of several atoms.

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The second question is how do I know which atom represents which element?

224
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What kind of atom is the image it sees?

225
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
How do we distinguish the atoms?

226
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This is the second question.

227
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The third question is what is not in such an image.

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The information in such an image is the electrical field and magnetic field.

229
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If there is an electronic microscope,

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I can't see the electrical field and magnetic field with the latest electronic microscope.

231
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This is the third question I want to answer.

232
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Let me give you a brief introduction.

233
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Electronic microscopes are very different from optical microscopes.

234
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But the structure is basically the same.

235
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You have a light source.

236
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is an electron.

237
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You have a condenser lens.

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The only difference is that the optical microscope on the left is a glass lens.

239
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The electron on the right is a conductive electron.

240
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So you use a magnetic lens to focus on the electron.

241
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There is also a sample.

242
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There is also a fog lens.

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There is also a projection lens.

244
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So the simplest way to understand is that the electronic microscope is an optical microscope.

245
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Just use the electron as a light source.

246
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If you understand this way,

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
In fact, most things can be solved.

248
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because most people should have encountered optical microscopes.

249
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The only difference is that you need a large electronic microscope.

250
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It needs high vacuum.

251
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But in addition, you can really use it as an optical microscope.

252
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Of course, electrons and substances have different effects.

253
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The biggest reason why I use electronic microscopes is

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
In fact, the wavelength of electrons is much smaller than that of normal visible light.

255
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you have studied physics and are familiar with light, you may know that there is a formula called Abbey Diffraction Limit.

256
00:17:42,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Basically, what he is talking about is that no matter how small the light is, the resolution will still be limited to the wavelength.

257
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is a physical limit.

258
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The maximum resolution is your wavelength divided by 2.

259
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Of course, this limit was broken in 2011 by the Super Resolution Optical Microscope.

260
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But in general, this is the limit of optical microscopes.

261
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If you look at this formula, you can intuitively see that if you want to improve your Abbey Diffraction Limit,

262
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You have to find a way to make your wavelength smaller.

263
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The reason why I use electrons is actually because of the resources.

264
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because when you apply a very strong electric field, the wavelength of electrons can be very small.

265
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,000
For example, if you apply 300 kV, your electronic wavelength can be up to 1 picometer.

266
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
In principle, you should be able to see the resolution of 1 picometer.

267
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But this is actually wrong.

268
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Then I will explain why this is wrong.

269
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But the basic concept is that the reason you use electrons is because the electromagnetic wavelength is very short.

270
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then it can help you see things more clearly.

271
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Why is it wrong?

272
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's because our lens is actually not perfect.

273
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There is something called Spherical Aberration Curve.

274
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,000
To put it simply, you start from the same point from different angles.

275
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can't actually focus on the same point through different angles.

276
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Of course, if you read a high school textbook, it will tell you that no matter which angle you start from, it will focus on a focus point.

277
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But in fact, you can't actually focus on a point.

278
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
To be more specific, what is Spherical Aberration Curve in real life?

279
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's a bit like you take a glass cup and put it on a floor with patterns or sandpaper.

280
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You will find that the part you see clearly is only a small area in the middle.

281
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But the sides are all curved.

282
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This is the reason for Spherical Aberration Curve.

283
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The more you move away from the center of the light, the more you can't actually focus on the same point.

284
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So what you see is curved.

285
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
In fact, in the electronic microscope...

286
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Can you hear me?

287
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Sorry, I'm not sure what happened just now.

288
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But there is also this problem in the electronic microscope.

289
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So the first thing you see is how to fix this problem.

290
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
In fact, this story can be recited for a very long time.

291
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But simply put, there are four people who contribute in this field respectively.

292
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The story began in the early 1940s.

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
After 40 or 50 years of hard work,

294
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
people found this problem and solved it.

295
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The method they used was to use a lot of electronic probes to try to correct this difference.

296
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Of course, this electronic probe is a very complicated result.

297
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
According to my research, in the latest electronic microscope,

298
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:11,000
you need to have 20 layers of this kind of electronic probe to achieve a good resolution.

299
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But in short, this is a success.

300
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So now we can see the origin through this Spherical Aberration Curve.

301
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Most users don't really need to know how to control it.

302
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Basically, the maintenance staff will help you adjust it.

303
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So if you use an electronic microscope now,

304
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
how much resolution can you get?

305
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I have a picture here.

306
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
On one side is TEM, and on the other is STEM.

307
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The one in the middle is the resolution before correction,

308
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and the one in the back is the resolution after correction.

309
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Of course, you can't see how well it has changed in this picture.

310
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But it's obvious that it's clear.

311
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
For most people, this is enough.

312
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If you look at the picture on the right,

313
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
it's actually a silicon.

314
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
There's a certain angle in the middle.

315
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If you do a Fourier Transform,

316
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
you'll see this kind of Diffraction Pattern.

317
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's obvious that if you don't have a corrected picture,

318
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
the Diffraction Pattern limit you see is about 1.92 Angstrom.

319
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If you go through the correction,

320
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
you can see that the limit is about 0.76 Angstrom.

321
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's 76 picometers.

322
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This resolution is probably in 2002.

323
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The data I found,

324
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
if you are a modern electronic microscope,

325
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
it should be able to reach more than 50 picometers.

326
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
As mentioned earlier,

327
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
the Cornell DMV group,

328
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
if they do Tycography,

329
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
it can reach 40 picometers.

330
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That's the current record.

331
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Your resolution is higher than 40 picometers.

332
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
If you hear this,

333
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I think some people may have a question.

334
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Why do I need such a high resolution?

335
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'll give you two examples.

336
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Why do we need this resolution?

337
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The first example is a carbon nanotube.

338
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If you look at this picture,

339
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
the picture on the left,

340
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
if you don't do analysis,

341
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
you can't see any difference.

342
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
This is a very beautiful

343
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
atomic resolution carbon nanotube.

344
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But if you do analysis,

345
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
every point,

346
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
intensity,

347
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
if you do Gaussian fitting,

348
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
you will find that you can analyze

349
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
one atom, one atom,

350
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
how many positions it deviates.

351
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You can see this value.

352
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
This color represents the distance it deviates.

353
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
All units are picometers.

354
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That is, through modern electronic microscope,

355
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
you can see from the position of the atom,

356
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you can know its

357
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
carbon nanotube

358
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
the distribution of gravity.

359
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Then you can know which atom is deviating.

360
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Do this kind of very

361
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
high-precision measurement.

362
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is very important for imaging.

363
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It is also important for EOS,

364
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
for light sampling.

365
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The reason is because

366
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
if you want to see

367
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the light sample of a single atom,

368
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
you must look at it very clearly

369
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
to understand which atom is what.

370
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
This work is

371
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Suenaga,

372
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
he is Japanese,

373
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
a Japanese broadcaster.

374
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The main idea of this work is

375
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
he wants to look at

376
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the green one,

377
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
the common graphene carbon,

378
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and the two-handed carbon

379
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
on the edge of the graphene,

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
to this one-handed carbon.

381
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What is the difference in its light sample?

382
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What is its impact on the quality of graphene?

383
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He really went to do it.

384
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I have a question.

385
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Sorry,

386
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm not an electronic microscope,

387
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
so I might ask a very out-of-the-way question.

388
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You said that your displacement

389
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
is probably at

390
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
dozens of picometers,

391
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
this level.

392
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You can probably say

393
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
how much of this displacement

394
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
comes from the incident particle,

395
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
which is your electron,

396
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
plus the displacement.

397
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What is the percentage,

398
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
or what is the percentage?

399
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't know.

400
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The first thing I want to say is

401
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
this is

402
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
how to say it,

403
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
that is,

404
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
modern,

405
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
you can,

406
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
because electronic microscopes

407
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
are actually quite long-standing

408
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
studies,

409
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
so a lot of information,

410
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
like how much energy

411
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
your electron emits

412
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
to a single atom,

413
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
you can use calculations,

414
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and you can also calculate

415
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
how much it heats up

416
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
to a single atom.

417
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But what you said,

418
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that is,

419
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
in the end,

420
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
for example,

421
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
how much impact

422
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
it has on carbon nanotubes,

423
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
this is a very good question.

424
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You have to,

425
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
for each different material,

426
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you have to discuss this matter.

427
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I can't tell you directly

428
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
that it probably stands to reason,

429
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
but I can tell you very clearly

430
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
that you do today,

431
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
like this carbon nanotube,

432
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the impact of electrons on a single atom

433
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
is definitely higher than

434
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
you take it to look at

435
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
metal or ceramics.

436
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Maybe ceramics,

437
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
you don't even,

438
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
electrons,

439
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
that is,

440
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
your atoms

441
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
don't cause any change at all.

442
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But in this kind of carbon nanotube,

443
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
indeed,

444
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
electrons may

445
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
have an impact on the position of the atom.

446
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But I can't tell you

447
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
exactly how much

448
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
it accounts for.

449
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Sorry.

450
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yes, I understand.

451
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Thank you.

452
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes,

453
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
simply put,

454
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
of course,

455
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
the question you just asked

456
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
is also a very practical question.

457
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You have to

458
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
study this matter.

459
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But simply put,

460
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
because there is a spherical refractor,

461
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
we can see the atom very accurately.

462
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That is,

463
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
people who do EOS

464
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
can go to

465
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
each atom,

466
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
each single atom,

467
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to see what is the difference

468
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
between its light waves,

469
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
such as green,

470
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
blue,

471
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and red.

472
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
There are some differences.

473
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Of course,

474
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
green and blue

475
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
may be very different,

476
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and blue and red

477
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
may not be so different.

478
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But if you do the calculation,

479
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
you can know

480
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
why they are different,

481
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and what the difference

482
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
means.

483
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
This can be interpreted.

484
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Sorry,

485
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I have a question.

486
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
OK.

487
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yes,

488
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
can you hear me?

489
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yes,

490
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I can hear you.

491
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You can hear me.

492
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
How do you look at

493
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
the energy loss

494
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
in the 2D

495
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
part?

496
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
In theory

497
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
or in practice,

498
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
how do you look at

499
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
this thing?

500
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
What kind of energy loss

501
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
does it have?

502
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I will put it

503
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
in the second session.

504
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I will put EOS's structure 2.

505
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But simply put,

506
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
you see this image.

507
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
In fact,

508
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
it is

509
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
EOS's structure 2.

510
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It is

511
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
EOS's structure 2.

512
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It is

513
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
EOS's structure 2.

514
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It is

515
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
EOS's structure 2.

516
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It is

517
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
EOS's structure 2.

518
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
In fact,

519
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
because you

520
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
have a

521
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
regressed electron,

522
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you

523
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
are

524
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
detecting

525
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
the energy

526
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
loss

527
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
of the

528
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
regressed electron.

529
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So EOS

530
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
is usually

531
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
placed at the

532
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
bottom of

533
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
the electron microscope

534
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
.

535
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
A

536
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
general

537
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
instrument

538
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
is placed

539
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
at the

540
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
bottom.

541
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You

542
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
put the

543
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
light

544
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
spectrum

545
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
like this

546
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and

547
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
analyze the

548
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
energy loss

549
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
of the

550
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
same electron.

551
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Then you can

552
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
see the

553
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
light spectrum

554
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
like this.

555
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I will

556
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
talk about

557
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the specific

558
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
structure

559
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
in the

560
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
next

561
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
section.

562
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Okay,

563
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
the part

564
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I just

565
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
talked about

566
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
is about

567
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
how we

568
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
can see

569
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
an electron

570
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
very precisely

571
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
.

572
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
This matter

573
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
is very

574
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
important.

575
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Because

576
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
if you can't see

577
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
the electron,

578
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
you can't

579
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
study the

580
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
light spectrum

581
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
of the

582
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
electron.

583
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The

584
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
red frame

585
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
here

586
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
is the

587
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
element

588
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
that

589
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
ordinary

590
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
people

591
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
will

592
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
encounter.

593
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The

594
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
element that

595
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
is not listed

596
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
below

597
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
may not

598
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
be an

599
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
element

600
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
that

601
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
ordinary

602
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
people

603
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
will

604
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
encounter.

605
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Let me

606
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
give you an

607
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
example.

608
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You can

609
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
think about

610
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
what you

611
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
expect to

612
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
see in

613
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
the electron

614
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
.

615
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The

616
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
answer is

617
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
that all

618
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
the elements

619
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
in this

620
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
frame can

621
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
be seen,

622
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
including

623
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
light and

624
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
light.

625
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I have

626
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
a picture

627
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
here.

628
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The

629
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
most important

630
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
element

631
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I just

632
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
talked about

633
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
is the

634
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
light

635
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
element.

636
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
This is

637
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
my

638
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
recent experiment.

639
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You can

640
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
see the

641
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
white

642
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
bismuth

643
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
forming

644
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
particles

645
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
or

646
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
single

647
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
atoms.

648
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
In the

649
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
glass,

650
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
bismuth

651
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
is definitely

652
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
something

653
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
that

654
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
is easy

655
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
to see.

656
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The

657
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
light element

658
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
is special

659
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
because it

660
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
has only

661
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
one

662
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
light

663
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
element.

664
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
The

665
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
first time

666
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
it was

667
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
seen was

668
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
in 2011

669
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
in the

670
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
YH

671
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
crystal.

672
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You

673
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
can see

674
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
the

675
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
faint

676
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
intensity,

677
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
but

678
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
basically

679
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you can

680
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
see the

681
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
light

682
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
element.

683
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
This

684
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
method,

685
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
in fact,

686
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
the first

687
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
method to

688
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
do this

689
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
is the

690
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
method

691
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that

692
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
you can

693
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
see the

694
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
light

695
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
element.

696
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Of

697
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
course,

698
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
it's not

699
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that simple,

700
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
but

701
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
theoretically

702
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
you can

703
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
see the

704
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
light

705
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
element.

706
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
The

707
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
first

708
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
question

709
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm

710
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
going to

711
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
talk about

712
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
today is

713
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
that

714
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
many people

715
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
seem to

716
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
be doing

717
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
STEM,

718
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
but

719
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
no one

720
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
knows

721
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
why.

722
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
This is

723
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
not a

724
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
traditional

725
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
electron microscope.

726
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's a

727
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
technology

728
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
called

729
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
STEM.

730
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's

731
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
very different

732
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
from a

733
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
optical

734
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
microscope.

735
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
STEM

736
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
actually

737
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
focuses

738
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
the

739
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
electron

740
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
into a

741
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
very small

742
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
probe

743
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and then

744
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
does

745
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
scanning.

746
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The

747
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
traditional

748
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
optical

749
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
microscope

750
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
will

751
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
very

753
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000

754
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000

755
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
put it

756
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
simply,

757
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
because

758
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
it does

759
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
this

760
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
scanning,

761
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
it can

762
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
put

763
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000

764
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000

895
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
let me

896
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
show

897
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
you

898
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
how

899
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
important

00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
this

science

903
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,140
is.

904
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,940
This

905
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,180
is an

907
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
tailor-made

909
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,140
that

910
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,140
studies

915
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
This

916
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,400
is their

917
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
an original

919
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
but

920
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
I don't know

921
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
if there is

922
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
any contrast

923
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
in this

924
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
picture,

925
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
that is,

926
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
there are some

927
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
lines,

928
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
but

929
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
you can't

930
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
see anything.

931
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
But

932
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
if you go

933
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
to the

934
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
hard

935
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400

936
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
image,

937
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
you will

938
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
find that

939
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
there are

940
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
actually

941
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
a lot of

942
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
gold ions

943
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
in

944
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
this

945
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
picture.

946
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
It

947
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
turns out

948
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
that

949
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
if you

950
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
do

951
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
such

952
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
research,

953
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
gold ions

954
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
can be

955
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
distinguished from

956
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
gold ions

957
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
and

958
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
it

959
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
becomes

960
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
a very

961
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
important

962
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
thing.

963
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
From

964
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
this

965
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
point of

966
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
view,

967
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
you

968
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
can't

969
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
see

970
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
anything

971
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
at

972
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
all.

973
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
On

974
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
the other

975
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
hand,

976
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
there

977
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
are several

978
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
ways.

979
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
The first

980
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
thing is that

981
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
this picture

982
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
is actually a

983
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
lithium-ion

984
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
liquid.

985
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
I forgot

986
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
whether it

987
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
was steam

988
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
or something,

989
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
but there is

990
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
a low

991
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
physical

992
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
mass,

993
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
so it

994
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
will not

995
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
become

996
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
gas in

997
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
vacuum.

998
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
You can

999
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
put it

1000
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
in.

1001
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
This is

1002
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
a general

1003
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
electronic

1004
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
microscope.

1005
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
If you

1006
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
allow it,

1007
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
you can put it

1008
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
in.

1009
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
In fact,

1010
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
many people

1011
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
don't like

1012
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
doing this,

1013
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
but in

1014
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
principle,

1015
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
it is physically

1016
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
safe.

1017
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Another

1018
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
method

1019
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
is

1020
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
called

1021
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
a

1022
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
liquid

1023
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
holder.

1024
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
It

1025
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
has a

1026
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
special

1027
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
holder

1028
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
that you

1029
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
can put

1030
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
liquid

1031
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
in.

1032
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
These

1033
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
things

1034
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
are

1035
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
very thin.

1036
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
My

1037
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
understanding

1038
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
is that

1039
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
EM

1040
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
has to be

1041
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
cut very

1042
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
thin.

1043
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Yes,

1044
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
this

1045
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
situation is

1046
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
a bit like

1047
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
a

1048
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
lithium-ion

1049
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
liquid.

1050
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
There

1051
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
should be

1052
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
a

1053
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
molybdenum

1054
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
or copper

1055
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
grid

1056
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
on the

1057
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
outside

1058
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
.

1059
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
At

1060
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
the

1061
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
beginning,

1062
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
it

1063
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
is

1064
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
very

1065
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
thin,

1066
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
but

1067
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
if you

1068
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
heat it

1069
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
a little

1070
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
in the

1071
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
vacuum

1072
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
furnace,

1073
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
it

1074
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
will

1075
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
actually

1076
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
become

1077
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
a film

1078
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
like this

1079
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
and

1080
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
its

1081
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
thickness

1082
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
is

1083
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
about

1084
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
10 nanometers

1085
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
.

1086
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
This

1087
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
material

1088
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
can do

1089
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
this.

1090
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
This

1091
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
material

1092
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
is

1093
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
very

1094
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
thin

1095
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
and

1096
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
quite

1097
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
mature.

1098
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
The

1099
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
most famous

1100
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
is

1101
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Berkeley

1102
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Lawrence

1103
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Lab.

1104
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
He

1105
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
has done

1106
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
a lot of

1107
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
liquid experiments.

1108
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Didn't

1109
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
they say

1110
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
to wrap

1111
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
things up

1112
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
with

1113
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
graphene?

1114
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
That's

1115
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
also a

1116
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
method,

1117
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
but

1118
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
you

1119
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
think about it

1120
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
yourself,

1121
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
it's

1122
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
really in the

1123
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
liquid environment.

1124
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
The graphene

1125
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
you just

1126
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
talked about is

1127
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
also a method,

1128
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
but the

1129
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
current mainstream

1130
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
is to

1131
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
use a

1132
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
special

1133
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
microwave holder

1134
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
.

1135
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
You can

1136
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
really put

1137
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
liquid in

1138
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
.

1139
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Generally

1140
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
it is

1141
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
silicon nitride.

1142
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
OK,

1143
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,400
so it

1144
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
is also

1145
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
silicon nitride.

1146
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Thank

1147
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
you.

1148
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
The

1149
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
other one

1150
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
is

1151
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
lithium

1152
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
atom.

1153
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Everyone

1154
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
is studying

1155
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
lithium

1156
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
atoms.

1157
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Our

1158
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
department

1159
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
originally

1160
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
studied

1161
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
ceramics.

1162
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
He just

1163
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
thought

1164
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
lithium

1165
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
atoms were

1166
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
quite

1167
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
interesting,

1168
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
so he

1169
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
used

1170
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
ABF

1171
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
as I

1172
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
just

1173
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
said.

1174
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
We

1175
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
developed a

1176
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
method

1177
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
to look at

1178
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
lithium

1179
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
atoms.

1180
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
But

1181
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
if you

1182
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
charge it,

1183
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
it will

1184
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
run out

1185
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
if you

1186
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
don't

1187
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,400
see it.

1188
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Then

1189
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
you can

1190
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
come in

1191
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
by

1192
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
health

1193
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
charging.

1194
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Then

1195
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
you can

1196
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
judge

1197
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
it by

1198
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
intensity

1199
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
.

1200
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
If

1201
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
you are

1202
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
studying

1203
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
lithium

1204
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
atoms,

1205
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
the

1206
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
current

1207
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
microwave

1208
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
will

1209
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
run out

1210
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
if you

1211
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
don't

1212
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
charge

1213
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
it.

1214
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
So

1215
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
that's

1216
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
why we

1217
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
don't

1218
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
need

1219
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
lithium

1220
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
atom

1221
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
technology.

1222
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Yes.

1223
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Finally,

1224
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
I'm not

1225
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
sure how

1226
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
many people

1227
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
are

1228
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
interested

1229
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
in

1230
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
magnetic

1231
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
and

1232
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
electrical

1233
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
fields.

1234
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
This

1235
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
has nothing

1236
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
to do

1237
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
with

1238
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
electrical

1239
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
or magnetic

1240
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
fields.

1241
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Electrical

1242
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
fields will

1243
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
tell you

1244
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
the direction

1245
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
of the magnetic

1246
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
field.

1247
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
In the

1248
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
past,

1249
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
if you

1250
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
only had

1251
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
one detector

1252
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
and

1253
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
didn't

1254
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
have a

1255
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400

1256
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
you

1257
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
couldn't

1258
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
tell

1259
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
the

1260
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
magnetic

1261
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
field

1262
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
or

1263
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
magnetic

1264
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400

1265
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,400
from

1266
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
the

1267
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
other

1268
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
detectors.

1269
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
So

1270
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
if you

1271
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,400
only had

1272
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
one

1273
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
detector and

1274
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
didn't

1275
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
have a

1276

1277
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
you

1278
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
couldn't

1279
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
tell

00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400

1283
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400

1284
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
magnetic

1285
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400

1286
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
from

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400

1290
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
So

1291
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
if you

1292
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
only had

1295
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
and

1296
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
didn't

1297
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
you

1300
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
couldn't

1305
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400

1307
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400

1312
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
So

1313
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
if you

1314
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400

1331
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
So

1332
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
if you

00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400

So

1350
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
if you

you

1582
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
have a

1583
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
block,

1584
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,400
you

1585
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
couldn't

1586
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,400
tell the

1587
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400

1588
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,400

1589
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400
from

1590
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
the other

1591
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
detectors.

1592
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,400
So

1593
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,400
if you

1594
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,400
only had

1595
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,400
one

1596
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
detector and

1597
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,400
didn't

1598
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,400
have a

1599

1600
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,400
you

1601
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,400
couldn't

1602
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
tell the

1603
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,400
magnetic

1604
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,400

1605
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,400
from

1606
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,400
the other

1607
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,400
detectors.

1608
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,400
So

1609
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,400
if you

1610
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
only had

1611
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,400
one

1612
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
detector and

1613
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,400
didn't

1614
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,400
have a

1615
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,400
block,

1616
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,400
you

1617
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
couldn't

1618
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
tell the

1619
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
magnetic

1620
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400

1621
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
from

1622
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
the other

1623
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,400
detectors.

1624
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,400
So

1625
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
if you

1626
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,400
only had

1627
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,400
one

1628
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
detector and

1629
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,400
didn't

1630
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,400
have a

1631
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
block,

1632
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
you

1633
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
couldn't

1634
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,400
tell the

1635
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,400
magnetic

1636
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,400
field

1637
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
from

1638
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,400
the other

1639
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
detectors.

1640
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,400
So

1641
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,400
if you

1642
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
only had

1643
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,400
one

1644
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
detector and

1645
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,400
didn't

1646
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
have a

1647
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,400
block,

1648
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,400
you

1649
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
couldn't

1650
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,400
tell the

1651
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
magnetic

1652
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,400
field

1653
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,400
from

1654
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,400
the other

1655
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,400
detectors.

1656
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,400
So

1657
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
spectroscopy

1658
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,400
is very

1659
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
important.

1660
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
Of course

1661
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,400
my time

1662
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,400
is very

1663
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
limited,

1664
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,400
but

1665
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
I can

1666
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,400
simply

1667
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
say that

1668
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,400
EOS

1669
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
is usually

1670
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
at the

1671
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
bottom

1672
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400

1673
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400

00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
sample.

1675
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,400
So

1676
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,400
EOS

1677
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,400
is

1678
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,400
basically

1679
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400

1857
00:52:33,400 --> 00:53:02,400
XAS

1858
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:10,400
In many of the blue squares, I have 5 to 6 hands.

1859
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,400
This can tell you a lot about the nature of glass.

1860
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:23,400
It can also tell you, for example, how many 5 or 6 hands you have on a point.

1861
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,400
It will affect the nature of glass.

1862
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,400
This is basically the information you can get from the structure map.

1863
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Other than that, I don't know, maybe a lot of people are interested in Transition Metal.

1864
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,400
For example, you can have a 2-frame mesh and a 3-frame mesh.

1865
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,400
If you just look at the image or the deflection, you can't tell.

1866
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,400
But if you use EOS, you will find that the light source is in a different position.

1867
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,400
If we don't mention the calculation, this is what it looks like in practice.

1868
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,400
You have two atoms here, one is A and the other is B.

1869
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Then you also look at MnL2Cag.

1870
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:19,400
You will find that the light source of EOS will change slightly between different atoms.

1871
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:33,400
If you use EOS to calculate, you will find that the light source of 2Cag is in the middle, and the light source of 3Cag is outside.

1872
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,400
This can tell you a lot of information.

1873
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:44,400
In addition to knowing the location of the light source, you can also know the oxidation state of the light source.

1874
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,400
Some EOS can even tell you if there is a transfer of electrons.

1875
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:57,400
So far, this is basically what everyone is doing.

1876
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Doing this in practice is actually quite simple.

1877
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,400
If you are interested, you can try it yourself.

1878
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
In fact, this is not that difficult.

1879
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,400
This is basically the most common application of Coros.

1880
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,400
It's like this, 2Cag, 3Cag, 4Cag, this kind of balance state mapping.

1881
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,400
Let me make a simple comparison here.

1882
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,400
The EOS I just talked about is actually XAS, X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

1883
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,400
In fact, it is very similar to the EOS function.

1884
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,400
But their energy boundaries are not quite the same.

1885
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,400
X-ray absorption is basically greater than the energy of 2KeV.

1886
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,400
EOS is basically 1mEV to 10KeV.

1887
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,400
The energy resolution is not much different now.

1888
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,400
But if you add the non-committer, the latest EOS record can be up to 3mEV.

1889
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,400
You can use it to study the body.

1890
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,400
But the spatial resolution is very different.

1891
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,400
The spatial resolution of XAS is about 50nm to micrometer.

1892
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,400
In the case of EOS, you can go to angstrom to nanometer.

1893
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,400
So if you are more interested in some nanometers,

1894
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,400
you can consider doing an EOS experiment.

1895
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,400
Then you can compare it with Bokeh.

1896
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:31,400
The second section I want to talk about is the VALENCE section.

1897
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,400
It is more about the transfer of light and snow.

1898
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,400
You can think of it as the energy obtained in this section.

1899
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,400
In fact, it has something to do with your relay parameters.

1900
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,400
This is a raw data.

1901
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,400
If you do fitting, you will find that there are different peaks in this fitting.

1902
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Some of them come from PLASMO, some of them come from the interband transition.

1903
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:05,400
You may know that the VALENCE band is usually at the top and the CONDUCTION band is at the bottom.

1904
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:12,400
This is the definition of the band gap between LUMO and LUMO.

1905
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,400
If you use EOS, you can do the same thing.

1906
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,400
We don't have time to go through the SURFACE PLASMO.

1907
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:33,400
What I think is more interesting is that we can measure the band gap of some interfaces in some very special materials.

1908
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,400
For example, the material here is actually oxidized aluminum.

1909
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,400
Oxidized aluminum has different angles in the oxidized aluminum of polyethylene.

1910
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
This is a metal defect.

1911
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,400
If you measure its EOS, you will find that the black one is Bokeh.

1912
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,400
Bokeh is basically the same.

1913
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,400
But you will find that the red one has two band gaps in this interface.

1914
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,400
In fact, each one is different.

1915
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,400
You can analyze it.

1916
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,400
For example, in the interface, your band gap becomes 6.7.

1917
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,400
Originally it was 8.8.

1918
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,400
What impact will this matter to your material quality?

1919
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,400
You can also analyze how the interface will have a lower band gap.

1920
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,400
How do you control this?

1921
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,400
If you are a semiconductor person, this is very interesting.

1922
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,400
Because you can measure a lot of interfaces in your software.

1923
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,400
Is it good or bad for you?

1924
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,400
I also think that the band gap measurement is not that simple.

1925
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,400
But basically, EOS instruments can do this.

1926
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,400
You can try it.

1927
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:53,400
The last section is Valence EOS.

1928
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,400
This section is a special one.

1929
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,400
It is interesting that it can measure temperature.

1930
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:09,400
The principle is to use Profile Fitting to feed PLASMON's energy.

1931
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,400
Because its energy is related to the density of the electrode.

1932
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,400
So if you change the temperature, the density of the electrode will change.

1933
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,400
You can measure the temperature.

1934
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:27,400
This diagram is a very simple temperature mapping.

1935
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,400
This material is aluminum.

1936
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,400
I'm not sure if it's a wet electrode or a wet electrode.

1937
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,400
It should be a wet electrode.

1938
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,400
You can see the temperature change in the aluminum.

1939
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,400
Of course, it's not that simple.

1940
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,400
But it can still be done.

1941
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,400
This is the part of measuring temperature.

1942
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,400
I've been doing it recently.

1943
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
It's a bit like what I just said.

1944
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,400
I'm going to measure the EOS changes in the interface.

1945
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,400
It's not the same as the above.

1946
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
I'm going to measure thermal expansion.

1947
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,400
If you're interested, we can discuss it next.

1948
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Can I ask a question?

1949
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Yes.

1950
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Can you go back to the aluminum diagram?

1951
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
The temperature next to you is almost normal.

1952
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Can you make it a little warmer?

1953
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Can you make it very low?

1954
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
You mean low temperature?

1955
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
Low enough that it doesn't overheat.

1956
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
It's less than 1K.

1957
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,400
I think it should be physically possible.

1958
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Because the way it gets the temperature is

1959
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:47,400
Simply put, if you look at the peak shift of Plasmon Peak,

1960
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,400
You can see how much the electronic density has changed.

1961
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,400
If you get low temperature,

1962
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,400
You may also know how low it is.

1963
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,400
But in the electronic microscope,

1964
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,400
It's easier to heat than to get low temperature.

1965
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,400
So most people do thermal experiments.

1966
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,400
Very few people do low temperature experiments.

1967
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,400
Can I say something?

1968
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,400
Yes.

1969
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,400
Basically, I don't think you should say this in this picture.

1970
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Because I've talked to the author about this.

1971
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:28,400
This sample itself is a silicon nitride membrane.

1972
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
To carve out these patterns.

1973
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,400
So when you're doing this experiment,

1974
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,400
There's a big problem.

1975
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,400
You're heating it up at the same time.

1976
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,400
What you're looking at now is the shift of EOS.

1977
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,400
It's actually bound to your silicon nitride substrate.

1978
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,400
That is, you're not a freestanding aluminum wire.

1979
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,400
So it's hard to say how big it is.

1980
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,400
Back to the question just now.

1981
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,400
If you put this sample in a liquid nitrogen holder,

1982
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,400
You can look at it after it's cooled down.

1983
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,400
So you can also put it in a heating holder.

1984
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,400
You can also heat it up.

1985
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,400
So if you want to know the temperature range,

1986
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,400
It's possible.

1987
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
Yes.

1988
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,400
Thank you.

1989
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,400
I don't know much about this sample.

1990
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,400
Because he's been here before.

1991
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,400
So he was very polite.

1992
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,400
That's what his structure is like.

1993
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,400
Because all of our papers.

1994
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,400
Science papers here.

1995
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,400
We all thought he was a freestanding aluminum wire.

1996
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,400
But what he said was that there was supporting underneath.

1997
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,400
So you go and look at the slice in front of you.

1998
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,400
The slice in front of you.

1999
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,400
Why is the temperature change so big?

2000
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,400
That's why it shifts so little.

2001
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,400
You're not a freestanding sample.

2002
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,400
You don't know how reliable this knife is.

2003
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,400
And your error is 0.06 electron volt.

2004
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,400
Your resolution is only 0.03.

2005
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,400
Then you have two pixels.

2006
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:09,400
I think this experiment is actually quite risky.

2007
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,400
Because you don't know where the error comes from.

2008
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,400
So basically, we think it's more reliable than three pixels.

2009
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,400
I see.

2010
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:26,400
Because this paper actually has a lot of citations.

2011
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,400
There are a lot of people who do something later.

2012
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,400
Or look at some things.

2013
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,400
Because if you're a freestanding sample.

2014
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,400
It makes a lot of sense if you measure it.

2015
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
But you're supporting.

2016
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,400
Like a sandwich.

2017
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,400
If the heat expansion coefficient below is very poor.

2018
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,400
It's very different from the temperature above.

2019
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,400
Then you might have a similar effect.

2020
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Then you can't measure what the real thing should be like.

2021
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,400
I see.

2022
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,400
After we heard the speech that day.

2023
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,400
Why do you have to wrap that layer underneath?

2024
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,400
But I didn't really measure the temperature myself.

2025
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,400
In my case, I always let the temperature be very warm.

2026
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,400
If it's in this situation.

2027
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,400
Then what I measured is.

2028
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,400
The change in electron density comes from heat expansion.

2029
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,400
Of course, this is also a new paper recently.

2030
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Then I'm also trying to see if I can.

2031
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,400
I'm actually not very clear right now.

2032
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,400
You are now.

2033
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,400
You slice like this.

2034
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
Sorry, until the next experiment.

2035
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,400
You slice this.

2036
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,400
Because of your.

2037
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,400
You are because the temperature is different.

2038
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,400
Then look at the energy of PLASMA is different.

2039
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,400
You are now.

2040
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
I let everything be PLASMA.

2041
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,400
Everything.

2042
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,400
This sample itself.

2043
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,400
The temperature has become the same.

2044
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,400
I went to see the interface.

2045
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,400
With Bulk.

2046
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,400
His.

2047
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,400
The change in heat expansion.

2048
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,400
But the two pictures below you.

2049
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,400
Is there a temperature change?

2050
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
This is the temperature here.

2051
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,400
This is after you fix a temperature.

2052
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,400
After reading it, change it to the next temperature.

2053
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,400
Yes, this is a very tiring experiment.

2054
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
But we've been trying it lately.

2055
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
Because the first paper to do heat expansion.

2056
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
Is in the secondary material.

2057
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,400
Then we did it ourselves.

2058
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,400
A ceramic traditional material.

2059
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
Try it out.

2060
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
Can they be used in traditional materials?

2061
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
Above.

2062
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
I can't tell you now.

2063
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,400
Is it good or bad?

2064
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
But I can tell you.

2065
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,400
I really have two.

2066
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,400
I understand.

2067
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,400
I just said you were processing this data.

2068
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,400
Have you ever done the so-called.

2069
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,400
How to say.

2070
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,400
Uh.

2071
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,400
Consider your thickness.

2072
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,400
Because thickness.

2073
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,400
You speak very well.

2074
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
Because.

2075
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,400
Because in fact.

2076
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,400
When you do this.

2077
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,400
You can go to one by the way.

2078
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,400
Anyway, the area you are in now.

2079
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,400
You can do the thickness.

2080
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Maybe you are now.

2081
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
After fitting.

2082
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,400
After decoupling.

2083
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,400
You can do the analysis later.

2084
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Then a point is.

2085
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
I am in the thick area.

2086
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,400
The heat expansion of the two areas is different.

2087
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,400
I mean.

2088
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,400
It doesn't matter if you are thick.

2089
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,400
Because as long as you take a full score.

2090
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,400
You can do decoupling.

2091
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,400
After decoupling.

2092
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,400
In fact, you are using decoupling data.

2093
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
To do these.

2094
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Plasma energy fitting.

2095
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,400
Maybe what you see.

2096
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,400
It may be the same as now.

2097
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,400
It should be said that all the data.

2098
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
I have done it.

2099
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,400
It's the backlight.

2100
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,400
But my own data.

2101
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,400
In the thick area and the thin area.

2102
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,400
This.

2103
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
The change in the heat expansion factor.

2104
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,400
In fact, more should be related to quantum.

2105
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,400
It's the same in the past.

2106
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
Not necessarily.

2107
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
If you are thin today.

2108
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,400
The area is less than 40 nanometers.

2109
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,400
The data you make now.

2110
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,400
I don't know how thick it is.

2111
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,400
But.

2112
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
For you to do this experiment.

2113
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,400
I would prefer to say.

2114
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,400
You are probably 40 to 80 nanometers.

2115
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
The thickness is the most perfect.

2116
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,400
Because below 40 nanometers.

2117
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,400
You will be more serious.

2118
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
So all of you.

2119
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,400
You think the peak of Bulk Plasma.

2120
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,400
Will shift to low energy.

2121
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,400
When you have high energy.

2122
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,400
You are after multiple scattering.

2123
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,400
You may.

2124
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,400
You may have to do a lot of processing.

2125
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
With your average thickness.

2126
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,400
For example, 40 to 80 nanometers.

2127
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,400
Maybe a little worse.

2128
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,400
But not so much worse.

2129
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,400
So I think you can consider.

2130
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,400
You are now in these two areas.

2131
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,400
What you marked.

2132
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,400
Is the thickness.

2133
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,400
In fact, you can calculate.

2134
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,400
What is the thickness?

2135
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,400
How many lambda?

2136
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,400
I can tell you.

2137
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,400
This is about 80 nanometers.

2138
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,400
This is about 20 nanometers.

2139
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,400
Because you have too many surface effects.

2140
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,400
So the energy you are doing now.

2141
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,400
You have to consider the surface plasma.

2142
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,400
Not your own Bulk.

2143
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,400
If you have a vacuum area.

2144
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,400
If you have a vacuum area.

2145
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,400
You just sweep past like this.

2146
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,400
You can know your whole.

2147
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,400
You want to identify.

2148
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,400
Is the location of the Bulk Plasma shifted?

2149
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,400
Then you know.

2150
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,400
Your thinnest place.

2151
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,400
The location of the energy you originally expected.

2152
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,400
There is a deviation.

2153
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,400
We can discuss this later.

2154
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,400
Thank you very much for your comment.

2155
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,400
I really don't know.

2156
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,400
What you said above.

2157
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,400
I don't really know.

2158
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,400
What you just said.

2159
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,400
Basically,

2160
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,400
Valence.

2161
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,400
I want to talk about this.

2162
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,400
Finally, I want to add.

2163
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,400
There is a new technology called Vibrational Yields.

2164
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
That is also.

2165
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,400
It was probably released in 2014.

2166
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,400
It is a piece.

2167
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,400
Its paper is.

2168
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
Look at the optical phonon of boron nitride.

2169
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,400
We ourselves.

2170
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,400
In 2014.

2171
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,400
Most of the time.

2172
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,400
Look at the CH vibration of ionic liquid.

2173
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,400
At that time, many people felt.

2174
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,400
This is a mess.

2175
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,400
But so.

2176
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,400
We basically published it at the same time.

2177
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,400
Then you can be sure.

2178
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,400
The optical phonon of boron nitride.

2179
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,400
You can see the phonon and the vibration.

2180
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,400
A more popular method now.

2181
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,400
It actually uses a model called.

2182
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,400
You don't put the disease.

2183
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,400
On top of your sample.

2184
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,400
But outside the sample.

2185
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,400
This mechanism.

2186
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
It interprets.

2187
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,400
It's all double scattering.

2188
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
But they mean.

2189
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,400
Your double scattering.

2190
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,400
It's a signal.

2191
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,400
The middle one.

2192
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
It's more detailed.

2193
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,400
Some people say it's virtual photon.

2194
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,400
But this part.

2195
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,400
I really don't understand.

2196
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
What are they talking about?

2197
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,400
But simply put.

2198
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,400
You put the electron outside the sample.

2199
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,400
In a specific position.

2200
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,400
You can actually detect.

2201
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,400
Your vibrational signal.

2202
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,400
Through this matter.

2203
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,400
In fact, since 2015.

2204
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,400
Many people have been using this method.

2205
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,400
To study some.

2206
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,400
This should be biological.

2207
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,400
Materials.

2208
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,400
It can be.

2209
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,400
Don't destroy your sample.

2210
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
Detect outside.

2211
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,400
Some of your material.

2212
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
Vibrational mode.

2213
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,400
If you are interested.

2214
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,400
You can also look at some papers.

2215
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,400
Or do this experiment.

2216
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,400
In 2019.

2217
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,400
I think it's more.

2218
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,400
It may be a bit controversial.

2219
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,400
Quite.

2220
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,400
What people know is.

2221
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Carbon-12 and carbon-13.

2222
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
That is, through EOS.

2223
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,400
What I just said.

2224
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,400
Since you can see.

2225
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
If the molecules vibrate.

2226
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,400
I believe.

2227
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
Carbon-12 and oxygen bound.

2228
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,400
Carbon-13 and oxygen bound.

2229
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,400
Their vibrational mode.

2230
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,400
In fact, it should be a bit different.

2231
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,400
That's what Oak Ridge does.

2232
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,400
You have carbon-12 particles.

2233
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,400
To do EOS.

2234
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,400
To distinguish these two.

2235
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,400
Basically, they are using profile fitting.

2236
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,400
To distinguish these two.

2237
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,400
Because now.

2238
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,400
The resolution at this time in 2019.

2239
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,400
Neon's system is about.

2240
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,400
5 mV.

2241
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,400
So they can distinguish.

2242
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,400
Carbon-13 and carbon-12.

2243
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,400
If you are interested.

2244
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,400
Oak Ridge has been doing this experiment.

2245
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,400
I am.

2246
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,400
I am actually.

2247
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,400
Take it to study my glass.

2248
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,400
Because in my glass.

2249
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,400
There are two-handed oxygen and three-handed oxygen.

2250
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,400
Two-handed oxygen and three-handed oxygen.

2251
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,400
General XAS.

2252
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,400
Or other.

2253
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,400
In fact, it is difficult to see the difference.

2254
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,400
My glass also has.

2255
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
Silicon Ridge and Aluminum Ridge.

2256
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,400
I can clearly know.

2257
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,400
What kind of structure I see.

2258
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,400
So I really go to study.

2259
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
What is the difference.

2260
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
What is the difference.

2261
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,400
If you do profile fitting.

2262
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,400
You will probably find it.

2263
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,400
About 10 mV.

2264
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,400
Then you can do some more analysis.

2265
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Tell you.

2266
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,400
In the end, what you see.

2267
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,400
Is it really from this oxygen coordination?

2268
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,400
Change.

2269
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,400
Or something from the hardware.

2270
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,400
This is my own recent.

2271
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,400
On Vibrational EOS.

2272
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,400
Some research results.

2273
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,400
If it is possible.

2274
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,400
More people will be interested.

2275
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,400
In fact.

2276
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Is this kind of Momentum Resolve.

2277
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,400
Vibrational EOS.

2278
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,400
In 2019.

2279
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
Basically, some people started to study.

2280
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,400
Since I can see the rope.

2281
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,400
Then I also want to study.

2282
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,400
This kind of phonon dispersion.

2283
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,400
Is that you change the Q-vector.

2284
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,400
You put your beam.

2285
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,400
Like other.

2286
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,400
Not directly on your.

2287
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,400
Spectrometer.

2288
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,400
If you give it a Q-vector.

2289
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,400
Momentum transfer.

2290
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,400
You can see.

2291
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,400
This kind of phonon dispersion.

2292
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,400
This picture is made in Japan.

2293
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,400
To get this kind of experiment.

2294
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,400
Suenaga.

2295
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,400
They said they did it.

2296
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,400
More than 60 hours.

2297
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,400
But this year.

2298
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,400
In 2020.

2299
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,400
Two months ago.

2300
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,400
Microsociety.

2301
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,400
He studied.

2302
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,400
Is that you are.

2303
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,400
On the original spectrometer.

2304
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,400
Add a layer.

2305
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,400
You will get a lot at the same time.

2306
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,400
Different Q-point.

2307
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,400
EOS.

2308
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,400
In 2019.

2309
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,400
You have to do.

2310
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,400
60 hours of such an experiment.

2311
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,400
You use Neon's instrument.

2312
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,400
With the latest method.

2313
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,400
Can be done in 10 minutes.

2314
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,400
If you are.

2315
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,400
This kind of nanometer.

2316
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,400
If you are interested.

2317
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,400
You can check it out.

2318
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,400
In the end.

2319
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,400
It will become.

2320
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,400
Electromagnetists.

2321
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,400
Want to do atomic wave solution.

2322
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,400
In 2020.

2323
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,400
Recently.

2324
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,400
He also did something like this.

2325
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,400
Silicon on graphene.

2326
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,400
He went to see.

2327
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,400
His surrounding atoms.

2328
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,400
Spectra of each atom.

2329
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
Every one.

2330
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,400
Of course it is a very difficult experiment.

2331
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,400
But they are also using.

2332
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
Very high Q-vector.

2333
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,400
To see this kind of spectra.

2334
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,400
So you can make sure.

2335
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,400
Detected signals.

2336
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,400
All come from a single atom.

2337
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,400
I'm not sure.

2338
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,400
How simple is this experiment.

2339
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,400
How complicated.

2340
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,400
Or where is its accuracy.

2341
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,400
But this is the current field.

2342
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,400
The latest research results.

2343
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,400
If you are interested.

2344
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,400
In the end.

2345
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,400
The information you really want to bring home.

2346
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,400
In fact.

2347
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,400
Electromagnetism is not just a magnifying glass.

2348
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,400
Although many people think so.

2349
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,400
Modern STEM fields.

2350
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,400
Is a very powerful tool.

2351
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,400
If you want to do.

2352
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,400
The experiments I just mentioned.

2353
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,400
You can choose some open facilities.

2354
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,400
Like Oak Ridge.

2355
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,400
Molecular foundry.

2356
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,400
Berkeley.

2357
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,400
ERC in Germany.

2358
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,400
STEM in the UK.

2359
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,400
Nanotechnology platform in Japan.

2360
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,400
You can apply for some.

2361
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,400
You can write your proposal.

2362
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,400
To apply for time.

2363
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,400
Then do such an experiment.

2364
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,400
The above is probably.

2365
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,400
Today's content.

2366
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,400
If I am also in.

2367
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,400
I want to do more glass recently.

2368
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,400
Then there are some.

2369
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,400
Is the MOF glass.

2370
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,400
Or the glass on the secondary material.

2371
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,400
If there is such a similar sample.

2372
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,400
Thank you.

2373
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,400
Thank you for the speech.

2374
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,400
Very complete.

2375
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,400
Let's applaud first.

2376
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,400
Thank you for his speech.

2377
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,400
Then.

2378
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,400
Let's go straight to the question.

2379
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,400
Because the time seems to have passed.

2380
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,400
Sorry.

2381
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,400
It doesn't matter.

2382
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,400
To add.

2383
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,400
This is a thing called paradigm.

2384
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,400
Also throw proposal.

2385
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,400
Then we can do the experiment for you.

2386
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,400
Cornell.

2387
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,400
You mean.

2388
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,400
You can also do this.

2389
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,400
Yes.

2390
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,400
Thank you.

2391
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,400
Yes.

2392
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,400
If.

2393
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,400
Finally, to add.

2394
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,400
If you are very interested in 4D STEM.

2395
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,400
Like I just said.

2396
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,400
Or Berkeley.

2397
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,400
Then if you are.

2398
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,400
EOS.

2399
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,400
If you are very interested.

2400
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,400
Ocarina and Super STEM.

2401
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,400
At present.

2402
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,400
Basically the best in the world.

2403
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,400
Everyone can.

2404
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,400
Take it as a priority.

2405
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,400
If everyone has no questions.

2406
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,400
I actually have a question.

2407
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,400
Sorry, you ask first.

2408
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,400
OK.

2409
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,400
This EOS.

2410
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,400
Can you measure acetone?

2411
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,400
Because the general RPEC.

2412
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,400
The reason is because it can only measure single particles.

2413
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,400
But EOS looks like.

2414
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,400
Should be able to measure.

2415
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,400
Because it looks like.

2416
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,400
And it should be.

2417
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,400
Can also measure.

2418
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,400
Then.

2419
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,400
I have seen someone.

2420
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,400
Measure.

2421
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,400
If it is vibrational.

2422
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,400
Someone is measuring.

2423
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Then.

2424
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,400
This paper.

2425
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,400
It actually mentions a little.

2426
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,400
Acetone effect.

2427
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,400
But I'm not sure.

2428
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,400
Does it have anything to do with what you said?

2429
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Because I am in this field.

2430
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,400
I know nothing about acetone.

2431
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,400
But there is also a strange question here.

2432
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,400
Why does it have a selection rule?

2433
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,400
I just can't figure it out.

2434
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,400
Electron loss.

2435
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,400
Is there any special selection rule?

2436
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,400
You can think of it as.

2437
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,400
Its mechanism.

2438
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,400
General EOS.

2439
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,400
It is still dipole scattering.

2440
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,400
It is basically.

2441
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,400
There is no resonant.

2442
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,400
So it follows the selection rule.

2443
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,400
That is Fermi golden rule.

2444
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,400
If it is Fermi.

2445
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,400
If it is simply Fermi golden rule.

2446
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,400
You mean.

2447
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,400
Is it like the Fermi golden rule of light and snow?

2448
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,400
Yes.

2449
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,400
It is.

2450
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,400
Fermi golden rule of light and snow.

2451
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,400
Then.

2452
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,400
That is.

2453
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,400
According to your.

2454
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,400
Angle.

2455
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,400
It is the focus angle.

2456
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,400
And the absorption angle is different.

2457
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,400
You will see your.

2458
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,400
EOS signal will be different.

2459
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,400
But.

2460
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,400
If it is light and snow.

2461
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,400
It should be optical phonon.

2462
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,400
It can be absorbed.

2463
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,400
Wait a minute.

2464
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,400
I confirm.

2465
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,400
Optical phonon is possible.

2466
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,400
It is IR active.

2467
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,400
Yes.

2468
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,400
But.

2469
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,400
I am looking at the paper.

2470
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,400
What I see now.

2471
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,400
The situation is.

2472
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,400
The first.

2473
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,400
You.

2474
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,400
That is.

2475
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,400
Its selection rule.

2476
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,400
It is still more like IR.

2477
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,400
We all say it is.

2478
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,400
IR optical phonon under the magnitude of nanometer.

2479
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,400
But if you put your Q vector.

2480
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,400
Move to a very high Q.

2481
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,400
Then greater than your.

2482
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,400
The first non-dimensional area.

2483
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,400
At present.

2484
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,400
Everyone's statement is that you are like this.

2485
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,400
You can see some.

2486
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,400
The selection rule that you could not see.

2487
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,400
Yes.

2488
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,400
But.

2489
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,400
The physical content should be.

2490
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,400
The current formula is already there.

2491
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,400
But I have to go.

2492
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,400
Try to understand the formula.

2493
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,400
Yes.

2494
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,400
Can I interrupt?

2495
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,400
Yes.

2496
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,400
You see this picture.

2497
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,400
You think of it as the simplest.

2498
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,400
If you put that to L.

2499
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,400
It is called Gamma as a starting point.

2500
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,400
Gamma to N.

2501
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,400
In the crystal structure.

2502
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,400
Facing the machine.

2503
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,400
You have a different one.

2504
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,400
Can run out.

2505
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,400
This will form you.

2506
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,400
Your so-called selection rule.

2507
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,400
Come out.

2508
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,400
Do you understand what I mean?

2509
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,400
So this picture.

2510
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,400
I saw this picture.

2511
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,400
The first impression is that it is very strange.

2512
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,400
All gray lines are theoretical calculations.

2513
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,400
All red lines are experimental data.

2514
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,400
Theoretical calculation.

2515
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
Gamma to N.

2516
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,400
Gamma to N.

2517
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,400
Is symmetrical.

2518
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,400
But it is not symmetrical in practice.

2519
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,400
Oh, OK.

2520
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,400
So this is when I saw this picture.

2521
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,400
The first thing I feel is.

2522
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,400
The area of ​​Plasma.

2523
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,400
Is symmetrical.

2524
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,400
But this one.

2525
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,400
Is not symmetrical.

2526
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,400
I do not know at the moment.

2527
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,400
What special things happen.

2528
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,400
The first one.

2529
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,400
This picture.

2530
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,400
As far as I know.

2531
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,400
Is done for more than 60 hours.

2532
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,400
Experimental error.

2533
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,400
Must be considered.

2534
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,400
I mean.

2535
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,400
In fact, we are doing.

2536
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,400
Momentum Resolution.

2537
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,400
Gamma to N.

2538
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,400
Gamma to N.

2539
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,400
Gamma to N.

2540
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,400
This picture is very simple.

2541
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,400
It should be symmetrical.

2542
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,400
Phonon is difficult to do.

2543
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,400
This energy is very low.

2544
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,400
So it takes a long time to collect.

2545
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,400
But.

2546
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,400
I think no matter how long you are.

2547
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,400
You will calculate.

2548
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,400
The position of the real loss peak.

2549
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,400
It must be.

2550
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,400
From one point to another.

2551
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,400
Slowly collect the data.

2552
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,400
Piled up.

2553
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,400
This is what I feel.

2554
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,400
I can not understand from the beginning.

2555
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,400
This picture is supposed to be.

2556
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,400
textbook.

2557
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,400
Or something else.

2558
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,400
This energy should be symmetrical.

2559
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,400
But your experiment is not symmetrical.

2560
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,400
That's what I do not understand.

2561
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,400
I can ask.

2562
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,400
Goodman is.

2563
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,400
Please say.

2564
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,400
Your name and organization.

2565
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,400
Which one is it?

2566
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,400
My last name is Liu.

2567
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,400
Liu Bei Liu.

2568
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,400
Thought is humble.

2569
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,400
Where are you now?

2570
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,400
I am in the United States.

2571
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,400
Maryland University.

2572
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,400
Also specializing in EOS.

2573
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,400
I am in Taiwan.

2574
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,400
EOS.

2575
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,400
I'm just a service here.

2576
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,400
Taiwan is EOS.

2577
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,400
Is a famous teacher.

2578
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,400
I used to be in that group.

2579
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,400
I understand.

2580
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,400
What you just said.

2581
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,400
In 1970.

2582
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,400
You just mentioned.

2583
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,400
David Muller.

2584
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,400
David Muller is my teacher.

2585
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,400
John Sircus.

2586
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,400
I know.

2587
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,400
The first.

2588
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,400
I was in Taiwan University.

2589
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,400
Postal boss.

2590
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,400
He is the first doctor.

2591
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,400
So you hear now.

2592
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,400
The most famous should be David Muller.

2593
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,400
David Muller is a countdown.

2594
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,400
Before the lab shut down.

2595
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,400
Doctor.

2596
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,400
But David Muller.

2597
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,400
He did not do EOS recently.

2598
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,400
You have one in front.

2599
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,400
Silicone dumbbell.

2600
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,400
That's called Fee Bateson.

2601
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,400
I know.

2602
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,400
The second doctor.

2603
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,400
That's it.

2604
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,400
You are familiar with Fee Bateson.

2605
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,400
Because Fee Bateson used to do.

2606
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,400
Q-dependent EOS.

2607
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,400
But not vibration.

2608
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,400
Yes.

2609
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,400
I am.

2610
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,400
Because our group does not have a device.

2611
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,400
I can only use.

2612
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,400
I can't.

2613
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,400
Do such a thing.

2614
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,400
This is actually.

2615
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,400
Because Fonon has been doing it for a long time.

2616
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,400
So this is not expected.

2617
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,400
Because if you say Plasma.

2618
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,400
About five seconds to solve.

2619
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,400
You mean like.

2620
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,400
You just this picture.

2621
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,400
Your last picture.

2622
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,400
This is not.

2623
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,400
It is scanned with Scanning TM.

2624
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,400
So.

2625
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,400
Your whole spectrum.

2626
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,400
What are you talking about?

2627
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,400
How long do you scan the spectrum image?

2628
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,400
How long will it end?

2629
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,400
It just needs to do some.

2630
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,400
This.

2631
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,400
Processing.

2632
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,400
But before.

2633
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,400
In the John Sialkas group.

2634
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,400
What they do is Q-dependent EOS.

2635
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,400
This one came out.

2636
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,400
No need to do.

2637
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,400
At most because it used to be a photo.

2638
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,400
So at most just do.

2639
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,400
Data to identify.

2640
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,400
But it's just a picture.

2641
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,400
It's the picture you see now.

2642
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,400
It is a.

2643
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,400
It used to be a photo.

2644
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,400
But because there is no.

2645
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,400
How to say.

2646
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,400
After you take a picture.

2647
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,400
You have to put the skill bar on it.

2648
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,400
Calculate energy.

2649
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,400
So the role of Fee Patterson is.

2650
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,400
The digital computer.

2651
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,400
To put the coordinates.

2652
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,400
The number of coordinates.

2653
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,400
Then my teacher is.

2654
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,400
My teacher is a watch.

2655
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,400
He is a computer watch.

2656
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,400
So it is.

2657
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,400
But I think the future.

2658
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,400
Momentum Resolve.

2659
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,400
This year.

2660
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,400
After he used a slide.

2661
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,400
I think that way.

2662
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,400
Copy the most primitive way.

2663
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,400
He put a slide on it.

2664
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,400
You can do it.

2665
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,400
You can get it in 10 minutes.

2666
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,400
You can get it in a minute.

2667
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,400
His slide is.

2668
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,400
The earliest David Muller.

2669
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,400
The device they use.

2670
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,400
That's right.

2671
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,400
You just change your EOS.

2672
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,400
Yes.

2673
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,400
But this is.

2674
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,400
You can do it on EOS.

2675
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,400
You can do it on EOS.

2676
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,400
But we can't do it ourselves.

2677
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,400
You can change it on EOS.

2678
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,400
Or you.

2679
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,400
In your.

2680
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,400
You usually have a screen now.

2681
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,400
You can change it on your screen.

2682
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,400
You can change it on your screen.

2683
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,400
Anyway, you just use a slide.

2684
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,400
That's it.

2685
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,400
That's it.

2686
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,400
It's not hard.

2687
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,400
It's not hard.

2688
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,400
We used to change it.

2689
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,400
If you want to cooperate.

2690
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,400
If you want to cooperate.

2691
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,400
I think it's not difficult in Asia.

2692
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,400
I think it's not difficult in Asia.

2693
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,400
It's harder in America.

2694
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,400
Because you have to call the manufacturers.

2695
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,400
Because you have to call the manufacturers.

2696
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,400
That's right.

2697
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,400
It's hard for us.

2698
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,400
It's hard for us.

2699
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,400
So you guys.

2700
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,400
The whole experience of the University of Tokyo.

2701
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,400
The whole experience of the University of Tokyo.

2702
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,400
A lot of.

2703
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,400
That's what the lab does.

2704
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,400
Is that what it means?

2705
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,400
About a dozen, at the moment.

2706
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,400
About a dozen, at the moment.

2707
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,400
More than 10 is open to the public.

2708
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,400
That is the nanotechnology platform I mentioned at the end.

2709
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,400
The nanotechnology platform I mentioned at the end.

2710
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,400
But there's a part of the teahouse.

2711
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,400
I just said a lot.

2712
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,400
a lot of developers.

2713
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,400
A lot of developers.

2714
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,400
It's their lab.

2715
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,400
It's their lab.

2716
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,400
So I want to ask you.

2717
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,400
So I want to ask you.

2718
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,400
You just mentioned 4D.

2719
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,400
Especially the part of the power plant.

2720
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,400
You still have to use it now.

2721
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,400
What I know is.

2722
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,400
There is no commercial software.

2723
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,400
Let's just do it.

2724
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,400
You still have to have some of your own.

2725
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,400
Now.

2726
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,400
This kind of DPC.

2727
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,400
No, no, no.

2728
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,400
You're the one on the right.

2729
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,400
You're the one on the left.

2730
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,400
I'm on the right.

2731
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,400
You're on the right.

2732
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,400
This is what we do.

2733
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,400
This is what we do.

2734
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,400
They're doing this.

2735
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,400
So they write the code themselves.

2736
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,400
But now.

2737
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,400
I'm going to this year.

2738
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,400
If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.

2739
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,400
If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.

2740
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,400
If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.

2741
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,400
The latest SEMO Fisher.

2742
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,400
The latest SEMO Fisher.

2743
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,400
You can do DPC.

2744
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,400
Because I thought.

2745
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,400
We still have to use Python.

2746
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,400
We still have to use Python.

2747
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,400
If you look at it now.

2748
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,400
You can think of it.

2749
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,400
The one I went to see with the teacher.

2750
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,400
It's not even Titan's DPC.

2751
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,400
It's not even Titan's DPC.

2752
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,400
Python code.

2753
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,400
Python code.

2754
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,400
There are a lot of commercial software.

2755
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,400
There are a lot of commercial software.

2756
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,400
Because of our biggest gold.

2757
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,400
Because of our biggest gold.

2758
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,400
And there's a bear.

2759
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,400
And there's a bear.

2760
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,400
He has been addicted recently.

2761
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,400
He has been addicted recently.

2762
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,400
Because it's the first time he developed it.

2763
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,400
Because it's the first time he developed it.

2764
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,400
But I.

2765
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,400
But I.

2766
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,400
The thing that's below you.

2767
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,400
The thing that's below you.

2768
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,400
The next one I remember one day.

2769
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,400
Just this one.

2770
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,400
The first page.

2771
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,400
The first page.

2772
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,400
This thing.

2773
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,400
No, it's on the next page.

2774
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,400
Sorry.

2775
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,400
So that's it.

2776
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,400
Right.

2777
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,400
This thing was first

2778
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,400
made by a Japanese

2779
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,400
named Nims.

2780
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,400
A Japanese named Nims made it.

2781
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,400
Ah, Nims.

2782
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,400
I go there often.

2783
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,400
What's it called? Kimoto.

2784
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,400
Koji Kimoto.

2785
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,400
And.

2786
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,400
I thought it was commercialized.

2787
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,400
But in fact, they said they didn't.

2788
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,400
They only

2789
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,400
finished the 4D

2790
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,400
process.

2791
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,400
But later,

2792
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,400
at that time,

2793
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,400
in 2011,

2794
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,400
they did it manually.

2795
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,400
But now

2796
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,400
you don't see such a good result.

2797
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,400
Yes.

2798
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,400
Most of the 4D

2799
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,400
that are made now are made in Europe and America.

2800
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,400
I can assure you that

2801
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,400
there are very few people

2802
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,400
who do this in Japan at this stage.

2803
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,400
Very few.

2804
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,400
But I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

2805
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,400
I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

2806
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,400
I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

2807
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,400
I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

2808
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,400
I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.

2809
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,400
I will go to Kimoto's factory

2810
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,400
to do the experiment next week.

2811
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,400
Because this thing.

2812
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,400
Sorry.

2813
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,400
We are talking too professionally.

2814
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,400
To put it simply,

2815
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,400
when every muscle

2816
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,400
has an order

2817
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,400
and a specific direction,

2818
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,400
in Kimoto's theory,

2819
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,400
I know this muscle,

2820
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,400
I know its muscle structure.

2821
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,400
In terms of muscle structure,

2822
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,400
you have the so-called symmetry.

2823
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,400
The most important thing about Kimoto

2824
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,400
is that he talked about

2825
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,400
the symmetry of the Atomic Scale,

2826
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,400
not the

2827
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,400
symmetry of a large muscle.

2828
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,400
He used the

2829
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,400
rightmost picture

2830
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,400
called the most typical

2831
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,400
Pythagorean Theorem.

2832
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,400
He can make

2833
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,400
the so-called

2834
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,400
4D

2835
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,400
figure of the

2836
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,400
Pythagorean Theorem.

2837
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,400
After the 4D figure

2838
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,400
comes out,

2839
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,400
based on the

2840
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,400
inner ring and outer ring,

2841
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,400
you can know the symmetry

2842
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,400
of the muscle structure.

2843
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,400
More importantly,

2844
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,400
in addition to proving this,

2845
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,400
Kimoto also talked about

2846
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,400
why in electromagnetic microscope,

2847
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,400
especially in scanning TM,

2848
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,400
the loss of the atomic scale is larger,

2849
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,400
the loss of the atomic state is second,

2850
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,400
and the loss of the oxygen is the last.

2851
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,400
In his diffraction pattern,

2852
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,400
he told you

2853
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,400
why the image I see now

2854
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,400
has such a big intensity change

2855
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,400
when I circle

2856
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,400
it.

2857
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,400
So in fact,

2858
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,400
I read that paper for a long time,

2859
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,400
and I found that

2860
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,400
I thought there was a commercial software

2861
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,400
that could do the

2862
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,400
post-processing,

2863
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,400
but there was no

2864
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,400
post-processing after

2865
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,400
the commercial software

2866
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,400
did the 4D.

2867
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,400
I think the biggest problem

2868
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,400
now is that,

2869
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,400
as you just said,

2870
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,400
Kimoto himself wrote.

2871
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,400
Yes, because the first time I heard this

2872
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,400
was also in UC Irvine.

2873
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,400
They have a group

2874
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,400
doing this.

2875
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,400
Then when they talked about it,

2876
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,400
I realized that

2877
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,400
in the past,

2878
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,400
they might have

2879
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,400
read Kimoto's paper

2880
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,400
as reading,

2881
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,400
but they didn't mention it,

2882
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,400
because the concept was the same.

2883
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,400
It used to be called Scanning CBET.

2884
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,400
No, the word Kimoto used

2885
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,400
was more fancy,

2886
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,400
called Atomic Scale Symmetry.

2887
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,400
Oh, I see.

2888
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,400
Yes, it's Atomic Scale Symmetry.

2889
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,400
Because if you really do

2890
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,400
the calculation of CBET,

2891
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,400
the CBET pattern

2892
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,400
made by these three elements

2893
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,400
is really different.

2894
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,400
We seem to be talking too professionally.

2895
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,400
Can I ask you a question?

2896
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,400
Sure.

2897
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,400
Sorry.

2898
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,400
Do you have any questions?

2899
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,400
If you have any questions

2900
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,400
about CBET,

2901
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,400
you can ask.

2902
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,400
Hello.

2903
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,400
Can you hear me?

2904
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,400
Yes, I can.

2905
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,400
I want to add

2906
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,400
that UC Irvine

2907
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,400
also has

2908
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,400
user facilities

2909
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,400
for training

2910
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,400
and samples.

2911
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,400
They also have staff

2912
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,400
to do experiments.

2913
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,400
Our group often

2914
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,400
goes to UC Irvine to do TEM.

2915
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,400
I have a question about

2916
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,400
when we were doing

2917
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,400
some low-melt point

2918
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,400
metal TEM,

2919
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,400
we were doing

2920
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,400
cryo TEM,

2921
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,400
but when we were

2922
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,400
using cryo holder,

2923
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,400
we couldn't get

2924
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,400
a very good resolution

2925
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,400
when we were doing

2926
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,400
stem HEDF

2927
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,400
mapping.

2928
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,400
I want to know

2929
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,400
if there are

2930
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,400
other ways

2931
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,400
to do

2932
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,400
low-melting materials

2933
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,400
to get

2934
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,400
a better

2935
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,400
Z-contrast

2936
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,400
or other

2937
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,400
resolutions.

2938
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,400
Thank you for your question.

2939
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,400
My understanding is

2940
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,400
that you can't get

2941
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,400
a very good resolution

2942
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,400
when you are doing cryo

2943
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,400
because your liquid nitrogen

2944
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,400
actually flows.

2945
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,400
You have

2946
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,400
touched liquid nitrogen

2947
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,400
or liquid nitrogen gas,

2948
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,400
and you know

2949
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,400
that it actually flows.

2950
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,400
I think this is

2951
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,400
a big reason

2952
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,400
why you can't get

2953
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,400
a stable Z-contrast.

2954
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,400
You just mentioned

2955
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,400
if there are

2956
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,400
other ways to

2957
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,400
change this or get

2958
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,400
a better resolution.

2959
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,400
I haven't done

2960
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,400
anything like this,

2961
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,400
but what I want to mention

2962
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,400
is that

2963
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,400
for example,

2964
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,400
when you look at

2965
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,400
high-resolution images,

2966
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,400
you can't get

2967
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,400
a very good image

2968
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,400
because your strength

2969
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,400
is too weak.

2970
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,400
David Miller Group

2971
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,400
used a method

2972
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,400
called TychoGraphy

2973
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,400
in 2018,

2974
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,400
which is 4D stem.

2975
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,400
They used this method

2976
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,400
to get a more blurry

2977
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,400
graphic image

2978
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,400
with higher resolution

2979
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,400
and higher resolution.

2980
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,400
That paper is also

2981
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,400
a very famous paper

2982
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,400
by Nature.

2983
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,400
If you have any

2984
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,400
information about

2985
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,400
David Miller Group,

2986
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,400
you can add it.

2987
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,400
But as far as I know,

2988
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,400
it is very suitable for

2989
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,400
people who can't get

2990
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,400
a high resolution image.

2991
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:23,400
This 4D stem can help you.

2992
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,400
I think that's it.

2993
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,400
I guess

2994
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,400
Cryo's problem is that

2995
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,400
your sample stage

2996
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,400
moves too fast,

2997
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,400
so you can't get a good image.

2998
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,400
There are several ways

2999
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,400
about this.

3000
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,400
One way is to scan very fast

3001
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,400
and scan a lot of pages.

3002
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,400
Then you fold it up

3003
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,400
in a post-processing way

3004
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,400
to get a good image.

3005
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,400
This method was developed

3006
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,400
by Lena Kakoudis

3007
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,400
Cryo Stem.

3008
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,400
We can try it.

3009
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,400
Thank you.

3010
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,400
I have a question.

3011
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,400
Before I talk about this question,

3012
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,400
I have a small comment.

3013
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,400
Because I am

3014
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,400
the speaker today,

3015
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,400
Project Hera.

3016
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,400
We are staff.

3017
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,400
I strongly recommend

3018
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,400
you to keep in touch.

3019
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,400
If you can keep in touch

3020
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,400
and help each other,

3021
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,400
it is the biggest reward for us.

3022
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,400
You feel the same, right?

3023
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,400
Yes.

3024
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,400
This is a small comment.

3025
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,400
I suggest you

3026
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,400
to keep in touch.

3027
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,400
If you think Project Hera

3028
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,400
is helpful to you,

3029
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,400
you can recommend it to others.

3030
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,400
My question is this.

3031
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,400
This is a crazy idea.

3032
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,400
If I have a sample today,

3033
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,400
what if I put it down

3034
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,400
for five years?

3035
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,400
Keep taking pictures.

3036
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,400
What is the resolution

3037
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,400
you want to achieve?

3038
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,400
A sample

3039
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,400
can be placed

3040
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,400
in the middle of your screen.

3041
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,400
Actually,

3042
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,400
I want to measure

3043
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,400
the distance between

3044
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,400
all the atoms.

3045
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,400
But I am waiting

3046
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,400
for something to happen.

3047
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,400
Why do I want to monitor?

3048
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,400
Because what I expect

3049
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,400
is not static.

3050
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,400
The distribution of the atom

3051
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,400
is like this,

3052
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,400
but suddenly it moves.

3053
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,400
Why did I

3054
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,400
take a picture of you

3055
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,400
for a long time?

3056
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,400
Because I think

3057
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,400
what I expect

3058
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,400
is the time scale

3059
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,400
from 10s to 100s microseconds.

3060
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,400
So if you take a picture

3061
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,400
for two seconds,

3062
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,400
you will miss it easily.

3063
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,400
I just said

3064
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,400
taking a picture for two seconds

3065
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,400
means a lot of pixels.

3066
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,400
One pixel is

3067
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,400
about 20 microseconds,

3068
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,400
which I often use.

3069
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,400
But maybe

3070
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,400
I still can't catch

3071
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,400
what you want.

3072
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,400
Another big problem

3073
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,400
is that I'm not sure

3074
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,400
how much electron radiation

3075
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,400
your sample can withstand.

3076
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,400
Because this is

3077
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:23,400
a key problem

3078
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,400
for TEM.

3079
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,400
If your sample can withstand

3080
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,400
infinite electron radiation,

3081
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,400
of course you can do

3082
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,400
similar experiments.

3083
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:35,400
But if your sample can only withstand

3084
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,400
one minute,

3085
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,400
you will have damage,

3086
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,400
or you have some carbon damage,

3087
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,400
or you can even

3088
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,400
pierce your sample.

3089
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,400
Then you won't be able to do such experiments.

3090
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,400
I think

3091
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,400
I will think

3092
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,400
from this perspective.

3093
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,400
Actually,

3094
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,400
this is what I think.

3095
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,400
Radiation damage.

3096
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,400
We are used to discussing

3097
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,400
what is an electron,

3098
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,400
one, two, three.

3099
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,400
We rarely discuss

3100
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,400
what is an electron.

3101
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:13,400
But basically,

3102
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,400
this is what happens in electrons.

3103
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:17,400
Yes.

3104
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,400
Actually, there is such a lab.

3105
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,400
In Sandia National Lab,

3106
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,400
they have connected

3107
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,400
a particle beam

3108
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,400
to hit your sample,

3109
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,400
to look at your

3110
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,400
radiation damage.

3111
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,400
There is such a thing.

3112
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,400
Time resolution can barely reach millisecond.

3113
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:39,400
There are

3114
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,400
faster detectors,

3115
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,400
about 400 frames per second,

3116
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,400
or 2000 frames per second.

3117
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,400
It can barely reach

3118
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,400
millisecond.

3119
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,400
Okay, let me ask.

3120
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,400
We are actually doing

3121
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,400
carbon-based

3122
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,400
spectroscopy detector

3123
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,400
in Sandia.

3124
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,400
Okay, thank you.

3125
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,400
They mainly look at

3126
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,400
radiation.

3127
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,400
I can comment on

3128
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,400
the microscope in Sandia.

3129
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,400
If they use

3130
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,400
photoelectron,

3131
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:17,400
they can make the electron pulse to nanosecond.

3132
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,400
So if your sample

3133
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,400
is beautiful enough,

3134
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,400
although it does not show

3135
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,400
a sample like a sample,

3136
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,400
but if it sounds

3137
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,400
like a millisecond,

3138
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,400
for example,

3139
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:33,400
if you want to do it in a shorter time,

3140
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:35,400
you can do it.

3141
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,400
I want to ask a question.

3142
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,400
You just mentioned

3143
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,400
that it can measure electric field

3144
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,400
and magnetic field.

3145
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,400
How good is the sensitivity?

3146
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,400
I can tell you that

3147
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,400
they all say

3148
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:59,400
atomic resolution,

3149
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,400
but I'm not sure

3150
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,400
how good it is.

3151
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,400
I don't know if you've heard of

3152
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,400
something called

3153
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,400
SCAMEL.

3154
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,400
Some people use

3155
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,400
such a device to measure

3156
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,400
SCAMEL.

3157
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,400
If you want to go to

3158
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,400
atomic resolution,

3159
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,400
that is,

3160
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,400
for example,

3161
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,400
I think

3162
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,400
this TEM

3163
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,400
considers

3164
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,400
whether the magnetic field

3165
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,400
penetrates your sample.

3166
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,400
This is a key question.

3167
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,400
If you use

3168
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,400
something without any magnetic field penetration,

3169
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,400
you can really determine

3170
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,400
if your magnetic field

3171
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,400
really comes from a very local area.

3172
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:53,400
But if you always have

3173
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,400
a general TEM,

3174
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,400
that is, there is a magnetic field

3175
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,400
that penetrates your sample,

3176
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,400
I'm not sure

3177
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,400
how good your resolution is.

3178
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,400
Sorry, my question is

3179
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,400
that you may have misunderstood my question.

3180
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,400
My question is not about

3181
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,400
how good the spatial resolution is.

3182
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,400
My question is,

3183
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,400
for example,

3184
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,400
what is the magnetic field

3185
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,400
or magnetic field

3186
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,400
that can be measured

3187
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,400
at a micrometer level?

3188
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,400
I'm sorry,

3189
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,400
I don't know how much this number is.

3190
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,400
Because what we currently see

3191
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,400
is that its principle

3192
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,400
is to look at your electron,

3193
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,400
at least the principle of DPC

3194
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,400
is to see how much your electron beam

3195
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,400
deviates.

3196
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,400
You can know its direction

3197
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,400
and its strength

3198
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,400
by doing this.

3199
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,400
You get something like this,

3200
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,400
for example,

3201
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,400
a map of the direction

3202
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,400
from the center.

3203
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,400
To be honest,

3204
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,400
I'm not sure

3205
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,400
how strong it is.

3206
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,400
OK, I can go back and look at these questions.

3207
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,400
Thank you.

3208
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,400
Thank you.

3209
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,400
OK,

3210
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,400
if there are no other questions,

3211
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:13,400
I will end the recording

3212
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,400
here.
