00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You can find the recording online a week and a half later.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you have any questions during this process,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you can leave a comment in the chat box.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We will have Q&A time at the end for everyone to ask questions.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's get started.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you everyone for listening to my presentation.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello everyone, I'm Lai Jun-Hai.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can call me Matt.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
First of all, I would like to thank Tyra for inviting me to share my research.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let me introduce myself.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm from Yonghe, Hsinchu.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I graduated from National University of China.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I worked as an engineer for a year and a half at BASF in Taiwan.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then I went to UCLA to study engineering.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I graduated in 2017.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I am currently working at Startup Battery Streak.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
At the same time, I am also a visiting scholar at UCLA.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My main work is focused on the development and mass production of new battery materials,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
as well as the transfer between the company and UCLA.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Today's topic is

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Designing pseudo-capacitance for fast-charging batteries.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That is, how to apply the mechanism of solid-state batteries to fast-charging batteries.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
First of all, why do we need fast-charging batteries?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The first motivation is the accumulation of electromagnetic traffic.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Charging stations are currently set up in three levels.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The first level is the plug-in that everyone puts at home.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It can charge 3 to 6 kilometers per hour.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The second level is the charging station in the parking lot.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It can charge 20 to 30 kilometers per hour.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The third level is the fastest Tesla charging station.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It can charge 5 kilometers per minute.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Interestingly, the current charging station is still far less than the gas station.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But it is almost impossible to see such a long queue at the charging station.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Not everyone has an electric car,

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but 5 kilometers per minute is still too slow compared to the time required for gas.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The second application of fast-charging batteries is the popularization of renewable energy.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
As of last year, renewable energy has reached one-third of the global power generation.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
50% of the power generation comes from renewable energy.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Other European countries also reach 20 to 30% of renewable power.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We all know that when wind and solar energy are converted into electricity,

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
they must be paired with suitable batteries.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
However, these batteries can't be charged quickly,

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
so they are inefficient.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
For example, when the wind speed is fast,

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
there will be a momentary large current.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The batteries that can't be charged at low power

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
will become waste heat and reduce the life of the battery.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So basically, this concept is the same as the concept of fast-charging batteries paired with aging cell phones.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The third application of fast-charging batteries is plant-based medical equipment.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Generally, the supply of such equipment is made up of a battery paired with a capacitor,

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
which is in the box at the bottom left.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Generally, the battery is used to monitor the function of low power for a long time,

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
while the capacitor is used to respond to high power in a short time.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Due to the limited size of the equipment and the need for different organ parts,

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
a single high-power battery is used to replace the two-in-one mode.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This has always been the trend in the development of this type of equipment power supply.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Of course, in addition to the above three applications,

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
there are other applications.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I won't go into detail here.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So in this main speech,

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
it mainly introduces how to improve the power density and energy density of the storage components using the materials of the capacitor.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
As shown in the picture on the left,

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the x-axis is the energy density,

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and the y-axis is the power density.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
First, I will briefly introduce the materials of the storage components and the techniques required for analysis.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then, the first part will start with the high-power supercapacitor material in blue.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then, the high-power characteristics will be achieved by using a non-oxidized carbonate residue.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The second part will start with the lithium battery.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Here is an example of fluorine,

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
L-NBOPF,

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
which achieves high power density by nanomerizing the battery material.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Generally, batteries or supercapacitors are basically composed of two terminals.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The positive terminal and the negative terminal are placed on the aluminum foil and copper foil respectively.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The two terminals are separated by a multi-hole separator,

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
which is the middle part of the separator,

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
to avoid short-circuit.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
When charging the battery, the lithium battery moves in the capacitor,

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and the battery material produces an oxidation reaction.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
At the same time, the battery moves in the external circuit to achieve the balance of the electric current.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The electric current is the main focus of our discussion today.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It is mainly composed of the storage material, carbon, and the high-voltage supercapacitor.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The electric current needs to have a certain vacuum.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It is like a sponge.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It must contain enough electrolysis.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
At the same time, it must have enough conductivity to be a high-voltage supercapacitor.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Although the structure of the battery and the capacitor are the same,

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the storage mechanism is completely different.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The mechanism of the capacitor is absorbed by the lithium.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In the external circuit, the aluminum foil and the copper foil are separated and absorbed by the surface of the battery.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because the lithium is absorbed by the surface for a short time,

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
this mechanism is most conducive to fast charging.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The disadvantage is that its surface area is limited,

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
so the density of energy is generally low.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In contrast, the storage method of the battery

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
uses the oxidation reaction inside the material.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In this case, the lithium can enter the material,

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and its energy is far greater than that of the capacitor.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
However, since the lithium moves very slowly inside the material,

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it is therefore unable to do high-speed charging.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Next, we will introduce how to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Basically, it is based on electrical chemistry analysis.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We will make the pre-analyzed material into an electrolyte

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and test it in the same electrolyte solution.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Generally, the device to be tested

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
has a single-phase electrolyte test on the upper left,

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and a double-phase torque battery test on the lower left.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There are two main methods of testing.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The first method is the cyclic voltammetry,

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
which is abbreviated as CV.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The principle is to change the speed of voltage change

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to measure the change in current.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The second method is the DC voltage test,

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
which is abbreviated as GC.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In the case of DC voltage charging,

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
it measures the change in voltage of the battery

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and makes a diagram of the voltage.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Now we use GC and CV to get the diagram

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They are two different storage mechanisms.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The capacitor on the left can be seen that

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the CV is a rectangle,

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
while the GC is basically a diagonal.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The battery on the right is composed of a set of peaks,

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
while the GC is mainly composed of a horizontal line.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Now that we know how to judge the material of the battery

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and the material of the capacitor,

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
we can look for the material of the fast charging battery.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What characteristics do we hope the fast charging battery has?

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We hope it has the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry on the left,

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
which allows it to be a fast charging battery.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It also has the characteristics of the material on the right,

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
which increases the density of energy

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
by storing energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is the material we are looking for.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The material of the capacitor

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
not only has a rectangle CV,

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but also a diagonal GC,

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and it stores energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Next, I will talk about the main character I will introduce today,

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
which is the T-Phased,

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Orphohombic Phased,

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
NB205.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Next, I will call it NIOVIA.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In addition to having the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry,

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
its energy density

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
is equivalent to the energy density of lithium carbon dioxide,

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
which is in the lithium-ion battery.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Its energy density is 10 times that of the capacitor.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Its power density,

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
which is the power of its fast charging,

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
can also reach 10 times that of the battery.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Its only drawback is that

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
it is still oxygen-chloride,

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
so its power consumption

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is the first topic we are going to fix.

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The first part

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is to mix carbon with NIOVIA

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
to improve the properties of NIOVIA.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We need to deduce a good NIOVIA,

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and we will eventually deduce

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
what kind of properties a good NIOVIA battery needs

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to show the characteristics of its lithium-ion battery.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A good NIOVIA battery

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
basically needs two parts.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The first is the high-voltage part,

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and the second is the part that can have a high pore density.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
In this study,

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
we mainly used three materials.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The first material is our protagonist, NIOVIA.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The second material is our chemical-capable

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Reduced Graphene Oxide, also known as RGO.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Its purpose is to provide short-term conductivity.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The third material

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is the one on the far right,

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Carbide Derived Carbon, also known as CDC.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It is a kind of carbon dioxide.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Its main purpose is that

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
it has a polypore structure

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and its size is in the micrometer level,

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
so it can provide long-term conductivity.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The way we prepare the battery

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is to first plant NIOVIA on RGO.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO with CDC

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
to get NIOVIA RGO CDC,

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
also known as NRC.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Finally, we make NRC

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
into a commercial-grade battery

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and test it to prove that

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it has a high-power and high-density

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
storage characteristics

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
at the right pore density.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This slide shows the details of the material equipment.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The main equipment is

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the water-heating method.

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We put the precursor

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
into the autoclave

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and heat it up to 180°C

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
for 12 hours.

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Next, we wash the particles

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and dry them.

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
After drying,

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
we heat it up to 500°C

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to get the body structure we want,

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
which is T-phase,

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
or ophiobic phase.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
with CDC.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The main purpose is to

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
make this composite material

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
in the form of surface electrolysis.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Next, we make it into a battery

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and test it.

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We have 20% NIOVIA,

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
40% NRC20,

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and 60% NRC20.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The BET on the right

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
is the analysis of the surface electrolysis.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It shows that

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the surface electrolysis of the material

220
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
increases with the

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
composition of the CDC.

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This means that

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
this composite method

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
does not cause the CDC to lose its surface area,

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
or the CDC to be less airtight,

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
or its structure to collapse.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Therefore, we can use

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
a simple ratio to

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
achieve the airtightness we need.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There are also two black dots on the picture.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
These two black dots

232
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
are where we directly plant NIOVIA

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
on the CDC.

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If we

235
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
do not use

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
this composite method

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
but use

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the water-heat method

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to directly plant it on the CDC,

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
at high temperature,

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
the CDC's

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
surface area

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
will...

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Because the surface area is too large,

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
the surface area will decrease

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
at high temperature.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We want to use the CDC

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to improve the airtightness

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
of the electrode.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is the idea.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Next, we need to

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
use the CV to judge the electrode.

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's see if it is like a battery material

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
or an electric material.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
In the case of changing the minority,

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
we can get the corresponding current.

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Therefore, we use the current

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to make judgments with the change of the minority.

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If the

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
material is like a battery,

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the change of the current

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
will be multiplied by the minority.

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If the material

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
is like a capacitor,

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the current

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
will be multiplied by the minority.

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
In other words,

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
when the minority is doubled,

269
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the current will be doubled.

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Combining these two formulas,

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
we can get

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
the following formula

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
from the experiment.

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The current is equal to the magnitude

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
multiplied by the minority.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is called

277
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
B-value analysis.

278
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We want the material

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to be as fast as the capacitor.

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Therefore, we want the B-value

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to be as close to 1 as possible.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This proves that the material

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
can do high-speed charging.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Next,

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the NRC

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
can store different

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
current

288
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
at different speeds.

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
On the left,

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
we use the minority

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to burn the NRC.

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The lowest value

293
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
is 100% Cdc.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The way

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
we control the minority

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
is from the slowest 30-minute

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
charging point on the left to the

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
90-second charging point on the right.

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The y-axis is the energy generated by me.

300
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
As time goes by,

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
the energy generated by me

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
will be reduced.

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We want the line to be as flat as possible.

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This means that the material

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
can do high-speed charging

306
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
as well as low-speed charging.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The lowest value is 100% Cdc.

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
As the amount of niobia increases,

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the density of the NRC

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
will also increase.

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Up to 40%, the increased current

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
will not be affected by the minority.

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
From 0% to 20% to 40%,

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the current will remain as flat.

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
From 0% to 60%,

316
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the NRC will be

317
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
charged at 90 seconds.

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The current is

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
less than 40%.

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The highest value, 100%,

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
although the total

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
current is

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
less than 40%,

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
we can expect

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
that when the charging time

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
is less than 90 seconds,

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the NRC will increase by 40%.

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
On the right is the B-value

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
introduced in the previous page.

330
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
When the curve

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
is closer to 1,

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
we mainly do CV

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
for different materials.

334
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Then we do

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
the analysis of B-value.

336
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The result of the analysis is in the lower right corner.

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When the curve is closer to 1,

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
it means that the charging speed is faster.

339
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
By this, we can judge

340
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that the charging speed of

341
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
NRC40 is faster than

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
NRC60 and 100%

343
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
of NIOBIA.

344
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This also proves that when 60%

345
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
of the CVC is stored in the electrode,

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the electrode has sufficient airtightness

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
to accommodate sufficient electrolysis

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to show the characteristics

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
of NIOBIA lithium-ion battery.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Finally,

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
we combine the NRC40

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
with the traditional lithium-ion electrode

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
to form a full electrode

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to do

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
the analysis of CV

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and GC.

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In terms of CV,

358
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
we can get

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the characteristics of the lithium-ion

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
we just talked about,

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
which is that it is a rectangular CV.

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
In terms of GC,

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
we also get

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
a oblique GC.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
At the same time,

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
due to the combination of NIOBIA,

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
we not only

368
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
increase the energy density

369
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
at low power,

370
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
but also increase the energy density

371
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
at high power.

372
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
At the power of

373
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
3000W per kg,

374
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
we can store

375
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
up to 23W

376
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
per kg of energy density.

377
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Next,

378
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I will briefly summarize the figure on the right.

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The first part

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
is that we use the amount of Cdc

381
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to adjust the airtightness and

382
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
conductivity of the NRC composite material.

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
At the same time,

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
it has high energy and

385
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
fast charging characteristics.

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
In other words,

387
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
we use Cdc as the starting point

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to mix different NIOBIA

389
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
to increase its energy density.

390
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
By maximizing the airtightness and conductivity,

391
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
we can increase

392
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the overall

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
energy density of the NRC

394
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and preserve

395
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the high power characteristics of Cdc.

396
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The second part

397
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I want to share is

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the LNVOPF material

399
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
as a medical equipment energy supply application.

400
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Speaking of medical equipment energy supply,

401
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I will use

402
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
an implantable

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
cardioverter

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
defibrillator

405
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
ICD

406
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
as an example.

407
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Its Chinese name is

408
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
implantable defibrillator.

409
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It basically

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
detects your heart beat.

411
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
When your heart beats abnormally,

412
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
it will use

413
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
high current to stimulate your heart beat.

414
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
For example,

415
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
when your heart stops beating,

416
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it will stimulate your heart beat.

417
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I am not a medical background,

418
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
so I only understand

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the basic concept of this device.

420
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The main usage method

421
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
is still left to the doctor.

422
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
ICD

423
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
mainly uses

424
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
high current and low current output.

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The low current part

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
is mainly responsible for the battery.

427
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The high current part

428
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
is responsible for the circuit board.

429
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There is also a device size

430
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
at the bottom.

431
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The size is about one-fourth of the heart.

432
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Most of the area

433
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
is actually from the low-voltage circuit.

434
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Another

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
medical device

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
is

437
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
DBS

438
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Deep Brain Stimulator.

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Deep Brain Stimulator.

440
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This type of device

441
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
has the same principle,

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
but the current demand

443
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
is smaller than ICD.

444
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
DBS mainly stimulates

445
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the brain nerve.

446
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
DBS mainly stimulates

447
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
the brain nerve.

448
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
DBS mainly stimulates

449
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
the brain nerve.

450
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The power supply

451
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
is also made up of

452
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
a battery and a circuit.

453
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
When we want to

454
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
put this medical device

455
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
in the body,

456
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
we hope that

457
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
its size can be smaller and better

458
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
to save more space.

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
For example,

460
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
we want to find a material

461
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
that has the characteristics of a battery and a circuit.

462
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We need to make a device

463
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
either a circuit

464
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
or a battery.

465
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We want to make a device

466
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that prefers a battery

467
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
because the size of the battery is smaller.

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We use a single storage device

469
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
to provide these two currents.

470
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This way we can save a lot of

471
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the power supply

472
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and medical equipment space.

473
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This material

474
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
is

475
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
LNVOPF.

476
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
LNVOPF

477
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
mainly comes from

478
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the transformation of

479
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
the structure of

480
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the nascon-nucleotide conductor.

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
After being mixed,

482
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the voltage of the

483
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
LNVOPF

484
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
increases,

485
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
which means it can

486
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
store more energy.

487
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
When I

488
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
put this

489
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
in the body,

490
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the change in

491
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
the size of the

492
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
LNVOPF

493
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
also decreases.

494
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
This means that

495
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the size of the

496
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
LNVOPF

497
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
is similar to

498
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
the lithium carbon dioxide

499
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
in the battery.

500
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The most important thing is

501
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
that this material

502
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
has the characteristics of

503
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
battery and current.

504
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Next we will introduce

505
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
another way to

506
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
distinguish the battery

507
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
from the current,

508
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
which is to use

509
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
X-ray diffraction

510
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
XRD analysis

511
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
to find out

512
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
if there is a change

513
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
in the structure of the

514
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
metal body,

515
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
which is the

516
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
x-ray diffraction

517
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
in the material.

518
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
In general, the charge of the

519
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
battery follows the

520
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
x-ray diffraction,

521
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
while the charge of the

522
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
nucleotide is

523
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
stored in the

524
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
solid.

525
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
In low voltage peak,

526
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
it follows the x-ray diffraction,

527
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
while in high voltage peak,

528
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
there is no x-ray diffraction.

529
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
This means that this material

530
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
can be used as a battery

531
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
in low voltage,

532
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and can be used as a current

533
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
in high voltage.

534
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But this

535
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
thing is not as simple as you think.

536
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This material

537
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is charged twice

538
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
every hour

539
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Here,

540
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
let me introduce a little bit.

541
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
When we talk about charging,

542
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
we use a unit called C-ray.

543
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
This unit

544
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
C-ray

545
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Everyone says a few Cs,

546
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
which means it can charge several times

547
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
in an hour.

548
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So in this material,

549
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
it charges twice

550
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
every hour,

551
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
which is the part of 2C.

552
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Basically, it can also store

553
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
80-90% of the charge.

554
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But when you

555
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
shorten the charging time to

556
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
3 minutes, it can only charge

557
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
8%.

558
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The reason is that during the charging process,

559
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
it will charge the battery first.

560
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Then it

561
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
goes through the capacitor part.

562
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But because the charging speed of the battery part

563
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
is too slow today,

564
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I can't even charge the capacitor.

565
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So

566
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
it's a bit like this.

567
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Mainly because the charging speed of the battery

568
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
is too slow,

569
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the overall charging speed

570
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
will decrease.

571
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Next,

572
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
this study

573
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is to use

574
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the material nanometrization

575
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
to shorten the time

576
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and distance

577
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
of the particles in the material

578
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to increase the

579
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
charging speed of the material.

580
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Next,

581
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
we are going to synthesize

582
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
this nanometer NVOPF

583
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and discuss

584
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
the size of the size

585
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
for fast charging.

586
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
First, the way we make it is

587
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
to put all our

588
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
materials into

589
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
this solvent thermal

590
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
method to synthesize. We also put it

591
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
into the pressure suit.

592
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
After

593
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
12 hours,

594
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
after 185°C,

595
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
we take out the material and

596
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
clean it.

597
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We will dry it.

598
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Next, we use

599
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
XRD, X-ray diffraction, to confirm the material.

600
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
After confirming that the material

601
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
has no problems and no impurities

602
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
in it, we will make it

603
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
an electrode for electromagnetic testing.

604
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Here,

605
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
we use

606
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the ratio of the material

607
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and the temperature of the

608
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
synthesis to get different

609
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
shapes of NVOPF.

610
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Basically, this NVOPF is a

611
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
rectangular body.

612
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We usually get a brick

613
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
shape.

614
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
If it is longer,

615
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
it becomes a rod.

616
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
If it is shorter, it becomes a pellet.

617
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If the pellet is small, it becomes a particle.

618
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We are going to

619
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
discuss the shape

620
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
of the NVOPF

621
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and the size of it.

622
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We will also discuss the impact of its

623
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
reaction speed.

624
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Next, we

625
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
use the b-value method

626
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
to analyze

627
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
the properties of the fast charge.

628
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
In the first step, we

629
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
make a different number of

630
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
CVs for the material.

631
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
From these four peaks,

632
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
we can get

633
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
individual b-values.

634
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Then, we make

635
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
b-values with different

636
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
aspect ratios,

637
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
different widths,

638
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and its size

639
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
to see

640
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
how it changes.

641
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
On the left,

642
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
this is the NVOPF

643
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
pellet.

644
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
On the right,

645
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
we use the rod

646
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
to make changes.

647
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The aspect ratio

648
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
gradually decreases to

649
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
the brick shape,

650
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and finally to the pellet shape.

651
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The b-value

652
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
decreases as the aspect ratio

653
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
decreases.

654
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
When we decrease the aspect ratio

655
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
of the material,

656
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
the characteristics of the fast charge

657
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
will be more and more like a capacitor.

658
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It can be used

659
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
as a material for high-speed charge.

660
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
On the other hand,

661
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
we also

662
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
compare

663
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
the particle size

664
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to the b-value.

665
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We combine

666
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
microns

667
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and microns.

668
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Then, we reduce to nanometers.

669
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
From hundreds of nanometers

670
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
to dozens of nanometers.

671
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We can see that

672
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
when the size decreases,

673
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
the b-value also increases.

674
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The increase in b-value

675
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
means that the smaller the particle,

676
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the more suitable it is

677
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
to be used

678
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
as a capacitor.

679
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The focus here

680
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
is on the microbrick.

681
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Its peak b-value

682
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
is close to 0.5.

683
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
0.5 means

684
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the same reaction as a battery.

685
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
When we make a nanoparticle,

686
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
all the reactions

687
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
of the oxidation reaction

688
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
have a b-value

689
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
of 0.7 or higher.

690
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Next,

691
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we do the charge-resistance test.

692
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The nanoparticle

693
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
of NVOPF

694
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
can charge up to 90%

695
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
in 2 hours

696
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
in 3 minutes.

697
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This means that

698
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
after the nanoparticle

699
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
of NVOPF

700
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
has been nanoparticulated,

701
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the reaction rate

702
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
of the battery

703
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
has increased significantly.

704
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
This also leads to an increase

705
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
in the reaction rate of our capacitors.

706
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The NVOPF

707
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and nanoparticles

708
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
of NVOPF

709
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
can charge up to 80%

710
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
in 100 seconds.

711
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We mainly test

712
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
two temperatures.

713
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The first is room temperature.

714
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The second is 37 degrees,

715
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
which is our human body temperature.

716
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The main reason for this test

717
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is that we want to put this material

718
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
into the human body.

719
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
In this environment,

720
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the NVOPF

721
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
can charge up to 80%

722
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
in 100 seconds

723
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
in the human body

724
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
temperature.

725
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The energy

726
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
of the NVOPF

727
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
can reach

728
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
100 watts

729
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
per kilogram

730
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
in 4000 watts

731
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
per kilogram.

732
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
This means that

733
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
the energy density

734
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
of the NVOPF

735
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
can reach 100 watts

736
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
per kilogram.

737
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Finally, we apply

738
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
this material

739
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
to the

740
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Deep Brain Stimulator

741
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
DBS application.

742
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We all know that

743
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
this device

744
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
must have

745
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
a soldering mode

746
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and a battery mode.

747
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
We charge it

748
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
with a fixed current.

749
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Then the current

750
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
will convert the energy

751
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
to output

752
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
in the form of a capacitor.

753
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So we designed

754
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
two different modes.

755
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The first is the capacitor mode,

756
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
which means that both charging and discharging

757
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
are soldering.

758
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The capacitor mode

759
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
allows us to

760
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
detect

761
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
the overall

762
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
amount of current

763
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
in the body.

764
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The discharging mode

765
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
allows us to

766
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
give feedback to the body

767
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and use the current

768
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
to perform different

769
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
treatments.

770
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So there are these two modes.

771
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The battery mode

772
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
uses the soldering mode

773
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
to charge the battery.

774
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The capacitor mode

775
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
uses the

776
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
discharging mode

777
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
to discharge.

778
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So the capacitor mode is

779
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
discharging.

780
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The battery mode

781
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
uses the discharging mode

782
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
to discharge.

783
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So basically,

784
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
we use these two modes

785
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
to operate the battery.

786
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The battery

787
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
can discharge

788
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
up to 1,000 rounds

789
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
in this mode

790
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
with the

791
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
electric current

792
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and the high-speed

793
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
discharging current

794
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
of the soldering current.

795
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
In each round,

796
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
it can provide

797
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
at least 3,000 soldering

798
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
to measure

799
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and give feedback.

800
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
The battery can also

801
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
provide 60% electric current.

802
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Let's compare

803
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
our battery

804
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
with the current

805
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
DBS specifications.

806
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Basically,

807
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
our output current

808
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
is from 4,000

809
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
microampere,

810
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
which is 4 mA

811
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
to 12 mA.

812
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Compared to the current specifications,

813
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
our current

814
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
output current

815
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
is greater than

816
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
these specifications.

817
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
In terms of frequency,

818
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
we can only measure

819
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
a few microseconds

820
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
on the device

821
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
because

822
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
the device

823
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
only measures 50Hz.

824
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This 50Hz

825
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
also covers

826
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
the frequency required

827
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
for some of these functions.

828
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Next,

829
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I will use this graph

830
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
to make a brief summary.

831
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
In the second part,

832
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
we use nanoparticle

833
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
to convert the

834
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
NBOPF, which cannot be

835
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
fast charged,

836
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
into fast charge.

837
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
In addition,

838
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
we also proved the

839
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
feasibility of the

840
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
soldering current

841
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
in DBS.

842
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Let me make a brief summary.

843
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
What is

844
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the so-called

845
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
take-home message?

846
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
First, I hope everyone

847
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
knows what a soldering current is.

848
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
A soldering current is

849
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
actually a storage mechanism

850
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
that has the power of the

851
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
soldering current and the

852
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
density of the battery.

853
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The second point is

854
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
how we can judge the soldering current.

855
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Of course, it is through

856
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
the method of electromagnetic mechanics.

857
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We have such a CV,

858
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
a oblique GC,

859
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and no change

860
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
in the material during

861
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the oxidation process.

862
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Finally,

863
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
how do we design a soldering current?

864
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Mainly,

865
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
there are three points in my demo.

866
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The first is

867
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the conductivity and

868
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
airtightness.

869
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
The conductivity and

870
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
airtightness of my electrode

871
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
can optimize my soldering current.

872
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The second point is

873
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
to nanomaterialize the material

874
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and adjust its phase change

875
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
so that the material of our

876
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
general battery

877
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
is not

878
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
too slow

879
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
in the transfer of ions.

880
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
In the part of the battery,

881
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
it can

882
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
reach the high speed

883
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
charging point.

884
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Thank you for your attention.

885
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
If you have any questions,

886
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
please feel free to ask.

887
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Thank you.

888
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Thank you, Matt.

889
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Now we can

890
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
start the Q&A.

891
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
In the chat box,

892
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Gavin has some questions.

893
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Do you want to unmute

894
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and ask your question?

895
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I would like to ask

896
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
what is the electrolyte used

897
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
when you start soldering?

898
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It should be an organic electrolyte.

899
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Because your reference electrode

900
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
is for aluminum.

901
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That's right.

902
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I use

903
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
LiPF6

904
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
ECDMC.

905
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It is an electrolyte

906
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
for lithium battery.

907
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So we can understand

908
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
why your lowest voltage

909
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
is around 1.2V.

910
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Another question is

911
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
what is the distribution

912
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
of the oxygen-oxide

913
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
in the electrode?

914
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Because recently,

915
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
there is no supercapacitor.

916
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I believe the distribution

917
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
of oxygen-oxide

918
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
should be an interesting

919
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
or important question.

920
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Basically,

921
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
the distribution

922
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
is between

923
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
1.2V and

924
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
1.2V to 3V.

925
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Here.

926
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The distribution

927
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
is from 1.2V

928
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
to 2.5V.

929
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Here.

930
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The capacity

931
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
of niobium oxide

932
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
should be

933
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
200mA.

934
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
When it is full, it is 200mA.

935
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
From 1.2V to 2.5V

936
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
means 90% of the voltage

937
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
comes from here.

938
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Does it mean that

939
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
when it is less than 1.2V,

940
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
it will be more than 2.5V?

941
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
When it is less than 1.2V,

942
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the electrolyte will be dissociated.

943
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The material won't be dissociated.

944
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
When it is more than 2.5V,

945
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you can't see

946
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
the value of the current.

947
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The current will be

948
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
close to zero.

949
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It is the same as

950
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
this picture.

951
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The CV is the same.

952
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It will be less than

953
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
3V.

954
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Basically, it is less than 3V.

955
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
OK.

956
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You showed this slide,

957
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
so I want to ask you

958
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
the following question.

959
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
How do you calculate

960
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
the B-value and the electrolyte?

961
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We scan different CVs.

962
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Each CV

963
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
has a current

964
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
at each voltage.

965
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We analyze

966
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
each current

967
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
for the change of the minority.

968
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
B-value should be

969
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
less than 3V,

970
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
or it doesn't matter

971
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
even if it is any current.

972
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
In pseudo-capacitor,

973
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
basically,

974
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
there are

975
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
consecutive

976
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
redox reactions.

977
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
When you produce

978
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
a box,

979
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
you only analyze

980
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the current at the peak.

981
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You are not fair

982
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
to the electrons

983
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Basically,

984
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
in pseudo-capacitor,

985
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
you can use this formula

986
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
on all CVs

987
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
to draw the continuous curve.

988
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Another story

989
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
behind this is

990
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
the redox happens

991
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
below 2V.

992
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It is less than 2V.

993
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
What do you see without redox?

994
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You see EDLC.

995
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
What does EDLC mean?

996
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
EDLC means

997
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
the reaction

998
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
of the electron.

999
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
For example,

1000
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the electron travels

1001
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
from far away

1002
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
to the surface of the electrode.

1003
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
What do you mean by diffusion control?

1004
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Yes.

1005
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
In addition,

1006
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
we increase

1007
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the density of Cdc,

1008
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
which increases the vacuum of the electrode.

1009
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Without redox,

1010
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
the kinetic

1011
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
energy of the electrode

1012
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
increases.

1013
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
With redox,

1014
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the kinetic energy of the electrode

1015
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
also increases.

1016
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Any other questions?

1017
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Thank you.

1018
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The last question

1019
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
is the last one.

1020
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Any other questions?

1021
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I will ask later.

1022
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Any other

1023
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
questions?

1024
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Hello.

1025
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I would like to ask Matt

1026
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
some questions.

1027
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Matt, thank you for your speech.

1028
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
My main question is

1029
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
about your first project.

1030
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
At that time,

1031
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I would like to know

1032
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
the particle size of

1033
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Nairobia.

1034
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The particle size

1035
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
is about

1036
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
here.

1037
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You can see it in the upper right corner.

1038
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The particle size is

1039
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
about 20-30 nm.

1040
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
20-30 nm.

1041
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So,

1042
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
you will combine

1043
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
reduced graphene oxide and Cdc

1044
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to increase

1045
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the conductivity of the electrode.

1046
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That's right.

1047
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Cdc also provides vacuum.

1048
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
OK.

1049
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I am doing research on

1050
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
hierarchical porous carbons.

1051
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
There are

1052
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
small micropores

1053
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and large macropores.

1054
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So,

1055
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I am thinking

1056
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
that if we combine

1057
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
other vacuum materials,

1058
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
will it increase

1059
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
the conductivity of the electrode?

1060
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yes.

1061
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Because

1062
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I have enough vacuum,

1063
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I can

1064
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
absorb more

1065
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
electrolytes

1066
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
into the electrode.

1067
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
There is a slide

1068
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
that I did not show.

1069
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
We still have some time.

1070
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You can see

1071
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
why Nairobia requires

1072
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
a large vacuum.

1073
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Basically,

1074
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
it comes from

1075
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
OK.

1076
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
This slide

1077
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
shows the result

1078
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
calculated by

1079
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Nernst

1080
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
equation

1081
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and Poisson equation.

1082
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Poisson equation

1083
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
represents the

1084
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
dielectric constant

1085
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
of the material.

1086
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So, under different voltages,

1087
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
how many electrons

1088
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
are on the surface.

1089
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
When the voltage

1090
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
moves to

1091
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the middle of the graph,

1092
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
the capacitive part

1093
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
shows how many electrons

1094
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
are on the surface of the material.

1095
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But when the voltage

1096
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
moves to a certain level,

1097
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Nairobia starts to react.

1098
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I need a large amount of

1099
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
electrons to enter the material.

1100
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So, when it needs a large amount of electrons

1101
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
to enter the material,

1102
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
it will cause a surface vacuum.

1103
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
The surface vacuum

1104
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
is the reason

1105
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
why Nairobia's

1106
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
connectivity drops.

1107
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
That's why

1108
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
the material needs

1109
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
higher concavity

1110
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
to maintain

1111
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
the characteristics of

1112
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
the capacitive part

1113
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
at high speed

1114
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
or at high voltage.

1115
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I have a follow-up question.

1116
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
How did you come up with

1117
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
reducing graphene oxide

1118
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
with Cdc?

1119
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Reducing graphene oxide

1120
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
has another advantage

1121
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
in the synthesis.

1122
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Basically,

1123
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
if you want to grow oxide,

1124
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the oxygen ligand

1125
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
of graphene oxide

1126
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
can be the nucleation site

1127
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
of these oxides.

1128
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Whether you want to grow metal particles

1129
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
or oxide particles,

1130
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
they are easy to grow on top.

1131
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Since there are many sites,

1132
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
the particles can grow

1133
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
very small.

1134
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Graphene oxide

1135
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
is like an additive.

1136
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It can make your particle size very small.

1137
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Second, it also increases

1138
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
the conductivity.

1139
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
In the case of graphene oxide,

1140
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
there are several ways to produce electricity.

1141
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
For example, when you do filtration,

1142
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
you use filtration to make it stack together.

1143
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Because it is

1144
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
a two-dimensional structure,

1145
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
so when you do filtration,

1146
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
it will naturally

1147
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
become a very dense electrode.

1148
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If it is a very dense electrode,

1149
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
basically,

1150
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
the electrolyte cannot penetrate.

1151
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So we want to find

1152
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
a special structure,

1153
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
which is Cdc.

1154
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
This kind of

1155
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
structure of graphene oxide

1156
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
is mixed inside.

1157
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
But we don't want to mix too much,

1158
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
because if we mix too much,

1159
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
the density of the energy

1160
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
will be relatively reduced.

1161
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Got it.

1162
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Thank you.

1163
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Are there any other questions?

1164
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
If not,

1165
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I will ask my last question.

1166
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
After talking about ZMath,

1167
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
you mentioned

1168
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
how to distinguish the battery,

1169
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
but now

1170
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
in the telecom industry,

1171
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
there is a more popular topic,

1172
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
which is solid-state electrolyte or solid-state electrolyte.

1173
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I want to know

1174
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
the difference between

1175
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
solid-state electrolyte

1176
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and the other two,

1177
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
or how to distinguish them.

1178
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Actually,

1179
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I haven't done the study electrolyte part.

1180
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You want to ask

1181
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
the study electrolyte part, right?

1182
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Because I mentioned that

1183
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
the second topic,

1184
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
solid-state electrolyte,

1185
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
is also a popular topic.

1186
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yes, it used to be

1187
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
solid-state electrolyte,

1188
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
but we changed

1189
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
its structure,

1190
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and used it as an electrolyte.

1191
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Basically,

1192
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
solid-state electrolyte,

1193
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I don't know much about it.

1194
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What I know about solid-state electrolyte

1195
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
is that

1196
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
its conductivity

1197
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
must be very thin.

1198
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Because its conductivity is not as fast as liquid.

1199
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Although it is a solid-state electrolyte,

1200
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
it is not as fast as liquid.

1201
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Another thing is that

1202
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
everyone says that

1203
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
solid-state electrolyte

1204
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
can avoid

1205
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
SEI reaction.

1206
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
But in fact,

1207
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
this is a mistake.

1208
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
In fact, solid-state electrolyte

1209
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
will have a big effect

1210
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
on its SEI

1211
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
in its first cycle.

1212
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
In our group,

1213
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
in addition to doing high-speed charge,

1214
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
another part is

1215
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
3D battery.

1216
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
3D battery is to make some

1217
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
electrical structure to make it a satellite battery.

1218
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
In that part,

1219
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
for solid-state electrolyte,

1220
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
we hope to use solid-state electrolyte.

1221
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Because solid-state electrolyte

1222
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
has a higher density

1223
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
than liquid.

1224
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So we can save a lot of liquid

1225
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
needed volume.

1226
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But they found that in the first cycle,

1227
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
this SEI

1228
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
will still occur.

1229
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And after it occurs,

1230
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
because it is a solid-state electrolyte,

1231
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
it is very difficult to solve.

1232
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Basically, your material is closely connected at the beginning.

1233
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But after the first cycle,

1234
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
it will separate.

1235
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Thank you for your answer.

1236
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Are there any other questions?

1237
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
If there are no questions,

1238
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Max,

1239
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
did you leave your email?

1240
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yes,

1241
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I put it in the last slide.

1242
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
If you have any questions,

1243
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
you can

1244
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
send me an email.

1245
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Thank you for your participation.

1246
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Thank you, Max,

1247
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
for giving us such a wonderful speech.

1248
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
This recording

1249
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
will be available online

1250
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
in about a week.

1251
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You can continue

1252
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
to discuss

1253
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
with Max

1254
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
related research.

1255
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Thank you.
