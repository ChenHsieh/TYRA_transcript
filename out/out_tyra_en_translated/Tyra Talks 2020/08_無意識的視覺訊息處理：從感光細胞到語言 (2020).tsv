0	15000	Hello everyone, welcome everyone to today's Tire Talk, we are very honored to invite Dr. Hong Shaoming today, he is now a post-doctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology, and he is my colleague.
15000	31000	He brought us today's speech topic is unconscious visual information processing, from sensory cells to language. If I'm not mistaken, most of the content of today's speech has been published recently.
31000	42000	First of all, let me introduce Shaoming to you. Dr. Shaoming got his medical school degree from Duke University and the University of Singapore.
42000	56000	When he was a doctor, his main job was to study the unconscious process. After he got his Ph.D., he came to Caltech.
56000	80000	His current boss is Shinsuke Okada. His main job is to continue his Ph.D. research on the unconscious process. His main tools are psychophysics, fMRI, EEG, and eye tracking.
81000	90000	One thing that is different from the usual speech is that we now applaud and thank Shaoming for bringing us the speech, but we have to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear everyone's applause.
90000	105000	Thank you for your introduction. I am Shaoming Hong. Thank you all for joining today's speech.
105000	113000	Today I want to talk about a research topic that I am very interested in, which is unconscious information processing. I will focus on the visual level.
113000	122000	As you can see from the title, there are two extremes, one is perception and the other is language. I want to tell you that unconscious language processing may cover a very large range.
122000	129000	From perception, from light information to telemetry information, that is the first level of our visual and external world interaction.
129000	144000	All the way to language, we usually think that language is a higher-level and more integrated message in the whole visual process. For example, you have to understand a sentence, you have to know the meaning of the words between them, and you have to know how different strokes work.
144000	155000	Today I want to convey a message to everyone, that is, unconscious information processing may exist in different levels of visual information processing, which may cover a very wide range.
156000	171000	What is consciousness? Until now, scientists have not been able to give a very good scientific definition. In this speech today, most people in the field of consciousness science use the definition that consciousness has sensory content.
171000	178000	For example, you can see the words on my slide now, which are in your visual consciousness. For example, you can hear my voice now, which is in your auditory sensory content.
178000	184000	We say that you are aware of these auditory or visual stimuli and have sensory content.
184000	193000	Is there any content? Do not be confused with the state of consciousness. What is the state of consciousness? For example, if you are too bored to talk about it, you may fall asleep and enter an unconscious state.
193000	199000	What we are talking about today is not the state. What I am talking about today is the state of unconsciousness without sensory content.
200000	208000	Is there any sensory content? You may often hear a metaphor. You can see the picture below. You may have seen it on the poster, which is a simple picture I drew myself.
208000	216000	Consciousness and unconscious processing seem to be just a corner of the iceberg. From the perspective of message processing, this may not be a big problem.
216000	225000	Because we receive a lot of messages every minute and every second, but only a small part of the message is really presented in our consciousness.
225000	231000	The rest of the messages that are not presented in our consciousness have always been a subject of research that I have been interested in.
231000	241000	What happened to these messages? Did our brain ignore these messages and ignore them? Or can these messages still affect our brain and further affect our behavior?
241000	248000	There are three main questions to discuss today. The first question I want to ask is the question that I have been interested in since I was a classmate.
248000	256000	What kind of information can be processed unconsciously? We can have a very simple paradoxical hypothesis.
256000	263000	The first is that simple, single-digit, and low-level messages can be processed in an unconscious situation.
263000	272000	On the contrary, another hypothesis may be more complex, integrated, and high-level messages. These messages are more difficult to process, so they cannot be processed in an unconscious situation.
272000	275000	Or they can be processed. These are two opposing hypotheses.
275000	280000	The second question I want to ask is whether unconscious processing is equivalent to automated processing.
280000	286000	What does this mean? Once this process starts, it will not be disturbed by other external processes.
286000	290000	We can have a very simple paradoxical hypothesis here.
290000	298000	The first is that unconscious processing will not be affected by the difficulty of what we do consciously, or how we use our attention.
299000	311000	On the contrary, another hypothesis may be that what we consciously process is more difficult, or what we do will interact with the unconscious message processing.
311000	313000	These are two different hypotheses.
313000	323000	Finally, I want to turn to a completely different angle and discuss with you the neural basis of unconscious processing with the study of nucleus resonance and brain imaging.
324000	326000	Without further ado, let's move on to the first study.
326000	331000	The first study I want to discuss with you is the integration relationship between sound and shape.
331000	335000	We want to know if this integration relationship can be produced in an unconscious situation.
335000	337000	If you look at the title, the title is actually a bit mysterious.
337000	346000	What we want to say is that this word can sound round or sharp before we understand it.
346000	347000	What does this mean?
347000	355000	If we want to answer this question, we may have to take a few steps back and think about what we originally wanted to ask.
355000	359000	What we want to know is how we name an object.
359000	367000	Imagine, for example, that 100,000 years ago, we may have some very basic language systems, but we do not have such complex grammar and structure as we do now.
368000	378000	When we go out to hunt, I see some objects, such as the stone on the left or the crystal on the right.
378000	385000	When I go back to the group, I want to tell my master that the two things I see today are object A and object B.
385000	389000	I must use two different sounds to express these two objects.
389000	393000	In this case, what sound should we use to express these objects?
393000	404000	A very famous contemporary linguist, Arthur Shearer, said that the process of using what sound or what object to express external objects is very likely to be arbitrary.
404000	412000	In other words, I use sound A to express the stone on the left, and sound B to express the crystal on the right.
413000	419000	Perhaps another possibility is that different tribes or people with different languages ​​have a common connection.
419000	428000	They all tend to use a certain type of sound to represent the round object on the left, and then use another sound to represent the pointed object on the right.
428000	434000	This means that there is a very strong connection between our sound and shape.
434000	439000	Does psychology have any evidence to support such a connection?
439000	448000	In fact, we have a very famous cross-sensory sound and visual correspondence called Bubakiki Effect or Bubakiki Phenomenon.
448000	449000	What is Bubakiki Phenomenon?
449000	451000	Those who have a background in psychology may be very familiar with it.
451000	454000	If you don't have a background in psychology, imagine that you are an experimenter today.
454000	459000	You walk into the lab and the experimenter tells you that what you are going to do today is very simple.
459000	463000	We will show you two pictures, the round picture on the left and the pointed picture on the right.
463000	469000	These two pictures are two words used by a remote African tribe.
469000	472000	One of the words is called Bubakiki and the other is called Kiki.
472000	473000	Your job is very simple.
473000	476000	Your job is to tell us which one is Bubakiki and which one is Kiki.
476000	488000	Even if you haven't heard of this phenomenon before, you may be able to guess what sound most people use to express the object on the left and what sound to express the object on the right.
488000	501000	In fact, the answer is that people use a softer sound to express the round object on the left and a sharper sound to express the pointed object on the right.
501000	504000	This is a phenomenon corresponding to sound and shape.
504000	507000	This phenomenon is highly consistent.
507000	508000	Why do I say it is highly consistent?
508000	511000	It is highly consistent that it can exceed the age.
511000	512000	What does this mean?
512000	517000	In an experiment, they took a group of adults and a group of children under the age of three.
517000	523000	They used different shapes on the right, round shapes, pointed shapes, and these words.
523000	525000	The homework is the same as the homework you just did.
525000	532000	They asked these children and adults to use these words to describe these shapes to name these shapes.
532000	539000	They found that children under the age of three have a very similar pairing pattern with us.
539000	547000	They also use a softer sound to describe these round shapes and a sharper sound to describe these pointed shapes.
547000	559000	This means that the corresponding time between sound and shape can be very early, even before these children have a complete language training or a complete cultural experience.
559000	561000	This is the first evidence.
561000	567000	The second evidence is that this phenomenon is even a cross-language phenomenon.
567000	568000	What does this mean?
568000	580000	It means that regardless of whether your mother tongue is Chinese or Mandarin, English or German, the results of the experiment on different species are very similar.
580000	584000	We use the sound of the round shape to represent the round shape, and vice versa.
584000	587000	The real problem of our research is here.
587000	589000	Why does this happen?
589000	594000	Here I provide two very intuitive hypotheses.
594000	598000	The first hypothesis is that this is a conscious association.
598000	602000	This consciousness is not the same as our whole speech to discuss consciousness.
602000	605000	This means that we intentionally connect some things together.
605000	606000	What does this mean?
606000	611000	It means that when I hear this thing, it sounds sharp and sharp.
611000	613000	So this pattern is also sharp.
613000	615000	I want to connect these two things together.
615000	616000	The original thing means the same.
616000	625000	In other words, the reason why there is a connection between sound and shape is because everyone intentionally connects sound and shape together.
625000	626000	This is a possibility.
626000	629000	But this possibility does not seem to be able to explain these past data very well.
629000	633000	Why are there such similar connections between children and adults?
633000	637000	Or why do people who cross-language have such a connection?
638000	647000	The second hypothesis is that perhaps the correspondence between sound and shape happened before these stimuli material entered our conscious state.
647000	651000	So it is a very early processing process.
651000	655000	This early processing process may be very common.
655000	661000	So it can explain that we have seen these studies in adults and children, or in different languages.
661000	663000	You can find this Bubakiki effect.
663000	671000	This whole study is used to test whether the Bubakiki effect can really occur in the unconscious state.
671000	676000	So at the beginning, our research question is very simple.
676000	679000	We want to know if the Bubakiki effect can occur in the unconscious state.
679000	682000	The first experiment we did was very easy.
682000	687000	We found some, for example, this round shape, and then paired with the word Bubu.
687000	689000	Then the pointed shape is paired with the word Kiki.
689000	694000	These are the pair or congruent pairs we talked about.
694000	704000	When you compare the word, the sound, and the shape, you will have an inconsistent pair.
704000	706000	The question we want to ask is very simple.
706000	711000	If we can make the receiver not see these pairs, and then we look at their reaction to these pairs.
711000	718000	If it's still different, does that mean that they can still deal with sound and shape when they can't see these pairs?
718000	723000	The next question is, how do we make the receiver unable to see these pairs?
723000	728000	Our approach is a technique called Continuous Flash Suppression.
728000	731000	The concept is like this.
731000	739000	In this case, if one eye shows you a very bright square, like these colorful squares, we call them Mondrians.
739000	745000	When one eye looks at this colorful square, if the other eye lets you see a very bright square,
745000	755000	it usually takes a few seconds for you to see the object on the other eye.
755000	762000	In these few seconds, the object is basically unconscious to you or the visual material to you.
762000	764000	What do we do at this time?
764000	771000	We put the congruent and incongruent pairs into your other eye.
771000	775000	Then we measure how long it takes for the receiver to see.
775000	784000	Our assumption is that if the congruence of sound and shape can be processed unconsciously or subconsciously,
784000	791000	the time when they see the higher congruence pair and the incongruence pair may be different.
791000	793000	This is our assumption.
793000	796000	I'll go into more detail about time.
796000	799000	You'll see three different visual representations later.
799000	807000	Basically, one corresponds to their non-priority vision, one is the priority vision, and the other is the image that is closer to what they really see.
807000	810000	At the beginning, there will be a random SOA.
810000	815000	After the end, we'll show him two colorful flickering squares.
815000	823000	What we're going to do is put a pair of congruence or incongruence in the other eye on the left or right.
823000	827000	What they're going to do on this assignment is when they see any part of this pair,
827000	830000	press a button and we'll record the time it responds.
830000	831000	So this is a detection task.
831000	834000	We measure the time and we call it suppression time.
834000	837000	It means that this pair can be suppressed.
837000	843000	How long can we keep it out of our consciousness?
843000	850000	Our assumption is that if the correspondence of sound and shape can exist before they enter our consciousness,
851000	856000	congruent pair and incongruent pair will spend different amounts of time.
856000	859000	In order to make sure that the receiver has a good time doing this,
859000	864000	they see the stimulation material and then react, not just press a button.
864000	868000	At the end of each trial, we also added a location task.
868000	869000	Basically, we just said,
869000	870000	Oh, you saw it.
870000	871000	Where did you see it?
871000	872000	Is it on the left or right?
872000	875000	That's just to make sure that our receiver is a good receiver.
876000	880000	You can see that the average accuracy rate is quite high here.
880000	886000	When we analyze, we only analyze the trials that respond correctly.
886000	890000	Back to the question, what exactly did we find?
890000	894000	This is the 20 receivers we received in this experiment.
894000	896000	There are a lot of things in this graph.
896000	899000	Let's look at the first column first.
899000	903000	You can see a orange dot, which means that this is one of the receivers.
903000	907000	The orange dot is the time it spends in incongruent pairs.
907000	911000	The dark blue dot at the bottom is the time it spends in congruent pairs.
911000	913000	The bar at the bottom is the difference between the two.
913000	914000	Its y-axis is on the right.
914000	915000	So in other words,
915000	918000	this receiver needs to spend more time to see incongruent pairs.
918000	920000	What we're doing here is very simple.
920000	924000	We put these individual data together and make an average.
924000	927000	Then we see that this is the average of all people's data.
927000	929000	Then it's a positive bar.
929000	931000	What does this mean?
931000	934000	We call it a congruency benefit.
934000	940000	When the shape of the word and the outer circle is more consistent,
940000	944000	they will enter the state of consciousness of our receivers earlier.
944000	947000	This means that the correspondence between the sound and the shape
947000	952000	seems to have been dealt with before entering the state of consciousness.
952000	954000	So in the first study,
954000	956000	we pointed out to some extent that
957000	961000	it seems to occur before or before consciousness.
961000	963000	Then we found something called congruency benefit.
963000	966000	When the sound and the shape are consistent,
966000	969000	it will enter our state of consciousness earlier.
969000	973000	For people who are more sensitive to experimental design or experiments,
973000	975000	they immediately feel that it doesn't seem right.
975000	980000	Let's take a step back and look at the relationship between the word and the shape.
980000	983000	What we've been claiming is that the sound of the word,
983000	987000	the phonology of the sound, and the shape will have a congruency effect.
987000	990000	When they are consistent, it's easier for you to see them.
990000	993000	But the relationship between the word, the shape, and the inner circle
993000	996000	is the relationship between the word's word form, orthography, and shape.
996000	1000000	So in other words, if you look at these congruent pairs in our first experiment,
1000000	1003000	they are not only correspondent between sound and shape,
1003000	1006000	they are also correspondent between shape and shape.
1006000	1010000	In other words, the congruent pair looks more like it visually.
1010000	1013000	In other words, we may have found some kind of integration phenomenon.
1013000	1016000	But this integration phenomenon may not be cross-sensory,
1016000	1019000	but only exists in the visual domain.
1019000	1022000	So in other words, when the word looks very similar to the shape of the outside,
1022000	1024000	the receiver will see it earlier.
1024000	1026000	When it's not, the receiver will see it later.
1026000	1032000	In order to prove that the sound really plays a very important role,
1032000	1035000	we made some changes in the next experiment.
1035000	1039000	We used some so-called neutral symbols or neutral text.
1039000	1041000	These things look neither far nor near.
1041000	1048000	What we do is that we train the receiver to put the sound on these symbols.
1048000	1051000	So the receiver will call these symbols bubu or kiki.
1051000	1054000	Then let's see if the symbols they trained
1054000	1059000	can produce the congruency benefit we just saw with a higher consistency shape.
1059000	1063000	It's still a bit abstract, so I'll go straight into the details of our experiment.
1063000	1067000	This time we really chose two languages from Africa,
1067000	1069000	called bi-language.
1069000	1072000	You can see that there are two different texts on the left.
1072000	1074000	Why did we choose this language?
1074000	1077000	Why did we choose these two different letters?
1077000	1080000	Because in another study,
1080000	1085000	our collaborators found that
1085000	1090000	if you ask the receiver to pair the two different words on the left and right
1090000	1093000	with different sounds,
1093000	1095000	the receiver basically has no preference.
1095000	1098000	If you ask them to pair with a sharp sound or a round sound,
1098000	1101000	their response is usually chance, 50%.
1101000	1105000	So we defined these as neutral letters.
1105000	1107000	It's neither round nor sharp.
1107000	1109000	What we do is very simple.
1109000	1114000	We ask the receiver to connect this to the sound of kiki or bubu.
1114000	1117000	Let's take a sip of water.
1117000	1126000	There are two stages in this experiment.
1126000	1128000	The first one is the training session.
1128000	1132000	What we do in the training session is to let them do a very simple matching task.
1132000	1135000	At the beginning, they will hear a sound.
1135000	1138000	You can see that in the upper right corner, they hear the sound of bubu or kiki.
1138000	1141000	Then they see one of the words in the two words.
1141000	1144000	What they have to do is tell us that this is matched or unmatched.
1145000	1148000	At the end of each trial, we will tell them that what they did was right or wrong.
1148000	1151000	So we didn't really tell them what was matched and what was unmatched.
1151000	1158000	It's up to them to figure out what the composition between them is at the end of each trial.
1158000	1160000	Through this training method,
1160000	1163000	if they answer 20 questions in a row,
1163000	1168000	we assume that they have learned which word and which sound should be paired.
1168000	1171000	In other words, in this experiment,
1171000	1177000	the consistency of things depends on what word is paired with what sound.
1177000	1182000	For example, we collected two experiments here, two groups of subjects.
1182000	1189000	In 2A, we asked them to pair this word with bubu and this word with kiki.
1189000	1194000	In other words, these two pairs are congruent in 2A.
1194000	1198000	In 2B, we collect another group of subjects and reverse the pairing relationship.
1198000	1202000	At this time, the pairs in the lower right corner become incongruent pairs.
1202000	1203000	As I just said,
1203000	1208000	the congruency depends entirely on what the word represents.
1208000	1211000	After the training, these subjects will move on to the next stage.
1211000	1213000	Basically, it's exactly the same as the experiment we did before,
1213000	1216000	but now we use these neutral symbols.
1216000	1218000	What did we find?
1218000	1219000	Let me recap for you.
1219000	1222000	In the first time, we found this congruency benefit.
1222000	1226000	When the shape of the word and the outside is more consistent,
1226000	1229000	it will move on to our conscious state earlier.
1229000	1233000	In 2A and 2B, we also found a very similar phenomenon.
1233000	1238000	In other words, the point is not the shape of the word, but the sound represented by the word.
1238000	1242000	As long as the sound and the shape of the outside are more consistent,
1242000	1245000	it will move on to our conscious state earlier.
1245000	1247000	After this experiment,
1247000	1253000	we found that a short training can cause a very similar unconscious phenomenon.
1253000	1258000	That is, if the shape of the word is consistent with the outside,
1258000	1263000	it will move on to our conscious state earlier.
1263000	1267000	If you follow this stage carefully,
1267000	1273000	you will find that there is no sound element in the formal experiment.
1273000	1275000	How does our sound element come from?
1275000	1277000	Let's assume that after it sees the word,
1277000	1279000	it will extract the sound of the word.
1279000	1282000	If the sound is consistent with the shape of the outside,
1282000	1284000	it will move on to our conscious state earlier.
1284000	1286000	If the sound is inconsistent with the shape of the outside,
1286000	1288000	it will move on to our conscious state later.
1288000	1292000	So the sound is a bit like we assume that they will read the sound of the word.
1292000	1294000	So in the next experiment,
1294000	1296000	we want to directly introduce the sound component.
1296000	1298000	If we directly introduce the sound component,
1298000	1300000	according to the results we found before,
1300000	1304000	this sound should help a shape you couldn't see originally.
1304000	1305000	If they are consistent,
1305000	1308000	it should help you see the shape you couldn't see originally.
1309000	1312000	At this time, we turn to another paradigm,
1312000	1314000	which is called the masking paradigm.
1314000	1315000	This approach is like this.
1315000	1318000	We will present a visual shape.
1318000	1322000	This situation is also a pointed shape or a round shape.
1322000	1324000	The presented time is only 33 milliseconds.
1324000	1326000	So if you use a 60Hz monitor,
1326000	1328000	it's about two frames.
1328000	1329000	The time is actually quite short.
1329000	1331000	Before and after this time,
1331000	1333000	we will put some noisy patterns.
1333000	1336000	These noisy patterns are to make you unable to see the shape.
1336000	1338000	In fact, the whole experiment is that the receiver will answer,
1338000	1340000	oh, I saw it or I didn't see it.
1340000	1341000	In the process of their answer,
1341000	1344000	we will do some staircasing to adjust the brightness of this thing.
1344000	1345000	So what we want to know is
1345000	1350000	what is the threshold for the receiver to see this shape?
1350000	1352000	How high or low do we want to adjust the brightness?
1352000	1355000	The receiver will just see this shape.
1355000	1356000	The important thing at this time is that
1356000	1358000	we will play a sound at the same time,
1358000	1361000	or 150 milliseconds before or after.
1361000	1364000	This sound may be consistent with this pattern or inconsistent.
1364000	1365000	According to our previous results,
1365000	1368000	if this sound is consistent with this pattern,
1368000	1371000	it should help the receiver see this pattern.
1371000	1373000	Is that true?
1373000	1374000	The answer is that this is true.
1374000	1376000	We found that if the sound is played
1376000	1381000	at 150 milliseconds before the shape,
1381000	1384000	the receiver will have a significant threshold reduction phenomenon.
1384000	1385000	yx is the threshold.
1385000	1386000	You can think of this as
1386000	1389000	how many luminance they need to see the shape.
1389000	1392000	So the lower it is, the easier it is to see the shape.
1392000	1395000	So when the sound is played at 150 milliseconds before,
1395000	1397000	if the sound is consistent with the shape,
1397000	1399000	the receiver will be easier to see the shape.
1399000	1400000	Again, it means that
1400000	1403000	the integration between the sound and the shape
1403000	1406000	is very likely to occur in a preconscious state
1406000	1409000	or unconscious state.
1409000	1411000	Through this series of studies,
1411000	1412000	the first thing we found was that
1412000	1413000	the effect of boobakiki
1413000	1416000	can occur in an unconscious state
1416000	1418000	or in a conscious state.
1419000	1421000	We also explained that
1421000	1423000	the important thing is what the word itself represents,
1423000	1424000	what the sound is,
1424000	1426000	not what the shape of the word is.
1426000	1427000	Finally, we found that
1427000	1429000	if you use a sound directly,
1429000	1430000	it will help a shape
1430000	1433000	that should have been hidden by the mask
1433000	1434000	to be seen more easily.
1434000	1436000	So again, it proves that
1436000	1438000	the correspondence between sound and shape
1438000	1439000	is very likely to occur
1439000	1443000	before the conscious threshold.
1443000	1446000	This is the first part of the experiment.
1446000	1448000	Do you have any questions?
1448000	1450000	If it's too fast or too slow,
1450000	1451000	you can tell me.
1456000	1458000	If you have any questions,
1458000	1460000	you can type next to me,
1460000	1461000	and I will help you ask.
1461000	1464000	You can also turn on the microphone yourself to ask.
1464000	1467000	But we set the microphone to silent.
1467000	1470000	So if you didn't notice,
1470000	1472000	you have to turn on the microphone
1472000	1474000	to ask questions.
1474000	1475000	I have a question.
1475000	1476000	Sorry.
1476000	1477000	Go ahead.
1477000	1480000	In the picture of the contrast,
1480000	1482000	does the contrast mean
1482000	1484000	that 22% and 23%
1484000	1489000	are gray and black?
1489000	1492000	The contrast is actually the alpha value.
1492000	1493000	OK.
1493000	1495000	Isn't 22% and 23% very different?
1495000	1498000	I can't see it with my naked eye.
1498000	1500000	Yes, it's very different.
1500000	1503000	The unconscious effect is usually very small.
1503000	1505000	One of the reasons is that
1505000	1507000	in the process of doing these experiments,
1507000	1510000	we want to make the audience unable to see.
1510000	1513000	For example, there are two ways.
1513000	1516000	The first is to make it very dark.
1516000	1519000	The second is to use masking or CFS
1519000	1521000	to make people unable to see.
1521000	1523000	So we intentionally or unintentionally
1523000	1525000	make the amount of information very small.
1525000	1528000	Usually the effect will not be very large.
1528000	1530000	Of course, this is statistically significant.
1530000	1532000	But it's hard to tell the difference
1532000	1533000	between the two.
1533000	1535000	But this is actually the point.
1535000	1537000	The point is that
1537000	1539000	in your consciousness,
1539000	1542000	you can't tell the difference.
1542000	1543000	OK.
1543000	1545000	But maybe your eyes
1545000	1548000	can still tell the difference.
1548000	1551000	But we consciously eliminated it.
1551000	1554000	So I can't feel it.
1554000	1556000	You can say that.
1556000	1558000	OK. Thank you.
1559000	1560000	OK.
1560000	1563000	Let's move on to the next research.
1563000	1564000	If you have any questions,
1564000	1565000	we can come back and discuss.
1565000	1566000	OK.
1566000	1567000	In this experiment,
1567000	1569000	we will explain to you that
1569000	1571000	the integration between sound and shape
1571000	1574000	can occur in the unconscious state.
1574000	1577000	The next research I want to talk to you about is...
1577000	1578000	Sorry.
1578000	1580000	Someone has a question.
1580000	1581000	He's next to me.
1581000	1582000	OK.
1582000	1584000	His question is this.
1584000	1586000	He said he wanted to ask
1586000	1588000	how to test the difference between
1588000	1590000	the dominant eye
1590000	1593000	and the dominant eye.
1593000	1595000	What part of the experiment will it affect?
1595000	1596000	OK.
1596000	1598000	This is a good question.
1598000	1601000	I don't have the official results
1601000	1603000	to support the second question.
1603000	1606000	But if I remember correctly,
1606000	1607000	the dominant eye is
1607000	1609000	when you put the design material
1609000	1611000	and what you want the other person to see,
1611000	1613000	which we call the suppressor,
1613000	1614000	in which eye?
1614000	1615000	I remember doing it.
1615000	1617000	The results are similar.
1617000	1619000	So it's a bit like a convention.
1619000	1621000	We put the suppressor on the dominant eye
1621000	1623000	because it's usually easier for you
1623000	1625000	to see what's on the other eye.
1625000	1627000	Because it's your superior eye.
1627000	1628000	So relatively speaking,
1628000	1630000	if what's on that eye is very salient,
1630000	1632000	it's even harder for you to see
1632000	1633000	what's on the other eye.
1633000	1634000	This is the reason.
1634000	1636000	So how do we know the dominant eye?
1636000	1638000	There are many ways to test it.
1638000	1639000	The simplest way is that
1639000	1641000	you can, for example,
1641000	1643000	form a small hole.
1643000	1645000	You can stretch out your hand
1645000	1647000	and look at something through the hole.
1647000	1649000	Both of your eyes have to open.
1649000	1650000	At this time,
1650000	1651000	you close one of your eyes,
1651000	1652000	and you'll find that
1652000	1654000	only one eye can see
1654000	1656000	what you're looking at.
1656000	1657000	That eye,
1657000	1659000	we usually call it the dominant eye.
1659000	1660000	When I force you to use one eye,
1660000	1662000	which eye will you look at?
1664000	1666000	You can try it later.
1668000	1669000	Excuse me.
1669000	1671000	Can I ask a question?
1671000	1672000	Go ahead.
1673000	1675000	My name is Wen Wen.
1675000	1677000	I'm from the University of Tokyo.
1677000	1678000	Hello.
1679000	1680000	I'd like to ask,
1680000	1682000	will there be a discussion later
1682000	1684000	about why there's this
1684000	1686000	congruence benefit?
1686000	1687000	Why do consistent things
1687000	1689000	enter the conference earlier
1689000	1691000	than inconsistent things?
1691000	1694000	Because in different fields,
1694000	1696000	sometimes inconsistent things
1696000	1698000	may be more salient.
1698000	1699000	And consistent things
1699000	1702000	are not very attractive.
1702000	1704000	Why do consistent things
1704000	1706000	in perception
1706000	1711000	have a more attractive position?
1712000	1713000	That's a good question.
1713000	1715000	And I've been facing this question myself.
1715000	1716000	Because in my different experiments,
1716000	1718000	sometimes consistent things
1718000	1719000	enter the state of consistency earlier,
1719000	1720000	and sometimes inconsistent things
1720000	1722000	enter the state of consistency earlier.
1722000	1723000	I'll come back.
1723000	1724000	I'll come back to this question
1724000	1726000	after all three of my research is done.
1726000	1727000	Okay, thank you.
1729000	1731000	I don't know how you control your time,
1731000	1733000	but I have a question.
1733000	1735000	If you think this is too much,
1735000	1737000	we can ask together at the end.
1737000	1738000	Okay, I'll speak faster.
1738000	1740000	How do you control
1740000	1742000	the age and gender of the audience?
1743000	1745000	There's no control in this study.
1745000	1747000	So we basically collect young people,
1747000	1748000	18 to 35 years old.
1748000	1749000	This is a visual study.
1749000	1751000	It's a bit of a conventional convention.
1751000	1753000	And gender is balanced.
1754000	1756000	Age is that period.
1756000	1758000	Gender is balanced.
1759000	1762000	Okay, I'm going to move on to the next study.
1764000	1765000	So in the next study,
1765000	1767000	I'm going to talk about a
1767000	1768000	unconscious science.
1768000	1770000	Everyone is relative.
1770000	1771000	Unconscious science is not a very popular science.
1771000	1772000	But in unconscious science,
1772000	1773000	of course, there are also more popular things.
1773000	1774000	That is,
1774000	1777000	unconscious meaning or language processing.
1777000	1778000	Okay, I want to tell you that
1778000	1780000	this language processing
1780000	1781000	will still be controlled by
1781000	1784000	the high and low difficulty of what we do.
1784000	1785000	Okay, like I said,
1785000	1787000	Unconscious meaning or language processing
1787000	1788000	has always been a
1788000	1789000	prominent field in this field.
1789000	1790000	Why?
1790000	1791000	In fact, intuitively speaking,
1791000	1793000	if we find that there is unconscious processing today,
1793000	1795000	the first thing I will be interested in is
1795000	1797000	that when I didn't see this word
1797000	1798000	or didn't hear this word,
1798000	1800000	can I understand what it means?
1800000	1802000	This is actually a pretty intuitive
1802000	1803000	and everyone wants to know the problem.
1803000	1804000	That's true.
1804000	1806000	This field has been studied for decades.
1806000	1808000	Everyone in different visual paradigms,
1808000	1810000	including Mr. Ye Su-lin of the Taiwan Psychological Department,
1810000	1811000	also found that
1811000	1812000	the meaning of a word,
1812000	1814000	even if you don't see it,
1814000	1815000	can also be read by you.
1815000	1817000	It will even affect the judgment of another word.
1817000	1818000	Okay, as you can see,
1818000	1820000	in the third Continuous Flash Suppression,
1820000	1821000	this is the paradigm we used
1821000	1823000	in the first experiment.
1823000	1825000	Okay, under this paradigm,
1825000	1827000	unfortunately or even luckily,
1827000	1829000	in fact, its results have not been stable.
1829000	1831000	Some experimenters found that
1831000	1833000	the meaning of the word can indeed
1833000	1835000	survive under this paradigm.
1835000	1837000	Even if the recipient can't see the word,
1837000	1838000	the meaning of the word seems to be able to be extracted
1838000	1840000	and then affect their judgment of another task.
1840000	1842000	Some of the experiments
1842000	1843000	did not work.
1843000	1845000	Okay, this experiment,
1845000	1846000	this study,
1846000	1848000	the initial intention
1848000	1849000	is actually to know
1849000	1850000	why there is this difference.
1850000	1853000	We want to make a big assumption
1853000	1855000	that maybe in different paradigms,
1855000	1856000	everyone uses the same paradigm,
1856000	1857000	but some people find it,
1857000	1858000	some people can't find it.
1858000	1860000	The reason is actually something else.
1860000	1862000	The reason we want to mention here is
1862000	1865000	whether it is related to the difficulty of the task.
1865000	1866000	What does this mean?
1866000	1867000	It means that
1867000	1870000	we assume that there is conscious processing
1870000	1871000	and unconscious processing.
1871000	1872000	Conscious processing
1872000	1874000	actually shares the same resources.
1874000	1876000	You can think of it as attention.
1876000	1878000	If they share the same resources,
1878000	1880000	then conscious processing,
1880000	1882000	if the task is more difficult,
1882000	1883000	then you spend all the resources.
1883000	1884000	Your unconscious processing
1884000	1885000	can't be produced.
1885000	1886000	In other words,
1886000	1887000	if you do this conscious task now,
1887000	1888000	it's actually quite simple.
1888000	1889000	Then you have more resources
1889000	1891000	that can be distributed to unconscious processing.
1891000	1893000	Next, we want to discuss this study
1893000	1895000	with everyone
1895000	1898000	to see if this hypothesis is true.
1898000	1900000	In order to test this hypothesis,
1900000	1902000	we made a paradigm called
1902000	1903000	Double Stroke Paradigm.
1903000	1905000	What is this paradigm?
1905000	1907000	For example, I will show you two words now.
1907000	1909000	You may be very intuitive to read red and blue.
1909000	1911000	Of course, there are other reasons
1911000	1913000	why people don't read blue and red.
1913000	1914000	But one of the reasons is
1914000	1917000	if I ask you to read the colors of these words now,
1917000	1919000	the left is blue and the right is red,
1919000	1920000	you will find that reading colors
1920000	1923000	is much more difficult than reading words.
1923000	1924000	Why?
1924000	1925000	Because when we read colors,
1925000	1927000	we are easily disturbed by words.
1927000	1928000	This is a famous
1928000	1930000	Stroke phenomenon.
1930000	1931000	You don't have to worry that
1931000	1933000	our readers will not read red and blue,
1933000	1936000	because we are doing research in English.
1936000	1939000	So in the case of reading colors,
1939000	1940000	as I just said,
1940000	1942000	usually the reader will have a higher
1942000	1945000	level of language interference,
1945000	1946000	so they want to read words.
1946000	1948000	Because reading words is a stronger process,
1948000	1951000	and it is usually relatively automated.
1951000	1952000	On the other hand,
1952000	1954000	when they read words,
1954000	1956000	they usually read better.
1956000	1958000	Because the color here
1958000	1960000	has a weaker effect.
1960000	1961000	If there is an effect,
1961000	1963000	it is usually called the Reverse Stroke Effect.
1963000	1967000	Let's define these two different conditions
1967000	1969000	as high-low and low-low.
1969000	1970000	In the case of reading words,
1970000	1972000	it is relatively simple, it is low-low.
1972000	1974000	But in the case of reading colors,
1974000	1976000	it is more difficult, it is high-low.
1976000	1977000	What we want to know is
1977000	1978000	if we put another word
1978000	1980000	before they react to this word
1980000	1982000	so that they can't see it,
1982000	1985000	will the consistency between the two words
1985000	1988000	affect their judgment of this word?
1988000	1989000	If it does,
1989000	1990000	what should it be in?
1990000	1991000	Should it be in a high-difficulty situation
1991000	1994000	or a low-difficulty situation?
1994000	1997000	I will go into the details of our research.
1997000	1998000	The same is used here
1998000	2000000	is the paradigm of double-eyed reading.
2000000	2001000	So you will still see
2001000	2003000	three different strings later.
2003000	2004000	At the beginning,
2004000	2005000	we just try to
2005000	2007000	keep the first word from being seen.
2007000	2009000	This is a bit different from before.
2009000	2010000	Before, we wanted to measure
2010000	2011000	how long that thing would be seen.
2011000	2012000	In this experiment,
2012000	2014000	we don't want it to be seen.
2014000	2015000	So let's show you again.
2015000	2016000	This is actually a
2016000	2017000	slightly different paradigm.
2017000	2018000	You will find that the way it flashes
2018000	2019000	is a bit different.
2019000	2021000	If you want to know the technical details,
2021000	2022000	we can discuss it later.
2022000	2023000	What we want to do
2023000	2025000	is just to make the receiver see this word.
2025000	2027000	So the receiver in this process,
2027000	2028000	when we put the first word
2028000	2029000	prime,
2029000	2030000	it can actually react.
2030000	2031000	If it says, oh, I saw it,
2031000	2032000	they press a button,
2032000	2033000	we will label this trial
2033000	2034000	as a conscious trial.
2034000	2035000	These trials
2035000	2036000	will not be analyzed later.
2036000	2037000	What we are interested in
2037000	2039000	is when they can't see this word,
2039000	2041000	how do they affect the next word?
2041000	2042000	In this process,
2042000	2043000	they say they can see it.
2043000	2044000	In the process of not seeing it,
2044000	2046000	we will adjust the brightness of this word
2046000	2047000	to keep this word
2047000	2049000	always almost visible
2049000	2051000	and a little bit invisible.
2051000	2053000	If they don't see the word
2053000	2054000	in this situation,
2054000	2056000	we will move on to the next stage.
2056000	2058000	We will present a word with color.
2058000	2059000	We will teach it
2059000	2060000	to read words in some experiments.
2060000	2061000	In some experiments,
2061000	2062000	we teach it to read colors.
2062000	2064000	That's the case of low difficulty
2064000	2066000	and high difficulty.
2066000	2069000	In the first layer,
2069000	2070000	when we say,
2070000	2071000	oh, it can actively report
2071000	2072000	that it has seen
2072000	2074000	or has not seen the word,
2074000	2076000	that is a subjective report
2076000	2078000	that they have not realized this word.
2078000	2079000	We also want to establish
2079000	2081000	an objective standard
2081000	2082000	that when it really
2082000	2083000	didn't see this word,
2083000	2084000	what would happen?
2084000	2085000	What we do is
2085000	2086000	we add a location task.
2086000	2087000	What is this?
2087000	2089000	At the end of each trial,
2089000	2090000	we ask it to judge
2090000	2091000	and ask it to guess
2091000	2092000	that you just didn't see that word,
2092000	2093000	that prime.
2093000	2094000	Please guess
2094000	2095000	whether the word
2095000	2096000	is above or below.
2096000	2097000	That's the logic.
2097000	2099000	If it really didn't see that word,
2099000	2101000	then its performance on this task
2101000	2102000	should be chance,
2102000	2103000	because it didn't see that word.
2103000	2105000	Indeed, across several experiments,
2105000	2106000	we found in this study
2106000	2107000	that their performance
2107000	2109000	on the location task
2109000	2110000	is about chance,
2110000	2112000	and there is no difference
2112000	2113000	with 50%.
2113000	2114000	So we want to establish
2114000	2116000	that subjectively and objectively,
2116000	2118000	it really didn't see that word.
2118000	2119000	In the case that it didn't see
2119000	2120000	that word,
2120000	2121000	if the two words
2121000	2122000	are not the same,
2122000	2123000	will it affect you
2123000	2125000	to read words or read colors?
2125000	2126000	The answer is yes.
2126000	2128000	This is the case of reading words.
2128000	2129000	The case of reading words
2129000	2130000	is a relatively low-difficulty situation.
2130000	2131000	You can see that the left corner
2131000	2133000	is our result.
2133000	2134000	This is when the two words
2134000	2135000	are the same,
2135000	2136000	it is congruent.
2136000	2137000	This is the case where the two words
2137000	2138000	are inconsistent.
2138000	2139000	In an inconsistent situation,
2139000	2140000	they will take about 5% of the time.
2140000	2141000	This is a standardized
2141000	2142000	normalized RT,
2142000	2143000	because we put a lot of
2143000	2144000	blank trials
2144000	2145000	at the same time
2145000	2146000	in this experiment,
2146000	2147000	that is,
2147000	2148000	in the case
2148000	2149000	where the word should be put,
2149000	2150000	the word should be put,
2150000	2151000	we sometimes
2151000	2152000	didn't show anything.
2152000	2153000	So that's our baseline.
2153000	2154000	So compared to the baseline,
2154000	2156000	if the two words are inconsistent,
2156000	2157000	they will take
2157000	2158000	about 5% of the time.
2158000	2160000	This is a relatively simple
2160000	2161000	case of reading words.
2161000	2162000	In the case of reading colors,
2162000	2163000	this is a high-low,
2163000	2164000	a more difficult situation.
2164000	2165000	We found that this effect
2165000	2166000	disappeared.
2166000	2167000	So at least so far,
2167000	2168000	this seems to indicate that
2168000	2170000	unconscious processing
2170000	2171000	does not seem to be so automated.
2171000	2173000	Because the exact same design
2173000	2174000	is in one situation,
2174000	2175000	there will be
2175000	2176000	unconscious interference.
2176000	2177000	In another situation,
2177000	2178000	there will be
2178000	2179000	unconscious interference.
2179000	2180000	What happened?
2180000	2181000	Just like we just said,
2181000	2182000	we just assumed at the beginning
2182000	2183000	that this was related to
2183000	2184000	the difficulty of the task,
2184000	2185000	the high and low.
2185000	2186000	If it really has
2186000	2187000	something to do with
2187000	2188000	the difficulty of the task,
2188000	2189000	then think about it.
2189000	2190000	This is a
2190000	2191000	reading color is
2191000	2192000	a relatively difficult task.
2192000	2193000	If I keep training
2193000	2194000	the collector to do this task,
2194000	2195000	let him do it for a long time,
2195000	2196000	do it to a level
2196000	2197000	that he becomes very powerful.
2197000	2198000	In theory,
2198000	2199000	this high-difficulty task
2199000	2200000	becomes simpler and simpler,
2200000	2201000	becoming a low-difficulty task.
2201000	2202000	When this high-difficulty task
2202000	2203000	becomes a low-difficulty task,
2203000	2205000	if we follow our theory,
2205000	2206000	it should have more resources
2206000	2207000	that can be distributed to
2207000	2208000	unconscious information processing.
2208000	2209000	At this time,
2209000	2211000	interference should be re-generated.
2211000	2212000	If you have participated in
2212000	2213000	visual research,
2213000	2214000	you will find that
2214000	2215000	visual scientists love to
2215000	2216000	do a lot of trials.
2216000	2217000	In fact,
2217000	2218000	at this time,
2218000	2219000	we have also
2219000	2220000	taught everyone to do
2220000	2221000	about 350 trials.
2221000	2222000	So they did
2222000	2223000	a total of
2223000	2224000	30-40 minutes.
2224000	2225000	The first thing we want to do
2225000	2226000	is to see
2226000	2227000	if there is a difference
2227000	2228000	in the performance of the
2228000	2229000	previous trial and the
2229000	2230000	subsequent trial.
2230000	2231000	Compared with the
2231000	2232000	previous quarter trial
2232000	2233000	and the subsequent quarter trial,
2233000	2234000	they are faster
2234000	2235000	in the subsequent quarter trial.
2235000	2236000	We found that
2236000	2237000	this may mean that
2237000	2238000	the difficulty of this task
2238000	2239000	has relatively
2239000	2240000	become lower
2240000	2241000	because they do better and better.
2241000	2242000	At this time,
2242000	2243000	let's look at
2243000	2244000	the first
2244000	2245000	quarter trial.
2245000	2246000	Basically,
2246000	2247000	their performance
2247000	2248000	is very similar
2248000	2249000	to that of all
2249000	2250000	trials.
2250000	2251000	They will not be
2251000	2252000	interfered with
2252000	2253000	by
2253000	2254000	this
2254000	2255000	unconscious word.
2255000	2256000	In the subsequent
2256000	2257000	quarter trial,
2257000	2258000	we found that
2258000	2259000	the original interference
2259000	2260000	phenomenon
2260000	2261000	was produced
2261000	2262000	when we
2262000	2263000	saw the
2263000	2264000	interference
2264000	2265000	phenomenon
2265000	2266000	when we
2266000	2267000	read the
2267000	2268000	words.
2268000	2269000	At this time,
2269000	2270000	it conforms to
2270000	2271000	our assumption
2271000	2272000	that
2272000	2273000	when the
2273000	2274000	first
2274000	2275000	quarter trial
2275000	2276000	occurs,
2276000	2277000	the
2277000	2278000	second
2278000	2279000	quarter trial
2279000	2280000	occurs.
2280000	2281000	The
2281000	2282000	combination of
2282000	2283000	the two
2283000	2284000	experiments
2284000	2285000	at least
2285000	2286000	explains
2286000	2287000	one thing,
2287000	2288000	which is
2288000	2289000	the
2289000	2290000	unconscious
2290000	2291000	prime
2291000	2292000	that
2292000	2293000	they can't
2293000	2294000	see,
2294000	2295000	and
2295000	2296000	the
2296000	2297000	unconscious
2297000	2298000	target
2298000	2299000	that
2299000	2300000	they
2300000	2301000	are reacting
2301000	2302000	to.
2302000	2303000	When the
2303000	2304000	first
2304000	2305000	quarter trial
2305000	2306000	occurs,
2306000	2307000	they are
2307000	2308000	more likely
2308000	2309000	to be
2309000	2310000	interfered with
2310000	2311000	by
2311000	2312000	this
2312000	2313000	unconscious
2313000	2314000	word.
2314000	2315000	When the
2315000	2316000	second
2316000	2317000	quarter trial
2317000	2318000	occurs,
2318000	2319000	they are
2319000	2320000	more likely
2320000	2321000	to be
2321000	2322000	interfered with
2322000	2323000	by
2323000	2324000	this
2324000	2325000	unconscious
2325000	2326000	word.
2326000	2327000	When the
2327000	2328000	first
2328000	2329000	quarter trial
2329000	2330000	occurs,
2330000	2331000	they are
2331000	2333000	more likely
2333000	2334000	to be
2334000	2336000	interfered with
2336000	2337000	by
2337000	2338000	this
2338000	2339000	cold
2339000	2340000	object
2340000	2341000	or
2341000	2343000	subconscious
2343000	2344000	object.
2344000	2346000	When the
2346000	2347000	second
2347000	2348000	quarter trial
2348000	2349000	occurs,
2349000	2350000	they
2350000	2351000	are
2351000	2352000	more likely
2352000	2353000	to be
2353000	2354000	interfered with
2354000	2355000	by
2355000	2356000	this
2356000	2357000	unconscious
2357000	2358000	object before
2358000	2359000	the
2359000	2360000	first
2360000	2361000	trial.
2361000	2362000	In fact,
2362000	2363000	we call the
2363000	2364000	observer to pay
2364000	2365000	attention to the
2365000	2366000	meaning of the
2366000	2367000	word, so
2367000	2368000	we ask him to
2368000	2369000	pay attention to
2369000	2370000	the phenomenon
2370000	2371000	that we want
2371000	2372000	to see.
2372000	2373000	That is a
2373000	2374000	speech interference
2374000	2375000	phenomenon.
2375000	2376000	These two
2376000	2377000	things are
2377000	2378000	consistent,
2378000	2379000	so we
2379000	2380000	say that
2380000	2381000	it is
2381000	2382000	cognitive
2382000	2383000	set
2383000	2384000	align or
2384000	2385000	task set
2385000	2386000	align.
2386000	2387000	On the
2387000	2388000	contrary,
2388000	2389000	when we
2389000	2390000	see this
2390000	2391000	phenomenon,
2391000	2392000	it is
2392000	2393000	likely that
2393000	2394000	it is not
2394000	2395000	a task
2395000	2396000	difficulty
2396000	2397000	adjustment,
2397000	2398000	but a
2398000	2399000	different reason
2399000	2400000	for the
2400000	2401000	nature of
2401000	2402000	their
2402000	2403000	work.
2403000	2404000	This
2404000	2405000	explanation
2405000	2406000	can also
2406000	2407000	explain
2407000	2408000	our
2408000	2409000	results.
2409000	2410000	Another
2410000	2411000	question you
2411000	2412000	may ask
2412000	2413000	is what
2413000	2414000	is the
2414000	2415000	consistency
2415000	2416000	that
2416000	2417000	causes
2417000	2418000	their
2418000	2419000	work
2419000	2420000	to
2420000	2421000	become
2421000	2422000	slower or
2422000	2423000	faster?
2423000	2424000	We have
2424000	2425000	just mentioned
2425000	2426000	that it is
2426000	2427000	actually related to
2427000	2428000	the conflict
2428000	2429000	between the
2429000	2430000	meanings of
2430000	2431000	the two
2431000	2432000	words.
2432000	2433000	Another
2433000	2434000	possibility is
2434000	2435000	that our
2435000	2436000	prime word
2436000	2437000	is always
2437000	2438000	blue and
2438000	2439000	red,
2439000	2440000	and our
2440000	2441000	target word
2441000	2442000	is always
2442000	2443000	blue and
2443000	2444000	red.
2444000	2445000	Maybe it's
2445000	2446000	related to
2446000	2447000	the conflict
2447000	2448000	between
2448000	2449000	the two
2449000	2450000	words.
2450000	2451000	In order to
2451000	2452000	solve these
2452000	2453000	two problems
2453000	2454000	at the same time,
2454000	2455000	we did
2455000	2456000	two things
2456000	2457000	in the
2457000	2458000	following two
2458000	2459000	experiments.
2459000	2460000	The first
2460000	2461000	thing is that
2461000	2462000	we replaced
2462000	2463000	the target
2463000	2464000	word with
2464000	2465000	these two
2465000	2466000	words,
2466000	2467000	Navy and
2467000	2468000	Scarlet.
2468000	2469000	These two
2469000	2470000	words still
2470000	2471000	have a consistent
2471000	2472000	or inconsistent
2472000	2473000	relationship
2473000	2474000	with the
2474000	2475000	original
2475000	2476000	word
2476000	2477000	meaning.
2477000	2478000	A very
2478000	2479000	interesting phenomenon
2479000	2480000	is that when we
2480000	2481000	use these two
2481000	2482000	words as
2482000	2483000	target words,
2483000	2484000	when we ask
2484000	2485000	the user to
2485000	2486000	read the
2486000	2487000	color or
2487000	2488000	read the
2488000	2489000	words,
2489000	2490000	their difficulty
2490000	2491000	is completely
2491000	2492000	reversed.
2492000	2493000	At this time,
2493000	2494000	when we
2494000	2495000	ask him to
2495000	2496000	read the
2496000	2497000	color,
2497000	2498000	he will not
2498000	2499000	be disturbed
2499000	2500000	by the
2500000	2501000	color.
2501000	2502000	This is actually
2502000	2503000	also reported
2503000	2504000	in the text
2504000	2505000	file.
2505000	2506000	In other
2506000	2507000	words,
2507000	2508000	in this
2508000	2509000	experiment,
2509000	2510000	if we
2510000	2511000	find any
2511000	2512000	interference,
2512000	2513000	it will
2513000	2514000	come from
2514000	2515000	the word
2515000	2516000	meaning.
2516000	2517000	If we
2517000	2518000	find interference
2518000	2519000	coming from
2519000	2520000	this new
2520000	2521000	low-difficulty
2521000	2522000	task,
2522000	2523000	that is,
2523000	2524000	the task of
2524000	2525000	reading the
2525000	2526000	color,
2526000	2527000	it means that
2527000	2528000	the important
2528000	2529000	thing is
2529000	2530000	the difficulty
2530000	2531000	of the
2531000	2532000	task.
2532000	2533000	If the
2533000	2534000	difficulty
2534000	2535000	of the
2535000	2536000	task is
2536000	2537000	easy to
2537000	2538000	be disturbed,
2538000	2539000	it means that
2539000	2540000	the important
2540000	2541000	thing is that
2541000	2542000	the thing
2542000	2543000	done by the
2543000	2544000	receiver is
2544000	2545000	consistent with
2545000	2546000	the interference
2546000	2547000	we want to
2547000	2548000	see,
2548000	2549000	that is,
2549000	2550000	the
2550000	2551000	Cognitive
2551000	2552000	Set is
2552000	2553000	aligned.
2553000	2554000	What do
2554000	2555000	we find?
2555000	2556000	We found
2556000	2557000	no effect
2557000	2558000	in the
2558000	2559000	task of
2559000	2560000	reading the
2560000	2561000	word.
2561000	2562000	This is a
2562000	2563000	new,
2563000	2564000	simple task.
2564000	2565000	This is a
2565000	2566000	simple task.
2566000	2567000	In this case,
2567000	2568000	without the
2568000	2569000	effect,
2569000	2570000	we found
2570000	2571000	a very similar
2571000	2572000	interference phenomenon
2572000	2573000	as before.
2573000	2574000	When the
2574000	2575000	meaning of
2575000	2576000	these two
2576000	2577000	words is
2577000	2578000	different,
2578000	2579000	its reaction
2579000	2580000	will be slower.
2580000	2581000	Through
2581000	2582000	these two
2582000	2583000	experiments,
2583000	2584000	we can
2584000	2585000	tell everyone
2585000	2586000	that
2586000	2587000	only the
2587000	2588000	meaning of
2588000	2589000	the word
2589000	2590000	alone
2590000	2591000	can make
2591000	2592000	the receiver
2592000	2593000	see the
2593000	2594000	word
2594000	2595000	in a
2595000	2596000	consistent
2596000	2597000	way.
2597000	2598000	We can
2598000	2599000	also say that
2599000	2600000	only the
2600000	2601000	meaning of
2601000	2602000	the word
2602000	2603000	alone
2603000	2604000	can
2604000	2605000	make
2605000	2606000	the receiver
2606000	2607000	see the
2607000	2608000	word
2608000	2609000	in a
2609000	2610000	consistent
2610000	2611000	way.
2611000	2612000	We can
2612000	2613000	also say that
2613000	2614000	the
2614000	2615000	meaning of
2615000	2616000	the word
2616000	2617000	alone
2617000	2618000	is
2618000	2619000	not
2619000	2620000	consistent
2620000	2621000	with
2621000	2622000	the
2622000	2623000	meaning
2623000	2624000	of
2624000	2625000	the
2625000	2626000	word
2626000	2627000	in
2627000	2628000	a
2628000	2629000	consistent
2629000	2630000	way.
2630000	2631000	We
2631000	2632000	can
2632000	2633000	also say
2633000	2634000	that
2634000	2635000	the
2635000	2636000	meaning of
2636000	2637000	the

2652000	2653000	We
2653000	2654000	can
2654000	2655000	also say
2655000	2656000	that
2656000	2657000	the
