00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Welcome everyone to participate in our presentation today.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
I am the host today, Zhang Yuanping.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
Our speaker today is very happy to invite Mr. Bojun to share his research with us.

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
As for the content, we will leave it to Mr. Bojun to share directly with everyone.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
It will be about the熱傳熱導.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
If I'm not mistaken, it should be like this, right?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Because it's not my major.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Everyone will know the details later.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Let's share the background of the teacher.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
The teacher used to be Qingda Materials.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
If I'm not mistaken, Qingda Materials.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
After graduating, he went to Stanford to study materials.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
Now, at the beginning of this year, he went to Duke.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
At the beginning of last year.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
At the beginning of last year, sorry.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
At the beginning of last year, he went to Duke.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
It's from the west coast to the east.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
And it's almost a right-angled line.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
It's not that right-angled, but a little bit.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Then I just missed the teacher.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Because I came back to Taiwan from UNC at that time.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
And I came back to Qingda Materials.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
So I just missed the teacher.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Otherwise, there should be a chance to meet in person.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I am very happy to have this opportunity today.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
So let's not talk too much.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
On behalf of everyone, I would like to warmly welcome the teacher to share with us today.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm going to take a picture.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
OK.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
You can share your screen.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
It's at the top.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
If you swipe over, there will be...

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Do you know how to do it?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
There are four buttons.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
One of them is the share screen.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Then you do this.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
OK, I saw it.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
OK.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Then I'll turn off my microphone.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I...

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
OK, so you really can't see what I mean.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
OK.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Thank you, Yen Ping.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Thank you for coming to listen to me.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Let me talk about the two little things I've been doing recently.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
It's quite interesting.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
It's mainly about how we can adjust our heat radiation.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
And then let this building be more...

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
It's simple.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I just...

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Yen Ping has already introduced my background.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Mainly, when I was at Stanford, I started doing nano.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
And then I switched to doing some metal nanowires.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And then I started doing some textile research.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
Textile, in my understanding, is actually related to energy.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Because...

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I hope this slide will be clearer.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Because we actually spent a lot of energy

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
to provide us with a very comfortable hot environment.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
In fact, most of the energy consumption in the United States

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
actually comes from fossil fuels.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
That is to say, on the one hand, we have to push for renewable energy,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
such as solar energy and wind energy.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
On the other hand, if we can save the energy we use,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
it will contribute a lot to reducing CO2 emissions.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
The reason why I say that

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
textile and energy are closely related

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
is because if we look at...

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
This is also from the United States.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Let me ask everyone first.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Maybe I'll use a pointer.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Okay, yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
This is American consumption.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
It's by different areas.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
There's transportation, there's industry, and there's architecture.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Architecture is where we are now.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Just now, Yanping told me that

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
he's been looking for a parking lot for a long time.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
We always go to a meeting place

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
to have a conference, class, and so on.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Even if you get off work, you go home.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
So it's always in a building.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
So it's not surprising that this building

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
takes up one-third of the energy consumption.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
When we were young,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I think when we grew up in Taiwan,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
we were taught to turn off the light

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
and turn off the faucet

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
to save electricity.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
But in fact,

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
we didn't know until later that

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
most of the electricity

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
is consumed...

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
You're in this building.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
You're consuming electricity.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Even if you don't turn on the light.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Because this building

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
needs to have a proper temperature.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
You have to turn on the air conditioner in summer.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Taiwan doesn't need air conditioners in winter.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But in fact,

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
most places in the world

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
still have air conditioners in winter.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
So HVAC is heating,

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
ventilation,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
and AC is air conditioning.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
This is a thermal air conditioner.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
It basically takes up

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
17% of the energy in the United States.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
You can imagine

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
if such a large amount of energy

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
is not consumed at all.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Because it is

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
the most basic living condition.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
So the so-called textile

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
and energy-related places

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
are in this concept

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
called personal self-management.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
In other words,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
our traditional concept

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
is that we take this building,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
the temperature of the whole building,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
and make it very warm in winter.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Turn on the heater

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
and the whole building becomes very comfortable.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Personal self-management means

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
that we don't want to

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
make the whole building very warm.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Instead, we focus on

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
the environment around these people.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
We try to make

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
these people feel warm.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
After all, these tables and chairs

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
and decorations

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
don't really matter.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Textile is in this place.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
We can make some new innovations

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
to achieve this goal.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Let's review

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
some of the past work

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
in personal self-management.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I mainly talk about radiative,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
which is heat radiation.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
In general, when we talk about a textile,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
its cold or heat

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
is usually its flow

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
or evaporation,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
how it is controlled.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Radiation is actually a very large piece,

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
but it has not been adjusted much.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So here we hope

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
that we can use some of the materials

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
and innovations to achieve different properties.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
For example, we can

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
buckle the 7N wire

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
to the top of the clothes.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
We can suppress the radiation.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
In other words,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
we can reduce our heat loss.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
On the other hand,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
we also made transparent clothes.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
If you ask a physicist

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
how to make the coolest clothes,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
the simplest answer is

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
not to wear it.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
But obviously you can't do that.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
So we can make clothes

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
that look colorful visually,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
not transparent,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
but don't seem to wear inside and outside.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
This is the meaning of cooling textile.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Like this one,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
it doesn't look very good,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
but it's a prototype.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
In the visible light,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
it looks like a white vest.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
In the infrared camera,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
it looks completely transparent.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
You can see the blood behind the clothes.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Radiation has a very special place

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
that is different from flow and evaporation.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Basically, it's like a TV.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
It's like a light.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
We all know that light has color.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Color is the nature of a surface.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Things can have two sides.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Two sides can have different colors.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
So we can use this method

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
to make some traditional textiles

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
that can't be disturbed.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
For example,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
the textile of this Bill Maugham

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
looks the same on both sides

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
but it has a bilayer structure inside.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
So when we put one side on the skin,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
you will feel that your radiation is working,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
so you will feel cooler.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
But when you turn it over,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
the other side is not so strong radiation,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
so you will feel warmer

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
because it keeps your heat.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
So with this Bill Maugham textile,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
we can increase people's ability

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
to adapt to the environment.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
For example,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
for elderly people,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
or people who get sick easily,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
or people who get sick easily,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
this can be a good protection for their immune system.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
But there are also other ways to control it.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
For example,

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
it's responsive to sweat.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
When you sweat,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
the textile becomes cooler,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and so on.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
So the first thing I want to talk about today

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
is that when we finish these

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
heating, cooling,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
and Bill Maugham textiles,

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
we find an interesting problem.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
We find that the radiative heat management

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
actually has something to do with the substance underneath.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
For example,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
the reason this infrared transparent textile can work

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
is because this person is a very good radiator.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
He's already radiating thermal radiation,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
so we want to cool it.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
The best way is to make this textile transparent.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
So for a high-transmittance cooling,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
for people,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
a good radiator is more useful.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
But if we want to manage things that are not people,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
let's say a car.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Cars also need cooling.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
That's not going to work,

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
because the metal itself is not a good radiator.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
If you put a transparent thing in it,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
it still doesn't radiate.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
It's still very hot.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
On the other hand,

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
if we want to do low-emissivity,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
what is low-emissivity?

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
Emissivity is the ability to radiate thermal radiation.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
The higher the emissivity,

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
the more radiation you emit.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
The lower the emissivity,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
the less radiation you emit.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
So for a low-emissivity thing,

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
we want to use a high-emissivity device.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
It's useful for low-emissivity objects,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
but for high-emissivity objects,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
it's a bit...

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
How can you be high-emissivity

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
if you don't have anything above that?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
So from an engineer's point of view,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
this is something that can't be tolerated.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Because when we make something,

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
we have to ask first

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
what kind of object this thing is suitable for.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
In terms of design,

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
this is not a very perfect design.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Especially when we don't know what this object is.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
It's easy to accidentally

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
make a lot of different devices

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
that can be useful for all objects.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
On the other hand,

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
in terms of heating,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
as long as we make this thing active,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
it can always work.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
This actually tells us that

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
today's transmittance,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
emissivity, and reactivity,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
these three modes need to be there

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
so that we can...

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
When we don't know what this object is,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
we hope it can be controlled by heating and cooling.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
We need these three modes

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
to have these three modes at the same time

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
on my device.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
This is what I just said,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
but in a more

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
quantitative way.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Basically,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
when I use a transparent film

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
to cover an object,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
the higher the coefficient of heat transfer,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
the cooler it is.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
The higher the emissivity,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
the cooler it is.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
If this is emissive,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
let's say this thing is...

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
It becomes opaque.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
So no matter what the thing underneath is,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
the film above determines

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
whether it's cold or hot.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
So you can imagine

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
there's a crossover

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
when the object underneath

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
is emissive,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
you want to use the transmittance mode

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
to do the cooling.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
So basically,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
our goal is to

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
make a triple mode modulation.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
At the same time,

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
this triple mode is also a completion,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
because you want a light and an object

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
to be either opaque,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
or absorb,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
or reflect.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So basically,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
as long as these three modes are available,

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
it's basically done.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So how do we do this?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
First of all,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
we choose an

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
infrared semi-absorbed elastomer.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Then we put this elastomer...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
The surface of this elastomer

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
has some texture,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
which is high-density adhesive.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Then we stretch this elastomer

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
to 100%,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
and then put more metal on it.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
So at this time,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
this elastomer has two properties.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
One is that its thickness becomes thinner.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
The other is that

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
the metal is actually flat.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
So at this time,

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
it's a better reflector.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
This is a reflection mode.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
So when we remove this elastomer,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
so that it can be released,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
two things will happen.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
The first one is that the film becomes thicker.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Then this is its...

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
The metal layer we just cut,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
it has an extra length.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
So it becomes more wrinkled.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
So we increase the thickness at the same time.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
We also increase the surface...

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
What we call slow reflection,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
which is scattering.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
So overall,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
we can increase

15:29.000 --> 15:36.000
the composite absorption.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
According to Kracov's law,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
which is a very useful physical law,

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
it says that

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
in a thermodynamic equilibrium,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
the more you absorb,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
the more you release.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
That is to say,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
when we make a film with high absorption,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
it also has high emittance.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
So at this time,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
it can do this cooling.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
The third mode,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
we just pulled this

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
100% film,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
and then pulled it out.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
We will pull this metal film.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
After pulling it out,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
of course,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
the opened part becomes transparent.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Because this is a semi-absorbing elastomer.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
So this is a state of high transmittance.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
By using this open area

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
and relatively small thickness

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
to achieve this transmittance.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
This is a simple evidence.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
We made this material.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
SCM is to look at the surface of the material

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
with an electron.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
First of all,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
we can compare this

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
emissive mode with static.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It's rougher.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
It's rougher than it is.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And then it's all broken.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
We also use a more static way

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
to explain the same thing.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Next,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
we really want to prove that

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
it can be absorbed from the outside of the red

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
and then reflected and transparent.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
So this is a

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
heavy-folding,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
as I just said,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
the nature of the three modes.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Of course,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
we measured the entire spectrum

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
and then made a score.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
But in short,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
we started from 100%,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
which is to pull and then cut the metal.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Then you put it in

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
the emissive mode.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
And then you pull it back to the original state

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
when you pull it to 100%.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
This is all reflected.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
And then you pull it,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
and you see that the green area becomes wider,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
and the transmittance is dominant.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And then this kind of

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
trend-induced cycling

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
can last for a thousand cycles.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
And then,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
of course,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
there's a little degradation,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
but it's not a big deal.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
In addition,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
we also focus on switching from reflectance

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
to emittance

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
as a mechanism study.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
As I just said,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
the emittance mode

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
mainly comes from two factors.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
The first is that its thickness becomes thicker,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
and the second is that its surface becomes rougher.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
So we can see that

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
the emittance mode

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
mainly comes from two factors.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
The first is that its thickness becomes thicker,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
and the second is that its surface becomes rougher.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
So we can think of the contrast of emittance

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
as contributing to these two factors.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
And this

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
is our experimental data.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
We can do some simple fitting and modeling

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
to explain

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
what the surface roughness factor

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
corresponds to

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
in terms of surface roughness.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
At the same time,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
this is a smooth surface.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
If you don't do surface texturing today,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
you won't be able to achieve

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
such a high contrast of emittance.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
As I just said,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
texturing is very, very important.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
At the same time,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
we can also

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
artificially predict

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
if we push

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
its application technique today,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
we may be able to

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
push it better.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
For example,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
if we can

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
make a perfect diffuse scattering

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
from a completely smooth surface

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
after it is released,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
we can predict

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
a 0.7 emittance contrast.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
In terms of the knowledge limit,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
today's surface

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
is a perfect diffuse

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
surface.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So when the light hits it,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
it will present a

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
it will present a

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
it has a specific distribution.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And this distribution

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
has to do with the thickness

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
and the scattering rate of the material.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
According to this thickness,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
according to this scattering rate,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
and according to this

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
the main thing is the scattering rate.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
According to this scattering rate,

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
we can calculate

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
how much enhancement you have.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
We can predict

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
if this is the limit,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
we can have higher and higher emittance.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Next,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
when we have this infrared measurement,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
how much can it bring

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
the change in thermodynamics.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
We also did a

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
heat transfer coefficient measurement.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
The most important thing is to measure

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
the ability to control heating and cooling.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
For example,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
if we look at the red line,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
the metal is at 100% strength.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
It can go from 10 to 7.5

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
and then go a little higher.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Of course, this is completely customizable.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
It depends on

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
whether you want more cooling

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
or more heating.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
If it is blue,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
it means there is a lot of heating mode.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
In addition,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
the picture on the right

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
is an experiment

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
to prove

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
what I said at the beginning.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I said,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
if I don't know

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
the emissivity of the underlying object,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I can't

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
heat and cool all the objects.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
For example,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
if this blue thing

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
is a low emissivity material,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
you will find that

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
when I use T-mode,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
it is actually very hot.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
The important thing is the temperature.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
On the other hand,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
if today I have a

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
high emissivity material,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I use T-mode,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
which is actually cooler.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
That is to say,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
only when these three modes are available,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I can do the best

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
heating or cooling

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
for all the different objects.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Finally,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
because we are adjusting the infrared now,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
we made a

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
simple little device.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
It's a

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
thing called

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
4x4.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
We made a 4x4

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
pixel device

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
that we can use

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
to pump air

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
into a small chamber

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
or to draw vacuum.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
We can adjust the

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
strength of the film above.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
We made a

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
not very good-looking

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
but still

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
distinguishable letter D.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Then, of course,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
we can adjust the other parts

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
to adjust the color

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
from non-radiative

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
to radiative.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I can pause here

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
and ask if you have any questions.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Hi,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
if you have any questions,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
you can ask directly.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Remember to turn on your microphone

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
or you won't hear the sound.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
If not,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I will

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
continue.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Okay.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Okay,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
so

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
this is just

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
for the infrared.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I just said

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
that

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
light and

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
infrared

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
are different from

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
radiation or radiation.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
They are different wavelengths

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
and have different properties.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
So we can have

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
different ways to adjust them.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
The second part

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
is also

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
for architecture.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
But we won't

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
do

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
this small device.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
We will talk about architecture.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Excuse me, Bo-Jun.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Do you have a video?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I didn't see it.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Let's share it again.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Sorry.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Sorry.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Sorry for

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
interrupting.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Okay,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
do you have it?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Do you have it?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Yes, I have it.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I have it.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Okay,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
the second part is

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
that

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
another way

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
to save energy

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
from building

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
is to

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
use

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
renewable

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
energy

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
directly.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Renewable energy is

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
very simple.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
We all know that

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
renewable energy is

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
a very mature industry.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Not many people

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
know that

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
there is another popular

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
field in the academic world

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
called radiative cooling.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Actually,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
it has been happening

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
all the time.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
When we

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
are in a vacuum,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
besides the sun

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
giving you energy,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
you are also radiating

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
to the earth.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It's hard to imagine,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
but as I said,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
infrared is a kind of light.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
If you take a laser

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
and shine it to the sky,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
you can shine it all the way to the moon.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
So for light,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
as long as nothing absorbs it,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
it will keep going.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
So when you are

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
on the surface of the earth,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
let's say 25 degrees,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
you are radiating to the universe,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
which is 3 Kelvin.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
So this is a very, very large temperature difference

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
that we can use

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
as a source of energy.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
It's hard to say

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
why you don't feel

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
the energy

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
when you are outside in the daytime

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
because the sun is too strong.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
This is why the academic world

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
has been doing

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
various materials

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
to make

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
what we call

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
daytime radiative cooling.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
It can reflect

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
all the sunlight,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
but there is still

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
a very strong radiation

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
that can do the cooling.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
So this studio,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
as Ye Min said,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I was at Stanford

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
and after my Ph.D. and postdoc,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I suddenly realized

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
that the world

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
has 4G.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
In California,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
it's basically the same every day.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
The result of having 4G

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
is that when this building

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
may be good for heating

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
in winter,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
but it needs cooling

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
in summer.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
So buildings,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
like people,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
all need a control function

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
to have the best

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
energy saving

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
portfolio

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
in a year with 4G.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
So we want to

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
have these two

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
sources of renewable energy

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
in the building

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
at the same time.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
But it's not that simple.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
The solar heating

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
and radiative cooling

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
require exactly the opposite

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
qualities.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
As an ideal

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
solar heating material,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
you want it to absorb

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
all the sunlight.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
You don't want it to

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
keep all the

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
heat radiation

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
around you.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
On the other hand,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
for radiative cooling,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
you want to do the opposite.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
You don't want to absorb

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
any sunlight.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
You want to maximize

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
the amount of heat

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
in the building.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
But you can't

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
control these two

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
materials by adding

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
or subtracting.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
You have to replace

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
the whole material

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
by chemical

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
or other methods.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
So we chose

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
an engineering solution

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
with different

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
land scale tricks

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
and different performance.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
But there is also

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
the possibility of

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
dual-mode control.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
We made a film

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
that is very light

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
and can be

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
made into a roll-to-roll.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
You can move

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
the film

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
in a roll-to-roll way.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
We put the

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
solar heating

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
and radiative cooling

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
on the film.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
We can use

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
the motor to switch.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
First of all,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
this material needs

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
good heating and cooling performance.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Let me briefly

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
introduce

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
the principles of these two parts.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
In terms of heating,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
we use

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
plasmonic absorber.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Basically,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
it is used to make

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
small metal nanoparticles.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
We have

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
used

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
a sound wave,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
right?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
The sound wave

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
has a fixed frequency.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
The size of the sound wave

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
or the frequency of the sound wave

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
will have different frequencies.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
The size of the nanoparticle

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
corresponds to the absorption

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
of visible light.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
There are many different sizes of nanoparticles.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
You can absorb

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
all the sunlight.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
At the same time,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
because it is metal,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
it does not emit light.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I said in the last project

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
that if it is a metal nanoparticle,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
it does not emit light.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
A metal nanoparticle

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
can be designed

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
to be a perfect

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
solar absorber,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
but it is a bad

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
infrared emitter.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
On the other hand,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
we use

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
PDMA.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
PDMA is a transparent

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
rubber.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
It is called silicone.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
It is transparent

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
under visible light or sunlight,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
but it is a good

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
absorber,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
so the result is

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
a PDMA-covered

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
silver mirror.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
We can reflect

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
sunlight, but it is a good

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
absorber.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
We deliberately chose

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
these two materials

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
to be very scalable.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Because this thing

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
is going to be used by the building.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
It is impossible to choose

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
a very unscalable

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
equipment.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Basically,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
we are limiting

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
the size of the equipment

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
in our school.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
For example,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
a 12-centimeter-wide

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
film side-by-side.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
This is

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
the opposite

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
optical quality I just mentioned.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Of course, it is not perfect,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
but it is close to the

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
trend I just described.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Alpha and

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Epsilon. Alpha is

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
the absorption of sunlight, and

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Epsilon is the emission of infrared light.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
For example,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
PDMA is a very high

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
absorption of infrared light.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
This is okay,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
but it can

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
be lower.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Cooling is

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
visible light.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Solar does not need to be absorbed.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
It is an infrared emission.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
So this 2.7

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
is not

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
less than 5%.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Basically, you can't achieve

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
an effective cooling.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Because the sunlight is too strong.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
The quality of both

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
materials

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
takes some time

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
to optimize the

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
material synthesis conditions.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
In addition,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
we use a

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
motor to

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
move the film to

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
make the material lighter

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
and thinner.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
At the same time, it can also

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
reduce the energy

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
required for switching.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
In addition, you don't want

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
the material to be too thick.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Because if it is too thick,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
you have to spend some energy

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
to heat it or cool it.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
It is more thermodynamic.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
This is a simple demonstration

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
of its durability.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I did it 100 times.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Its performance is basically

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
unchanged.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
The third point is

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
not so obvious,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
but it is very important.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
It is called reversible thermal contact.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
You can imagine that when the film

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
moves to the left,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
the solar heating will be very hot

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
and the water cooling will be very cold.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
But if you can't

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
bring this heat or cold

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
to the building,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
it will be meaningless.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Reversible thermal contact

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
is when we fix it,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
we hope that it can

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
bring the heat down,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
but it can also remove

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
and make a switching.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
We use static electricity

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
as a driving force

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
to realize this function.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Basically, it is

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
a metal electrode

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
and substrate

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
as an electrode board.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
As you can see,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
the higher the voltage,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
the higher the thermal contact.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
On the right is the reference.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
This is our film.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
The higher the voltage,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
the closer it is to the reference.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
In other words,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
it can bring all the heat

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
at the bottom.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
This is a way

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
to reduce

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
or increase

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
its thermal contact conductance.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
This is a relatively

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
simple way to describe it.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
This is...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
We want to demonstrate

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
that we don't need

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
to keep adding static electricity.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
It's like today,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I know the capacitor.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
After you add the voltage to the capacitor,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
you break the voltage,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
and the voltage is still there.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
If you are

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
a circuit breaker.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
So today,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
as long as you don't

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
break the voltage,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
it will stay there

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
until the water

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
or something else

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
takes the voltage away.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
We measured

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
how long the voltage

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
can stay at the top.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
After three days,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
we can see the decay.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
But it doesn't matter

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
if it's decayed.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
We just need to touch it

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
a little bit

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
This is a video

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
of a real device

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
moving.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
We use this motor

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
to move it.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
The black part is

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
the solar heater.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
The reflective part

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
is the radiator cooler.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
This is the actual

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
roof of our school.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
We did this experiment.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Doing this experiment

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
was actually

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
very difficult.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
If it rains, we can't do it.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Anyway,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
this is our

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
actual data.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
The positive value

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
is for heating.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
The negative value is for cooling.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
We put a sensor

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
to measure this.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
We also verified

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
the importance

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
of the voltage

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
in this device.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
When we

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
gradually increase the voltage,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
we can see that

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
the number of heating and cooling

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
has increased.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Switching

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
takes about one or two minutes.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
In terms of

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
a building's time scale,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
it's very fast.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Then we compare

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
the data

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
with the

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
model value.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
The model value is

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
the weather,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
the solar energy,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
the humidity,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
and the wind speed.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I can expect

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
how much heating

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
and cooling.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
If the measurement

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
is close to the model,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
it means that

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
the thermal contact

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
has been solved.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
We can see

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
the black line

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
is the model value,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and the red line

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
is the model value.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Lastly,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
we hope

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
that this

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
dual-mode device

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
can be used

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
in other places

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
in the United States.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
As I said,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
buildings

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
require

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
dynamic

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
and smart tuning.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
With this

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
dual-mode device,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
we expect

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
it can be used

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
in different climatic areas

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
in the most

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
effective way.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
In fact,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
if your building

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
can only do heating,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
you can save a lot of energy

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
in the Five Lakes

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
and the Northeast.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Does it make sense?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Cooling is more average.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
As you know,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
in the East China Sea,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
the East China Sea is

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
hot in the winter and cold in the summer.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
In the West China Sea,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
the four seasons are different.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Cooling is basically needed

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
in every place.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
If you have dual-mode today,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
you can choose

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
to do cooling or heating

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
when it is cold.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
In different areas,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
you can have a cool

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
or energy-saving

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
improvement.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Finally,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
to summarize,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
the two main tasks today

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
are dual-mode

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
and

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I don't know

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
whether it can do heating

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
or cooling.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
We also demonstrated

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
multi-spectral,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
which is to say,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
it can control

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
the two different

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
wavelengths.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Let's talk about

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
what kind of work

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
we want to do

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
from now on.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
For example,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
we can further subdivide

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
the concept of multi-spectral.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
We know that although it is solar,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
it also has visible light

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
and infrared.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Infrared is

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
coming from the sun,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
but it can't be seen.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Today,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I just want to see the scenery.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
If we can

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
subdivide it,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
there will be more

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
useful functions.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
In addition,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
we need to use

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
telemetry to control it.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Basically,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
these two tasks

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
are controlled by

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
mechanical methods.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
For many applications,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
moving part

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
is not a good thing.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
It is easy to be damaged.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Telemetry has

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
advantages in this aspect.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Of course,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
it is also more fun

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
in Fundamental Material Science.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
For example,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Electrochromic,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
we are doing a topic

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
about

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
wearable infrared

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
control.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Basically,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
it can control

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
the radiation

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
from 1.5 times

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
to 1.5 times.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Another one

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
is

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
the work of

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
an audience called

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Dai Yiqin Initiator.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
It basically follows

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
the control of

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Miraiya solar.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
But we don't use

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
mechanical methods,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
which is the same as before.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
After we add electricity,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Miraiya becomes

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
higher,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
solar becomes lower,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
and vice versa,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
solar becomes higher,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Miraiya becomes lower.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
This is my talk today.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I should acknowledge

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Lai Yiqin,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
but that is

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
not the case.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
The main work is

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
completed by my postdoc

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
and the students.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
My collaborator is

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Duke's

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Willie Padilla,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
and Wyoming's

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Kang Tan.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Thank you.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Before we start,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I would like to

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
thank Lai Yiqin

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
for his wonderful talk.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Thank you.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I don't think it will be long.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I think the time is just right.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
We usually have

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
this kind of time.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
So,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
I don't know

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
if you have any questions.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Since it is

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
over,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
please turn on your mic.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
If you are too shy,

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
you can ask me.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Can I ask a question?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
No.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
You can ask.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Oh, no. I was shot.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
We are classmates.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
We are college roommates.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Oh, right.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
I just want to

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
thank Taira

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
for this great platform.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
We haven't seen each other

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
for hundreds of years.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Let me introduce myself.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I am Ethan,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
and I am doing research

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
in the field of materials.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
We are college classmates.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
This platform

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
is cross-field.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
I don't want to get into

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
material science.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I don't want people to know

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
what we are talking about.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I want to ask a general question.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
We are all overseas.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I believe this platform

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
is for Taiwanese

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
who are mainly scholars.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I want to ask you

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
to share your experience

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
in Duke.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
You worked hard

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
to get a faculty position.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
This is the light of Taiwan.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I want to ask

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
about your experience

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
in this platform

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
and your connection with Taiwan.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
For example,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
you interviewed students in Taiwan.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
You also had a job interview

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
with some PhD students.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I want to ask you to share

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
what I think can be discussed.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
First, what is the current situation of Taiwanese students?

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
For example, how active are they in studying abroad?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Second,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
on a global scale,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
what do you think

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
are the advantages of being Taiwanese?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
What was the first question?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
The first one is...

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I know you didn't sleep well.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
The second one is the level of activity, right?

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Yes.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I think

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
in general,

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
everyone should have

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
a sense of crisis.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Of course, I think

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Taiwan's society is stable

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
and prosperity is a good thing.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
But I think

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
in terms of security,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
at least

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
since we went abroad,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I've only heard about the situation in Taiwan.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
But, for example,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
there are fewer and fewer people studying abroad.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I don't think many people want to go abroad.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Actually, I'm curious about where everyone is going.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
If it's a financial system,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
it should be obvious.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Of course, everyone has their own...

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Everyone has their own aspirations.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
But I think

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
this distribution...

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Fewer people

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
are doing academic research.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
In the long run,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
it's not good.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
We'll be short of a lot of...

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
First,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
let's say

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
in the first ten or twenty years,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
there will be more potential

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
for growth.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
But in

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
other countries,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
the connection

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
will be weaker.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I still encourage

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
everyone to

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
take more risks.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
What's the first question?

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Share your experience

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
building connections with Taiwan.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Of course,

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
my experience is

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
taking care of Taiwanese people.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Let me give you an example.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I met

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
a Taiwanese

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
in a meeting.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
We discussed

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
how to promote

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Taiwanese students

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
to study abroad.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
At the time,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I suggested...

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
It's simple.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I was teaching in

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
an American school.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
If Taiwanese students

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
can get

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
a small living

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
allowance,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
for example,

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
they can come to me

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
or other teachers

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
to do summer research

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and get a recommendation.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I think it's easier

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
than

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
building a

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
school-to-school

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
memorandum.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
If you sign a memorandum,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
you'll know

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
you have a weak connection

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
with the teacher.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
As a Ph.D.,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
you can't do that.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
If you can do that,

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I think

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
it's possible.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Actually,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I brought this student

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
this summer,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
but it became remote

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
due to COVID-19.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I don't know

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
how she'll do.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
It's her first year.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
But I think

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
it's a good summer experience.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
For me,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I...

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
For her,

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
she has a very direct

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
teacher's recommendation

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
in the U.S.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
It's very detailed.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
It's different

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
from the teacher's

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
recommendation in Taiwan.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
This is the style

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
between Taiwan and the U.S.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
In Taiwan,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
a lot of students

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
in the U.S.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
would look at

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
when they met this student.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
What was their first impression

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
when they first met her?

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
What project did she do?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
What did she do?

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
What did she do?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
What did she do?

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
What did she do?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
What did she do?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
What did she do?

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
What did she do?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Even if she was an exchange student,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
it's not as detailed.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
This is my...

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
This year,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I established a new

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
connection with Taiwan.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
It's a new experiment.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I think it's a good point.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I'm a beneficiary.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
We also have students

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
who are like you.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Visiting students.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Because of your recommendation,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
we have some opportunities

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
for students

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
to exchange abroad

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
in college.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Of course, it's not much,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
but it's a big difference

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
for a poor student.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Of course, we will try to make up for it.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
We try to help with some costs,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
such as experimental fees,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
some space, and so on.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
As for living expenses,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
she may have to figure it out herself.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I believe it's across the board.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Many Taiwanese friends

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
are serving in different schools.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Let's see if there's a chance

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
to compete with her mother's school.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Of course, the school can do it.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
If there is such an opportunity,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
exchange students with Taiwanese students.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Of course, the main purpose

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
is to get a recommendation later.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And this thing

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
is easy to do.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Because for us,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
today, of course,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
there is a layer of alumni relationship.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
But even if you go to

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
a non-alumni,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
you tell him you have a free labor

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
to work for you.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
No one will say no.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
It will be very simple.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
If you choose a more official

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
recommendation today,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
but you have to admit your academic qualifications

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
and credit,

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
it will be very troublesome.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
And let me tell you first

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
that now all schools

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
have some operations,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
such as 2 plus 2.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
It's a bit like Chinese people

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
stealing Western resources

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
to train their students.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
At least I don't know other places,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
but our whole country in Australia

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
has banned

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
signing MOUs with any place

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
in detail.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
So you can't sign it.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
You can't sign it at all.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
So

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I think

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
it's the first year

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
now.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Let's see how this student applies.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Of course, his application is mainly related

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
to his own ability.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
But I think

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
this may help.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
OK.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
That's about it. Don't take up my time.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Yiting, do you have anything to add?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Yiting is my

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
first

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Taiwanese student.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Hello, everyone. I'm Yiting.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I have a question.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Can you hear me?

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Yes, I can.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Now

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
it's global warming,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
so Taiwan's summer temperature

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
has reached 37-38 degrees.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I went with my uncle to visit

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
a orchid farmer.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
They use a greenhouse.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
During the day,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
the sunlight comes in.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
But because the temperature is too high,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
they have to turn on the air conditioner all the time.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Because their orchids are very large,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
their air conditioner power is not enough,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
so many orchids die.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Now because of global warming,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Taiwan's orchids

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
also have other problems.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
They can't lower

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
the temperature to the right temperature.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Do you have any suggestions?

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Sure.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Like I said earlier,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
first of all,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
you have to let the light in.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
The cheapest way

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
is to add a black cloth.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
That's the cheapest way.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
A more high-tech way

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
is to

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
block the part

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
where the sunlight

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
is only hot.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
You can reduce it a little bit.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I think

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
in terms of greenhouse,

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
transparent is the first priority.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
So this is a little bit

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
related to my last slide

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
about the future world.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Today,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
for a very special requirement,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
there will be a different approach.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
The dual mode

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
just now

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
doesn't work because it's not transparent.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Orchids are all dead.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
So we have to think of

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
a new material solution.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
The interesting part is here.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
For this different application.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Thank you.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Does anyone have any questions?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Our discussion today

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
is because we already asked

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
so we don't have to

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
ask about the content.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I think the content is really interesting.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I'm not a professional

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
so I can't ask professional questions.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
I want to leave it

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
at the end

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
and let everyone

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
discuss first.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
If there are any questions

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
related to the content,

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
we can discuss

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
whether it is

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
students studying abroad

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
or international cooperation

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
between teachers.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
This is definitely

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
the core of Terra.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
You can speak

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
later.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
What time is our meeting scheduled?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
In fact, there are only about 10 minutes left.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
If everyone has something to say,

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
you can also be neutral.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
If you want to stay and discuss later,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
this room can be kept open.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
After 10 minutes,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
you can turn it off.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
It's a bit stressful to talk while recording.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
I've been waiting for you to turn it off.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I'll ask the next question first.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I'm going to turn it off.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
What?

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Are you going to turn it off?

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Wait, let me finish my question first.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I have a question.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I just saw you talking about

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
the D

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
written in Chongqing style,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
right?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I was thinking

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
when I went to see your website,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
you mentioned

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
that the cloth becomes transparent

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
after it is covered,

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
but the white cloth

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
will pass the red line,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
so there is no cloth

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
in Chongqing.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
But if

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
the transparent cloth

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
doesn't pass the red line,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
so you can see the cloth.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I was thinking

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
these things

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
can be used

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
for confidential communication

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
or other applications.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Do you know what I mean?

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
These possibilities are...

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Can you answer this question?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Yes, of course.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Actually,

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
the red line

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
means

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
that

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
you can imagine

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
if

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
you have

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
a sensor

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
and you

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
take a picture of

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
the background

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
of the red line,

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
and you know

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
what the background looks like,

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
then you

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
wear a

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
pixel-by-pixel display,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
and you adjust

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
the radiation on your body

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
to be the same as the background,

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
then you are

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
transparent in real life.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Yes,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
there are many...

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Yes, yes.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I was thinking that

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
it's like a encryption.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
You put something on it,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
but in a certain channel,

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
it's actually transparent.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
You have to decode it.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
It's like that.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
You can think like that.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
At least I thought like that when I saw it.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Yes,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
basically,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
we are talking about

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
a visible

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
material.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
It can have

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
a color of

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
heat radiation.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
You can control it

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
separately like this.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
OK.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
But in this case,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
in the application of communication,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
it will be

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
like what we usually

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
say,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
like the encryption of visual data

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
and decode it.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Compared to that,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
how efficient is it?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Because it's not a very...

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
When we do communication,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
we don't think like that.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But in terms of concept, it's a bit like that.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Is it more efficient?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Or is its safety level

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
higher? I think the safety level is lower.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
the efficiency seems to be quite high.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Because it can be...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It can be recorded.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
amount of

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
data will be smaller.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I don't know.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I think if I really want to

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
push it like this,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I can think about it.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
If you do it today,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
suppose I only have

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
a very narrow

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
wavelength

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
with

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
specific text.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I can't see the other wavelengths.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Let me tell you

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
how many

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
wavelengths I'm going to use today.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Then you can see my text in this wavelength.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You can't see the other wavelengths.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
In this case, it may be possible.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Because you talked about the

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
rush later, I think it's really cool.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So I just thought

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
it was a bit like what you said.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And because of

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
the control of the

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
current of the film,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
you can have a schedule.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It doesn't have to be

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
a fixed wavelength.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It will change

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
according to some other conditions.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So even if you

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
really find that wavelength,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
it's only for that second.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Because it's already

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
somewhere else.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So it's a

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
visual data

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
that covers it.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Because at least people

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
can't see it, so it's a visual data

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
method.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Yes.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I don't know.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I just thought about it.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I think

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
it's pretty cool.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
But I don't have

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
a lot of ideas to realize this thing.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
But I think it's okay.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
You can think about it.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I'm done asking.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Because what I do

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I'm not doing material science.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I'm not doing chemistry or physics.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm doing more communication research.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
So I think about

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
this kind of thing.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Yes.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
You can

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
brainstorm again another day.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Okay.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Do you have any more questions?

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Then

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
if there are no questions,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I'll turn off the recording.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I'll turn it off.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
1, 2, 3.
