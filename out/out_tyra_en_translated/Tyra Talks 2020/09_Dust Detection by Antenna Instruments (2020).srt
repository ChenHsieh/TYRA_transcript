00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
OK, thank you very much for being able to participate in the weekly speech of Taira today, and of course, thank you very much to our speaker today, Shen Mingxue, for sharing with us what she is going to talk about today.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Before we start, let me quickly introduce Ms. Mingxue. Mingxue is a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Next, we will continue to read about the details of space science related to the CU Boulder.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But I think the most interesting thing is that when I look at her introduction, it looks like a Star Trek fan.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is the technology required for space exploration, as well as the research that needs to be solved, which is very exciting.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Without further ado, let's give the time to Mingxue, and then let me warmly welcome today's speaker, Shen Mingxue.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Shen Mingxue is a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
She has a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Today, I would like to introduce the measurement and exploration of cosmic dust.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you can see my mouse on the right, we are using a lot of spacecraft.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What I do is related to space. When I was in college, I watched a lot of movies, so I wanted to know something about Star Trek.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
There is a space engine in Star Trek, so I went to the teacher to ask him what kind of space engine could be used in space.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Later, I found that it was not practical, and when I was in the master's class, I was not good at it. There is an impulse drive on Star Trek, which is the so-called electric power engine.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I went to the master's thesis and did an impulse drive. After doing it, I found that there were not many people using it in the world.

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:18,000
At that time, the propulsion in space was still a rocket or a coolant. My so-called rocket is only the chemical propulsion and combustion. This part is related to its propulsion or other things.

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Another part is that you need to pay attention to the space environment where you are in the space when you are in space.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The space environment we are in today is very different from the one we are protected by the entire atmosphere. I went to do some research on the electric power layer later.

18
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now when I come here, we start to do star science and do some aspects related to cosmic dust. I have done some data analysis of Cassini.

19
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What I have been doing recently is the Parker Solar Propeller and the Solar Orbiter. The one above is NASA, and the one below is a project mainly cooperated by ESA and NASA.

20
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Both are orbiting within a solar unit within 1 AU near the sun. Why is it special? I want to mention this distance.

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:25,000
When we talk about cosmic dust later, the space environment is close to the distance of the sun, the position of the solar unit on the earth, and even the outer solar system.

22
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The space environment is different. This will lead to the charging effect of our probe or spacecraft, that is, the charging effect on it or the position it is in is different.

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It will have a different interaction with the surrounding background environment, which may lead to different things happening on both sides of cosmic dust.

24
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The first thing we need to talk about is dust. When we go to the beach, there is also sand, or when you wipe the floor, there will be some dust. These are indeed called dust in Chinese.

25
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But scientifically speaking, these dusts still have to start with the Big Bang, which is the large-scale theory we are talking about. After all, it is the source of all matter.

26
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So the Big Bang is the beginning, and then it starts to gather or form some hydrogen or hydrogen, and then it slowly starts to have more and more ions, and then it finally forms more atoms and molecules.

27
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In the end, it forms our galaxy or the entire universe. In the middle of this process, cosmic dust is often a very important role.

28
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You often see some photos in astronomy about the nebula. The nebula is simply a cluster of clouds, which contains a lot of gas or dust.

29
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:06,000
When they gather together, they become such a nebula. But because there is density inside, so when they get denser and denser, another singular noun is dense molecular cloud.

30
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It is also a part of the nebula, but it slowly, because at the beginning of the universe, we said there was a strange point, and it was very hot.

31
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:26,000
After it began to slowly expand, its temperature began to drop. After a long time, when its temperature became slightly less than high, and then slightly denser and denser, it began to form molecules.

32
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In the process of these formations, it slowly began to evolve and form. When those heavier and heavier substances are formed, they slowly gather.

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Because of some gravity, it will begin to form some possible stars that are going to form a star.

34
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Next, another form will appear, which is the stellar nebula. It is really going to form our star. It will encounter some gravitational collapse and gather it up.

35
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then, its core will begin to heat up more and more until it begins to form a fusion state.

36
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In the process of these, all of their molecules, atoms, and gatherings will begin to encounter some fine, iron, aluminum processes, plus some high-energy UV or other high-energy ions colliding.

37
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It will produce some basic examples of cosmic dust. At present, it is still in a theoretical state, which means that its theory is not yet complete, and we do not yet know how they are produced.

38
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
After all, if we can be clear about this, we may be able to start thinking about how organic matter is produced, or how our life originates.

39
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In the end, this whole situation will begin to form an original nebula. The center of the original nebula is a star, and then it will start to rotate around the orbit.

40
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
After the orbit, they will begin to gather into 10 stones, larger asteroids, and even form the eight stars we are in.

41
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In these cases, it forms a so-called stable orbit, which means that when you have a star-shaped orbit like the Earth, we will roughly clear out the dust of these places around the distance of our astronomical unit, either gathered or sucked into the atmosphere.

42
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If there is no gathering, there will be a small nebula between the Earth and Mars that we are familiar with.

43
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
After billions of years, when the sun is no longer the current yellow, it slowly becomes a red giant and slowly reaches the end of its life.

44
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03,000
As soon as it explodes, it swallows all of our stars, and then it spits out those substances. It eventually becomes a small stone, becomes dust, and returns to the origin.

45
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That is, in the end, this so-called planetary nebula is directly blown up, and then it becomes a very beautiful, clouded image.

46
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's why we usually say dust to dust. The reason we say dust to dust is because some of the cosmic dust that was created at the beginning, some small substances, and then slowly gather together to form bigger things, until they can become a solar system, a star system.

47
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:49,000
In the process, there will be some satellites, some small stars, and then interplanetary dust. In the end, after the whole explosion is blown up, it will all come back again.

48
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In other words, all of us here are a part of the star system, and we are all their main components.

49
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, let's jump back. In the solar system, we have a lot of cosmic dust. In the upper left corner, this is our Cassini, which was on its way to Saturn.

50
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It encountered a satellite in the middle called Enceladus. The interesting thing is that it will spray this kind of water ice dust in its south pole. We call it dust, or we call it a small particle, a small crystal.

51
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Scientists are very interested in whether there will be any life on the surface of the ice. The other one is that it can produce Saturn's E-ring, E-ring, the little crystals that we can see, which are made up of these dust.

52
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Or in the upper right corner, our moon also has a lot of dust, and then it will have some dust because of some magnetic field fluctuations and some external solar wind blowing.

53
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That is, before the astronauts went up there to step on a footprint and stepped on that footprint, that was the dust.

54
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There are also some very interesting examples, such as the Saturn satellite Io in the lower left corner. The volcano will erupt, and after it erupts, the particles that erupt into dust will start to go into the solar system after the gravity of Saturn's star group is finished.

55
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So there will be a part of the group coming from there near our Earth. Or we used to have people, uh, Rosetta, right, uh, European probe, they went to this, uh, 67P to learn about these dust streams.

56
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Or the Japanese who just came back, they just picked up some dust from the little stars of the Dragon Palace. Or the next new flagship plan is to go to another satellite in Jupiter, Europa, to measure some of the cosmic dust.

57
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay, so is there anything closer? First of all, the cosmic dust is probably going to look like this, and it's probably within a few microns. Of course, if it's a little bigger, it's probably up to 100 to 1000 microns.

58
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There is also a kind of classification, the so-called nanodust. The main thing is that if you are on our Earth, uh, I remember it was early in the morning to the east, uh, west to the east, to the west.

59
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:49,000
When you look to the west, you will see something like yellow light, and yellow light is interplanetary dust, which is the so-called dust in the solar system, which is constantly fixed by the gravity of the sun, and it has its own orbit.

60
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It will scatter some of the sunlight, and what we see is the yellow light, and what we just saw is the bright E ring, which is what we just said, Enceladus, which is caused by the dust of those ice crystals blown out by the South Pole.

61
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No, or when our comet usually passes by, we will see the dust tail, the dust tail, so the dust tail is the dust tail, which is our dust.

62
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, since we have a lot of dust in our solar system, how do we measure it? There are a lot of measurements on the right side, including you can see the light, you can see the thermal emission, or someone can use the radar, even like Arecibo, Arecibo Astronomical Observatory, they can measure some, uh, some things about the comet.

63
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well, the main thing we do in space, if we use a satellite or a spacecraft to measure, it is the so-called impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization.

64
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, what about this thing? The impact ionization mechanism is directly related to the volume or weight of your dust.

65
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So what is the mechanism of the impact ionization? If we have a high-speed L, which is generally considered high-speed, which is at least greater than 1 km per second, if our dust hits any surface,

66
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:37,000
then the first thing that comes out may be some neutral particles or ions or electrons, because we have tied it up, uh, to become impact ionization, which is ionization.

67
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So there will be ions and electrons, and of course some solid pieces will be sprayed out, which is from those, from that spacecraft or anything else.

68
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Then its formula, here you will mainly see that it is related to the weight of your cosmic dust and the speed of its impact, and the speed of this impact is even more powerful.

69
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Okay, so why do we say this is important? The first one is that we can use this mechanism to understand the weight of your impact, and the weight will usually be directly or indirectly related to its volume.

70
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The other one we can know its speed, so when we know its weight and speed, if we can use other methods to know the location or source of its impact, we can roughly simulate its orbit, its position, its size in the entire solar system.

71
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If we go back, we can understand where it may come from, from Jupiter, from Saturn, or where it comes from. If we go back, we may understand, uh, or even know, uh, how long these dusts have lived in the solar system.

72
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Can it tell us some information about life that happened a long time ago or something? What about the electromagnetic cloud generated by the impact plasma cloud? Some related formulas may be related to some temperature, some speed, and some other things.

73
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So how can we measure it? Generally speaking, it is not measured by the antenna we are talking about. It is actually measured by some of these so-called, uh, a lot of electrical networks.

74
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then we can get some scale maps, and from the scale map, we can know that, uh, the ice or dust that hit it contains some, uh, gas, carbon, CH-related, or some silver, iron, uh, uh, gold, or something else.

75
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Then these can help us understand that the components on it and even whether there are some organic matter. The one in the upper left corner is the Cassini project.

76
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Well, the instrument it carries is something similar in the middle. There is another very interesting thing that, uh, they used to install some so-called PVDF, which is a very thin film.

77
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That thin film is when there is ice or dust hitting it, it will also produce a similar electrical signal. This is just the difference between different instruments, but it is actually the same, uh, mechanism to measure.

78
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay, so let's go back to how we use the antenna to measure. How does the antenna do the measurement? It must have a collision at the beginning to measure something.

79
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:31,000
After the collision, it is 5 to 10 or 12 kilometers per second because of the high speed. This is relative to the speed of our probe, which means that when the probe flies 100 kilometers per second, like Parker Solar Probe, it actually flies faster.

80
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:48,000
After the collision, it produces the electric field cloud of Impact Plasma Cloud. It will start to expand because it is going to leave. At this time, we will have the effect of charging on the probe or on our antenna.

81
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:04,000
In the end, it will be our background, because we are actually in the state of electric field in space. The electric field in our space mainly comes from some of the electrons, light, or other direct things brought by the solar wind.

82
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's talk about the space environment a little later. So we mainly find that if a main instrument, like the one just now, is very expensive, several kilograms, 7, 8 kilograms, or even more than 10 kilograms, it can only be measured in such a small place.

83
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But what about our antenna instrument? Our antenna instrument has a form called monopole. The difference in its measurement location is on the antenna and our probe. That is to say, anything can hit the antenna.

84
00:19:40,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It can also hit any part of the body of the entire probe. In other words, the entire probe is the surface area that we can measure. Compared to this small, special one, we will tell people that, of course, what we can measure is definitely not as complicated as the design just now.

85
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It may be more complicated to measure, and it may even be flat. But we can tell them more supplementary information and some basic features of Impact Plasma Cloud. So we will say that it is very sensitive because it has a very large measuring surface area.

86
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:40,000
When we do research, the predecessor must have done something. What the predecessors have done is probably to say that they found that they provided some theory that after the impact, they felt that all signals were only related to the antenna.

87
00:20:40,000 --> 00:21:04,000
They did not consider the fact that they hit the probe, and they said that they felt that because the antenna was measuring something, it was just a probe, so it was only related to the antenna. The second person said that after the object hit it, I think it may be related to the antenna, but mainly because it hit the body, so its formula is only related to the spacecraft itself.

88
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The third person said that I think what you said before is wrong. Since our formula is called the difference between the signal on the antenna and the signal on the probe, the two may be able to measure something.

89
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So he used a correct idea to do it, but he did not know how to understand how this signal was, so he assumed some mathematical formulas and then did fitting, and then he found that the fitting was not very good, so he kept introducing new variables, and then after the introduction, he gave some experimental parameters, and finally found that it was OK.

90
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So we will sum up the above, we will find that in fact, we may not know how the signal is produced, but we know that there is a signal, and there is no good qualitative model at present, which is what we want to do.

91
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Fortunately, what the people in front of them do is to analyze two things in space. At Colorado University, we can not only do those analyzes, but we also have a so-called accelerator, we can simulate the impact of dust.

92
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What kind of device is this? It is a peletron, which you can imagine as a static accelerator, which is what I call an electron cannon.

93
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It will pass through some of our middle Particle Selection Units, which is the speed at which we can control the impact above. We can set our model to the lower left corner, which is a space probe model.

94
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We can set its floating position on the body, which is about how much. We can know that different antenna configurations are actually different, and the impact position will be related later.

95
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There is another one, because after we collide, we produce electrons and ions. If some of the students of the Institute of Engineering or the Institute of Physics know that electrons and ions, it will start to work with the battery factory, and it may rotate.

96
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:28,000
In this case, if we encounter a magnetic field, or some external magnetic field, the impact plasma that actually erupts will have a different shape.

97
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Another one is that we find that the dust particles of different materials may have different reactions after they collide. This has a lot to do with the atomic mass contained in it, or some of its other substances on the surface of the probe surface.

98
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Later, we will talk about this thing, which is more mathematical or physical. We will talk about Induced Charging and Direct Charging. In other words, if you imagine this yellow ball as a charge, you put a dot outside.

99
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Finally, after we go through the so-called image charge method, we will sum it up. In other words, on this whole ball, in fact, this ball is the subsequent probe. What you measure will include the entire charge on this ball, your probe.

100
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:46,000
In addition, when the external charge is further away, it will have a 1 over r decay, which is a lot of electric field, or electric position, or something else.

101
00:24:46,000 --> 00:25:04,000
When you are close to your parents, you have a greater limit, and when you are far away, the limit you are subject to is relatively small, and the impact you are subject to is relatively small. So what's on top of this is fixed, but what's far away from the dot will be reduced with the distance.

102
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So what about our antenna signal? You will find that this is very similar to the thing I just drew, the Cassini number.

103
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:31,000
After we hit it, didn't we just say that there was a cloud, and then it went out? At this time, in general, the electrons will expand faster, and then the ions will expand slower.

104
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:45,000
In this case, it will produce a signal similar to the one in the lower left corner. The main source of this situation is because your spacecraft may be positive or negative.

105
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If your probe is positive, you will absorb some negative electrons on the surface with positive electricity, and you may be negative.

106
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Then all the ions will leave, and then these leave, which is what we just talked about. In the process of leaving, it will produce different positions on your probe correspondingly.

107
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:32,000
In general, you can imagine a situation, and then the electrons start to go out, so the electrons go out correspondingly to the ions that remain on your probe, so you are positive.

108
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But in this case, because we are on both sides, we usually cut off the antenna signal and the probe signal. In this case, we generally think that when the antenna is far away, we simplify it as the oscillation of the position of the probe alone.

109
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So we just said that the electrons ran away first, and the rest of the main positive on the probe, because of the negative number just mentioned, so it gets a feature of downward.

110
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Then your ions are gone, and your probe is not so positive, so it is relatively negative. Negative plus a negative number, it becomes a positive, and then it comes down.

111
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So in general, as long as you see a similar signal, in general, any beam probe in space, the signal of general dust is all like this.

112
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:41,000
This is a very complicated formula, mainly to tell us that when you have something hit your probe at the beginning, the thing that hits it will produce a charge because of the oil or electricity.

113
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It is directly related to the quality and speed of the dust that hits it.

114
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Next, because of the position of the probe, it may be positive or negative.

115
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:08,000
In contrast, your ions or electrons will be divided into those who have enough energy to escape, or those who are trapped on the surface.

116
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Then we can get these different quantities and tell them that they are collected and stuck on it, or they can escape.

117
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The charging equation will finally tell us which ones are on top, which ones are gone, and it is related to 1 over r decay.

118
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
There is also the so-called discharging, which is a very fun thing.

119
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Discharging comes from the solar wind in the space environment, for example, when light hits, it produces a light-emitting effect and kicks out an electron.

120
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Then your spacecraft will become positive, or the electron hits and is absorbed, and your spacecraft becomes negative.

121
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So we will have a floating potential floating position in space, which is the meaning of this so-called discharging.

122
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Finally, according to q is equal to cv conversion equation, we can get the floating picture of the position just now.

123
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:13,000
What we just talked about is the equation we came up with, and we found that the equation is the so-called red thing and the green experiment thing.

124
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
The so-called discharging feels pretty good, and it can provide us with some numbers or some information.

125
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It tells us that after these impacts are collected, what are some of the characteristics of the electricity generation temperature, electron temperature and ion temperature?

126
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Or after it produces the electron, how can it leave its speed or its background?

127
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Because when we were experimenting, we knew the so-called position floating and we knew the speed of impact and mass.

128
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So we can understand the following things, but on the other hand, in space, we actually don't know much about the above information.

129
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So we are mainly from the following things, after you have finished, we can guess the position of the floating above.

130
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Then according to our orbital mechanics calculation, we can guess that the speed of impact is about how much.

131
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Then from the following data to rebut tell us that how much is the value of our dust?

132
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So it is the so-called, we are generally talking about the measurement of the antenna instrument, it is similar to the supplementation or the measurement of a specific dedicated measurement.

133
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Then we will think that we want to make a standard model, then you will find that this kind of thing looks like Sputnik, or it is very similar to the Pike solar propeller.

134
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Because we want to know if it is hit in any place, its signal is the same, but we find that it is not the case.

135
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So this is a top view, you will find that after the impact, if it corresponds to 45 degrees away from any antenna, you will find that it actually looks very similar.

136
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That is, its signal may be almost the same, which is mainly what we said before, most of the reaction is on the probe, so it is caused by the probe charging.

137
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:33,000
But when we look to the right, we will find that if your impact is very close to a certain antenna, it will have a very special peak.

138
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Then we think this is related to induced charging, because we have added this conductor antenna here, so we think it will affect this.

139
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Then we think this is a very important reason, because the first thing you have to do is to make a box.

140
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
If this kind of thing just affects your box, in fact, the number of boxes here is not the real thing, it may actually be some fake things.

141
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So we have to understand the location of the impact first, and then we can restore the real box process to get the real data hidden in it.

142
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So the paper we are writing now is to tell you that we think we can simulate this situation.

143
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That is to say, if you simplify what you just saw into a probe and an antenna, you will find that some of the boxes will be collected after the impact, and some will leave, as we just said.

144
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Because they are not particles at all, they are electrons, so they are charged.

145
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The charge will produce an electric field line, for example, at the beginning, when it is very close to the probe, it is all connected, slowly approaching the antenna.

146
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It is actually closer to the antenna, which means it affects the antenna more, and then it slowly ends when it reaches infinity.

147
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So when we simulate some of our problems, we can simulate some of this shape and tell people that, hey, actually, look, if this is an x-axis, it is a distance, and the y-axis is your location.

148
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You will find that compared to this round probe, in fact, as long as your charge is away from it, it is a 1 over r decay.

149
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That is, the further away you are from it, the less you feel its impact.

150
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But the antenna is very strange, it comes out of this peak in the middle.

151
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That's because at the beginning, the main thing that affects the charge particles is your probe.

152
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But in the middle, your antenna is here, and it is more affected.

153
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So you are in these two, because we measured the antenna, subtracted the spacecraft probe, you will get this particularly high peak in the middle.

154
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That is to tell us that this is the reason, this is why we can get this peak.

155
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So when we can simulate this situation, after the calculation of static electricity, we can go back and get those simulations.

156
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So when we get those collision locations, we can start playing with all the probes in space.

157
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
For example, Cassini, or Stereo, this is for measuring the sun.

158
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Or it's already far away from our ball shock, not ball shock, terminal shock.

159
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's already close to leaving our solar circle, the Voyager.

160
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Or recently near the sun, the Parker Solar Probe, or the solar orbiter.

161
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
There was Wind and MMS earlier.

162
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Then you will find that there seems to be something different.

163
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
If you cut it off here, we find that the reason why we are doing experiments is that these antennas are stuck on the side.

164
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's stuck with three of these antennas.

165
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The signal it measures will be different.

166
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That's a lot of trouble because it has something to do with some of the configurations on our circuit.

167
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's related to the C conductor between Q and CV.

168
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That's what we're doing right now.

169
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So you can imagine that when we have this method or technique,

170
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:28,000
We can measure from the inner solar system near the sun to 1AU, the so-called Stereo or Wind orbit around the Earth, or even MMS within the Earth's magnetic field.

171
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Then all the way along, including Europa Clipper in Jupiter, Cassini in Saturn, or Voyager has left our solar circle all the way.

172
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So after we have this method, we can analyze all the way from the inner solar system to the outer star Gaia, all the way to the outer solar system.

173
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The distribution of our cosmic dust, or their orbit, or their source.

174
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So to sum up, we're all sources of cosmic dust.

175
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Of course, we know that we've heard of some space stuff, but we don't want to measure those ashes in outer space in the future.

176
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But basically, these things are all dust.

177
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
The second thing is that the simulation we're doing right now and the model functions we're providing.

178
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We found that it's actually a good way to analyze a signal of cosmic dust hitting your probe or antenna.

179
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So with these things we provide, we can understand some of the hidden impact plasmas in the middle.

180
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The inner characteristics of the impact probe to understand some of the temperature inside, its speed, its distribution.

181
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And then after the application, we can get some impact locations.

182
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And after we get these impact locations, we can find out where these dust comes from.

183
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And then we can understand the characteristics of the location of that planet or the original dust, or its space environment.

184
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And even some of the things that are measured on top may be organic.

185
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So can they tell us some information about where our origin comes from?

186
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Are we the only species in the universe?

187
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So that's what we're doing right now.

188
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay, I guess 40 minutes.

189
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So, let's start the Q&A.

190
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Is my microphone on? Okay, it's on.

191
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
The timing is just right.

192
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Before we start the Q&A, let me give a warm round of applause to thank Mingxue for sharing with us today.

193
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I personally think that the first part of the presentation was very precise.

194
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The other part was very rich in content.

195
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I tried my best to speak in Chinese.

196
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
All kinds of demonstrations and illustrations were very impressive.

197
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Very clear.

198
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Very good at explaining.

199
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Very good at explaining.

200
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Do you have any questions?

201
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
If you have any questions at this time, you can turn on the microphone and speak.

202
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Before you speak, please tell us your name and affiliation so that we can get to know you better.

203
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Hello, I'm Chengxin Da.

204
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Can you hear me?

205
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Hi, I'm Mingxue.

206
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm a postdoc at UPenn Chemistry.

207
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
My name is Chengxin Da.

208
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I have one last question.

209
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You mentioned that you can analyze impact of a project.

210
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Can you tell us where it comes from?

211
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes.

212
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's a bit too...

213
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That's a bit too...

214
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That's a bit too far.

215
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
From the analysis of its composition,

216
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I know you can know its mass and see if there's anything organic in it.

217
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But how do you know where it comes from?

218
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Okay, good.

219
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
First of all,

220
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you can start by imagining if...

221
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Let's say we launch a space shuttle from the Earth.

222
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If you fly to the moon,

223
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
because first of all, any probe in any place,

224
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
we can basically calculate its orbit and speed.

225
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
After you know the orbit and speed,

226
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
if we can know the impact location,

227
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
we can probably know its origin and speed.

228
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Right?

229
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The first one is the origin and speed.

230
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
After the origin and speed,

231
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
we have a method to calculate the speed of escape.

232
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So you can know the speed of escape.

233
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You can know who might tie it up.

234
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
For example, is it tied up by the Earth?

235
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Is it tied up by the Moon?

236
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Or is it tied up by the Sun?

237
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I think you can know...

238
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
For example,

239
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
your probe is between the Earth and the Moon,

240
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
so you can know where it comes from.

241
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
For example, if I fly to the Earth and the Moon,

242
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I measure 8 km per second.

243
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
8 km per second is probably the escape speed of the Earth.

244
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But it can't escape 30 km per second from the Sun.

245
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
At this time, we would say

246
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
it should be in the middle.

247
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
If you measure 5 km per second when you return to the Moon,

248
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
it won't be outside,

249
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
but the speed on the surface of the Earth.

250
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's about 2 km to 5 km.

251
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So we can guess from here.

252
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
There's another one, like the Parker Solar Probe.

253
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I can't show it,

254
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
but I can tell you that

255
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
when we measure,

256
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
we know that the closer we get to the Sun,

257
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
there will be a block,

258
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
that is, your impact will be higher and higher.

259
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But when they...

260
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
In addition to the impact,

261
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
they found another unknown peak.

262
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's still being studied at the moment,

263
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
but they think that

264
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
in the measurement or non-passing process,

265
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
just at that time,

266
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
there was a comet passing by.

267
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So they think it's related to the comet.

268
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yeah.

269
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The comet is a dirty snowball.

270
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
There's water in it, and there's organic matter in it.

271
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So we're always happy to say

272
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
that as long as the measurement is related to the comet,

273
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
will there be life in the universe?

274
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So if we're talking about chemistry,

275
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the latest thing we're going to do

276
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
is the Europa Clipper.

277
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's going to go to Jupiter.

278
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
If it used to be Cassini,

279
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'll zoom in for you.

280
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If it used to be Cassini,

281
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
if it used to be Cassini,

282
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
oh, this is not zoom,

283
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I can't draw this.

284
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Wait a minute.

285
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
If it used to be Cassini,

286
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
its resolution would look like this.

287
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
OK.

288
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Its resolution is really bad.

289
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You probably know what it looks like.

290
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But you don't know what's in the middle.

291
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
For example,

292
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
its isomers can't be seen.

293
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah.

294
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But the latest one,

295
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
its resolution can be higher.

296
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So we want to look at the middle,

297
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
especially some of the carbon dioxide compounds

298
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
to understand

299
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
if there's any life in it.

300
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
OK.

301
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Does that answer your question?

302
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Yes.

303
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Very interesting.

304
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
OK.

305
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Does anyone else have a question?

306
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Or you can go ahead and ask.

307
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Hello, I have a question.

308
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
OK.

309
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Hi, I'm Zheng Yunting.

310
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm a Ph.D. student at Caltech.

311
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I do astronomy,

312
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
as well as cosmology.

313
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I think your talk is quite interesting.

314
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You see,

315
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
these things are

316
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
foreground for us.

317
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We don't want them.

318
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I have two questions.

319
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
The first one is

320
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I want to know

321
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
how much

322
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
the rate of

323
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
cosmic dust

324
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
is in

325
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Cassini.

326
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Is it like

327
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
tens of thousands per second

328
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
or a few seconds per second?

329
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
We can say a few tens of minutes.

330
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Sorry?

331
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We usually say

332
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
a few tens of minutes.

333
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
A few tens of minutes?

334
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah.

335
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
If you want to get close to the sun,

336
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
at the nearest point,

337
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
at 340 solar radii,

338
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
that's 20 minutes per second.

339
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
As far as I know,

340
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
the New Horizons

341
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
is

342
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I don't know if there's one per week.

343
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That's the current rate.

344
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But if you're talking about

345
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Cassini

346
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
in Enceladus,

347
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
where it flies through the ice,

348
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
it's saturated.

349
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's like

350
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
a hundred or a thousand per minute.

351
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So,

352
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
it's like

353
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
a hundred or a thousand per minute.

354
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
In this kind of place,

355
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
it's hard to measure

356
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
because the whole instrument is overloaded.

357
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
OK.

358
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
What if it's

359
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
outside of Mars?

360
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
What's that called?

361
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The small star belt?

362
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The small star belt is usually

363
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
If this is a small

364
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh, the small star belt rate.

365
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm not sure about this.

366
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But

367
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
if you can get close to

368
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
these sources,

369
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
it should be pretty high.

370
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
But other than that,

371
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
if it's in a general empty space,

372
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
it's a few dozen minutes.

373
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
OK, OK.

374
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Got it.

375
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And my other question is

376
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
if you have

377
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
if you have

378
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
If your detector

379
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
is hit by Cosmic Ray,

380
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
will it affect it?

381
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
OK.

382
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Good question.

383
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
If it's an antenna device,

384
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
it won't.

385
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
But if it's this kind of PVDF,

386
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
it will.

387
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Because this kind of thing

388
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
for high-capacity ions

389
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
or even for temperature control,

390
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
it's going to give you a wrong signal.

391
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But for a PVDF detector,

392
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
it will.

393
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
In this case,

394
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
if it's what we just talked about,

395
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
these two on the left,

396
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
this kind of dedicated dust analyzer,

397
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
UV will also be affected.

398
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So it can't measure directly in front of UV.

399
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It's usually sublim.

400
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's about 30 degrees to 45 degrees.

401
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You can start measuring

402
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
to all the back sides can be measured.

403
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But you can't go to the sun.

404
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
There's a problem with the sun.

405
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Because it's got MCP

406
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah, that's a good question.

407
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
As for the antenna measurement we just talked about,

408
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
because this kind of thing

409
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
is something that can be hit.

410
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
There's no difference in UV.

411
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
OK, OK.

412
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
What if you look at the stars

413
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
and then reflect the light of the sun?

414
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Will the UV be too strong?

415
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Stars reflect UV?

416
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Generally, it won't.

417
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Because in general,

418
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
albedo,

419
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
what we usually hear is no.

420
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It's not that exaggerated.

421
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
OK, OK.

422
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
OK, thank you.

424
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You're welcome.

425
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I know you guys,

426
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
there's a picture that looks like

427
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
something like that,

428
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
that size,

429
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
and then it goes down like this.

430
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And then the lower part is the bigger star

431
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
or that kind of star.

432
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And then in the middle is a small star.

433
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And then the upper left corner is dust.

434
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Is this albedo?

435
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
No, no, no.

436
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
In astronomy, when you measure,

437
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
you usually measure the bigger the better.

438
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
We measure where we don't want

439
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
the smaller the better.

440
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Oh.

441
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Yeah.

442
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Because our experiment,

443
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Zodiacal Light

444
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
is our biggest experiment.

445
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Because we measure

446
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
near-infrared wavelengths.

447
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And our main wavelengths

448
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
are actually

449
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
the reflections

450
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
of small stars nearby.

451
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah.

452
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Got it.

453
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
OK.

454
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Can I ask a question?

455
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Sure, go ahead.

456
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I don't know if this question

457
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
sounds unprofessional.

458
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
But when you were drawing

459
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
the rotation angle,

460
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
what did you say?

461
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
If the two antennae are in the middle

462
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
at 45 degrees,

463
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
it will look like this.

464
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But if you put it on the antenna

465
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
from time to time,

466
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
it will look like this, right?

467
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yes.

468
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
OK.

469
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That's the picture, right?

470
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
OK.

471
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I was thinking

472
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
about the frequency problem.

473
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It doesn't sound good

474
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
for two weeks.

475
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
But if today

476
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
it's a stable beam,

477
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
it's not one thing,

478
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
it's a beam,

479
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and we assume it's a stable frequency.

480
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
At this time,

481
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
because we know

482
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
the rotation of the detector,

483
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
because the rotation

484
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
is on our machine,

485
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
we can record it.

486
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Of course, there is an assumption

487
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
that the direction of the beam

488
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
is fixed.

489
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
In this case,

490
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
for example,

491
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
the first one looks like this on the left,

492
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and the second one

493
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
has a different angle,

494
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
and it looks more and more

495
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
like the picture on the right.

496
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
When it hits the antenna,

497
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
it becomes the picture on the right,

498
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and when it leaves the antenna,

499
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
it becomes the picture on the left.

500
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
There is an oscillation

501
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that can be solved.

502
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
In other words,

503
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
it can be solved

504
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
what kind of frequency

505
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
it is now.

506
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The first thing to know

507
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
is the frequency.

508
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But the frequency knows

509
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
because it knows the frequency

510
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
every time it pauses.

511
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So you can take this parameter

512
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and use it.

513
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But this is something

514
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
that needs a stable flow.

515
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Can you do this?

516
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I think I deleted something

517
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and missed to tell you.

518
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
When we were doing the experiment,

519
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
we measured where the collision was.

520
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
There are 10 degrees, 30 degrees,

521
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
45 degrees, 60 degrees,

522
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
and then we went around like this.

523
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So we measured a lot of things.

524
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Of course,

525
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
for example, this is 10 degrees,

526
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and 30 degrees may be in the middle.

527
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yes, yes, yes.

528
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yes.

529
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
What you just said is right.

530
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
When we do measurements,

531
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
generally speaking,

532
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
the main probe in space

533
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
is actually not fixed.

534
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It's best to let it choose.

535
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
There is a frequency to choose.

536
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Our attitude control system

537
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
will know its angle of rotation.

538
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
If you say today,

539
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
for example,

540
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
let's say we encounter

541
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
an Enceladus.

542
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
This is the one that keeps spraying ice.

543
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It has a fixed

544
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
time rate.

545
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
OK,

546
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
what you want to talk about is this, right?

547
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yes, yes, yes.

548
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You really know how to explain things.

549
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
After going around like this,

550
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
you will find that

551
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
if the original signal

552
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
is red,

553
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
you will see the blue signal

554
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
going up and down.

555
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
This is what you want to talk about, right?

556
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yes, yes, yes.

557
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yes, yes.

558
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
In this case,

559
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
we generally believe

560
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
our attitude control system.

561
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
In this case, it's really interesting.

562
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
We must believe

563
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
our attitude control system is correct.

564
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So if our attitude control system is correct,

565
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
we can know that

566
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
suppose I want to change a color today.

567
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Then I set it as the

568
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
pointing direction.

569
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I might have known at the beginning

570
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
that my pointing is like this.

571
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I think my first antenna points there.

572
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
The second antenna points there.

573
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You will rotate like this, right?

574
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yes.

575
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
In this case,

576
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
we can solve the location of the collision.

577
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But I have to say

578
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
there is a drawback in this case.

579
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
The first drawback is

580
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
our probe

581
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
will never be as beautiful

582
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
as this sphere.

583
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
This is the first one.

584
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
The second one,

585
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
even if this sphere

586
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I draw a big probe now.

587
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
The middle one is called

588
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
your antenna.

589
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I will face it directly at the top.

590
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
There is a drawback in this case.

591
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You know its angle.

592
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It's the distance

593
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
between you and it.

594
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But the distance is

595
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
similar to the distance of a copper core.

596
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Right?

597
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You don't know

598
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
the distance.

599
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
If the distance is so close

600
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
and it's a perfectly fixed sphere,

601
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
the signal here

602
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and here

603
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
look like this.

604
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
The distance is there.

605
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You don't know if it's here

606
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
or here or there.

607
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So we need to

608
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
develop a new model

609
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
or think about how to explain it.

610
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
It needs to be improved.

611
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
OK.

612
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I just thought of another one.

613
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Can't we just

614
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
hit the earth

615
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and build the model first?

616
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That's right.

617
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So now we have a model

618
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
like the Pyke Solar Probe.

619
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Cassini made a model.

620
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This is a 20 to 1 model.

621
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It's exactly the same.

622
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So we later said

623
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
we have this model.

624
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
We have this physical model.

625
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
This doesn't seem right.

626
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I mean

627
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
there is a formula for the physical model.

628
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
After we have this,

629
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
we take a physical model

630
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
which is also called physical model in English.

631
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Laboratory model

632
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
to do this kind of simulation

633
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
of hitting the earth.

634
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Then put the two together.

635
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
We just want to tell people

636
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
who wants to launch a thing with an antenna.

637
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We can make a model

638
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
and then do this kind of simulation.

639
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
After knowing all the parameters,

640
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
when you get to the sky,

641
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
you are facing these databases

642
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
to correspond.

643
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Then it's accurate.

644
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yes.

645
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Got it.

646
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Good question.

647
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Any other questions?

648
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
You can ask anything.

649
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
If you don't want to ask about the universe dust,

650
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
you can ask about the electromagnetic dust.

651
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Or you can ask about the particle promoter.

652
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Since you mentioned it,

653
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
let me ask.

654
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Why did you decide to

655
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
make an antenna?

656
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Because the particle promoter

657
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
is a bit far away.

658
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
But it doesn't seem impossible.

659
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It can't be done.

660
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
First,

661
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
in the US,

662
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
you can't make a promoter.

663
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Second,

664
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
everyone knows

665
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
who gives you money,

666
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
just do it.

667
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You said you can't make a promoter in the US?

668
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
What do you mean by that?

669
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I don't know.

670
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
What does it mean?

671
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
As long as you come across

672
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
defense or military industry,

673
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you can't do it.

674
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Even if you are a foreigner in Taiwan,

675
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
you can't do it.

676
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You can't do it as a foreigner.

677
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Let's be official and scientific.

678
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
After I made the particle engine,

679
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
the particle engine

680
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
is related to the space environment.

681
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
In the space environment,

682
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
in addition to electromagnetic waves,

683
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
matter will collide.

684
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So we need to make some cosmic things.

685
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You can also understand the origin of your life,

686
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
right?

687
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
That makes sense.

688
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Do you have any questions?

689
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Let me see.

690
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
We are waiting

691
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
for one minute.

692
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
If you don't have any questions,

693
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'll end the recording.

694
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Someone wants to ask a question

695
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
but doesn't want to be recorded.

696
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You can ask after we're done.

697
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I mean we'll end the recording

698
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
after one minute.

699
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
No problem.

700
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Okay.

701
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
One minute is up.

702
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
On behalf of everyone,

703
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
let's give Mingxue

704
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
a big round of applause

705
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
before we end the recording.
