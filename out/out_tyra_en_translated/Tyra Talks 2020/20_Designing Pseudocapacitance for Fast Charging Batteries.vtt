00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
You can find the recording online a week and a half later.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
If you have any questions during this process,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
you can leave a comment in the chat box.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
We will have Q&A time at the end for everyone to ask questions.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Let's get started.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Thank you everyone for listening to my presentation.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello everyone, I'm Lai Jun-Hai.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
You can call me Matt.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
First of all, I would like to thank Tyra for inviting me to share my research.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Let me introduce myself.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm from Yonghe, Hsinchu.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I graduated from National University of China.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
I worked as an engineer for a year and a half at BASF in Taiwan.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Then I went to UCLA to study engineering.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I graduated in 2017.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
I am currently working at Startup Battery Streak.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
At the same time, I am also a visiting scholar at UCLA.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
My main work is focused on the development and mass production of new battery materials,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
as well as the transfer between the company and UCLA.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Today's topic is

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Designing pseudo-capacitance for fast-charging batteries.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
That is, how to apply the mechanism of solid-state batteries to fast-charging batteries.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
First of all, why do we need fast-charging batteries?

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
The first motivation is the accumulation of electromagnetic traffic.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Charging stations are currently set up in three levels.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
The first level is the plug-in that everyone puts at home.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
It can charge 3 to 6 kilometers per hour.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
The second level is the charging station in the parking lot.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
It can charge 20 to 30 kilometers per hour.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
The third level is the fastest Tesla charging station.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
It can charge 5 kilometers per minute.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Interestingly, the current charging station is still far less than the gas station.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
But it is almost impossible to see such a long queue at the charging station.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Not everyone has an electric car,

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
but 5 kilometers per minute is still too slow compared to the time required for gas.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
The second application of fast-charging batteries is the popularization of renewable energy.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
As of last year, renewable energy has reached one-third of the global power generation.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
50% of the power generation comes from renewable energy.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Other European countries also reach 20 to 30% of renewable power.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
We all know that when wind and solar energy are converted into electricity,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
they must be paired with suitable batteries.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
However, these batteries can't be charged quickly,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
so they are inefficient.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
For example, when the wind speed is fast,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
there will be a momentary large current.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
The batteries that can't be charged at low power

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
will become waste heat and reduce the life of the battery.

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
So basically, this concept is the same as the concept of fast-charging batteries paired with aging cell phones.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
The third application of fast-charging batteries is plant-based medical equipment.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
Generally, the supply of such equipment is made up of a battery paired with a capacitor,

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
which is in the box at the bottom left.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
Generally, the battery is used to monitor the function of low power for a long time,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
while the capacitor is used to respond to high power in a short time.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
Due to the limited size of the equipment and the need for different organ parts,

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
a single high-power battery is used to replace the two-in-one mode.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
This has always been the trend in the development of this type of equipment power supply.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Of course, in addition to the above three applications,

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
there are other applications.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I won't go into detail here.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
So in this main speech,

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
it mainly introduces how to improve the power density and energy density of the storage components using the materials of the capacitor.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
As shown in the picture on the left,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
the x-axis is the energy density,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
and the y-axis is the power density.

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
First, I will briefly introduce the materials of the storage components and the techniques required for analysis.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
Then, the first part will start with the high-power supercapacitor material in blue.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Then, the high-power characteristics will be achieved by using a non-oxidized carbonate residue.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
The second part will start with the lithium battery.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Here is an example of fluorine,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
L-NBOPF,

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
which achieves high power density by nanomerizing the battery material.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Generally, batteries or supercapacitors are basically composed of two terminals.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
The positive terminal and the negative terminal are placed on the aluminum foil and copper foil respectively.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
The two terminals are separated by a multi-hole separator,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
which is the middle part of the separator,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
to avoid short-circuit.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
When charging the battery, the lithium battery moves in the capacitor,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
and the battery material produces an oxidation reaction.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
At the same time, the battery moves in the external circuit to achieve the balance of the electric current.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
The electric current is the main focus of our discussion today.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
It is mainly composed of the storage material, carbon, and the high-voltage supercapacitor.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
The electric current needs to have a certain vacuum.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
It is like a sponge.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
It must contain enough electrolysis.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
At the same time, it must have enough conductivity to be a high-voltage supercapacitor.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Although the structure of the battery and the capacitor are the same,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
the storage mechanism is completely different.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
The mechanism of the capacitor is absorbed by the lithium.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
In the external circuit, the aluminum foil and the copper foil are separated and absorbed by the surface of the battery.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Because the lithium is absorbed by the surface for a short time,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
this mechanism is most conducive to fast charging.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
The disadvantage is that its surface area is limited,

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
so the density of energy is generally low.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
In contrast, the storage method of the battery

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
uses the oxidation reaction inside the material.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
In this case, the lithium can enter the material,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
and its energy is far greater than that of the capacitor.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
However, since the lithium moves very slowly inside the material,

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
it is therefore unable to do high-speed charging.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Next, we will introduce how to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Basically, it is based on electrical chemistry analysis.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
We will make the pre-analyzed material into an electrolyte

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
and test it in the same electrolyte solution.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Generally, the device to be tested

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
has a single-phase electrolyte test on the upper left,

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
and a double-phase torque battery test on the lower left.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
There are two main methods of testing.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
The first method is the cyclic voltammetry,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
which is abbreviated as CV.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
The principle is to change the speed of voltage change

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
to measure the change in current.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
The second method is the DC voltage test,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
which is abbreviated as GC.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
In the case of DC voltage charging,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
it measures the change in voltage of the battery

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and makes a diagram of the voltage.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Now we use GC and CV to get the diagram

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
to distinguish the battery from the capacitor.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
They are two different storage mechanisms.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
The capacitor on the left can be seen that

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
the CV is a rectangle,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
while the GC is basically a diagonal.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
The battery on the right is composed of a set of peaks,

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
while the GC is mainly composed of a horizontal line.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Now that we know how to judge the material of the battery

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
and the material of the capacitor,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
we can look for the material of the fast charging battery.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
What characteristics do we hope the fast charging battery has?

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
We hope it has the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry on the left,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
which allows it to be a fast charging battery.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
It also has the characteristics of the material on the right,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
which increases the density of energy

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
by storing energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
This is the material we are looking for.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
The material of the capacitor

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
not only has a rectangle CV,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
but also a diagonal GC,

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
and it stores energy through the reaction of oxygen-chloride.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Next, I will talk about the main character I will introduce today,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
which is the T-Phased,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Orphohombic Phased,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
NB205.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Next, I will call it NIOVIA.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
In addition to having the characteristics of electromagnetic chemistry,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
its energy density

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
is equivalent to the energy density of lithium carbon dioxide,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
which is in the lithium-ion battery.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Its energy density is 10 times that of the capacitor.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Its power density,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
which is the power of its fast charging,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
can also reach 10 times that of the battery.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Its only drawback is that

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
it is still oxygen-chloride,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
so its power consumption

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
is the first topic we are going to fix.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
The first part

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
is to mix carbon with NIOVIA

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
to improve the properties of NIOVIA.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
We need to deduce a good NIOVIA,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and we will eventually deduce

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
what kind of properties a good NIOVIA battery needs

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
to show the characteristics of its lithium-ion battery.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
A good NIOVIA battery

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
basically needs two parts.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
The first is the high-voltage part,

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
and the second is the part that can have a high pore density.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
In this study,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
we mainly used three materials.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
The first material is our protagonist, NIOVIA.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
The second material is our chemical-capable

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Reduced Graphene Oxide, also known as RGO.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Its purpose is to provide short-term conductivity.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
The third material

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
is the one on the far right,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Carbide Derived Carbon, also known as CDC.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
It is a kind of carbon dioxide.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Its main purpose is that

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
it has a polypore structure

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
and its size is in the micrometer level,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
so it can provide long-term conductivity.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
The way we prepare the battery

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
is to first plant NIOVIA on RGO.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO with CDC

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
to get NIOVIA RGO CDC,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
also known as NRC.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Finally, we make NRC

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
into a commercial-grade battery

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
and test it to prove that

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
it has a high-power and high-density

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
storage characteristics

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
at the right pore density.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
This slide shows the details of the material equipment.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
The main equipment is

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
the water-heating method.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
We put the precursor

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
into the autoclave

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
and heat it up to 180°C

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
for 12 hours.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Next, we wash the particles

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
and dry them.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
After drying,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
we heat it up to 500°C

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
to get the body structure we want,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
which is T-phase,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
or ophiobic phase.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
Next, we combine NIOVIA RGO

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
with CDC.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
The main purpose is to

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
make this composite material

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
in the form of surface electrolysis.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Next, we make it into a battery

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
and test it.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
We have 20% NIOVIA,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
40% NRC20,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
and 60% NRC20.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
The BET on the right

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
is the analysis of the surface electrolysis.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
It shows that

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
the surface electrolysis of the material

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
increases with the

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
composition of the CDC.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
This means that

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
this composite method

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
does not cause the CDC to lose its surface area,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
or the CDC to be less airtight,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
or its structure to collapse.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Therefore, we can use

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
a simple ratio to

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
achieve the airtightness we need.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
There are also two black dots on the picture.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
These two black dots

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
are where we directly plant NIOVIA

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
on the CDC.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
If we

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
do not use

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
this composite method

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
but use

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
the water-heat method

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
to directly plant it on the CDC,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
at high temperature,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
the CDC's

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
surface area

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
will...

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Because the surface area is too large,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
the surface area will decrease

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
at high temperature.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
We want to use the CDC

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
to improve the airtightness

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
of the electrode.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
This is the idea.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Next, we need to

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
use the CV to judge the electrode.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Let's see if it is like a battery material

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
or an electric material.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
In the case of changing the minority,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
we can get the corresponding current.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Therefore, we use the current

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
to make judgments with the change of the minority.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
If the

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
material is like a battery,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
the change of the current

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
will be multiplied by the minority.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
If the material

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
is like a capacitor,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
the current

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
will be multiplied by the minority.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
In other words,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
when the minority is doubled,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
the current will be doubled.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Combining these two formulas,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
we can get

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
the following formula

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
from the experiment.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
The current is equal to the magnitude

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
multiplied by the minority.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
This is called

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
B-value analysis.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
We want the material

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
to be as fast as the capacitor.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Therefore, we want the B-value

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
to be as close to 1 as possible.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
This proves that the material

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
can do high-speed charging.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Next,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
the NRC

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
can store different

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
current

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
at different speeds.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
On the left,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
we use the minority

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
to burn the NRC.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
The lowest value

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
is 100% Cdc.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
The way

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
we control the minority

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
is from the slowest 30-minute

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
charging point on the left to the

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
90-second charging point on the right.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
The y-axis is the energy generated by me.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
As time goes by,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
the energy generated by me

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
will be reduced.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
We want the line to be as flat as possible.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
This means that the material

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
can do high-speed charging

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
as well as low-speed charging.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
The lowest value is 100% Cdc.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
As the amount of niobia increases,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
the density of the NRC

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
will also increase.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Up to 40%, the increased current

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
will not be affected by the minority.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
From 0% to 20% to 40%,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
the current will remain as flat.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Up to 60%,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
from the NRC 60,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
we can see that

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
the current is lower than

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
40% at 90 seconds.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
The highest value is 100%.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Although the amount of

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
niobia is

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
higher than 40%,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
we can expect that

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
according to the trend,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
when the charging time is less than 90 seconds,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
the NRC 40 will increase.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
On the right is the B-value

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
introduced in the previous page.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
When the curve

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
is closer to 1,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
we mainly do CV

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
for different materials.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Then we do the

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
B-value analysis.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
The result of the analysis is in the lower right corner.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
When the curve is closer to 1,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
it means that the charging speed is faster.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
By this, we can judge

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
that the charging speed of

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
NRC 40 is faster than

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
NRC 60 and 100% niobia.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
This also proves that

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
when there is 60% CVC

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
stored in the electrode,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
the electrode has sufficient airtightness

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
to accommodate sufficient electrolysis

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
to show the characteristics of

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
niobia lithium-ion battery.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Finally,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
we combine the NRC 40

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
with the traditional lithium-ion electrode

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
to form a full electrode

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
to do

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
CV and GC analysis.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
In terms of CV,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
we can get

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
the characteristics of lithium-ion,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
which is a rectangular CV.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
In terms of the

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
GC,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
we also get a

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
oblique GC.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
At the same time,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
because of the combination of niobia,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
we not only

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
increase the energy density

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
at low power,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
but also increase the energy density

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
at high power.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
At the power of

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
3000W per kg,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
we can store

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
up to 23W

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
per kg of energy density.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Next,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I will use the picture on the right to summarize.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
The first part

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
is that we use the amount of Cdc

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
to adjust the airtightness and

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
electrolysis of the NRC composite material.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
At the same time,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
the electrode has high energy

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and fast charge characteristics.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
In other words,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
we use Cdc as the starting point

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
to mix different niobia

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
to increase its energy density.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
By maximizing airtightness and electrolysis,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
we can increase

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
the overall

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
energy density of the electrode

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
and preserve

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
the high power characteristics of Cdc.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
The second part

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I want to share is

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
the LNVOPF material

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
as a medical equipment energy supply application.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Speaking of medical equipment energy supply,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I will use

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
an implantable

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
cardioverter

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
defibrillator

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
ICD

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
as an example.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Its Chinese name is

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
implantable defibrillator.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It basically

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
detects your heart beat.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
When your heart beats abnormally,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
it will use

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
high current to stimulate your heart beat.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
For example,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
when your heart stops beating,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
it will stimulate your heart beat.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I am not a medical background,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
so I only understand

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
the basic concept of this device.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
The main usage method

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
is still left to the doctor.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
ICD

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
mainly uses

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
high current and low current output.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
The low current part

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
is mainly responsible for the battery.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
The high current part

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
is responsible for the circuit board.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
There is also a device size

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
at the bottom.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
The size is about one-fourth of the heart.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Most of the area

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
is actually from the low-voltage circuit.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Another

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
medical device

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
is

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
DBS

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Deep Brain Stimulator.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Deep Brain Stimulator.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
This type of device

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
has the same principle,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
but the current demand

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
is smaller than ICD.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
DBS mainly stimulates

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
the brain nerve.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
DBS mainly stimulates

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
the brain nerve.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
DBS mainly stimulates

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
the brain nerve.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
The power supply

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
is also made up of

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
a battery and a circuit.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
When we want to

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
put this medical device

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
in the body,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
we hope that

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
its size can be smaller and better

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
to save more space.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
When we find the material,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
it has the characteristics

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
of a battery and a circuit.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
So,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
we can use a single device

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
to make a circuit

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
or a battery.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
We prefer the battery

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
because the battery size is smaller.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
A single storage device

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
will provide the supply of

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
the current.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
We can save more

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
the power supply

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
of medical equipment.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
This material

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
is

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
L-NBOPF.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
NBOPF

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
comes from

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
NASKON,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
which is a transformer.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
When it is mixed,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
the voltage

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
of this material

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
will increase

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
with time.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
This means it can store more energy.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
when I

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
use it,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
the voltage

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
will

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
decrease

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
with time.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
This means

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
the material

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
will last longer.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
The storage density

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
is the same as

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
the lithium carbon dioxide

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
in the battery.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Most importantly,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
this material has

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
the characteristics of a battery

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
and a circuit.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Next,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
we will introduce another way

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
to distinguish a battery from a circuit.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
We will use X-ray

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
diffraction

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
to judge

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
whether the material

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
is

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
changing

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
with the

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
structure of the crystal.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
This is what we call

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
X-ray diffraction.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
X-ray diffraction

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
occurs when the battery is charged.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
X-ray diffraction

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
occurs when the battery is charged.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
X-ray diffraction

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
occurs when the battery is charged.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Let's analyze

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
NBOPF.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
NBOPF has two peaks

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
that are opposite to each other.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
The peak at low voltage

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
is parallel.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
The peak at high voltage

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
is not parallel.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
This means that

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
the material can be used

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
as a battery at low voltage

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
and as a circuit at high voltage.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
However,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
this is not that simple.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
The material

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
is charged twice

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
per hour

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Let me introduce

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
a little bit.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
When we talk about charging,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
we use a unit called C-ray.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
We use a unit called C-ray.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
C-ray

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
has several Cs.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
This means that it can charge several times

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
in an hour.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
When this material

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
charges twice per hour,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
when this material charges twice per hour,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
which is the part of 2C,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
it can store

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
80-90% of the power.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
However,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
when you shorten the charging time

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
to 3 minutes,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
it can only charge 8%.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
The reason is that

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
during the charging process,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
it will charge the battery first.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Then it will charge the capacitor.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
However, the charging speed of the battery

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
is too slow,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
so I can't even charge the capacitor.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
So,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
it's a bit like this.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
The main reason is that the charging speed of the battery

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
is too slow,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
resulting in a decrease

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
in the overall charging speed.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
What we are going to do next

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
is to

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
use the material

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
as a nanometer

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
to shorten the time

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
and distance

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
of the particles in the material

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
to increase the charging speed

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
of the material.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Next,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
we are going to synthesize

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
this nanometer NVOPF

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
and discuss the size

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
and characteristics of fast charging.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
First,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
the way we make it is

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
to put all the materials

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
in the

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
solvent thermal

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
to synthesize.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
We also put it in the pressure suit.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Then,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
after 12 hours,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
after 185°C,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
we take the material out

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
and clean it.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
We will dry it.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Next, we use

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
XRD, X-Ray Diffraction, to confirm the material.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
After confirming that

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
there is no problem with the material

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
and there is no impurities in it,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
we will make an electrode

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
for electromagnetic testing.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Here,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
we can get

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
different types of

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
NVOPF

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
based on

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
the ratio of the material

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
and the temperature of the synthesis.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Basically, NVOPF

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
is a rectangular body.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
We usually get

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
brick-shaped

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
and if it is longer,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
it becomes rod.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
If it is shorter,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
it becomes pellet.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
We will discuss

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
the shape of the

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
NVOPF

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
and the impact of its size

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
on its reaction rate.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Next,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
we will use bValue

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
to analyze

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
the properties of the fast charge.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
In the first step,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
we make different

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
cVs for the material.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
From these four peaks,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
we can get

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
individual bValue.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Then, we make

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
bValue with different

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
aspect ratio

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
and its size

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
to see

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
how it changes.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
On the left is

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
the NVOPF pellet.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
On the right,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
we change

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
the rod

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
to reduce

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
the aspect ratio

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
to the brick

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and the pellet.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
We can see that

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
the bValue

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
decreases as the aspect ratio decreases.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
This means that

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
when we decrease the aspect ratio,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
the characteristics of the fast charge

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
will be more and more like the current.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
It can become

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
the material

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
for the fast charge.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
On the other hand,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
we also

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
compare the

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
particle size

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
to the bValue.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
We combine

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
the microns

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and microns

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
to reduce the nanometers.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
The nanometers

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
are reduced to a few tens of nanometers.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
We can see that

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
when the size decreases,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
the bValue also increases.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The increase in bValue means

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
that the smaller the particle,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
the more suitable it is

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
for the fast charge.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
The more suitable it is

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
for the fast charge.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
The focus here is

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
on the microbrick.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Its peak bValue

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
is close to 0.5.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
0.5 means that it is

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
like a battery.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
When we make a nanoparticle,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
all of its

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
oxidation-reduction reactions

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
have a bValue

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
of 0.7 or higher.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Next,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
we will do a charge-electric charge test.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
The nanoparticle

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
of the microbrick

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
can charge up to 90%

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
in 2 hours.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
in 2 hours.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
This means that

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
the bValue of the

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
NBOPF

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
has increased

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
significantly

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
after the nanoparticle

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
has been nanoparticle.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
The bValue of the

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
bValue of the

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
bValue of the

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
bValue of

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
bValue of

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
bValue of

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
bValue of

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
bValue of

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
bValue of

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
bValue of

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
bValue of

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
bValue of

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
bValue of

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
bValue of

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
bValue of

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
bValue of

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
bValue of

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
bValue of

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
bValue of

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
bValue of

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
bValue of

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
bValue of

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
bValue of

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
bValue of

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000

bValue of

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
bValue of

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
bValue of

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
bValue of

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
bValue of

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
bValue of

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
bValue of

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
bValue of

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
bValue of

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
bValue of

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
bValue of

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
bValue of

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
bValue of

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
cV meters

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
compared to the current specifications

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
our current current

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
is greater than

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
greater than these functions

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
greater than these specifications

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
our frequency

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
because of the device

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
on the device

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
we can only measure

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
a few microseconds

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
so we only measured

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
50Hz

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
50Hz

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
also covers some

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
function frequency

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
next

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I will use this graph

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
to make a brief summary

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
the second part

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
we use nanoparticle

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
to convert this

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
NBOPF

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
to fast charge

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
in addition

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
we also proved

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
the feasibility of

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
NBOPF

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
finally

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I will make a brief summary

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
what is

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
the so-called

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Taekwondo Message

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
first, I hope everyone

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
knows what is a nanoparticle

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
nanoparticle

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
is actually a storage mechanism

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
it has the power of the nanoparticle

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
and the density of the battery

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
and

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
the second point

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
is how we can judge a nanoparticle

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
of course, through

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
the method of electromagnetic

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
we have such a CV

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
we have such a oblique

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
GC

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
and in the process of my oxygenation

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
the material did not change

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
finally

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
how do we design a nanoparticle

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
mainly

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
here I demo three points

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
the first is

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
the first is the conductivity

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
and the airtightness

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I control the conductivity and airtightness of my electrode

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
to make my

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
NBOPF optimized

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
the second

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
is to make the material nanoparticle

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
and adjust its phase change

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
to make our general battery material

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
it is not affected

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
by

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
the transfer of ions

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
too slow

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
let it

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
in the part of the battery

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
can reach the high speed charge point

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
the effect

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
thank you

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
thank you

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
if you have any questions

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
please let me know

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
thank you

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
thank you Matt

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
now we can

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
start the Q&A

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
in the chat box

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
there are some questions

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
do you want to unmute

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
and ask your question

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I want to ask

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
what is the electrolyte used

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
when you start to make your battery

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
it should be organic electrolyte

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
right

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
yes

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I use

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
LIPF-6

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
ECDMC

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
the general

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
electrolyte used

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
so we can understand

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
why the lowest voltage

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
should be around 1.2V

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
another question

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
what is the

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
diagonal direction of

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
the nitrogen oxide

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
nitrogen oxide

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
not supercapacitor

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
it should be

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
interesting

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
or important

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
basically

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
the diagonal direction

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
is between

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
1.2V to

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
1.2V to 3V

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
this is

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
here

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
here

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
the diagonal direction

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
is 1.2V to

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
1.2V to 2.5V

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
this is

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
the nitrogen oxide

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
the capacity

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
should be

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
200

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
from 1.2V to

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
2.5V

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
90% of the voltage

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
comes from here

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
it means

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
when it is below 1.2V

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
2.5V will be disconnected

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
when it is below 1.2V

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
the electrolyte will be disconnected

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the material will not be disconnected

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
when it is above 2.5V

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
you can't see

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
the current

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
the current will be

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
close to 0

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
like this picture

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
sorry

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
the CV is the same

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
it will be

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
no current

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
basically no current

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
ok

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
you just showed this slide

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
so I want to ask the following question

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
how do you calculate the B-value

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
and the voltage graph in the lower right corner

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
now we have

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
different CVs

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
each CV

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
has a current

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
in each voltage

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
so every current

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
will be analyzed

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
for the change

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
does the B-value have to use the peak current

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
or does it have to be any current

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
so today in pseudo-capacitance

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
pseudo-capacitance

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
basically

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
it has many

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
continuous

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
redox reactions

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
so when you produce a box

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
you can't

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
only analyze

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
the peak current

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
you are not fair to

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
the other currents

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
so

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
basically

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
in pseudo-capacitance

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
you can use this formula

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
on all the voltage graphs

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
to draw the continuous curve

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
another story

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
behind this

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
is that the redox

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
happens below 2V

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
so it doesn't have redox

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
so what do you see

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
you see EDLC

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
what does EDLC mean

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
EDLC is the

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
reaction rate

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
on the surface of the electrode

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
so EDLC

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
from the electrode

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
far away

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
to the surface of the electrode

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
what do you mean by diffusion control

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
yes

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
so here we increase

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
the density of Cdc

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
so the vacuum of the electrode

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
increases

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
so when there is no redox

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
the kinetics

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
increases

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
so when there is

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
redox

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
the kinetics increases

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
any other questions

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
ok thank you

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
the last one is later

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
so if you have any questions

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I will ask later

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
any other

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
questions

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
hello

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
hello

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I want to ask Matt

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
some questions

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
please

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Matt thank you for your speech

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
my main question is

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
on your first project

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
you were doing

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I want to ask

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
how big is the particle size

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
of Nairobia

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
the particle size is

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
here

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
you can see on the upper right

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
the size is

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
20-30 nm

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
20-30 nm

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
so you

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
reduce graphene oxide

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
and Cdc

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
to increase

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
the conductivity of short-circuit and long-circuit

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
yes

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Cdc also provides the vacuum

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
ok

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I was doing research on

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
hierarchical porous carbons

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
and

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
there are small

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
micropores

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
and big macropores

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
so I was thinking

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
if you combine

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
other porous materials

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
does it increase the

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
potential of the capacitor

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
yes

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
because

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I have enough porosity

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
my particles

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
can be

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I can

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
absorb more electrolyte

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
so I can

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
there is a slide

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I didn't show

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
because I have some time

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
so you can see

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
why Nairobia

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
needs big porosity

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
basically

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
it comes from

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
ok

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
basically this slide

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I was doing different

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
this is the result from consul

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
so

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
basically it comes from Nernst equation

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
and Poisson

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
equation

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Poisson equation represents

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
how much

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
the dielectric constant is

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
so under different voltage

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
how many particles are on the surface

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
so when the voltage

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
moves to

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
in the middle of the graph

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
basically

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
it represents

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
how many particles are on the surface

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
but when it

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
moves to

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
below a certain level

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Nairobia starts to react

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I need a lot of

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
particles to enter the material

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
so when it needs a lot of particles

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
to enter the material

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
it will cause the surface porosity

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
the surface porosity

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
is the reason why

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Nairobia's kinetics

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
so

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
this is the reason why

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
this material needs

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
high porosity

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
so that

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
it can maintain

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
the characteristics of the dielectric

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
or the characteristics

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
of the dielectric

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I want to

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
follow up

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
how did you come up with

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
reducing graphene oxide

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
plus Cdc

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
reducing graphene oxide

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
has another advantage

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
on the synthesis

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
basically if you want to

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
grow oxide

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
graphene oxide

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
the ligand of oxygen

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
can be the nucleation site

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
of these synthesis

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
no matter if you want to grow metal particles

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
or oxide particles

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
basically it can easily grow on top

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
because it has a lot of sites

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
the particles you grow

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
are small

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
so

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
graphene oxide

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
is like an additive

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
it can make your particle size very small

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
second, it also increases

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
the conductivity

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
for graphene oxide

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
there are several ways

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
for example, you do filtration

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
you filter it

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
it is

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
a two-dimensional structure

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
so when you do filtration

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
when you do filtration

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
it will become

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
a very dense electrode

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
if it is very dense

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
the electrode can't get in

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
so we want to

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
find a structure

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
like Cdc

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
this

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
structure

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
of graphene oxide

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
to mix in

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
but we don't want to mix too much

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
because

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
the density of the energy

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
is relatively low

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I understand, thank you

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
any other questions?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
if not

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I will ask my last question

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
after talking about ZMath

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
I mentioned

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
how to distinguish

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
between solid electrolyte and

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
solid electrolyte

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
but now

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
there is a popular topic

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
solid electrolyte

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
or solid electrolyte

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I want to see

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
the difference between

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
solid electrolyte and

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
other two

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
how to distinguish

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
how to judge

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
actually

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I didn't do the

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
because I talked about

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
the second topic

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
solid electrolyte

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
yes, it was

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
solid electrolyte

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
but we took it

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
basically

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
we just changed its structure

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
then we took it as an electrolyte

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
basically

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
solid electrolyte

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
yes

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I don't know much about this

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
what I know about solid electrolyte

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
is

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
its conductivity

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
it must be very thin

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
because its conductivity is not as fast as liquid

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
although it is solid electrolyte

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
but it is not as fast as liquid

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
another thing

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
everyone says

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
solid electrolyte

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
it doesn't

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
we can

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
avoid the SEI reaction

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
but actually

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
this is a loss

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
actually solid electrolyte

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
in its first cycle

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
its SEI

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
has a big impact

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
in our group

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
in addition to high-speed charge

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
another part is

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
3D battery

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
3D battery is

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
the structure of the battery

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
to make it a satellite battery

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
that part

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
in solid electrolyte

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
of course we want to use solid electrolyte

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
because solid electrolyte

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
its density

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
is much higher than liquid

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
so we can save a lot of liquid

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
needed volume

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
but they found that in the first cycle

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
this SEI

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
actually still occurs

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
and after it occurs

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
because it is solid

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
so it is very difficult to solve

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
basically your material

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
at first it is a tight connection

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
it will separate

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
thank you

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
anyone else have questions?

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
if no questions

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Max, do you have your email?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
yes

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I put it in the last slide

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
if you have any questions

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
you can

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
email me

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
thank you

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
for coming

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
and thank you Max

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
for giving us such a wonderful speech

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
this recording

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
you can watch it again

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
in a week

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
and you can continue

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
to discuss with Max

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
related research

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
so I will stop recording now
