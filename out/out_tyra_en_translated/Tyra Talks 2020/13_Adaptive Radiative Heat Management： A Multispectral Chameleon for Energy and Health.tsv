0	12000	Welcome everyone to participate in our presentation today.
12000	15000	I am the host today, Zhang Yuanping.
15000	22000	Our speaker today is very happy to invite Mr. Bojun to share his research with us.
22000	30000	As for the content, we will leave it to Mr. Bojun to share directly with everyone.
30000	33000	It will be about the熱傳熱導.
33000	36000	If I'm not mistaken, it should be like this, right?
36000	38000	Because it's not my major.
38000	41000	Everyone will know the details later.
41000	44000	Let's share the background of the teacher.
44000	46000	The teacher used to be Qingda Materials.
46000	49000	If I'm not mistaken, Qingda Materials.
49000	54000	After graduating, he went to Stanford to study materials.
54000	61000	Now, at the beginning of this year, he went to Duke.
61000	63000	At the beginning of last year.
63000	65000	At the beginning of last year, sorry.
65000	67000	At the beginning of last year, he went to Duke.
67000	71000	It's from the west coast to the east.
71000	75000	And it's almost a right-angled line.
75000	78000	It's not that right-angled, but a little bit.
78000	82000	Then I just missed the teacher.
82000	86000	Because I came back to Taiwan from UNC at that time.
86000	88000	And I came back to Qingda Materials.
88000	92000	So I just missed the teacher.
92000	96000	Otherwise, there should be a chance to meet in person.
96000	99000	I am very happy to have this opportunity today.
99000	102000	So let's not talk too much.
102000	107000	On behalf of everyone, I would like to warmly welcome the teacher to share with us today.
107000	110000	I'm going to take a picture.
110000	112000	OK.
112000	115000	You can share your screen.
115000	117000	It's at the top.
117000	118000	If you swipe over, there will be...
118000	120000	Do you know how to do it?
120000	123000	There are four buttons.
123000	126000	One of them is the share screen.
126000	129000	Then you do this.
129000	132000	OK, I saw it.
132000	133000	OK.
133000	135000	Then I'll turn off my microphone.
140000	142000	I...
142000	145000	OK, so you really can't see what I mean.
145000	148000	OK.
148000	149000	Thank you, Yen Ping.
149000	154000	Thank you for coming to listen to me.
154000	158000	Let me talk about the two little things I've been doing recently.
158000	159000	It's quite interesting.
159000	164000	It's mainly about how we can adjust our heat radiation.
164000	169000	And then let this building be more...
169000	171000	It's simple.
171000	172000	I just...
172000	176000	Yen Ping has already introduced my background.
176000	181000	Mainly, when I was at Stanford, I started doing nano.
181000	185000	And then I switched to doing some metal nanowires.
185000	188000	And then I started doing some textile research.
188000	195000	Textile, in my understanding, is actually related to energy.
195000	198000	Because...
198000	201000	I hope this slide will be clearer.
201000	205000	Because we actually spent a lot of energy
205000	210000	to provide us with a very comfortable hot environment.
211000	216000	In fact, most of the energy consumption in the United States
216000	220000	actually comes from fossil fuels.
220000	224000	That is to say, on the one hand, we have to push for renewable energy,
224000	228000	such as solar energy and wind energy.
228000	232000	On the other hand, if we can save the energy we use,
232000	236000	it will contribute a lot to reducing CO2 emissions.
236000	240000	The reason why I say that
240000	244000	textile and energy are closely related
244000	247000	is because if we look at...
247000	249000	This is also from the United States.
249000	250000	Let me ask everyone first.
250000	253000	Maybe I'll use a pointer.
253000	257000	Okay, yeah.
257000	259000	This is American consumption.
259000	262000	It's by different areas.
262000	265000	There's transportation, there's industry, and there's architecture.
265000	268000	Architecture is where we are now.
268000	271000	Just now, Yanping told me that
271000	274000	he's been looking for a parking lot for a long time.
274000	278000	We always go to a meeting place
278000	281000	to have a conference, class, and so on.
281000	283000	Even if you get off work, you go home.
283000	285000	So it's always in a building.
285000	287000	So it's not surprising that this building
287000	291000	takes up one-third of the energy consumption.
291000	293000	When we were young,
293000	295000	I think when we grew up in Taiwan,
295000	298000	we were taught to turn off the light
298000	300000	and turn off the faucet
300000	302000	to save electricity.
302000	304000	But in fact,
304000	305000	we didn't know until later that
305000	307000	most of the electricity
307000	309000	is consumed...
309000	311000	You're in this building.
311000	312000	You're consuming electricity.
312000	313000	Even if you don't turn on the light.
313000	314000	Because this building
314000	318000	needs to have a proper temperature.
318000	320000	You have to turn on the air conditioner in summer.
320000	322000	Taiwan doesn't need air conditioners in winter.
322000	324000	But in fact,
324000	325000	most places in the world
325000	327000	still have air conditioners in winter.
327000	330000	So HVAC is heating,
330000	331000	ventilation,
331000	333000	and AC is air conditioning.
333000	335000	This is a thermal air conditioner.
335000	336000	It basically takes up
336000	339000	17% of the energy in the United States.
339000	340000	You can imagine
340000	343000	if such a large amount of energy
343000	345000	is not consumed at all.
345000	347000	Because it is
347000	349000	the most basic living condition.
349000	351000	So the so-called textile
351000	353000	and energy-related places
353000	358000	are in this concept
358000	360000	called personal self-management.
360000	361000	In other words,
361000	363000	our traditional concept
363000	365000	is that we take this building,
365000	367000	the temperature of the whole building,
367000	370000	and make it very warm in winter.
370000	371000	Turn on the heater
371000	373000	and the whole building becomes very comfortable.
373000	375000	Personal self-management means
375000	376000	that we don't want to
376000	378000	make the whole building very warm.
378000	380000	Instead, we focus on
380000	383000	the environment around these people.
383000	384000	We try to make
384000	386000	these people feel warm.
386000	389000	After all, these tables and chairs
389000	391000	and decorations
391000	393000	don't really matter.
393000	395000	Textile is in this place.
395000	398000	We can make some new innovations
398000	400000	to achieve this goal.
400000	403000	Let's review
403000	405000	some of the past work
405000	407000	in personal self-management.
407000	410000	I mainly talk about radiative,
410000	413000	which is heat radiation.
413000	416000	In general, when we talk about a textile,
416000	418000	its cold or heat
418000	422000	is usually its flow
422000	423000	or evaporation,
423000	425000	how it is controlled.
425000	429000	Radiation is actually a very large piece,
429000	432000	but it has not been adjusted much.
432000	434000	So here we hope
434000	436000	that we can use some of the materials
436000	440000	and innovations to achieve different properties.
440000	442000	For example, we can
442000	445000	buckle the 7N wire
445000	450000	to the top of the clothes.
450000	455000	We can suppress the radiation.
455000	456000	In other words,
456000	458000	we can reduce our heat loss.
458000	459000	On the other hand,
459000	462000	we also made transparent clothes.
463000	466000	If you ask a physicist
466000	469000	how to make the coolest clothes,
469000	471000	the simplest answer is
471000	473000	not to wear it.
473000	475000	But obviously you can't do that.
475000	479000	So we can make clothes
479000	484000	that look colorful visually,
484000	485000	not transparent,
485000	487000	but don't seem to wear inside and outside.
487000	491000	This is the meaning of cooling textile.
491000	493000	Like this one,
493000	495000	it doesn't look very good,
495000	497000	but it's a prototype.
497000	500000	In the visible light,
500000	503000	it looks like a white vest.
503000	505000	In the infrared camera,
505000	507000	it looks completely transparent.
507000	510000	You can see the blood behind the clothes.
510000	514000	Radiation has a very special place
514000	517000	that is different from flow and evaporation.
517000	522000	Basically, it's like a TV.
522000	523000	It's like a light.
523000	525000	We all know that light has color.
525000	529000	Color is the nature of a surface.
529000	531000	Things can have two sides.
531000	532000	Two sides can have different colors.
532000	534000	So we can use this method
534000	537000	to make some traditional textiles
537000	539000	that can't be disturbed.
539000	540000	For example,
540000	542000	the textile of this Bill Maugham
542000	545000	looks the same on both sides
546000	552000	but it has a bilayer structure inside.
552000	556000	So when we put one side on the skin,
556000	559000	you will feel that your radiation is working,
559000	561000	so you will feel cooler.
561000	562000	But when you turn it over,
562000	565000	the other side is not so strong radiation,
565000	568000	so you will feel warmer
568000	572000	because it keeps your heat.
572000	579000	So with this Bill Maugham textile,
579000	583000	we can increase people's ability
583000	585000	to adapt to the environment.
585000	586000	For example,
586000	588000	for elderly people,
588000	590000	or people who get sick easily,
590000	591000	or people who get sick easily,
591000	594000	this can be a good protection for their immune system.
594000	597000	But there are also other ways to control it.
597000	598000	For example,
598000	602000	it's responsive to sweat.
602000	603000	When you sweat,
603000	606000	the textile becomes cooler,
606000	608000	and so on.
608000	613000	So the first thing I want to talk about today
613000	615000	is that when we finish these
615000	617000	heating, cooling,
617000	618000	and Bill Maugham textiles,
618000	623000	we find an interesting problem.
623000	627000	We find that the radiative heat management
627000	631000	actually has something to do with the substance underneath.
631000	632000	For example,
632000	635000	the reason this infrared transparent textile can work
635000	639000	is because this person is a very good radiator.
639000	642000	He's already radiating thermal radiation,
642000	645000	so we want to cool it.
645000	648000	The best way is to make this textile transparent.
648000	653000	So for a high-transmittance cooling,
653000	654000	for people,
654000	657000	a good radiator is more useful.
657000	660000	But if we want to manage things that are not people,
660000	662000	let's say a car.
662000	664000	Cars also need cooling.
664000	666000	That's not going to work,
666000	670000	because the metal itself is not a good radiator.
670000	671000	If you put a transparent thing in it,
671000	672000	it still doesn't radiate.
672000	675000	It's still very hot.
675000	676000	On the other hand,
676000	680000	if we want to do low-emissivity,
680000	681000	what is low-emissivity?
681000	687000	Emissivity is the ability to radiate thermal radiation.
687000	688000	The higher the emissivity,
688000	689000	the more radiation you emit.
689000	690000	The lower the emissivity,
690000	692000	the less radiation you emit.
692000	696000	So for a low-emissivity thing,
696000	703000	we want to use a high-emissivity device.
704000	707000	It's useful for low-emissivity objects,
707000	709000	but for high-emissivity objects,
709000	711000	it's a bit...
711000	713000	How can you be high-emissivity
713000	717000	if you don't have anything above that?
717000	720000	So from an engineer's point of view,
720000	723000	this is something that can't be tolerated.
723000	725000	Because when we make something,
725000	726000	we have to ask first
726000	729000	what kind of object this thing is suitable for.
729000	730000	In terms of design,
730000	733000	this is not a very perfect design.
733000	735000	Especially when we don't know what this object is.
735000	738000	It's easy to accidentally
738000	741000	make a lot of different devices
741000	744000	that can be useful for all objects.
744000	745000	On the other hand,
745000	746000	in terms of heating,
746000	748000	as long as we make this thing active,
748000	750000	it can always work.
750000	751000	This actually tells us that
751000	753000	today's transmittance,
753000	756000	emissivity, and reactivity,
756000	757000	these three modes need to be there
757000	758000	so that we can...
758000	761000	When we don't know what this object is,
761000	764000	we hope it can be controlled by heating and cooling.
764000	767000	We need these three modes
767000	770000	to have these three modes at the same time
770000	773000	on my device.
773000	776000	This is what I just said,
776000	779000	but in a more
779000	781000	quantitative way.
781000	782000	Basically,
782000	784000	when I use a transparent film
785000	789000	to cover an object,
789000	791000	the higher the coefficient of heat transfer,
791000	793000	the cooler it is.
793000	794000	The higher the emissivity,
794000	795000	the cooler it is.
795000	797000	If this is emissive,
797000	799000	let's say this thing is...
799000	801000	It becomes opaque.
801000	803000	So no matter what the thing underneath is,
803000	805000	the film above determines
805000	808000	whether it's cold or hot.
808000	809000	So you can imagine
809000	812000	there's a crossover
812000	814000	when the object underneath
814000	815000	is emissive,
815000	818000	you want to use the transmittance mode
818000	821000	to do the cooling.
824000	826000	So basically,
826000	829000	our goal is to
829000	832000	make a triple mode modulation.
832000	833000	At the same time,
833000	837000	this triple mode is also a completion,
837000	839000	because you want a light and an object
839000	841000	to be either opaque,
841000	842000	or absorb,
842000	843000	or reflect.
843000	844000	So basically,
844000	846000	as long as these three modes are available,
846000	850000	it's basically done.
850000	852000	So how do we do this?
852000	854000	First of all,
854000	855000	we choose an
855000	859000	infrared semi-absorbed elastomer.
859000	861000	Then we put this elastomer...
863000	864000	The surface of this elastomer
864000	866000	has some texture,
866000	869000	which is high-density adhesive.
869000	872000	Then we stretch this elastomer
872000	874000	to 100%,
874000	876000	and then put more metal on it.
876000	877000	So at this time,
877000	880000	this elastomer has two properties.
880000	883000	One is that its thickness becomes thinner.
883000	884000	The other is that
884000	887000	the metal is actually flat.
887000	888000	So at this time,
888000	892000	it's a better reflector.
892000	894000	This is a reflection mode.
894000	898000	So when we remove this elastomer,
898000	901000	so that it can be released,
901000	902000	two things will happen.
902000	904000	The first one is that the film becomes thicker.
904000	907000	Then this is its...
907000	909000	The metal layer we just cut,
909000	913000	it has an extra length.
913000	917000	So it becomes more wrinkled.
917000	919000	So we increase the thickness at the same time.
919000	924000	We also increase the surface...
924000	925000	What we call slow reflection,
925000	927000	which is scattering.
927000	928000	So overall,
928000	929000	we can increase
929000	936000	the composite absorption.
936000	940000	According to Kracov's law,
940000	943000	which is a very useful physical law,
943000	944000	it says that
944000	947000	in a thermodynamic equilibrium,
947000	948000	the more you absorb,
948000	952000	the more you release.
952000	953000	That is to say,
953000	955000	when we make a film with high absorption,
955000	957000	it also has high emittance.
957000	958000	So at this time,
958000	961000	it can do this cooling.
961000	962000	The third mode,
962000	964000	we just pulled this
964000	966000	100% film,
966000	968000	and then pulled it out.
968000	971000	We will pull this metal film.
971000	973000	After pulling it out,
973000	975000	of course,
975000	978000	the opened part becomes transparent.
978000	980000	Because this is a semi-absorbing elastomer.
980000	986000	So this is a state of high transmittance.
986000	987000	By using this open area
987000	990000	and relatively small thickness
990000	994000	to achieve this transmittance.
994000	1000000	This is a simple evidence.
1000000	1003000	We made this material.
1003000	1006000	SCM is to look at the surface of the material
1006000	1011000	with an electron.
1011000	1012000	First of all,
1012000	1014000	we can compare this
1014000	1018000	emissive mode with static.
1018000	1020000	It's rougher.
1020000	1021000	It's rougher than it is.
1021000	1023000	And then it's all broken.
1023000	1025000	We also use a more static way
1025000	1030000	to explain the same thing.
1030000	1031000	Next,
1031000	1033000	we really want to prove that
1033000	1037000	it can be absorbed from the outside of the red
1037000	1041000	and then reflected and transparent.
1041000	1043000	So this is a
1043000	1044000	heavy-folding,
1044000	1045000	as I just said,
1045000	1046000	the nature of the three modes.
1046000	1047000	Of course,
1047000	1049000	we measured the entire spectrum
1049000	1052000	and then made a score.
1052000	1053000	But in short,
1053000	1055000	we started from 100%,
1055000	1057000	which is to pull and then cut the metal.
1057000	1060000	Then you put it in
1060000	1061000	the emissive mode.
1061000	1063000	And then you pull it back to the original state
1063000	1065000	when you pull it to 100%.
1065000	1067000	This is all reflected.
1067000	1068000	And then you pull it,
1068000	1071000	and you see that the green area becomes wider,
1071000	1073000	and the transmittance is dominant.
1073000	1075000	And then this kind of
1075000	1077000	trend-induced cycling
1077000	1081000	can last for a thousand cycles.
1081000	1082000	And then,
1082000	1083000	of course,
1083000	1084000	there's a little degradation,
1084000	1087000	but it's not a big deal.
1088000	1089000	In addition,
1089000	1092000	we also focus on switching from reflectance
1092000	1094000	to emittance
1094000	1098000	as a mechanism study.
1098000	1099000	As I just said,
1099000	1101000	the emittance mode
1101000	1103000	mainly comes from two factors.
1103000	1105000	The first is that its thickness becomes thicker,
1105000	1108000	and the second is that its surface becomes rougher.
1108000	1109000	So we can see that
1109000	1110000	the emittance mode
1110000	1112000	mainly comes from two factors.
1112000	1114000	The first is that its thickness becomes thicker,
1114000	1117000	and the second is that its surface becomes rougher.
1117000	1121000	So we can think of the contrast of emittance
1121000	1125000	as contributing to these two factors.
1125000	1127000	And this
1127000	1130000	is our experimental data.
1130000	1133000	We can do some simple fitting and modeling
1133000	1137000	to explain
1137000	1140000	what the surface roughness factor
1140000	1142000	corresponds to
1142000	1144000	in terms of surface roughness.
1144000	1145000	At the same time,
1145000	1147000	this is a smooth surface.
1147000	1149000	If you don't do surface texturing today,
1149000	1151000	you won't be able to achieve
1151000	1154000	such a high contrast of emittance.
1154000	1156000	As I just said,
1156000	1159000	texturing is very, very important.
1159000	1160000	At the same time,
1160000	1163000	we can also
1163000	1165000	artificially predict
1165000	1167000	if we push
1167000	1171000	its application technique today,
1171000	1173000	we may be able to
1173000	1174000	push it better.
1174000	1175000	For example,
1175000	1177000	if we can
1177000	1180000	make a perfect diffuse scattering
1180000	1182000	from a completely smooth surface
1182000	1185000	after it is released,
1185000	1187000	we can predict
1187000	1191000	a 0.7 emittance contrast.
1191000	1196000	In terms of the knowledge limit,
1196000	1197000	today's surface
1197000	1200000	is a perfect diffuse
1200000	1202000	surface.
1202000	1204000	So when the light hits it,
1204000	1206000	it will present a
1209000	1211000	it will present a
1211000	1213000	it has a specific distribution.
1213000	1215000	And this distribution
1215000	1217000	has to do with the thickness
1217000	1220000	and the scattering rate of the material.
1220000	1222000	According to this thickness,
1222000	1224000	according to this scattering rate,
1224000	1226000	and according to this
1226000	1228000	the main thing is the scattering rate.
1228000	1229000	According to this scattering rate,
1229000	1230000	we can calculate
1230000	1232000	how much enhancement you have.
1232000	1233000	We can predict
1233000	1235000	if this is the limit,
1235000	1237000	we can have higher and higher emittance.
1240000	1241000	Next,
1241000	1244000	when we have this infrared measurement,
1244000	1247000	how much can it bring
1247000	1250000	the change in thermodynamics.
1250000	1253000	We also did a
1253000	1256000	heat transfer coefficient measurement.
1256000	1258000	The most important thing is to measure
1258000	1261000	the ability to control heating and cooling.
1261000	1263000	For example,
1263000	1265000	if we look at the red line,
1265000	1269000	the metal is at 100% strength.
1269000	1273000	It can go from 10 to 7.5
1273000	1277000	and then go a little higher.
1277000	1279000	Of course, this is completely customizable.
1279000	1280000	It depends on
1280000	1282000	whether you want more cooling
1282000	1284000	or more heating.
1284000	1285000	If it is blue,
1285000	1287000	it means there is a lot of heating mode.
1291000	1293000	In addition,
1293000	1295000	the picture on the right
1295000	1297000	is an experiment
1297000	1299000	to prove
1299000	1303000	what I said at the beginning.
1303000	1305000	I said,
1305000	1307000	if I don't know
1307000	1310000	the emissivity of the underlying object,
1310000	1312000	I can't
1312000	1315000	heat and cool all the objects.
1315000	1316000	For example,
1316000	1318000	if this blue thing
1318000	1320000	is a low emissivity material,
1320000	1322000	you will find that
1322000	1324000	when I use T-mode,
1324000	1326000	it is actually very hot.
1326000	1328000	The important thing is the temperature.
1328000	1329000	On the other hand,
1329000	1331000	if today I have a
1331000	1333000	high emissivity material,
1333000	1335000	I use T-mode,
1335000	1337000	which is actually cooler.
1337000	1338000	That is to say,
1338000	1341000	only when these three modes are available,
1341000	1343000	I can do the best
1343000	1345000	heating or cooling
1345000	1349000	for all the different objects.
1351000	1353000	Finally,
1353000	1355000	because we are adjusting the infrared now,
1355000	1357000	we made a
1357000	1359000	simple little device.
1359000	1361000	It's a
1361000	1363000	thing called
1363000	1365000	4x4.
1365000	1367000	We made a 4x4
1367000	1369000	pixel device
1369000	1371000	that we can use
1371000	1373000	to pump air
1373000	1375000	into a small chamber
1375000	1377000	or to draw vacuum.
1377000	1379000	We can adjust the
1379000	1381000	strength of the film above.
1381000	1383000	We made a
1383000	1385000	not very good-looking
1385000	1387000	but still
1387000	1389000	distinguishable letter D.
1389000	1391000	Then, of course,
1391000	1393000	we can adjust the other parts
1393000	1395000	to adjust the color
1395000	1397000	from non-radiative
1397000	1399000	to radiative.
1401000	1403000	I can pause here
1403000	1405000	and ask if you have any questions.
1415000	1417000	Hi,
1417000	1419000	if you have any questions,
1419000	1421000	you can ask directly.
1421000	1423000	Remember to turn on your microphone
1423000	1425000	or you won't hear the sound.
1425000	1427000	If not,
1427000	1429000	I will
1429000	1431000	continue.
1431000	1433000	Okay.
1433000	1435000	Okay,
1435000	1437000	so
1437000	1439000	this is just
1439000	1441000	for the infrared.
1441000	1443000	I just said
1443000	1445000	that
1445000	1447000	light and
1447000	1449000	infrared
1449000	1451000	are different from
1451000	1453000	radiation or radiation.
1453000	1455000	They are different wavelengths
1455000	1457000	and have different properties.
1457000	1459000	So we can have
1459000	1461000	different ways to adjust them.
1461000	1463000	The second part
1463000	1465000	is also
1465000	1467000	for architecture.
1467000	1469000	But we won't
1469000	1471000	do
1471000	1473000	this small device.
1473000	1475000	We will talk about architecture.
1475000	1477000	Excuse me, Bo-Jun.
1477000	1479000	Do you have a video?
1479000	1481000	I didn't see it.
1481000	1483000	Let's share it again.
1483000	1485000	Sorry.
1485000	1487000	Sorry.
1489000	1491000	Sorry for
1491000	1493000	interrupting.
1495000	1497000	Okay,
1497000	1499000	do you have it?
1501000	1503000	Do you have it?
1503000	1505000	Yes, I have it.
1505000	1507000	I have it.
1507000	1509000	Okay,
1509000	1511000	the second part is
1511000	1513000	that
1513000	1515000	another way
1515000	1517000	to save energy
1517000	1519000	from building
1519000	1521000	is to
1521000	1523000	use
1523000	1525000	renewable
1525000	1527000	energy
1527000	1529000	directly.
1529000	1531000	Renewable energy is
1531000	1533000	very simple.
1533000	1535000	We all know that
1535000	1537000	renewable energy is
1537000	1539000	a very mature industry.
1539000	1541000	Not many people
1541000	1543000	know that
1543000	1545000	there is another popular
1545000	1547000	field in the academic world
1547000	1549000	called radiative cooling.
1549000	1551000	Actually,
1551000	1553000	it has been happening
1553000	1555000	all the time.
1555000	1557000	When we
1557000	1559000	are in a vacuum,
1559000	1561000	besides the sun
1561000	1563000	giving you energy,
1563000	1565000	you are also radiating
1565000	1567000	to the earth.
1569000	1571000	It's hard to imagine,
1571000	1573000	but as I said,
1573000	1575000	infrared is a kind of light.
1575000	1577000	If you take a laser
1577000	1579000	and shine it to the sky,
1579000	1581000	you can shine it all the way to the moon.
1581000	1583000	So for light,
1583000	1585000	as long as nothing absorbs it,
1585000	1587000	it will keep going.
1587000	1589000	So when you are
1589000	1591000	on the surface of the earth,
1591000	1593000	let's say 25 degrees,
1593000	1595000	you are radiating to the universe,
1595000	1597000	which is 3 Kelvin.
1597000	1599000	So this is a very, very large temperature difference
1599000	1601000	that we can use
1601000	1603000	as a source of energy.
1603000	1605000	It's hard to say
1605000	1607000	why you don't feel
1607000	1609000	the energy
1609000	1611000	when you are outside in the daytime
1611000	1613000	because the sun is too strong.
1613000	1615000	This is why the academic world
1615000	1617000	has been doing
1617000	1619000	various materials
1619000	1621000	to make
1621000	1623000	what we call
1623000	1625000	daytime radiative cooling.
1625000	1627000	It can reflect
1627000	1629000	all the sunlight,
1629000	1631000	but there is still
1631000	1633000	a very strong radiation
1633000	1635000	that can do the cooling.
1639000	1641000	So this studio,
1641000	1643000	as Ye Min said,
1643000	1645000	I was at Stanford
1645000	1647000	and after my Ph.D. and postdoc,
1647000	1649000	I suddenly realized
1649000	1651000	that the world
1651000	1653000	has 4G.
1653000	1655000	In California,
1655000	1657000	it's basically the same every day.
1657000	1659000	The result of having 4G
1659000	1661000	is that when this building
1661000	1663000	may be good for heating
1663000	1665000	in winter,
1665000	1667000	but it needs cooling
1667000	1669000	in summer.
1669000	1671000	So buildings,
1671000	1673000	like people,
1673000	1675000	all need a control function
1675000	1677000	to have the best
1677000	1679000	energy saving
1679000	1681000	portfolio
1681000	1683000	in a year with 4G.
1683000	1685000	So we want to
1685000	1687000	have these two
1687000	1689000	sources of renewable energy
1689000	1691000	in the building
1691000	1693000	at the same time.
1693000	1695000	But it's not that simple.
1695000	1697000	The solar heating
1697000	1699000	and radiative cooling
1699000	1701000	require exactly the opposite
1701000	1703000	qualities.
1703000	1705000	As an ideal
1705000	1707000	solar heating material,
1707000	1709000	you want it to absorb
1709000	1711000	all the sunlight.
1711000	1713000	You don't want it to
1713000	1715000	keep all the
1715000	1717000	heat radiation
1717000	1719000	around you.
1719000	1721000	On the other hand,
1721000	1723000	for radiative cooling,
1723000	1725000	you want to do the opposite.
1725000	1727000	You don't want to absorb
1727000	1729000	any sunlight.
1729000	1731000	You want to maximize
1731000	1733000	the amount of heat
1733000	1735000	in the building.
1735000	1737000	But you can't
1737000	1739000	control these two
1739000	1741000	materials by adding
1741000	1743000	or subtracting.
1743000	1745000	You have to replace
1745000	1747000	the whole material
1747000	1749000	by chemical
1749000	1751000	or other methods.
1751000	1753000	So we chose
1753000	1755000	an engineering solution
1755000	1757000	with different
1757000	1759000	land scale tricks
1759000	1761000	and different performance.
1761000	1763000	But there is also
1763000	1765000	the possibility of
1765000	1767000	dual-mode control.
1767000	1769000	We made a film
1769000	1771000	that is very light
1771000	1773000	and can be
1773000	1775000	made into a roll-to-roll.
1775000	1777000	You can move
1777000	1779000	the film
1779000	1781000	in a roll-to-roll way.
1781000	1783000	We put the
1783000	1785000	solar heating
1785000	1787000	and radiative cooling
1787000	1789000	on the film.
1789000	1791000	We can use
1791000	1793000	the motor to switch.
1795000	1797000	First of all,
1797000	1799000	this material needs
1799000	1801000	good heating and cooling performance.
1801000	1803000	Let me briefly
1803000	1805000	introduce
1805000	1807000	the principles of these two parts.
1807000	1809000	In terms of heating,
1813000	1815000	we use
1815000	1817000	plasmonic absorber.
1817000	1819000	Basically,
1819000	1821000	it is used to make
1821000	1823000	small metal nanoparticles.
1823000	1825000	We have
1825000	1827000	used
1827000	1829000	a sound wave,
1829000	1831000	right?
1831000	1833000	The sound wave
1833000	1835000	has a fixed frequency.
1835000	1837000	The size of the sound wave
1837000	1839000	or the frequency of the sound wave
1839000	1841000	will have different frequencies.
1841000	1843000	The size of the nanoparticle
1843000	1845000	corresponds to the absorption
1845000	1847000	of visible light.
1847000	1849000	There are many different sizes of nanoparticles.
1849000	1851000	You can absorb
1851000	1853000	all the sunlight.
1853000	1855000	At the same time,
1855000	1857000	because it is metal,
1857000	1859000	it does not emit light.
1859000	1861000	I said in the last project
1861000	1863000	that if it is a metal nanoparticle,
1863000	1865000	it does not emit light.
1865000	1867000	A metal nanoparticle
1867000	1869000	can be designed
1869000	1871000	to be a perfect
1871000	1873000	solar absorber,
1873000	1875000	but it is a bad
1875000	1877000	infrared emitter.
1877000	1879000	On the other hand,
1879000	1881000	we use
1881000	1883000	PDMA.
1883000	1885000	PDMA is a transparent
1885000	1887000	rubber.
1887000	1889000	It is called silicone.
1891000	1893000	It is transparent
1893000	1895000	under visible light or sunlight,
1895000	1897000	but it is a good
1897000	1899000	absorber,
1899000	1901000	so the result is
1901000	1903000	a PDMA-covered
1903000	1905000	silver mirror.
1905000	1907000	We can reflect
1907000	1909000	sunlight, but it is a good
1909000	1911000	absorber.
1911000	1913000	We deliberately chose
1913000	1915000	these two materials
1915000	1917000	to be very scalable.
1917000	1919000	Because this thing
1919000	1921000	is going to be used by the building.
1921000	1923000	It is impossible to choose
1923000	1925000	a very unscalable
1925000	1927000	equipment.
1927000	1929000	Basically,
1929000	1931000	we are limiting
1931000	1933000	the size of the equipment
1933000	1935000	in our school.
1935000	1937000	For example,
1937000	1939000	a 12-centimeter-wide
1939000	1941000	film side-by-side.
1941000	1943000	This is
1943000	1945000	the opposite
1945000	1947000	optical quality I just mentioned.
1947000	1949000	Of course, it is not perfect,
1949000	1951000	but it is close to the
1951000	1953000	trend I just described.
1953000	1955000	Alpha and
1955000	1957000	Epsilon. Alpha is
1957000	1959000	the absorption of sunlight, and
1959000	1961000	Epsilon is the emission of infrared light.
1961000	1963000	For example,
1963000	1965000	PDMA is a very high
1965000	1967000	absorption of infrared light.
1967000	1969000	This is okay,
1969000	1971000	but it can
1971000	1973000	be lower.
1973000	1975000	Cooling is
1975000	1977000	visible light.
1977000	1979000	Solar does not need to be absorbed.
1979000	1981000	It is an infrared emission.
1981000	1983000	So this 2.7
1983000	1985000	is not
1985000	1987000	less than 5%.
1987000	1989000	Basically, you can't achieve
1989000	1991000	an effective cooling.
1991000	1993000	Because the sunlight is too strong.
1993000	1995000	The quality of both
1995000	1997000	materials
1997000	1999000	takes some time
1999000	2001000	to optimize the
2001000	2003000	material synthesis conditions.
2003000	2005000	In addition,
2005000	2007000	we use a
2007000	2009000	motor to
2009000	2011000	move the film to
2011000	2013000	make the material lighter
2013000	2015000	and thinner.
2015000	2017000	At the same time, it can also
2017000	2019000	reduce the energy
2019000	2021000	required for switching.
2021000	2023000	In addition, you don't want
2023000	2025000	the material to be too thick.
2025000	2027000	Because if it is too thick,
2027000	2029000	you have to spend some energy
2029000	2031000	to heat it or cool it.
2031000	2033000	It is more thermodynamic.
2033000	2035000	This is a simple demonstration
2035000	2037000	of its durability.
2037000	2039000	I did it 100 times.
2039000	2041000	Its performance is basically
2041000	2043000	unchanged.
2043000	2045000	The third point is
2045000	2047000	not so obvious,
2047000	2049000	but it is very important.
2049000	2051000	It is called reversible thermal contact.
2051000	2053000	You can imagine that when the film
2053000	2055000	moves to the left,
2055000	2057000	the solar heating will be very hot
2057000	2059000	and the water cooling will be very cold.
2059000	2061000	But if you can't
2061000	2063000	bring this heat or cold
2063000	2065000	to the building,
2065000	2067000	it will be meaningless.
2067000	2069000	Reversible thermal contact
2069000	2071000	is when we fix it,
2071000	2073000	we hope that it can
2073000	2075000	bring the heat down,
2075000	2077000	but it can also remove
2077000	2079000	and make a switching.
2079000	2081000	We use static electricity
2081000	2083000	as a driving force
2083000	2085000	to realize this function.
2085000	2087000	Basically, it is
2087000	2089000	a metal electrode
2089000	2091000	and substrate
2091000	2093000	as an electrode board.
2093000	2095000	As you can see,
2095000	2097000	the higher the voltage,
2097000	2099000	the higher the thermal contact.
2099000	2101000	On the right is the reference.
2101000	2103000	This is our film.
2103000	2105000	The higher the voltage,
2105000	2107000	the closer it is to the reference.
2107000	2109000	In other words,
2109000	2111000	it can bring all the heat
2111000	2113000	at the bottom.
2113000	2115000	This is a way
2115000	2117000	to reduce
2117000	2119000	or increase
2119000	2121000	its thermal contact conductance.
2121000	2123000	This is a relatively
2123000	2125000	simple way to describe it.
2125000	2127000	This is...
2127000	2129000	We want to demonstrate
2129000	2131000	that we don't need
2131000	2133000	to keep adding static electricity.
2133000	2135000	It's like today,
2135000	2137000	I know the capacitor.
2137000	2139000	After you add the voltage to the capacitor,
2139000	2141000	you break the voltage,
2141000	2143000	and the voltage is still there.
2143000	2145000	If you are
2145000	2147000	a circuit breaker.
2147000	2149000	So today,
2149000	2151000	as long as you don't
2151000	2153000	break the voltage,
2153000	2155000	it will stay there
2155000	2157000	until the water
2157000	2159000	or something else
2159000	2161000	takes the voltage away.
2161000	2163000	We measured
2163000	2165000	how long the voltage
2165000	2167000	can stay at the top.
2167000	2169000	After three days,
2169000	2171000	we can see the decay.
2171000	2173000	But it doesn't matter
2173000	2175000	if it's decayed.
2175000	2177000	We just need to touch it
2177000	2179000	a little bit
2179000	2181000	This is a video
2181000	2183000	of a real device
2183000	2185000	moving.
2191000	2193000	We use this motor
2193000	2195000	to move it.
2195000	2197000	The black part is
2197000	2199000	the solar heater.
2199000	2201000	The reflective part
2201000	2203000	is the radiator cooler.
2209000	2211000	This is the actual
2211000	2213000	roof of our school.
2213000	2215000	We did this experiment.
2217000	2219000	Doing this experiment
2219000	2221000	was actually
2221000	2223000	very difficult.
2223000	2225000	If it rains, we can't do it.
2225000	2227000	Anyway,
2227000	2229000	this is our
2229000	2231000	actual data.
2231000	2233000	The positive value
2233000	2235000	is for heating.
2235000	2237000	The negative value is for cooling.
2237000	2239000	We put a sensor
2239000	2241000	to measure this.
2241000	2243000	We also verified
2243000	2245000	the importance
2245000	2247000	of the voltage
2247000	2249000	in this device.
2249000	2251000	When we
2251000	2253000	gradually increase the voltage,
2253000	2255000	we can see that
2255000	2257000	the number of heating and cooling
2257000	2259000	has increased.
2259000	2261000	Switching
2261000	2263000	takes about one or two minutes.
2263000	2265000	In terms of
2265000	2267000	a building's time scale,
2267000	2269000	it's very fast.
2269000	2271000	Then we compare
2271000	2273000	the data
2273000	2275000	with the
2275000	2277000	model value.
2277000	2279000	The model value is
2279000	2281000	the weather,
2281000	2283000	the solar energy,
2283000	2285000	the humidity,
2285000	2287000	and the wind speed.
2287000	2289000	I can expect
2289000	2291000	how much heating
2291000	2293000	and cooling.
2293000	2295000	If the measurement
2295000	2297000	is close to the model,
2297000	2299000	it means that
2299000	2301000	the thermal contact
2301000	2303000	has been solved.
2303000	2305000	We can see
2305000	2307000	the black line
2307000	2309000	is the model value,
2309000	2311000	and the red line
2311000	2313000	is the model value.
2317000	2319000	Lastly,
2319000	2321000	we hope
2321000	2323000	that this
2323000	2325000	dual-mode device
2325000	2327000	can be used
2327000	2329000	in other places
2329000	2331000	in the United States.
2331000	2333000	As I said,
2333000	2335000	buildings
2335000	2337000	require
2337000	2339000	dynamic
2339000	2341000	and smart tuning.
2341000	2343000	With this
2343000	2345000	dual-mode device,
2345000	2347000	we expect
2347000	2349000	it can be used
2349000	2351000	in different climatic areas
2351000	2353000	in the most
2353000	2355000	effective way.
2355000	2357000	In fact,
2357000	2359000	if your building
2359000	2361000	can only do heating,
2361000	2363000	you can save a lot of energy
2363000	2365000	in the Five Lakes
2365000	2367000	and the Northeast.
2367000	2369000	Does it make sense?
2369000	2371000	Cooling is more average.
2371000	2373000	As you know,
2373000	2375000	in the East China Sea,
2375000	2377000	the East China Sea is
2377000	2379000	hot in the winter and cold in the summer.
2379000	2381000	In the West China Sea,
2381000	2383000	the four seasons are different.
2383000	2385000	Cooling is basically needed
2385000	2387000	in every place.
2387000	2389000	If you have dual-mode today,
2389000	2391000	you can choose
2391000	2393000	to do cooling or heating
2393000	2395000	when it is cold.
2395000	2397000	In different areas,
2397000	2399000	you can have a cool
2399000	2401000	or energy-saving
2401000	2403000	improvement.
2403000	2405000	Finally,
2405000	2407000	to summarize,
2407000	2409000	the two main tasks today
2409000	2411000	are dual-mode
2411000	2413000	and
2413000	2415000	I don't know
2415000	2417000	whether it can do heating
2417000	2419000	or cooling.
2419000	2421000	We also demonstrated
2421000	2423000	multi-spectral,
2423000	2425000	which is to say,
2425000	2427000	it can control
2427000	2429000	the two different
2429000	2431000	wavelengths.
2431000	2433000	Let's talk about
2433000	2435000	what kind of work
2435000	2437000	we want to do
2437000	2439000	from now on.
2439000	2441000	For example,
2441000	2443000	we can further subdivide
2443000	2445000	the concept of multi-spectral.
2445000	2447000	We know that although it is solar,
2447000	2449000	it also has visible light
2449000	2451000	and infrared.
2451000	2453000	Infrared is
2453000	2455000	coming from the sun,
2455000	2457000	but it can't be seen.
2457000	2459000	Today,
2459000	2461000	I just want to see the scenery.
2461000	2463000	If we can
2463000	2465000	subdivide it,
2465000	2467000	there will be more
2467000	2469000	useful functions.
2469000	2471000	In addition,
2471000	2473000	we need to use
2473000	2475000	telemetry to control it.
2475000	2477000	Basically,
2477000	2479000	these two tasks
2479000	2481000	are controlled by
2481000	2483000	mechanical methods.
2483000	2485000	For many applications,
2485000	2487000	moving part
2487000	2489000	is not a good thing.
2489000	2491000	It is easy to be damaged.
2491000	2493000	Telemetry has
2493000	2495000	advantages in this aspect.
2495000	2497000	Of course,
2497000	2499000	it is also more fun
2499000	2501000	in Fundamental Material Science.
2503000	2505000	For example,
2505000	2507000	Electrochromic,
2507000	2509000	we are doing a topic
2509000	2511000	about
2511000	2513000	wearable infrared
2513000	2515000	control.
2515000	2517000	Basically,
2517000	2519000	it can control
2519000	2521000	the radiation
2521000	2523000	from 1.5 times
2523000	2525000	to 1.5 times.
2525000	2527000	Another one
2527000	2529000	is
2529000	2531000	the work of
2531000	2533000	an audience called
2533000	2535000	Dai Yiqin Initiator.
2535000	2537000	It basically follows
2537000	2539000	the control of
2539000	2541000	Miraiya solar.
2541000	2543000	But we don't use
2543000	2545000	mechanical methods,
2545000	2547000	which is the same as before.
2547000	2549000	After we add electricity,
2551000	2553000	Miraiya becomes
2553000	2555000	higher,
2555000	2557000	solar becomes lower,
2557000	2559000	and vice versa,
2559000	2561000	solar becomes higher,
2561000	2563000	Miraiya becomes lower.
2563000	2565000	This is my talk today.
2567000	2569000	I should acknowledge
2569000	2571000	Lai Yiqin,
2571000	2573000	but that is
2573000	2575000	not the case.
2575000	2577000	The main work is
2577000	2579000	completed by my postdoc
2579000	2581000	and the students.
2581000	2583000	My collaborator is
2583000	2585000	Duke's
2585000	2587000	Willie Padilla,
2587000	2589000	and Wyoming's
2589000	2591000	Kang Tan.
2591000	2593000	Thank you.
2597000	2599000	Before we start,
2599000	2601000	I would like to
2601000	2603000	thank Lai Yiqin
2603000	2605000	for his wonderful talk.
2607000	2609000	Thank you.
2611000	2613000	I don't think it will be long.
2613000	2615000	I think the time is just right.
2615000	2617000	We usually have
2617000	2619000	this kind of time.
2619000	2621000	So,
2621000	2623000	I don't know
2623000	2625000	if you have any questions.
2625000	2627000	Since it is
2627000	2629000	over,
2629000	2631000	please turn on your mic.
2631000	2633000	If you are too shy,
2633000	2635000	you can ask me.
2639000	2641000	Can I ask a question?
2641000	2643000	No.
2647000	2649000	You can ask.
2649000	2651000	Oh, no. I was shot.
2653000	2655000	We are classmates.
2655000	2657000	We are college roommates.
2657000	2659000	Oh, right.
2661000	2663000	I just want to
2663000	2665000	thank Taira
2665000	2667000	for this great platform.
2667000	2669000	We haven't seen each other
2669000	2671000	for hundreds of years.
2671000	2673000	Let me introduce myself.
2673000	2675000	I am Ethan,
2675000	2677000	and I am doing research
2677000	2679000	in the field of materials.
2679000	2681000	We are college classmates.
2681000	2683000	This platform
2683000	2685000	is cross-field.
2685000	2687000	I don't want to get into
2687000	2689000	material science.
2689000	2691000	I don't want people to know
2691000	2693000	what we are talking about.
2693000	2695000	I want to ask a general question.
2695000	2697000	We are all overseas.
2697000	2699000	I believe this platform
2699000	2701000	is for Taiwanese
2701000	2703000	who are mainly scholars.
2703000	2705000	I want to ask you
2705000	2707000	to share your experience
2707000	2709000	in Duke.
2709000	2711000	You worked hard
2711000	2713000	to get a faculty position.
2713000	2715000	This is the light of Taiwan.
2715000	2717000	I want to ask
2717000	2719000	about your experience
2719000	2721000	in this platform
2721000	2723000	and your connection with Taiwan.
2723000	2725000	For example,
2725000	2727000	you interviewed students in Taiwan.
2727000	2729000	You also had a job interview
2729000	2731000	with some PhD students.
2731000	2733000	I want to ask you to share
2733000	2735000	what I think can be discussed.
2735000	2737000	First, what is the current situation of Taiwanese students?
2737000	2739000	For example, how active are they in studying abroad?
2739000	2741000	Second,
2741000	2743000	on a global scale,
2743000	2745000	what do you think
2745000	2747000	are the advantages of being Taiwanese?
2751000	2753000	What was the first question?
2753000	2755000	The first one is...
2757000	2759000	I know you didn't sleep well.
2759000	2761000	The second one is the level of activity, right?
2761000	2763000	Yes.
2765000	2767000	I think
2767000	2769000	in general,
2769000	2771000	everyone should have
2771000	2773000	a sense of crisis.
2777000	2779000	Of course, I think
2781000	2783000	Taiwan's society is stable
2783000	2785000	and prosperity is a good thing.
2787000	2789000	But I think
2789000	2791000	in terms of security,
2791000	2793000	at least
2793000	2795000	since we went abroad,
2799000	2801000	I've only heard about the situation in Taiwan.
2801000	2803000	But, for example,
2803000	2805000	there are fewer and fewer people studying abroad.
2807000	2809000	I don't think many people want to go abroad.
2809000	2811000	Actually, I'm curious about where everyone is going.
2813000	2815000	If it's a financial system,
2815000	2817000	it should be obvious.
2817000	2819000	Of course, everyone has their own...
2823000	2825000	Everyone has their own aspirations.
2825000	2827000	But I think
2827000	2829000	this distribution...
2831000	2833000	Fewer people
2833000	2835000	are doing academic research.
2837000	2839000	In the long run,
2839000	2841000	it's not good.
2841000	2843000	We'll be short of a lot of...
2845000	2847000	First,
2847000	2849000	let's say
2849000	2851000	in the first ten or twenty years,
2851000	2853000	there will be more potential
2853000	2855000	for growth.
2855000	2857000	But in
2857000	2859000	other countries,
2859000	2861000	the connection
2861000	2863000	will be weaker.
2865000	2867000	I still encourage
2869000	2871000	everyone to
2871000	2873000	take more risks.
2875000	2877000	What's the first question?
2877000	2879000	Share your experience
2879000	2881000	building connections with Taiwan.
2885000	2887000	Of course,
2889000	2891000	my experience is
2891000	2893000	taking care of Taiwanese people.
2897000	2899000	Let me give you an example.
2901000	2903000	I met
2905000	2907000	a Taiwanese
2907000	2909000	in a meeting.
2909000	2911000	We discussed
2911000	2913000	how to promote
2913000	2915000	Taiwanese students
2915000	2917000	to study abroad.
2917000	2919000	At the time,
2919000	2921000	I suggested...
2923000	2925000	It's simple.
2925000	2927000	I was teaching in
2927000	2929000	an American school.
2931000	2933000	If Taiwanese students
2933000	2935000	can get
2935000	2937000	a small living
2937000	2939000	allowance,
2939000	2941000	for example,
2941000	2943000	they can come to me
2943000	2945000	or other teachers
2945000	2947000	to do summer research
2947000	2949000	and get a recommendation.
2949000	2951000	I think it's easier
2951000	2953000	than
2953000	2955000	building a
2955000	2957000	school-to-school
2957000	2959000	memorandum.
2959000	2961000	If you sign a memorandum,
2961000	2963000	you'll know
2963000	2965000	you have a weak connection
2965000	2967000	with the teacher.
2967000	2969000	As a Ph.D.,
2969000	2971000	you can't do that.
2971000	2973000	If you can do that,
2973000	2975000	I think
2975000	2977000	it's possible.
2979000	2981000	Actually,
2981000	2983000	I brought this student
2983000	2985000	this summer,
2985000	2987000	but it became remote
2987000	2989000	due to COVID-19.
2989000	2991000	I don't know
2991000	2993000	how she'll do.
2993000	2995000	It's her first year.
2995000	2997000	But I think
2997000	2999000	it's a good summer experience.
2999000	3001000	For me,
3001000	3003000	I...
3003000	3005000	For her,
3005000	3007000	she has a very direct
3007000	3009000	teacher's recommendation
3009000	3011000	in the U.S.
3011000	3013000	It's very detailed.
3013000	3015000	It's different
3015000	3017000	from the teacher's
3017000	3019000	recommendation in Taiwan.
3019000	3021000	This is the style
3021000	3023000	between Taiwan and the U.S.
3023000	3025000	In Taiwan,
3025000	3027000	a lot of students
3027000	3029000	in the U.S.
3029000	3031000	would look at
3031000	3033000	when they met this student.
3033000	3035000	What was their first impression
3035000	3037000	when they first met her?
3037000	3039000	What project did she do?
3039000	3041000	What did she do?
3041000	3043000	What did she do?
3043000	3045000	What did she do?
3045000	3047000	What did she do?
3047000	3049000	What did she do?
3049000	3051000	What did she do?
3051000	3053000	What did she do?
3053000	3055000	Even if she was an exchange student,
3055000	3057000	it's not as detailed.
3059000	3061000	This is my...
3061000	3063000	This year,
3063000	3065000	I established a new
3065000	3067000	connection with Taiwan.
3067000	3069000	It's a new experiment.
3071000	3073000	I think it's a good point.
3073000	3075000	I'm a beneficiary.
3075000	3077000	We also have students
3077000	3079000	who are like you.
3079000	3081000	Visiting students.
3081000	3083000	Because of your recommendation,
3083000	3085000	we have some opportunities
3085000	3087000	for students
3087000	3089000	to exchange abroad
3089000	3091000	in college.
3091000	3093000	Of course, it's not much,
3093000	3095000	but it's a big difference
3095000	3097000	for a poor student.
3097000	3099000	Of course, we will try to make up for it.
3099000	3101000	We try to help with some costs,
3101000	3103000	such as experimental fees,
3103000	3105000	some space, and so on.
3105000	3107000	As for living expenses,
3107000	3109000	she may have to figure it out herself.
3109000	3111000	I believe it's across the board.
3111000	3113000	Many Taiwanese friends
3113000	3115000	are serving in different schools.
3115000	3117000	Let's see if there's a chance
3117000	3119000	to compete with her mother's school.
3119000	3121000	Of course, the school can do it.
3121000	3123000	If there is such an opportunity,
3123000	3125000	exchange students with Taiwanese students.
3125000	3127000	Of course, the main purpose
3127000	3129000	is to get a recommendation later.
3129000	3131000	And this thing
3131000	3133000	is easy to do.
3133000	3135000	Because for us,
3135000	3137000	today, of course,
3137000	3139000	there is a layer of alumni relationship.
3139000	3141000	But even if you go to
3141000	3143000	a non-alumni,
3143000	3145000	you tell him you have a free labor
3145000	3147000	to work for you.
3147000	3149000	No one will say no.
3149000	3151000	It will be very simple.
3151000	3153000	If you choose a more official
3153000	3155000	recommendation today,
3155000	3157000	but you have to admit your academic qualifications
3157000	3159000	and credit,
3159000	3161000	it will be very troublesome.
3161000	3163000	And let me tell you first
3163000	3165000	that now all schools
3165000	3167000	have some operations,
3167000	3169000	such as 2 plus 2.
3169000	3171000	It's a bit like Chinese people
3171000	3173000	stealing Western resources
3173000	3175000	to train their students.
3175000	3177000	At least I don't know other places,
3177000	3179000	but our whole country in Australia
3179000	3181000	has banned
3181000	3183000	signing MOUs with any place
3183000	3185000	in detail.
3185000	3187000	So you can't sign it.
3187000	3189000	You can't sign it at all.
3189000	3191000	So
3191000	3193000	I think
3193000	3195000	it's the first year
3195000	3197000	now.
3197000	3199000	Let's see how this student applies.
3199000	3201000	Of course, his application is mainly related
3201000	3203000	to his own ability.
3203000	3205000	But I think
3205000	3207000	this may help.
3209000	3211000	OK.
3211000	3213000	That's about it. Don't take up my time.
3215000	3217000	Yiting, do you have anything to add?
3217000	3219000	Yiting is my
3219000	3221000	first
3221000	3223000	Taiwanese student.
3227000	3229000	Hello, everyone. I'm Yiting.
3229000	3231000	I have a question.
3231000	3233000	Can you hear me?
3235000	3237000	Yes, I can.
3239000	3241000	Now
3241000	3243000	it's global warming,
3243000	3245000	so Taiwan's summer temperature
3245000	3247000	has reached 37-38 degrees.
3247000	3249000	I went with my uncle to visit
3249000	3251000	a orchid farmer.
3251000	3253000	They use a greenhouse.
3253000	3255000	During the day,
3255000	3257000	the sunlight comes in.
3257000	3259000	But because the temperature is too high,
3259000	3261000	they have to turn on the air conditioner all the time.
3261000	3263000	Because their orchids are very large,
3263000	3265000	their air conditioner power is not enough,
3265000	3267000	so many orchids die.
3267000	3269000	Now because of global warming,
3269000	3271000	Taiwan's orchids
3271000	3273000	also have other problems.
3273000	3275000	They can't lower
3275000	3277000	the temperature to the right temperature.
3277000	3279000	Do you have any suggestions?
3283000	3285000	Sure.
3285000	3287000	Like I said earlier,
3287000	3289000	first of all,
3289000	3291000	you have to let the light in.
3291000	3293000	The cheapest way
3293000	3295000	is to add a black cloth.
3295000	3297000	That's the cheapest way.
3299000	3301000	A more high-tech way
3301000	3303000	is to
3303000	3305000	block the part
3305000	3307000	where the sunlight
3307000	3309000	is only hot.
3309000	3311000	You can reduce it a little bit.
3319000	3321000	I think
3323000	3325000	in terms of greenhouse,
3325000	3327000	transparent is the first priority.
3327000	3329000	So this is a little bit
3329000	3331000	related to my last slide
3331000	3333000	about the future world.
3333000	3335000	Today,
3335000	3337000	for a very special requirement,
3337000	3339000	there will be a different approach.
3339000	3341000	The dual mode
3341000	3343000	just now
3343000	3345000	doesn't work because it's not transparent.
3345000	3347000	Orchids are all dead.
3347000	3349000	So we have to think of
3349000	3351000	a new material solution.
3355000	3357000	The interesting part is here.
3357000	3359000	For this different application.
3361000	3363000	Thank you.
3373000	3375000	Does anyone have any questions?
3375000	3377000	Our discussion today
3377000	3379000	is because we already asked
3379000	3381000	so we don't have to
3381000	3383000	ask about the content.
3383000	3385000	I think the content is really interesting.
3385000	3387000	I'm not a professional
3387000	3389000	so I can't ask professional questions.
3389000	3391000	I want to leave it
3391000	3393000	at the end
3393000	3395000	and let everyone
3395000	3397000	discuss first.
3397000	3399000	If there are any questions
3399000	3401000	related to the content,
3401000	3403000	we can discuss
3403000	3405000	whether it is
3405000	3407000	students studying abroad
3407000	3409000	or international cooperation
3409000	3411000	between teachers.
3411000	3413000	This is definitely
3413000	3415000	the core of Terra.
3415000	3417000	You can speak
3417000	3419000	later.
3421000	3423000	What time is our meeting scheduled?
3427000	3429000	In fact, there are only about 10 minutes left.
3433000	3435000	If everyone has something to say,
3435000	3437000	you can also be neutral.
3439000	3441000	If you want to stay and discuss later,
3441000	3443000	this room can be kept open.
3443000	3445000	After 10 minutes,
3445000	3447000	you can turn it off.
3451000	3453000	It's a bit stressful to talk while recording.
3459000	3461000	I've been waiting for you to turn it off.
3463000	3465000	I'll ask the next question first.
3465000	3467000	I'm going to turn it off.
3467000	3469000	What?
3469000	3471000	Are you going to turn it off?
3471000	3473000	Wait, let me finish my question first.
3473000	3475000	I have a question.
3475000	3477000	I just saw you talking about
3477000	3479000	the D
3479000	3481000	written in Chongqing style,
3481000	3483000	right?
3485000	3487000	I was thinking
3487000	3489000	when I went to see your website,
3489000	3491000	you mentioned
3491000	3493000	that the cloth becomes transparent
3493000	3495000	after it is covered,
3495000	3497000	but the white cloth
3497000	3499000	will pass the red line,
3499000	3501000	so there is no cloth
3501000	3503000	in Chongqing.
3503000	3505000	But if
3505000	3507000	the transparent cloth
3507000	3509000	doesn't pass the red line,
3509000	3511000	so you can see the cloth.
3511000	3513000	I was thinking
3513000	3515000	these things
3515000	3517000	can be used
3517000	3519000	for confidential communication
3519000	3521000	or other applications.
3521000	3523000	Do you know what I mean?
3523000	3525000	These possibilities are...
3525000	3527000	Can you answer this question?
3527000	3529000	Yes, of course.
3529000	3531000	Actually,
3531000	3533000	the red line
3533000	3535000	means
3535000	3537000	that
3537000	3539000	you can imagine
3539000	3541000	if
3541000	3543000	you have
3543000	3545000	a sensor
3545000	3547000	and you
3547000	3549000	take a picture of
3549000	3551000	the background
3551000	3553000	of the red line,
3553000	3555000	and you know
3555000	3557000	what the background looks like,
3557000	3559000	then you
3559000	3561000	wear a
3561000	3563000	pixel-by-pixel display,
3563000	3565000	and you adjust
3565000	3567000	the radiation on your body
3567000	3569000	to be the same as the background,
3569000	3571000	then you are
3571000	3573000	transparent in real life.
3575000	3577000	Yes,
3577000	3579000	there are many...
3579000	3581000	Yes, yes.
3581000	3583000	I was thinking that
3583000	3585000	it's like a encryption.
3585000	3587000	You put something on it,
3587000	3589000	but in a certain channel,
3589000	3591000	it's actually transparent.
3591000	3593000	You have to decode it.
3593000	3595000	It's like that.
3595000	3597000	You can think like that.
3597000	3599000	At least I thought like that when I saw it.
3599000	3601000	Yes,
3601000	3603000	basically,
3603000	3605000	we are talking about
3605000	3607000	a visible
3607000	3609000	material.
3609000	3611000	It can have
3611000	3613000	a color of
3613000	3615000	heat radiation.
3615000	3617000	You can control it
3617000	3619000	separately like this.
3621000	3623000	OK.
3623000	3625000	But in this case,
3625000	3627000	in the application of communication,
3627000	3629000	it will be
3629000	3631000	like what we usually
3631000	3633000	say,
3633000	3635000	like the encryption of visual data
3635000	3637000	and decode it.
3637000	3639000	Compared to that,
3639000	3641000	how efficient is it?
3643000	3645000	Because it's not a very...
3645000	3647000	When we do communication,
3647000	3649000	we don't think like that.
3649000	3651000	But in terms of concept, it's a bit like that.
3651000	3653000	Is it more efficient?
3653000	3655000	Or is its safety level
3655000	3657000	higher? I think the safety level is lower.
3657000	3659000	But
3659000	3661000	the efficiency seems to be quite high.
3661000	3663000	Because it can be...
3663000	3665000	It can be recorded.
3665000	3667000	The
3667000	3669000	amount of
3669000	3671000	data will be smaller.
3671000	3673000	I don't know.
3673000	3675000	I think if I really want to
3675000	3677000	push it like this,
3677000	3679000	I can think about it.
3679000	3681000	If you do it today,
3681000	3683000	suppose I only have
3683000	3685000	a very narrow
3685000	3687000	wavelength
3687000	3689000	with
3689000	3691000	specific text.
3691000	3693000	I can't see the other wavelengths.
3693000	3695000	Let me tell you
3695000	3697000	how many
3697000	3699000	wavelengths I'm going to use today.
3699000	3701000	Then you can see my text in this wavelength.
3701000	3703000	You can't see the other wavelengths.
3703000	3705000	In this case, it may be possible.
3707000	3709000	Because you talked about the
3709000	3711000	rush later, I think it's really cool.
3711000	3713000	So I just thought
3713000	3715000	it was a bit like what you said.
3715000	3717000	And because of
3717000	3719000	the control of the
3719000	3721000	current of the film,
3721000	3723000	you can have a schedule.
3723000	3725000	It doesn't have to be
3725000	3727000	a fixed wavelength.
3727000	3729000	It will change
3729000	3731000	according to some other conditions.
3731000	3733000	So even if you
3733000	3735000	really find that wavelength,
3735000	3737000	it's only for that second.
3737000	3739000	Because it's already
3739000	3741000	somewhere else.
3741000	3743000	So it's a
3743000	3745000	visual data
3745000	3747000	that covers it.
3747000	3749000	Because at least people
3749000	3751000	can't see it, so it's a visual data
3751000	3753000	method.
3753000	3755000	Yes.
3755000	3757000	I don't know.
3757000	3759000	I just thought about it.
3759000	3761000	I think
3761000	3763000	it's pretty cool.
3763000	3765000	But I don't have
3765000	3767000	a lot of ideas to realize this thing.
3767000	3769000	But I think it's okay.
3769000	3771000	You can think about it.
3775000	3777000	I'm done asking.
3777000	3779000	Because what I do
3779000	3781000	I'm not doing material science.
3781000	3783000	I'm not doing chemistry or physics.
3783000	3785000	I'm doing more communication research.
3785000	3787000	So I think about
3787000	3789000	this kind of thing.
3789000	3791000	Yes.
3791000	3793000	You can
3793000	3795000	brainstorm again another day.
3797000	3799000	Okay.
3799000	3801000	Do you have any more questions?
3801000	3803000	Then
3803000	3805000	if there are no questions,
3805000	3807000	I'll turn off the recording.
3807000	3809000	I'll turn it off.
3809000	3811000	1, 2, 3.
