0	13000	Hello everyone, I am today's keynote speaker, Jason Hong.
13000	19000	I am now a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan.
19000	23000	I am also a Project Taira staff member.
23000	32000	Project Taira stands for the Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.
32000	47000	The purpose of today's event is to provide suggestions and feedback.
48000	60000	We hope that Project Taira will continue to grow and improve.
60000	71000	At the beginning, I would like to talk about what Project Taira is currently doing,
71000	76000	and what questions we would like to ask.
76000	92000	This video is the summary of Project Taira.
92000	98000	We hope to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,
98000	101000	to connect with Taiwanese academics from all over the world,
101000	106000	to communicate about the development, results, and trends of overseas and Taiwan academic circles,
106000	111000	and to provide each other with an effective platform for communication.
111000	115000	This is basically the purpose of Project Taira.
115000	125000	We hope that young Taiwanese academics from all over the world can come to this platform,
125000	130000	and share information with each other.
130000	136000	Our organization currently has two websites.
136000	142000	The first is our blog, where we publish our weekly speeches.
142000	147000	The second is our Facebook page, where you can find our information.
148000	156000	Let me talk a little bit about what Project Taira has been doing in recent years.
156000	166000	The first thing we are doing is to prepare a regular speech every week.
166000	175000	We have been doing this speech from 2017 to now, about 4 to 5 years.
176000	191000	If you go to our blog, the page will tell you what the topic of our next week's speech is.
191000	197000	There are many topics, and it will tell you the main time.
197000	208000	We hope that the main time will be around 6 to 7 p.m. in the west coast of the United States.
208000	213000	This time will be around 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the east coast of the United States.
213000	220000	If you are in Taiwan, you may hear this speech at 10 a.m.
220000	225000	We mainly do this on weekends, such as Saturdays and Sundays.
226000	231000	We hope that you can take the time to listen to our speech.
231000	236000	We hope that you can take the time to listen to our speech.
239000	245000	Every week, our speech will be recorded and posted on our blog.
245000	249000	If you have listeners who want to find the previous speech,
249000	253000	you may find some important information in the previous speech,
253000	256000	and you may go there to find it.
256000	264000	We hope that every week we can record the speech and put it in this space.
265000	274000	Sometimes, if the speech has not been published yet,
274000	281000	we can postpone the upload time.
281000	286000	According to our previous results,
286000	293000	we have found speakers from various fields.
293000	298000	This is a small part.
298000	306000	This may be related to air pollution, biology, astronomy,
306000	312000	or computer science.
313000	323000	We will share the information of the speech every week.
323000	329000	We use e-mail and the blog I just mentioned.
329000	332000	We will share it on Facebook.
332000	339000	We will also share it on the Facebook page of major alumni associations.
342000	350000	Finally, if you are a speaker and you give a speech,
350000	359000	we will send you an Amazon gift card at the end of the year.
359000	364000	It depends on our budget.
364000	373000	The above is our regular talk.
373000	380000	The second important thing we do is the summer special activities.
380000	384000	In the summer, because everyone is on vacation,
384000	389000	there is usually less time in the middle to give a speech.
389000	394000	In the middle, we will invite some people from outside to give us some speeches.
394000	397000	Some special and interesting speeches.
397000	402000	In 2018, we invited Liu Junlin to tell us
402000	410000	how to use some academic speech or presentation software.
410000	414000	For example, how to use LaTeX, how to use DeepLeaf.
414000	416000	I don't know what these are.
416000	421000	In 2019, we made some changes.
421000	428000	Our main focus was the ZR development symposium.
428000	438000	We invited two professors and an industry person
438000	444000	to share with us their experience in finding a job.
444000	448000	I believe this is a topic that many people are interested in.
448000	453000	This symposium has a very high attendance rate.
453000	460000	In 2020, two weeks ago,
460000	466000	we continued to do academic work and development symposium.
466000	472000	This event is co-organized with the Professor Association of Taiwan in North America.
472000	474000	This year, we invited them to co-organize the symposium.
474000	483000	We hope that we can get more information from the professor.
483000	487000	This year, there are some other activities.
487000	490000	For example, the annual member's meeting.
490000	494000	Two or three weeks later,
494000	497000	there will be a research project on Taiwan's first rocket.
497000	504000	Finally, there will be a symposium on the reform of higher education.
504000	507000	I think this symposium is quite interesting.
507000	517000	We invited the former president of the Research Student Association,
517000	524000	as well as some legal assistants and researchers from the Policy Research Center.
524000	531000	I hope that more people can participate in this symposium.
531000	541000	This symposium is very hard-earned by Professor Yan Yong, one of our staff members.
541000	552000	There are two important things that Taira has done so far.
552000	559000	There is a weekly speech and a special symposium or speech in the summer.
559000	564000	Let's take a look at the growth data.
564000	568000	You can give us some suggestions for reference.
568000	574000	The first graph shows the number of members and the time.
574000	581000	As you can see, we had a member system since the end of 2017.
581000	584000	It has continued to grow.
584000	586000	It looks pretty linear.
586000	589000	I hope we can continue to maintain it in the future.
589000	593000	So far, we have almost 300 members.
594000	598000	We held a total of 122 speeches.
598000	604000	If you look at our Facebook page, there are more than 2,000 members.
604000	614000	The graph on the right is the breakdown of our speech.
614000	616000	I divided it into several categories.
617000	624000	Because the topic is very complicated and diverse, I roughly divided it into several categories.
624000	634000	It's probably math, physics, chemistry, biology, other sciences, engineering, and humanities.
634000	638000	You can take a look at it.
638000	642000	So far, physics and biology seem to be the most popular.
643000	647000	Engineering is also quite a lot.
654000	657000	The number of members is actually the most in these categories.
657000	659000	But the number of speeches is not very clear.
659000	662000	The number of speeches seems to be the most in biology.
662000	666000	Next, if you add physics, it is also the most.
666000	672000	This is our breakdown.
672000	686000	The following is the IP address of the audience.
686000	695000	70% of the audience is from the United States.
695000	701000	About 20% of the audience is from Taiwan.
701000	705000	The rest are from Japan and some European countries.
705000	716000	The number of people on the line seems to be smaller and more professional.
717000	723000	So the number of people on the line is about 10 people.
723000	733000	Unless there is a symposium, the number of people on the line may exceed 50 or 40.
733000	738000	These 40 or 50 people are usually in a symposium.
739000	741000	This is a special event in the summer.
746000	753000	Finally, I would like to mention that there are organizations that cooperate with us and support us financially.
753000	760000	As mentioned earlier, we have some financial support.
760000	770000	These funds come from the Ministry of Education and TACO.
770000	775000	We also found some partners.
775000	780000	This is the Taiwan University Graduate Association and the North American and Taiwanese Professor Association.
780000	785000	There are also some activities from the Ministry of Science and Technology.
785000	794000	Unfortunately, we can't hold activities with them this year, but we hope to hold activities with them in the future.
794000	800000	We would like to hear some opinions from the ministers and scientists.
807000	811000	I hope to leave more time for meeting discussion.
811000	820000	I have listed some things that we want to discuss with you.
820000	823000	There are four main parts.
823000	832000	Membership rights, PR team, seminar team, and IT team.
833000	842000	As for the membership rights, the priority is higher.
842000	846000	We hope to change some membership rights and obligations.
846000	851000	We also hope to change some conditions and frequency for speeches.
851000	854000	Let's take a look at the following slide.
855000	858000	You can take a look at it.
858000	863000	In our blog, we mentioned the membership rights.
863000	870000	This is for doctoral students and post-doctoral students working in public or private institutions.
870000	875000	The main problem is the membership obligations.
875000	886000	In our previous membership obligations, there is a rule that members should give a speech every two years and share recent research results.
886000	895000	This rule is because a long time ago, the TARA group was actually a very small organization.
895000	901000	There were more than ten people at that time, and we had to give speeches in turns.
902000	909000	But now there are too many members, and it has become a big organization.
909000	917000	We hope to discuss how we should upgrade our speeches in the future.
917000	925000	What rights should we have as members?
925000	929000	How should TARA upgrade its speeches?
929000	939000	One of our proposals is to eliminate this obligation.
939000	944000	We don't need to give a speech every two years.
944000	950000	Giving a speech is your right.
950000	958000	In the future, we will try to find members who have a membership status.
958000	963000	We will try to find speakers from the members so that you can share your speech.
963000	966000	It's also a chance to practice speaking.
966000	972000	This is a change.
972000	988000	In addition, there are some job openings opportunities in universities and Taiwan.
988000	994000	They will provide us with job openings information.
994000	997000	We will forward this information to the members.
997000	1001000	This is a new membership right.
1001000	1009000	According to these conditions, what we hope to do in the future is this.
1009000	1022000	If you are not a member and you are a non-member, you will go to a non-member registration form.
1022000	1024000	You need to fill out a form.
1024000	1028000	If you are a member, you will receive our letters on a regular basis.
1028000	1034000	You don't have to do anything. You just need to go online and participate in the speech.
1034000	1040000	In the future, we hope to change it to this.
1040000	1043000	We will make two Google Groups.
1043000	1048000	Basically, it's a group of non-members.
1048000	1053000	A group is responsible for the information of TeraTalks.
1053000	1059000	Every week, TeraTalks will be sent out by this letter.
1059000	1065000	You can freely choose whether you want to join or quit.
1065000	1069000	It's like a subscribe function.
1069000	1071000	You just need to subscribe.
1071000	1073000	It doesn't matter if you are a member or not.
1074000	1082000	For this reason, all members or non-members have to sign up for the speech.
1082000	1085000	You need to fill out a form to participate in the speech.
1085000	1093000	The second thing the Google Group does is to send the information of TeraTalks to everyone.
1093000	1097000	However, this is limited to the rights of members.
1097000	1101000	So far, we hope to make such a change.
1102000	1104000	Please listen to it.
1104000	1109000	There are other things we can discuss.
1109000	1111000	For example, the PR group.
1111000	1117000	One important thing is that TeraTalks has no official logo.
1117000	1120000	So we hope everyone can provide a logo.
1120000	1128000	Or we can hold a logo presentation.
1128000	1130000	We need to do something like this.
1130000	1138000	If you want us to work together, you can suggest it later.
1138000	1140000	We will have Q&A time later.
1140000	1142000	You can make a suggestion at that time.
1142000	1147000	Another thing is that the number of registrants we have seen so far.
1147000	1156000	If there are 30 people, only 15 people will participate in the speech.
1156000	1161000	It's weird. Where are the other 15 people?
1161000	1170000	For the seminar group, if you want us to make some adjustments in the field of speech.
1170000	1179000	Or if you want us to do something special in the summer.
1179000	1182000	Everyone can make a suggestion.
1182000	1189000	If you want to open a journal club, or want to do a forum in your field.
1189000	1191000	You can also discuss with us.
1191000	1198000	For the IT group, we mainly want to know the experience of using BlueDreams.
1198000	1206000	We want to know if there are any benefits of other online meeting software.
1206000	1208000	It is very, very necessary.
1209000	1211000	OK.
1211000	1216000	My report is about to end.
1216000	1221000	I hope everyone can, whether it's on this topic.
1221000	1226000	Or if you have anything else you want to discuss, you can mention it later.
1226000	1230000	This is our current staff.
1230000	1232000	Let me read the names.
1232000	1241000	Zhang Jianyuan, Zhang Yanping, Hong Shisan, Xu Youzhen, Wei Qunshu, Zhang Yanyong, Zhou Zhixian, Zhu Haoran, Su Yiyan, and Yang Jiayin.
1241000	1243000	OK.
1243000	1256000	We will have about 20 to 30 minutes of Q&A.
1257000	1263000	After that, we will have a small presentation for recruiting staff.
1263000	1273000	If you want to join our Taira organization, you are welcome to stay.
1273000	1276000	Our Taira organization needs new blood.
1276000	1278000	We need new blood.
1278000	1284000	The reason we founded this organization is that there are a group of young scholars.
1284000	1288000	Everyone can share with each other.
1288000	1296000	As you know, if there is a professor here, a professor who may be 40 or 50 years old, everyone will feel uncomfortable.
1296000	1301000	So we really want young scholars to join us.
1301000	1305000	Then we can finish this project together.
1305000	1307000	OK.
1307000	1312000	Let's start the discussion.
1312000	1320000	Does anyone have any comments?
1320000	1339000	Hello? I can't hear you.
1339000	1341000	There seems to be a serious echo.
1341000	1349000	Hello?
1349000	1353000	Sorry, there was a problem with my microphone.
1353000	1358000	I just told you that your video is gone.
1358000	1360000	And now it's back.
1360000	1364000	You are not playing, but it's back.
1364000	1368000	So what should we discuss now?
1368000	1374000	Should we discuss one group at a time or all at once?
1374000	1379000	Let's start with the membership rights.
1379000	1381000	This is what we want to know the most.
1381000	1394000	Do you have any questions about the membership rights or membership obligations?
1395000	1403000	Let me talk about why we proposed this.
1403000	1414000	Jason and I were mainly collecting speeches and then arranging them into annual schedules.
1414000	1420000	Then we found that there are too many people now.
1420000	1426000	If you calculate a little, there are more than 42 weeks a year, right?
1426000	1428000	No, sorry, there are more than 50 weeks.
1428000	1431000	Then deduct the holiday, we have to arrange 30 speeches a year.
1431000	1435000	But we have more than 200 people, so we just have to say that we want to collect speeches.
1436000	1445000	Even if we only limit the number of members to give speeches, we will usually line up far more than this year's slots.
1445000	1447000	Then it will be too much.
1447000	1451000	So we were a bit like a compulsory.
1451000	1455000	That is, we ask everyone to give a speech every one to two years.
1455000	1457000	This thing basically does not exist.
1457000	1460000	Because everyone is forced to give a speech, otherwise you will line up for three years.
1460000	1462000	This is also a strange thing.
1463000	1471000	Instead, many people come to ask if I can use this platform to share my speech.
1471000	1475000	Let me find potential partners.
1475000	1480000	Or let people who are interested in the same field as me get to know each other.
1480000	1482000	Then we can discuss.
1482000	1488000	It becomes a kind of benefit.
1488000	1498000	Basically, everyone who comes to participate now means that you are already members.
1498000	1506000	In theory, you can give your opinion on our policy.
1506000	1508000	What do you think?
1508000	1513000	Or do you have any other thoughts on this part?
1513000	1523000	Everyone is very silent.
1523000	1525000	Everyone seems to be very silent.
1525000	1527000	Yes.
1527000	1543000	If not, let's ask everyone else's opinion first.
1543000	1546000	Everyone may have no feeling for this.
1546000	1560000	Do you want to adjust the field of our speech?
1560000	1565000	Or do you have any interesting summer activities that you want to provide?
1566000	1572000	I can't see the chat.
1572000	1577000	I saw a lot of comments on the chat just now.
1577000	1579000	No, the chat is not important.
1579000	1581000	The chat is self-introduction.
1581000	1583000	It has nothing to do with what I told you.
1583000	1585000	OK.
1585000	1587000	Let me talk about this part.
1587000	1589000	It's the same as me and Jason.
1589000	1591000	We are having a speech.
1592000	1595000	We first found a problem.
1595000	1599000	In fact, there are quite a few people who have given us suggestions.
1599000	1607000	You may find that a very large part of TARA is focused on the speech in the field of science and technology.
1607000	1609000	This is not our intention.
1609000	1615000	We don't want to be biased in this way.
1615000	1629000	In fact, we really want to have humanitarian research, or even various kinds of research, to enter our organization.
1629000	1636000	Because the ultimate goal is to connect young people around the world to engage in research.
1636000	1639000	But the reason is simple.
1639000	1644000	Our network is very polite.
1644000	1649000	So our friends spread out like this.
1649000	1652000	Then TARA becomes a very polite organization.
1652000	1656000	There are even other similar academic exchanges.
1656000	1661000	They all say, aren't you just a polite academic organization?
1661000	1663000	They think we are positioned like this.
1664000	1674000	We found that when we start to give others such an impression, positive feedback will continue to make us more like this.
1674000	1681000	Then we have no way to break through the humanistic part.
1681000	1683000	So I don't know what you think.
1683000	1684000	This is the first one.
1684000	1686000	The other one is similar.
1686000	1690000	We are a very American-based organization.
1690000	1694000	This is also because the founders are all in the United States, so our circle of friends is also in the United States.
1694000	1699000	But we have always wanted to enter, that is to say, we can connect with European Taiwanese.
1699000	1702000	But this has always been a bit of a difficult thing.
1702000	1705000	I don't know what you think about this.
1705000	1708000	Or what do you think? Or what can we do?
1708000	1715000	Or if you want to provide a speaker specifically, you can also hope that he will give a speech.
1716000	1723000	Hello is my name is Zhong Boting, and I just joined the first time to attend this meeting.
1723000	1726000	And then I had not heard of any of your speeches at all.
1726000	1733000	And then I just a little bit, I have a little look at your previous speech, is the head of the head of the head.
1733000	1736000	And then I am a background in science and engineering.
1736000	1742000	And then I feel from the start it seems to be quite professional.
1742000	1747000	I do not know the content because I did not go to see the content, but just from the beginning to look at it, I feel very professional.
1747000	1754000	And then even if I am a science and engineering, I will have a little bit of rejection.
1754000	1756000	Because I do not understand the title at all.
1756000	1762000	And then I think this may be more for those of you who are talking about other fields.
1762000	1765000	Maybe those who are not science and engineering are not science and engineering.
1765000	1768000	They may be a little bit more sure.
1768000	1772000	So I was thinking, is it possible to give some more general?
1772000	1776000	Just from the title, it looks like a more general, everyone can participate.
1776000	1779000	It will be more interesting.
1779000	1782000	Oh, I see.
1782000	1783000	Yes, this is my feeling.
1783000	1790000	But I just joined the first time, so I just looked at the title of the previous talk very quickly.
1790000	1794000	Yes, I can understand this thing.
1794000	1798000	Yes, but the current title is actually written by the speaker.
1798000	1801000	We will not make any changes.
1801000	1812000	I'm not sure if your goal is to make it easier for everyone to understand and be interested.
1812000	1816000	Then there may be more people who really participate.
1816000	1819000	There is a chance to attract more people.
1819000	1822000	Sorry, can you hear my voice?
1822000	1824000	You go first.
1824000	1834000	Our current approach is that when the speaker comes, we will suggest that you can give a 10 to 20-minute background review.
1834000	1837000	It's about the general audience.
1837000	1842000	But we can't control what the speaker is going to do.
1842000	1845000	Some speakers will do it, some will not do it.
1845000	1848000	This is not something we can control.
1849000	1859000	I think maybe in the future we can discuss the topic and content with the speaker.
1859000	1863000	In this case, can we make him more generous?
1863000	1865000	What do you think, Yanyong?
1865000	1870000	I have a different opinion, but Zhang Yiping just said something.
1870000	1872000	Yes.
1872000	1874000	Zhang Yiping, don't talk first.
1874000	1875000	I told him not to talk first.
1876000	1878000	OK, I'll speak first.
1878000	1880000	No, Zhang Yiping, you go first.
1880000	1889000	I want to talk about what Zhang Yiyong just said.
1889000	1896000	I think our number of people, although it seems that if you compare, there are more volunteers.
1897000	1906000	But if you compare the number of people in the research institute, in Taiwan, especially in the United States,
1906000	1910000	I don't think we are particularly humanistic.
1910000	1913000	Because there are very few people who are humanistic.
1913000	1914000	So maybe...
1914000	1916000	You don't think there are many volunteers?
1916000	1921000	I don't think there are many volunteers because there are very few people who are humanistic.
1921000	1925000	So our people are relatively humanistic.
1925000	1927000	That's what I think.
1927000	1930000	There are not many, but I don't think this is a mistake.
1930000	1933000	Of course, if your interpretation is that everyone has to do 50% or 55%,
1933000	1937000	it may look like that, but this is actually a mistake.
1937000	1938000	I think this is a mistake.
1938000	1939000	I can add to Zhang Yiping.
1939000	1941000	It's about 5 to 1.
1941000	1946000	Hello everyone, I'm Yi An, and I'm a staff member.
1947000	1952000	I think in the past five years, from the doctoral students who graduated from North America,
1952000	1956000	there are about 500 to 600 so-called science majors every year,
1956000	1963000	and about 100 are humanities or humanities.
1963000	1964000	It's about 5 to 1.
1964000	1969000	If you look at the number of doctoral graduates from North America.
1970000	1972000	Another thing you just said,
1972000	1979000	Zhang Yiping just talked about the number of people in different regions.
1979000	1981000	I think there are very few people in Europe.
1981000	1982000	I guess there's a reason.
1982000	1984000	Maybe it's because their time is really not ideal.
1984000	1987000	In the United States and Taiwan, one in the evening, one in the morning.
1987000	1989000	The European time zone is 2 o'clock in the middle of the night.
1989000	1991000	That's really difficult.
1991000	1993000	So maybe it's a barrier.
1994000	1996000	Let me interrupt you.
1996000	1999000	I don't know if I can interrupt your point of view.
1999000	2001000	We are now chatting.
2001000	2004000	There are different people with different problems.
2004000	2007000	We will discuss one by one.
2007000	2009000	But let's finish the discussion now.
2009000	2012000	So everyone just wait patiently.
2015000	2018000	What I'm going to talk about next is about the topic.
2018000	2022000	How broad or narrow the topic is.
2022000	2025000	I guess what Zhang Yiping is going to tell me is about the same.
2025000	2027000	Because I don't think ...
2027000	2030000	First of all, I am Zhang Yiping.
2030000	2032000	I am studying social psychology.
2032000	2033000	So I guess I am ...
2033000	2035000	I'm not completely humanities.
2035000	2037000	But I should be relatively social science.
2037000	2039000	But from my point of view,
2039000	2042000	I don't think the current topic is too special.
2042000	2044000	The reason is ...
2044000	2046000	The reason is ...
2046000	2047000	I don't think ...
2047000	2050000	At least my understanding is that Tyra's goal is not to do science.
2050000	2052000	We are not TED.
2052000	2054000	So ...
2054000	2057000	And we didn't force everyone to attend many times.
2057000	2060000	So it seems that social science people have to sign up for a few things.
2060000	2062000	He obviously doesn't understand.
2062000	2063000	This is not ...
2063000	2065000	This is a free participation.
2065000	2068000	Then our goal is actually more professional.
2068000	2069000	This ...
2069000	2071000	Establish academic links with each other.
2071000	2073000	So it was originally a professional academic link.
2073000	2075000	If I see that topic, I don't know at all.
2075000	2077000	He wrote a few mathematical symbols on it.
2077000	2079000	Even this ...
2079000	2081000	The symbol of the physical example has nothing to do with me.
2081000	2083000	I just don't want to go.
2083000	2087000	On the contrary, such a more professional topic can actually help ...
2087000	2091000	The speaker and the audience will go to establish a link.
2091000	2092000	Instead of them talking ...
2092000	2093000	They ...
2093000	2096000	The speaker and the original professional audience feel very shallow.
2096000	2097000	They don't know what they are doing here.
2097000	2098000	Then I go ...
2098000	2099000	I finished listening.
2099000	2100000	I think it's very interesting.
2100000	2103000	But when I go home, it has nothing to do with my academics.
2103000	2104000	I think ...
2104000	2106000	I think it's more of a difference.
2106000	2107000	So I ...
2107000	2110000	I don't think the topic is too short now.
2112000	2113000	Let me talk about that ...
2113000	2115000	Zhang Jiaming just said.
2115000	2116000	That is ...
2118000	2121000	In fact, I think there is a point.
2121000	2122000	Just ...
2122000	2124000	Jason is not very correct.
2124000	2126000	That is, we can't control the speaker.
2126000	2130000	In fact, we are communicating with the speaker.
2130000	2132000	When is the speech?
2132000	2134000	How do we usually arrange a process?
2134000	2137000	How much time do you need to do the introduction?
2137000	2139000	How long does it take to talk about the professional part?
2139000	2140000	But ...
2140000	2141000	We ...
2141000	2142000	At least I personally ...
2142000	2143000	If I do it ...
2143000	2145000	I am doing some speeches.
2145000	2146000	If it's my field of chair.
2146000	2148000	I will tell them that ...
2148000	2151000	We hope it can really be in ...
2151000	2154000	Academically, it has enough impact on you.
2154000	2155000	That is to say ...
2155000	2158000	You can get a network that is useful to you.
2158000	2160000	Or a partner.
2160000	2161000	So if you come and give a ...
2161000	2163000	Like ...
2163000	2166000	If you give a speech like a YouTuber ...
2166000	2168000	It may make everyone feel very fruitful.
2168000	2170000	But in fact, for our organization ...
2170000	2171000	Or for ...
2171000	2173000	The impact we really want to have.
2173000	2174000	May not be the best.
2174000	2175000	Because you go ...
2175000	2176000	Yeah, it's TED Talk.
2176000	2178000	Just listen to TED Talk.
2178000	2179000	So I personally ...
2179000	2181000	Usually positioned in this part.
2181000	2182000	Then I will tell them that ...
2182000	2184000	What academic speech do you want to say?
2184000	2185000	You really let ...
2185000	2187000	This thing can be played.
2187000	2188000	That ...
2188000	2189000	He himself will not come.
2189000	2190000	We do not mind a speech.
2190000	2191000	Only ten people.
2191000	2192000	Or I do not mind.
2192000	2194000	But in fact, I know ...
2194000	2196000	Jason is actually more inclined to do ...
2196000	2197000	More ...
2197000	2198000	Interdisciplinary.
2198000	2199000	Or ...
2199000	2200000	More ...
2200000	2201000	Lighter.
2201000	2203000	But a wider speech.
2203000	2204000	Then I think this is a ...
2204000	2205000	Discussable direction.
2205000	2206000	That is to say ...
2206000	2208000	Everyone to our ...
2208000	2210000	What do you think of the scope?
2210000	2211000	This way.
2211000	2213000	I do not necessarily want to do ...
2213000	2214000	Lighter speech.
2214000	2215000	I hope that ...
2215000	2216000	That is ...
2216000	2217000	Speakers ...
2217000	2218000	In fact, you can ...
2218000	2221000	Spend ten to twenty minutes to talk about the background.
2221000	2222000	That is to say ...
2222000	2223000	His field ...
2224000	2225000	That is ...
2225000	2226000	Current development ...
2226000	2228000	What is the current situation?
2229000	2230000	How?
2230000	2231000	That is ...
2231000	2232000	But later ...
2232000	2233000	He can say that ...
2233000	2234000	He ...
2234000	2236000	What is he really doing?
2236000	2237000	I would think ...
2237000	2238000	If this is the case ...
2238000	2240000	I think this is actually ...
2240000	2242000	A large part is the current situation.
2242000	2243000	Is not it?
2243000	2244000	I think ...
2244000	2246000	If this is the case, I think ...
2246000	2247000	I quite agree.
2247000	2248000	I think ...
2248000	2249000	Sure.
2249000	2251000	If you really want to produce this ...
2251000	2252000	Cross-field cooperation ...
2252000	2253000	You do not tell people ...
2253000	2254000	You are in ...
2254000	2255000	What is your big picture?
2255000	2256000	In fact, it is very ...
2256000	2257000	It is a hindrance.
2257000	2258000	So I think ...
2258000	2259000	This ...
2259000	2260000	Yes.
2260000	2261000	But there is ...
2261000	2262000	I think ...
2262000	2263000	The audience just said ...
2263000	2264000	A good point is that ...
2264000	2265000	This is your name ...
2265000	2267000	It can be better.
2267000	2269000	You can write better.
2271000	2272000	Yes, I think my ...
2272000	2274000	My idea should just say ...
2274000	2276000	Because you just discussed ...
2276000	2277000	How to let ...
2278000	2279000	Some ...
2279000	2280000	Different audiences ...
2280000	2281000	Participate.
2281000	2282000	Maybe I did not hear very clearly.
2282000	2283000	But I just want to say ...
2283000	2284000	Maybe you can ...
2284000	2286000	How to attract people.
2286000	2287000	So I just feel from ...
2287000	2288000	Title or ...
2288000	2289000	Advertising ...
2289000	2290000	You can attract people.
2290000	2291000	Because ...
2291000	2292000	Maybe you have discussed the content ...
2292000	2293000	Background.
2293000	2294000	But because I ...
2294000	2296000	I do not know these things.
2297000	2298000	Yes.
2298000	2299000	OK.
2299000	2300000	Yes.
2300000	2302000	I think his meaning should be like this.
2302000	2303000	That is ...
2303000	2304000	We should be advertising ...
2304000	2305000	Promotion.
2305000	2306000	Or ...
2306000	2307000	Title should be at least ...
2307000	2308000	Clear.
2308000	2309000	Clear.
2309000	2310000	And I think ...
2310000	2312000	I do not know if this is too much trouble.
2312000	2313000	But I think maybe ...
2313000	2314000	Can be divided a little bit.
2314000	2315000	Because like now ...
2315000	2316000	Someone mentioned ...
2316000	2317000	I just mentioned that ...
2317000	2318000	We can be divided into areas.
2318000	2319000	Or ...
2319000	2320000	But I think maybe ...
2320000	2321000	You can be divided a little bit.
2321000	2322000	There are some talks ...
2322000	2323000	Maybe some ...
2323000	2324000	Speakers would like to talk ...
2324000	2325000	General ...
2325000	2326000	A little bit.
2326000	2327000	Or more ...
2327000	2328000	Background part.
2328000	2329000	Some of them may be ...
2329000	2330000	More professional ...
2330000	2331000	Want to discuss with each other.
2331000	2332000	But I think ...
2332000	2333000	This may be a little bit ...
2333000	2334000	To distinguish.
2335000	2336000	This may also be helpful ...
2336000	2337000	To digest ...
2337000	2338000	That is ...
2338000	2339000	Speech requirements.
2340000	2341000	I ...
2341000	2342000	I ...
2342000	2344000	I want to follow this suggestion.
2344000	2346000	My own position is more like ...
2346000	2348000	Leave this freedom to the speaker.
2348000	2350000	Let me give an example.
2350000	2351000	Like ...
2351000	2352000	Uh ...
2352000	2353000	The freedom I'm talking about is ...
2353000	2355000	How deep, how much money, how much money.
2355000	2356000	This freedom.
2356000	2357000	Let me give an example.
2357000	2358000	Suppose I am doing this today.
2358000	2359000	Quantum computing.
2359000	2361000	Then I did it very well.
2361000	2362000	I am ...
2362000	2363000	I am Zhang Taide.
2363000	2364000	I am very professional.
2364000	2365000	I am very good.
2365000	2366000	Then I'm going to find another one.
2366000	2367000	With me ...
2367000	2368000	To ...
2368000	2369000	This ...
2369000	2370000	Co-PI of a ...
2370000	2371000	I am now looking for a co-PI.
2371000	2372000	Then do a very professional thing.
2372000	2373000	So I talked about a very professional speech.
2373000	2374000	I wrote a very professional title.
2374000	2375000	Others do not understand.
2375000	2376000	Is ...
2376000	2377000	They just go to die.
2377000	2378000	This is my freedom.
2378000	2379000	Then my goal is ...
2379000	2380000	This way.
2380000	2381000	Then I also do this.
2381000	2382000	I also achieved.
2382000	2383000	I actually feel that there is no problem.
2383000	2384000	But suppose I am doing today.
2384000	2385000	Quantum computing.
2385000	2387000	Then I want to go to the TSMC to ask for money.
2387000	2388000	This way.
2388000	2389000	Then I obviously can not write ...
2389000	2390000	Such a title.
2390000	2391000	So I will ...
2391000	2392000	Uh ...
2392000	2393000	I ...
2393000	2394000	I predict who the audience is.
2394000	2396000	So I wrote a relatively clear title.
2396000	2397000	Then focus on not so much math.
2397000	2398000	Maybe not so much math.
2398000	2399000	Then write some ...
2399000	2400000	The future possibilities of these.
2400000	2402000	Then I may even be ...
2402000	2404000	Write Chinese, etc.
2404000	2406000	So I will be more inclined to ...
2406000	2407000	Uh ...
2407000	2408000	The speaker ...
2408000	2410000	I think this is the responsibility of the speaker.
2410000	2411000	They ...
2411000	2412000	Want to know their own ...
2412000	2413000	Predict the audience.
2413000	2414000	Who do they want the audience to be?
2414000	2415000	Then go ...
2415000	2416000	Cooperate with the audience.
2416000	2418000	Control their depth.
2418000	2420000	Achieve the goal they want to achieve.
2420000	2421000	I will be more inclined to ...
2421000	2423000	Leave this part to the speaker.
2423000	2425000	Then if you really want the speaker ...
2425000	2426000	There is no no.
2426000	2427000	Yeah, I ...
2427000	2428000	I fully understand you.
2428000	2429000	I mean ...
2429000	2430000	The speaker can of course decide for himself.
2430000	2431000	But it should be said ...
2431000	2433000	Maybe your platform can ...
2433000	2434000	Is that you can ...
2434000	2435000	Maybe on the website.
2435000	2436000	Or what can you say?
2436000	2437000	Oh, we have ...
2437000	2438000	These ...
2438000	2439000	That is, we may ...
2439000	2440000	You can give these ...
2440000	2441000	Types of ...
2441000	2442000	That ...
2442000	2443000	Speech.
2443000	2444000	Then you can ...
2444000	2445000	Just think about it.
2445000	2447000	Which part are you more inclined to?
2447000	2448000	That ...
2448000	2449000	You can tell us first.
2449000	2450000	Then we are doing advertising.
2450000	2451000	Or in classification.
2451000	2452000	Or when arranging.
2452000	2453000	We are more able to ...
2453000	2454000	Just ...
2454000	2455000	Help you classify well.
2455000	2457000	Or help you promote.
2457000	2458000	Of course there is a speaker.
2458000	2459000	Decide for yourself first.
2459000	2460000	What type does he want to give you?
2460000	2461000	It's not that we ...
2461000	2463000	I did not say what to ask the speaker to give.
2463000	2464000	Just say you are probably ...
2464000	2465000	Just in advertising.
2465000	2466000	Or classification.
2466000	2467000	Or just ...
2467000	2468000	When giving everyone options.
2468000	2469000	Just say, oh, we have these choices.
2469000	2470000	This feeling.
2470000	2471000	Yeah.
2471000	2472000	Yeah.
2472000	2473000	Ok.
2473000	2474000	Understand.
2474000	2475000	This may be in the future.
2475000	2476000	Just ...
2476000	2477000	To the speaker's ...
2477000	2478000	Uh ...
2478000	2479000	Instructions.
2479000	2480000	Yeah.
2480000	2481000	Because I was thinking ...
2481000	2482000	You just ...
2482000	2483000	Yeah.
2483000	2484000	You just said ...
2484000	2485000	Maybe you want to classify or classify.
2485000	2486000	Then I just want to say ...
2486000	2487000	This may be ...
2487000	2488000	Just ...
2488000	2489000	You can try it.
2489000	2490000	Just ...
2490000	2491000	Because I have participated in it.
2491000	2492000	I'm not sure.
2492000	2493000	No, no.
2493000	2495000	I think this suggestion is very good.
2495000	2496000	Just ...
2496000	2498000	I think we might have to think about it.
2498000	2499000	Is ...
2499000	2500000	Sure.
2500000	2501000	Our speech content.
2501000	2502000	There is probably no problem.
2502000	2504000	This is the 20-minute, 40-minute distribution.
2504000	2505000	Then the depth of distribution.
2505000	2506000	But we are ...
2506000	2508000	Let others see this.
2509000	2512000	When people see this announcement.
2512000	2514000	Unless you are really doing that thing.
2514000	2515000	Or you will not know.
2515000	2516000	What is this doing?
2516000	2517000	That is either.
2517000	2518000	We can make the speech.
2518000	2519000	The title can be set.
2519000	2520000	It is easier to understand.
2520000	2521000	Otherwise, we are.
2522000	2523000	We, for example, Facebook.
2525000	2526000	That article in the post.
2526000	2527000	There should be one.
2527000	2528000	For example,
2528000	2529000	What kind of this is.
2529000	2530000	Or say this thing.
2530000	2531000	One word clearly said.
2531000	2532000	What is this doing?
2532000	2533000	This is so that you can know.
2533000	2534000	I think this may have to think about it later.
2534000	2535000	I think this may have to think about it later.
2535000	2536000	I think this may have to think about it later.
2536000	2537000	I think this may have to think about it later.
2537000	2538000	I wrote it down.
2538000	2539000	End of discussion.
2539000	2540000	We can write a difficulty index.
2540000	2542000	1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars.
2542000	2543000	Then every time.
2544000	2545000	That is, you know.
2545000	2546000	1 star is a textbook speech.
2546000	2547000	5 stars.
2547000	2548000	You may have to do academic discussion.
2548000	2549000	You may have to do academic discussion.
2549000	2551000	We can have one like this.
2551000	2552000	We can have one like this.
2552000	2553000	Logo.
2553000	2554000	What is the type.
2557000	2558000	OK.
2559000	2560000	That was Zhang Yan-yong.
2560000	2561000	That was Zhang Yan-yong.
2561000	2562000	I am not sure.
2562000	2563000	I am not sure.
2564000	2565000	There is no.
2565000	2566000	It's me.
2566000	2567000	But I was just...
2567000	2568000	But I was just...
2568000	2569000	Settings.
2569000	2570000	I finished.
2570000	2571000	I finished.
2571000	2572000	I finished.
2572000	2573000	And then...
2573000	2574000	Er...
2574000	2575000	So I think just now,
2577000	2579000	The summary of Zhang Yan-yong is good.
2579000	2581000	In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,
2581000	2584000	In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,
2584000	2587000	In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,
2587000	2589000	In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,
2589000	2590000	In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,
2590000	2592000	In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,
2592000	2593000	In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,
2623000	2624400	In this speech,
2624400	2625500	In this speech,
2625500	2627000	Because of, for example,
2627000	2627000	
2627000	2630000	Because of, for example,
2630000	2633000	Because of, for example,
2633000	2637000	Because of, for example,
2637000	2640000	Because of, for example,
2640000	2644000	Because of, for example,
2644000	2650000	Because of, for example,
2650000	2653000	Because of, for example,
2653000	2661000	Because of, for example,
2661000	2665000	Because of, for example,
2665000	2669000	Because of, for example,
2670000	2680000	Because of, for example,
2680000	2683000	Because of, for example,
2683000	2689000	Because of, for example,
2689000	2696000	Because of, for example,
2697000	2699000	A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.
2699000	2701000	A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.
2701000	2703000	A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.
2703000	2706000	The development of your career may be similar at that age.
2706000	2708000	The development of your career may be similar at that age.
2708000	2710000	That's probably what I am talking about.
2710000	2713000	Well that's the answer to your question.
2715000	2719000	Last time when I was looking for a job as a novice professor
2719000	2724000	I found that most of the professors are very active.
2724000	2727000	But I don't know if they are active when I am in a deeper speech.
2727000	2730000	But I don't know if they are active when I am in a deeper speech.
2730000	2732000	Or maybe they are not participating.
2733000	2735000	I found that they may have been doctors at that time.
2735000	2737000	I found that they may have been doctors at that time.
2737000	2740000	But they are now in the workplace.
2740000	2742000	Their contribution and their needs are different.
2742000	2745000	But we didn't follow them or update them.
2745000	2748000	But we didn't follow them or update them.
2748000	2750000	When we want to find a partner,
2750000	2754000	we can't find them.
2754000	2760000	Another thing I want to mention is the scope.
2760000	2762000	In public health,
2762000	2765000	there is a committee of North American public health scholars.
2765000	2767000	The committee is very detailed.
2767000	2771000	We have a group about health policy on Facebook.
2771000	2773000	We have a group about health policy on Facebook.
2773000	2779000	If the members are willing to work with other professional groups,
2779000	2782000	If the members are willing to work with other professional groups,
2782000	2787000	it will increase the scope of their work.
2787000	2791000	But now I heard that the speech is all about science and technology.
2791000	2793000	I participated in a few times.
2793000	2795000	I participated in a few times.
2795000	2797000	I really don't understand other things.
2797000	2799000	I really don't understand other things.
2829000	2831000	Who are you and what are you doing?
2831000	2833000	Who are you and what are you doing?
2833000	2835000	Who are you and what are you doing?
2835000	2840000	I don't think there is a way.
2840000	2844000	If your profession has a special organization
2844000	2846000	that has been established for a long time
2846000	2849000	and has developed into a good platform,
2849000	2852000	I don't think we need to recruit people like that.
2852000	2856000	I don't think we need to recruit people like that.
2856000	2860000	We can find a Taiwanese public service organization in North America
2860000	2862000	and hold a speech with them.
2862000	2864000	I think this is the best way to cooperate.
2868000	2872000	For public service scholars,
2872000	2874000	they can speak on our platform.
2874000	2878000	They can speak to non-public service people.
2878000	2879000	They can speak to non-public service people.
2879000	2882000	In this way, they may be able to reach people
2882000	2884000	they usually can't reach.
2885000	2889000	I think this is a way to cooperate.
2889000	2893000	I think I can only agree with this.
2893000	2895000	I just want to say
2895000	2901000	in our administrative experience,
2901000	2903000	in fact,
2903000	2907000	I know there is a Taiwanese Biological Society in Boston.
2907000	2909000	They are in South California now.
2909000	2911000	They are in San Diego.
2911000	2913000	Professional societies like this
2913000	2915000	have contacted us.
2915000	2917000	There are also other societies
2917000	2919000	that are similar to Taiwanese
2919000	2922000	in certain academic fields overseas.
2922000	2924000	Many of them have contacted us.
2924000	2928000	We do want to cooperate with them.
2928000	2931000	We are also very welcome
2931000	2933000	if there is a practical plan
2933000	2934000	to discuss with us
2934000	2937000	or if you are interested in joining the staff.
2937000	2939000	Because we don't have a lot of people.
2939000	2941000	This is also a problem.
2941000	2943000	Another problem is that
2943000	2945000	we are thinking about how to do it better.
2945000	2947000	If you have any opinion,
2947000	2948000	we are very welcome.
2948000	2950000	Obviously, everyone has this idea.
2950000	2951000	We also have this idea.
2951000	2953000	This is a good suggestion.
2953000	2955000	I don't know what you think.
2955000	2969000	Otherwise, we can go through the questions.
2969000	2974000	I have a small question.
2974000	2978000	Everyone,
2978000	2983000	for our actual system experience,
2984000	2988000	what I want to ask is
2988000	2990000	if you join the membership,
2990000	2993000	we will add you to the list of members.
2993000	2995000	All the members are on the list.
2995000	2997000	We will send out all the emails
2997000	2999000	using the mailing list.
2999000	3002000	Basically, everyone will receive all the messages.
3002000	3005000	I know that for many people,
3005000	3007000	this is not the best way.
3007000	3009000	Some people may only want to receive
3009000	3010000	the membership information.
3010000	3011000	They don't want to receive
3011000	3013000	a speech announcement every week.
3013000	3015000	Some people only want to receive
3015000	3016000	the speech announcement.
3016000	3018000	They don't want you to contact them
3018000	3020000	to update their rights.
3020000	3021000	Whatever.
3021000	3022000	I can accept it anyway.
3022000	3024000	I just want to know the speech information.
3024000	3027000	Some people only want to receive
3027000	3029000	the information like
3029000	3031000	where the job openings are,
3031000	3033000	or where people are competing.
3033000	3035000	This kind of information.
3035000	3040000	For this more detailed system operation,
3040000	3042000	I don't know how your experience is,
3042000	3047000	or what kind of changes you want to see,
3047000	3050000	or what kind of upgrades you want to see.
3050000	3052000	Do you have any opinions?
3052000	3055000	Or share your feelings.
3061000	3062000	Zhang Anping said,
3062000	3065000	you want to classify the mailing list
3065000	3067000	into several themes.
3067000	3069000	Is that what you mean?
3070000	3074000	This may be a way.
3074000	3076000	But how do you actually do it?
3076000	3078000	Does anyone have similar experience?
3078000	3080000	Or a better suggestion?
3080000	3082000	You can share.
3082000	3085000	I don't know how to do it backstage.
3085000	3088000	But I think the front desk part
3088000	3090000	seems to have a lot of websites
3090000	3091000	that say you go in
3091000	3093000	and there are several different themes
3093000	3096000	of newsletters you can book.
3096000	3097000	Then you tick what you want.
3097000	3098000	It's like this.
3098000	3101000	I think we have a little bit like this now.
3101000	3103000	Because the main list of staff
3103000	3105000	and the members are actually separate.
3105000	3106000	So for me,
3106000	3109000	there are already two options.
3109000	3110000	I can tick both.
3110000	3111000	That kind of feeling.
3111000	3115000	I don't know how to do it backstage.
3121000	3123000	Or you can divide it by frequency.
3123000	3124000	For example,
3124000	3125000	the type of work,
3125000	3128000	maybe several times a month.
3128000	3129000	Or the type of speech,
3129000	3131000	several times a month.
3131000	3133000	By frequency.
3139000	3140000	What you said is
3140000	3141000	a pretty interesting idea.
3141000	3143000	In fact, this idea is like
3143000	3146000	you subscribe to some main list.
3146000	3147000	Then you can say,
3147000	3148000	don't send it to me.
3148000	3150000	You help me monthly digest.
3150000	3151000	Then send it all to me.
3152000	3154000	Similar concept, right?
3154000	3156000	OK.
3156000	3157000	Let me write it down.
3165000	3166000	Are we talking about the same thing?
3166000	3167000	You go ahead.
3167000	3169000	Just now, Lin Gaoxian
3169000	3171000	left a comment in the chat.
3171000	3172000	He said,
3172000	3176000	is it possible to divide the members into areas?
3176000	3178000	Then each group has a person to gather.
3178000	3180000	Each person gathers to give a speech.
3180000	3182000	Each group may have
3182000	3185000	different areas at the same time.
3185000	3188000	It can consume a lot of speech demand.
3191000	3192000	This feels a bit like
3192000	3194000	the question just now.
3194000	3195000	That is to say,
3195000	3197000	we have to divide into different areas.
3197000	3199000	Then each create a group.
3204000	3205000	In fact,
3205000	3206000	this is what we have thought about
3206000	3208000	in the staff part.
3211000	3212000	There is a problem.
3214000	3215000	For example,
3215000	3216000	every week,
3216000	3217000	from carrying one speech
3217000	3218000	to carrying two speeches,
3218000	3221000	the number of staff we basically need
3221000	3224000	is to first order to multiply by 2.
3224000	3226000	But we don't have enough people.
3226000	3228000	This is a problem.
3229000	3230000	But
3230000	3232000	we have recruited new staff this year.
3232000	3234000	If new staff are interested
3234000	3237000	in this direction
3237000	3239000	to produce such a project,
3239000	3240000	we can try it.
3240000	3241000	I think we can try it.
3241000	3242000	I am optimistic.
3242000	3244000	There is nothing wrong with it.
3245000	3246000	The actual details may be
3246000	3247000	what the staff
3247000	3248000	might want to do
3248000	3250000	when arranging it.
3251000	3253000	This is a good suggestion.
3257000	3259000	I think most of the suggestions
3259000	3261000	are similar to this.
3262000	3264000	There is a guest
3265000	3266000	who said
3267000	3268000	there is a
3269000	3270000	e-news platform.
3270000	3271000	I clicked on it.
3271000	3272000	He said
3272000	3273000	MailChimp.
3273000	3274000	I know this.
3276000	3278000	It can help you make e-news.
3279000	3281000	You Zhen is our IT team.
3281000	3282000	She said
3282000	3284000	thank you for considering this platform.
3286000	3288000	Let me add something.
3288000	3290000	I actually quite like this platform.
3290000	3291000	But because
3291000	3293000	currently we
3293000	3295000	discussed it before.
3295000	3296000	We hope
3296000	3298000	the new staff
3298000	3299000	can
3300000	3301000	see the previous
3301000	3302000	work opportunities
3302000	3303000	or
3303000	3304000	the speech
3304000	3305000	announced this week
3305000	3307000	but it hasn't happened yet.
3307000	3308000	This kind of information.
3308000	3309000	Something like this.
3309000	3311000	You can look back.
3311000	3313000	That's why we want to use
3313000	3314000	Google Groups.
3314000	3315000	It can be like
3316000	3318000	you can see the website.
3318000	3319000	There is a website interface.
3320000	3321000	You can receive it
3321000	3322000	from e-mail.
3322000	3324000	That's why we consider this.
3325000	3326000	MailChimp
3326000	3328000	is an e-news platform.
3328000	3330000	So we can't do this.
3330000	3331000	This is the reason
3331000	3333000	we don't consider it.
3333000	3335000	But it is good management.
3337000	3338000	Thank you for your advice.
3347000	3349000	Does anyone have any questions
3349000	3350000	about logo?
3350000	3352000	Or does anyone want to...
3353000	3355000	Do we need a draft?
3355000	3357000	Pause.
3359000	3361000	Does anyone want to ask
3361000	3363000	where the Facebook logo came from?
3364000	3365000	Sorry.
3365000	3367000	This is my personal question.
3368000	3370000	You can explain.
3371000	3372000	When I
3373000	3374000	created it 2 years ago,
3374000	3375000	I thought
3375000	3376000	there is no logo now.
3376000	3378000	I should put my son's photo.
3381000	3382000	To protect his
3382000	3383000	portrait rights,
3383000	3385000	I didn't put my son's photo.
3388000	3389000	It's okay.
3389000	3391000	What do you think
3391000	3393000	about logo?
3397000	3398000	I think
3398000	3399000	we should
3399000	3400000	see
3400000	3401000	if there is
3401000	3402000	a person who is good at
3402000	3403000	art.
3403000	3404000	If there is,
3404000	3406000	we can create our logo.
3410000	3411000	I don't think
3411000	3412000	there is
3412000	3413000	any
3413000	3414000	opinion.
3414000	3415000	I don't think
3415000	3416000	there is much opinion.
3436000	3437000	Okay.
3437000	3438000	Does anyone
3438000	3439000	have any
3439000	3440000	questions?
3440000	3441000	If you don't,
3441000	3442000	let's move on
3442000	3443000	to the next part.
3460000	3461000	Okay.
3463000	3464000	Let's
3465000	3466000	stop
3466000	3467000	the Q&A
3467000	3468000	part.
3469000	3470000	Okay?
3475000	3476000	Next,
3476000	3477000	let's talk about
3478000	3479000	Project Hira.
3479000	3480000	We hope
3480000	3481000	there will be
3481000	3482000	new people
3482000	3483000	joining us
3483000	3484000	next year.
3485000	3486000	Next,
3486000	3487000	let's move on
3487000	3488000	to the recruitment.
3491000	3492000	Okay.
3492000	3493000	Basically,
3494000	3495000	we hope
3495000	3496000	we can
3496000	3497000	find
3497000	3498000	some
3498000	3499000	new people
3499000	3500000	to recruit.
3500000	3501000	We hope
3501000	3502000	we can
3502000	3503000	find
3503000	3504000	some people
3504000	3505000	from
3505000	3506000	the past
3506000	3507000	to join us.
3507000	3508000	We hope
3508000	3509000	we can
3509000	3510000	find
3510000	3511000	more people
3511000	3512000	to join us.
3512000	3513000	Next,
3513000	3514000	let's move on
3514000	3515000	to the
3515000	3516000	hiring.
3516000	3517000	We hope
3517000	3518000	we can
3518000	3519000	find
3519000	3520000	more people
3520000	3521000	to join us.
3521000	3522000	We also
3522000	3523000	hope
3523000	3524000	we can
3524000	3525000	find
3525000	3526000	more people
3526000	3527000	to join us.
3527000	3528000	We also
3528000	3529000	hope
3529000	3530000	we can
3530000	3531000	find
3531000	3532000	more people
3532000	3533000	to join us.
3533000	3534000	Next,
3534000	3535000	we have
3535000	3536000	the
3536000	3537000	HR.

3538000	3539000	have
3539000	3540000	a

3559000	3560000	We

3607000	3610000	thing
3610000	3613000	is
3613000	3616000	to

3619000	3621000	the form.

3623000	3625000	when we

3659000	3660000	we have
