1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Recording has started.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In fact, he was originally a law student at NTU Law School.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He had studied in the Department of Law at Hokkaido University in Japan for a year.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Not only did he complete his law degree, he also obtained a lawyer's license.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He also worked at a large law firm in Taiwan and Japan.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
To add to that, Ming-Hsi and I have known each other for a long time.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We were classmates in the same year at NTU Law School.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In our hearts, Ming-Hsi has always been a strong character like a god.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We thought it was difficult for him to study law.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We didn't expect him to be able to study history.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Not only that, he is also the president of NTU's Food & Beverage Association.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
To us, he has always been a very strong god.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He also won countless books.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think it's very impressive.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's cool about Ming-Hsi is that he always follows a two-way path.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He studies both law and history at the same time.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
At the moment, he is in the Department of History at NTU Law School.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He also combined his two-way background with his major.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
His field of research includes modern international law history,

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
East Asian legal modernization,

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Sino-US relations history,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
international economic law and tax law, and so on.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was thinking about today's topic, foreign law.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
For many people, foreign law is a familiar and uncertain concept.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So let's talk about the rules of today's speech.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Today's speech is actually quite simple.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you have any questions,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you can either turn on your microphone and ask the speaker directly.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ming-Hsi likes this kind of interactive speech mode.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Or if you are shy or worried about affecting the speaker's flow,

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you can also post your questions in the chat area.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I will find the right time to ask.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
After Ming-Hsi finishes his speech,

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
we will also have a Q&A session.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If everyone is okay,

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
let's welcome Ming-Hsi.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello, everyone.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Can you see my PowerPoint?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you for your introduction.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
As Yi-An said,

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
we are both university classmates.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But in the legal department of NTU,

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think Yi-An and I are quite different.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yi-An left the legal department to study psychology

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and became a lawyer.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am honored to have Yi-An as my host.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Today's topic is

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
controlling US citizens in China.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is my research plan for the first-year students

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
in the history department of NTU.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This plan is still in the early stages,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
so I would like to share it with you.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I found that in this project,

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
there are fewer liberal arts students.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So I will spend a little more time

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to introduce to you

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the current situation of humanities

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and legal studies in the US.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So today's speech will be divided into several parts.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
One is self-introduction.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I don't think I need to introduce too much,

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
because Yi-An has given me a very detailed explanation.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The second part is to share with you

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
what history is.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is actually a common question for everyone.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I am often asked by teachers

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
in different departments or classmates.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because history is abstract.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We can say that what happened in the past is history.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There are so many things in history.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As a historian or a doctoral student in history,

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
how do we choose the topic?

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How do we do research?

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In other words, what are the doctoral students

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
in the history department doing?

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why do I want to study legal history?

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is the relationship between law and history?

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In particular, why do I want to choose the topic

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
of international law as my research topic?

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
After the introduction of these major subjects

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and the background,

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will talk about my initial research in the first year.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That is, what is the foreign law in the United States?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In the past, in high school textbooks,

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
we often heard that foreign law

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is a part of an unequal treaty.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
In the past, our country or China

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
suffered a lot of unequal treatment.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then it was a matter of losing power.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is it true? Is it true?

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Did the United States benefit from this?

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Who benefited from this?

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The first research in the history department

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
is to clarify some facts and some institutional backgrounds.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The higher level is to develop theories.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So in the end, I want to talk about my future plan.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How do I develop these facts and their theoretical meanings

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and then carry out my future research?

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So here, actually,

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yi-An has already introduced it to me.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not drunk.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to talk about the last point.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That is, why do I want to study history?

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
In fact, my initial goal was

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
to teach in a law school in the United States.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Here, I think there is something very interesting

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that I can share with you.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
In the United States, professional schools,

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
such as law schools,

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
their practice is very different from

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
what we usually do in history, physics, or math.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
As a historian, I will tell you

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
what the origin and evolution of this system is.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As you know,

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
in the world of legal education,

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
North America is very special.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
They do not have legal education in the university.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Unlike in Taiwan, Japan, Germany,

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the United Kingdom, or France,

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
we can choose the law department

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
after graduating from high school.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
After graduating from the law department,

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you can take a law exam.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then you can become a lawyer

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
or continue to study for a master's degree

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and return to the law department to teach.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is not the case in the United States and Canada.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The U.S. Department of State does not have a law department.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You have to graduate from the Department of State

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
before you can get your first law degree,

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
which is called JD, or Juris Doctor.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's the same as MD.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It has the title of a doctor,

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but it's not a Ph.D. doctor.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So traditionally,

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
when there was a law school in the United States,

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
they thought that

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
law was a skill,

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
not a subject.

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So in the 19th century,

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the teachers of the law school

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
were some senior lawyers,

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
judges, or food workers.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And the education of the law school

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
was to have these food workers

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
tell you how to become a good lawyer.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So the course of the law school

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
was very food-oriented.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It taught you how to sign a contract,

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
how to act or defend in front of the jury,

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
how to interact and interrogate,

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
how to get along with the judge,

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and so on and so forth.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Later, everyone thought

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
that if you teach at school,

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you still need to have a little bit of academic knowledge.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But there was no such thing as a law Ph.D.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So what should you do?

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There is still a method

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
taught at law schools in the United States

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
called traditional track,

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
which allows you to become a teacher of the law school.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What is traditional track?

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's when you graduate from college

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and become a JD,

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
your first law degree.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
After that,

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you become a lawyer for three years

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
or a judge assistant for three years

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
to gain food experience.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
After gaining food experience,

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you go to the law department of the university

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to apply for the position of teacher.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
When you're a teacher,

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
it's usually three years.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You have to teach on the side.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What you teach is to teach some legal writing,

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
mathematical writing, and so on.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
These are related to food.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
During the three years you teach,

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you have to write a master's thesis.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If this master's thesis is well written,

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you can go to various schools

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and apply for the position of assistant professor.

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Once you become an assistant professor,

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
you'll be like other departments.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You'll start writing thesis,

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
升等,教書, and so on.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But later,

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
in the 1970s or 1980s,

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
we found that

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the failure of being a fellow

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and not becoming an assistant professor

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
is very high.

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This can also be seen.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In JD for three years,

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you're learning how to write a book,

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and then you become a lawyer for three years.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It doesn't make sense.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When you go back to law school,

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you suddenly start writing a thesis.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Like everyone here,

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
we all study Ph.D.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We all know that

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
writing a thesis requires a lot of practice,

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and then you need someone to lead.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You need a lot of research methods, and so on.

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So later, the U.S. Law School

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
came up with a new way

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to make you a teacher,

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
which is the so-called JD Ph.D. double degree.

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
In other words,

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you get a Ph.D. in another field,

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
such as history, economics,

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
politics, language,

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
psychology, and so on.

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then you go to JD,

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and then you become a lawyer for two years.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
At this point, you don't have to be a fellow,

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and you can take your Ph.D. thesis

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Basically,

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
all the new professors at the U.S. Law School

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
are JD Ph.D. double degrees.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is my original goal.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to get a Ph.D. in history first,

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and then I want to get a Ph.D. in JD.

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Then I can apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There are more and more Chinese people

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
applying for a Ph.D. degree

232
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
at the U.S. Law School

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
through this kind of double degree.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But as far as I know,

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
no one in Taiwan

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
has applied for a Ph.D. degree

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
at the U.S. Law School in this way.

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So I want to give it a try.

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Next,

240
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
in the past,

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
most of the Ph.D. and JD degrees

242
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
were obtained at different schools.

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
For example,

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Professor Ian Ayers,

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
who is very famous for

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
doing legal economic analysis

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
at Yale University.

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He was MIT's Econ Ph.D.,

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
plus Yale's JD,

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and then he taught at Yale.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For people in mainland China,

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
for example,

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Professor Li Ji at UC Irvine,

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
he was a political science Ph.D.

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
at Northwestern University,

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
plus Yale's JD,

257
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and then he taught law at UC Irvine.

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So this is what I want to challenge.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I want to practice and hone my knowledge

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
in the history department,

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
learn the methods of history,

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and write papers.

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Later on,

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
in the last stage of my Ph.D. program,

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in the 6th, 7th, or 8th year,

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I applied for a Ph.D. degree

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
at another school.

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I was a lawyer in the U.S. for two years,

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and then I taught at a law school.

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is a brief explanation

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
of why I want to

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
apply for a Ph.D. degree in history.

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
On the one hand,

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I always have this idea of cross-field.

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think this kind of training and environment in the U.S.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
is the best fit for my research.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The last thing I want to add is that

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I just said that

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Taiwanese have not yet read Ph.D. and JD,

280
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
right?

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The next question must be

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that in Taiwan's law department,

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
there are many legal scholars

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
who claim to have obtained a Ph.D. degree in the U.S.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What kind of degree did they read?

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What kind of career path did they embark on?

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Since they are different from Americans

288
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
who cultivate law schools,

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
they must have a different set of things, right?

290
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So I wrote LLM and JSD here later.

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Here I would like to explain to you

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
what this is.

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
LLM is generally translated as

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
a legal master's degree.

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It is a Latin abbreviation.

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It means that

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
if you are not in the U.S. today,

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
for example, the U.K., France,

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Taiwan, or Japan,

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you have already studied law in college.

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So it is an abbreviation

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
for a legal master's degree

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
for foreigners.

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is called LLM.

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You only need to study for nine months

306
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
without writing a paper.

307
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Then you can be qualified

308
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
to be a lawyer in New York.

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So in most cases,

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in general, in Taiwan or Japan,

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
if you have been a lawyer for three or five years

312
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and you think you need to retire,

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you can go to the U.S.

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and study for nine months.

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Among these LLM students,

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
some may be interested in academics.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So you can find a professor

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
who is willing to teach you

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
while you are studying LLM.

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Then you can enroll

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and become a JSD,

322
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
which we generally call

323
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
a legal master's degree.

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This JSD is actually very different

325
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
from our general Ph.D.

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Because once you enroll,

327
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you are a doctoral candidate.

328
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So you don't need to take classes,

329
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you don't need to be a teacher,

330
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you don't need to be a lecturer.

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
In principle, if you write a paper,

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you can graduate after the exam.

333
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So there are some very famous

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
LLM teachers in China.

335
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They may only study JSD for a year and a half

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
or two years

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
before they graduate.

338
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There are a lot of people like this.

339
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because JSD is not like

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
our Ph.D. training,

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you have to take classes,

342
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
take exams,

343
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
be a lecturer,

344
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
teach, and so on.

345
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So the problem with a JSD graduate

346
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
is that

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
their quality is not very certain.

348
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Some people are JSD,

349
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
their boss has very high requirements for them,

350
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
asking them to continue to take classes,

351
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
continue to study methods,

352
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
or take the qualification exam with them.

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Or some students are very smart.

354
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I have a lot of JSD teachers

355
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
in the Department of Law in Canada.

356
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They are very smart.

357
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They watch the lecturers

358
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
have a seminar in the law school every day,

359
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and they will kill each other.

360
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
They watch Huashan's paper every day

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and become a big family.

362
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
After they return to China,

363
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
they can be a Ph.D.

364
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and teach law in Taiwan.

365
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But in the US Department of Law,

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you can hardly see any teachers

367
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
who are JSD.

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Because they are

369
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Ph.D. for foreigners.

370
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is a brief introduction.

371
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I used to think that

372
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
if I went to the US to study law,

373
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I could just study LLM and JSD.

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But I thought,

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
no,

376
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I want to try to

377
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
receive the same training as Americans.

378
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If Americans want to become a professor of law,

379
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I will become a professor of law.

380
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So I started with Ph.D.

381
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Later,

382
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in my senior year,

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I will see if I can get a J.D.

384
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and try to find a job

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
in the US Department of Law.

386
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Next, I will answer a question.

387
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What is history?

388
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I am often asked this question.

389
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I think this is a disaster question.

390
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's like I want to ask,

391
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
what is physics?

392
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What is math?

393
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It is difficult to define a subject.

394
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But I think I can try

395
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to look at this subject

396
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
from a more specific perspective.

397
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What is it?

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think from the perspective of abstract theory,

399
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
in the Western context,

400
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
history is also a method of philosophy.

401
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In other words,

402
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the research we do in history

403
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
is the same as asking a question,

404
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
giving it a false hypothesis,

405
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and then verifying it, right?

406
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It is the same as philosophy, physics, and chemistry.

407
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We need to ask a question,

408
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and then use some methods to answer it,

409
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
to verify if your hypothesis is correct.

410
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Of course, this is a bit of nonsense.

411
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Because anyone who studies Ph.D.

412
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
has to do this kind of study.

413
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So I think we can look at history

414
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
from a different perspective.

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Whether it is Greece or China,

416
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
people in ancient times

417
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
have a cycle of history.

418
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
By cycle of history,

419
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I mean that

420
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
for them,

421
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
history is something that

422
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
happens over and over again.

423
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
For example,

424
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
in the Tang Dynasty,

425
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Emperor Taizong said that

426
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
history is the key to understanding the mind.

427
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In other words,

428
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
as long as you study the past,

429
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you will learn some lessons.

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
By cycle of history,

431
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I mean that

432
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
there is nothing new under the sun.

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So I understand the past,

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and I understand the future.

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Because what happened in the past

436
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
will keep happening over and over again.

437
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So as long as I know the past,

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I will know how to face the same thing in the future.

439
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What should I do when it happens again?

440
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But as we all know,

441
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
this is a kind of fantasy.

442
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
How is it possible that

443
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
people 200 years ago

444
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
would face the same problems

445
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
as we do now?

446
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course, it is different.

447
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
In the 18th and 19th centuries,

448
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
history was taken over by the state.

449
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There was a very

450
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
purposeful approach

451
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
to help

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
build a democratic country.

453
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
For example,

454
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
when Germany was about to be unified,

455
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
a group of historians came out

456
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and wrote history of Germany.

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They told us that we were different

458
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
from the Italians.

459
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We have a glorious history.

460
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Who is German?

461
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We have a common memory.

462
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This also happened

463
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
in the end of the Qing Dynasty

464
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and the beginning of the Republic of China.

465
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Chinese historians told you

466
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
that we are all descendants of the Yan Emperor.

467
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So we have a common ancestor.

468
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We must agree that we are all Chinese.

469
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So for a while,

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
history was used by the state

471
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
to build the common memory of the nation.

472
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
In the 19th century,

473
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
there was another trend.

474
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Social science,

475
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
political science,

476
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and other social sciences

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
wanted to become

478
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
like natural science

479
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and discover the common principles

480
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
of human society.

481
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
They wanted to analyze

482
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
why the French Revolution happened,

483
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
what its causal relationship was,

484
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and what its social background conditions were.

485
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If we can build

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
a abstract theory

487
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that the French Revolution

488
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
will happen

489
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
when the four conditions

490
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
are met,

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
we can predict

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
when the next revolution will happen

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
or prevent it from happening.

494
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Another famous example

495
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
is Marx.

496
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He said that human history

497
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
has a process.

498
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We will go from feudalism

499
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
to a small class revolution

500
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to a large class revolution.

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Many historians' work

502
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
is to prove

503
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
the theory of social science

504
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and the process

505
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
of social science principles.

506
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Until now,

507
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
many historians in mainland China

508
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
are still trying to prove

509
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the process of Marxism

510
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
in China.

511
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is the purpose

512
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
of the third kind of history.

513
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The fourth kind of history

514
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
is similar to the second kind of history,

515
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
but it starts to ask smaller questions.

516
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Historians want to

517
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
understand the history of the past

518
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and develop quantitative studies

519
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
of economics or politics.

520
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The most famous example

521
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
is Professor Daniel Clerman

522
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
at the University of South Carolina.

523
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
He taught at the University of Chicago

524
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
because his wife was a lawyer

525
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
who was afraid of the cold.

526
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
His family moved to South Carolina.

527
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He is a history doctor

528
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and a law professor

529
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
at the University of Chicago.

530
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
His research is very interesting.

531
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He uses the documents

532
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and information

533
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
he discovered

534
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
in history training

535
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and his strong

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
statistical and quantitative background

537
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
to do some

538
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
theoretical practical research.

539
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Some questions

540
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
are difficult to answer.

541
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Does judicial independence

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
help economic development?

543
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We are not like natural science,

544
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
which can control all variables

545
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
in the laboratory.

546
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
When we want to study this topic,

547
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
we have to do some social experiment

548
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to do the cause-and-effect theory,

549
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and we need to find

550
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
a lot of agent variables.

551
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Every time a country

552
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
does judicial independence reform,

553
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
it often follows

554
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
many other reforms at the same time.

555
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This is the best way

556
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
to understand the relationship

557
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
between judicial independence

558
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and economic development in the UK.

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Professor Dan Clearman

560
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
has some very good information.

561
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
For example,

562
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
he found that

563
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
in the 18th and 19th centuries,

564
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the UK was doing judicial independence reform.

565
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
At the same time,

566
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
East India Company

567
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
was listed

568
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
in London Stock Exchange

569
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
because

570
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
there was no

571
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
good information transmission system.

572
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Therefore, news from London

573
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
had to wait three or five days

574
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
before it could be sent to Amsterdam.

575
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
He thought

576
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
that the agent variables

577
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
of economic development

578
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
were the high and low prices

579
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
of East India Company's shares.

580
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Whenever a judicial independence

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
law or reform

582
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
occurred in the UK,

583
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
East India Company's shares

584
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
would rise or fall

585
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
when the news

586
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
was sent to Amsterdam.

587
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He used statistics

588
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to infer the situation in the UK.

589
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In the end,

590
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
he concluded that

591
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
every judicial independence reform

592
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
in the UK

593
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
had something to do

594
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
with the rise of

595
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
East India Company's shares.

596
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Without historical training,

597
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
East India Company's shares

598
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
would not have risen.

599
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This is another theory.

600
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
In the early years,

601
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
there was a theory

602
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that asked

603
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
why there was

604
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
no China in the West.

605
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In the early years,

606
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
historians liked to ask

607
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
why there was no capitalism in China,

608
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
why there was no scientific revolution in China,

609
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and why there was no

610
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
revolution in China.

611
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The next theory is

612
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
very popular recently,

613
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
but it is a bit similar

614
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
to the idea of a national state.

615
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Historians believe that

616
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the people's historical memory

617
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
should not serve the country.

618
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Therefore,

619
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
historians began to write

620
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
some important historical memories.

621
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
For example,

622
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
transitional justice should tell you

623
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that the Nazi massacre

624
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
against the Jews

625
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
was really horrible.

626
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We should remember this

627
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
forever.

628
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Because it happened once,

629
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
it may happen again.

630
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The main consciousness of Taiwan

631
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
must be awakened,

632
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
because the people of Taiwan

633
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
have been oppressed for the past 400 years.

634
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
These popular historical writings

635
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
are actually shaping historical memory.

636
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Another group of people

637
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
believe that

638
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
history should not serve the country,

639
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
so there are a lot of historical studies

640
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
to deconstruct the national state.

641
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
For example,

642
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
tradition is invented,

643
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and tradition does not have

644
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
a long history of 5,000 years.

645
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The so-called descendants of the King of Japan

646
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
only appeared for 100 years.

647
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The so-called Japanese cuisine

648
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
was invented after the Ming Dynasty.

649
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
In the Middle Ages,

650
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
the Emperor of Japan believed in Buddhism,

651
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
so he told everyone not to eat meat.

652
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
In ancient East Asia,

653
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
there were four categories of animals

654
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
in the world,

655
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
such as grass fish and birds.

656
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
At that time,

657
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the Emperor of Japan said

658
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that everyone was not allowed to eat meat,

659
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
grass fish and birds.

660
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
In fact,

661
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
before the Ming Dynasty,

662
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the Japanese did not eat beef or pork,

663
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
so the so-called barbecue and fried pork chops

664
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
were far-fetched Japanese cuisine.

665
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
They appeared in the late 19th century

666
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and even in the early 20th century.

667
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Finally, I think history

668
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
is different from everyone else.

669
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
In politics and sociology,

670
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
they ask more objective questions,

671
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
but in history,

672
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
they also ask subjective questions.

673
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Traditional sociology

674
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
may ask a question,

675
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
such as

676
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
whether the exam system

677
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
has promoted social movement.

678
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So some historical sociologists

679
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
will look for a lot of past history

680
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
to see if there are some

681
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
poor and hard-working people

682
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
who became good officials

683
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
because of the imperial examination,

684
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and then flew to Tengda

685
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and became famous

686
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
from the Han dynasty.

687
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But historical sociology

688
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
will ask a question.

689
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Objectively,

690
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
even if the imperial examination

691
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
really promoted social movement,

692
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
did the people at that time

693
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
really realize that

694
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
the imperial examination

695
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
promoted social movement?

696
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
In the Han dynasty,

697
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
there were some economic works.

698
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We can find out from economics

699
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
what is the meaning of

700
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Chou Chou's The Theory of Economics?

701
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What does it mean in economics?

702
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But historians may ask

703
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
a person who has not studied

704
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
modern economics,

705
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
has not studied Adam Smith,

706
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
or has not studied economics

707
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
in NTU,

708
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
how can he write The Theory of Economics?

709
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I think this is the difference

710
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
between historical sociology

711
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and other subjects.

712
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The next question is

713
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
what is legal history?

714
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Why is legal history

715
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
a field worth studying

716
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
for me?

717
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The first argument is,

718
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
of course,

719
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
all the legal experts in the court

720
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
are historians,

721
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
because the court can only

722
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
judge what has happened.

723
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I am going to discuss

724
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
whether Su Jianhe killed someone

725
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
in the past or not.

726
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Is he guilty or not?

727
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We can only discuss

728
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
whether he killed someone in the past.

729
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The court cannot decide

730
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
whether he will kill someone in the future.

731
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This is a matter of fact.

732
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The court can only deal with

733
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
what has happened.

734
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
From the legal point of view,

735
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
when we make a judgment,

736
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
the court will always

737
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
make a judgment.

738
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
In the tradition of British and American law,

739
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
there are many cases

740
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that are not in the text,

741
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
so you have to tell everyone

742
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
whether the case in front of you

743
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
is the same as the case in the past.

744
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
If it is the same,

745
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you should apply the same law.

746
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
If it is different,

747
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
you should make another explanation.

748
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
There are some famous cases

749
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
where, for example,

750
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
a court said that

751
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
A car must pay

752
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
$10,000.

753
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Later,

754
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
a new case came out

755
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
where

756
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
A was hit by B car.

757
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Then

758
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
A told the court

759
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that the driver of B car

760
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
should pay me $10,000.

761
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But the lawyer of B car said

762
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
no, no, no,

763
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
our case is different from A car.

764
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because A car is black

765
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and B car is red.

766
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Because humans are more alert

767
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
when they see a red car.

768
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So

769
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
when they are hit,

770
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
they have to take more responsibility

771
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
because they see a red car.

772
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
British and American law

773
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
has been debating this kind of thing,

774
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
so you have to keep looking at

775
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
the past cases

776
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
as they are now.

777
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Then you need a lot of

778
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
historical training

779
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The second thing is that

780
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
there is a saying in English

781
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
that the past is like a foreign country.

782
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So when we study

783
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the history of law,

784
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
it's like we are studying

785
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
another country.

786
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So it's like we are now in Taiwan,

787
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
we are going to legislate.

788
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We will refer to what the Japanese do,

789
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
what the Germans do,

790
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
what the Americans do.

791
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Because these comparisons

792
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
can give you some ideas.

793
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But if you refer to other countries,

794
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
you will be surprised.

795
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because from a psychological point of view,

796
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
people all have this

797
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
in-domain effect.

798
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's not good to play big

799
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
in front of the case.

800
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But you will think

801
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
what you have is the best.

802
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But sometimes when you look at

803
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
foreign things,

804
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
you will know that

805
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
there are many different ways

806
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
in this world.

807
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
For example, if I want to control

808
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
cigarettes,

809
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
can I refer to

810
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
how people controlled

811
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
opium in the past?

812
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Of course, opium and cigarettes

813
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
are different things.

814
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But you can think about

815
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
some new ideas.

816
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The second thing is that

817
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
we all know that

818
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
humans have a path to rely on.

819
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There is one thing that people

820
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
have been doing for a long time,

821
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and the legal history

822
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
can help you understand

823
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the background of this system

824
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and its reasons.

825
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What did people think at that time?

826
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
After understanding the reason for

827
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
the path to rely on,

828
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
we should now verify that

829
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
this condition no longer exists

830
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
or the condition has changed,

831
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
which means that

832
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we should do something different.

833
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
For example,

834
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
in the debate on same-sex marriage,

835
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
it is said that two people

836
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
of the same sex can get married.

837
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If not, why?

838
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If there is, why?

839
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Has it really changed now?

840
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Another common legal history

841
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
is the debate on

842
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the structure of mainstream.

843
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
For example, we used to think

844
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
that Hitler's Nazi was terrible

845
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because he killed Jews.

846
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
He set up a prison court

847
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and let the judge judge

848
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
that homosexuals and Jews

849
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
are inferior species

850
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and are not suitable for having children.

851
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
On the other hand,

852
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
the United States

853
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is a free and democratic defender.

854
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Through World War II,

855
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
the United States

856
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
liberated

857
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
these oppressed people.

858
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
James Whitman,

859
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
a professor at Yale University,

860
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is also a doctor of history.

861
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
He wrote a book

862
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
called Hitler's American Model.

863
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He said that

864
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Hitler's

865
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
racial discrimination law

866
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
was widely referred to

867
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
in the United States

868
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
as the law of racial discrimination

869
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
that oppresses black people.

870
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In fact, Hitler once said

871
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
that Americans were too fierce to black people.

872
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We can't be so fierce.

873
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So, how did Hitler

874
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
know how to use the law

875
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
to oppress minorities?

876
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It came from the United States.

877
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
This is what I am doing now.

878
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I am using the third world approach

879
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
to look at the international law.

880
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
In the past,

881
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
we thought that the international law

882
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
was a principle of equal interaction

883
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
between sovereign states.

884
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But in fact, it was not.

885
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We know that the international law

886
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
was once used to oppress

887
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and to colonize.

888
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The Third World Approach

889
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
to International Law

890
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
has a group of scholars.

891
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Their goal is to tell you

892
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
how the international law

893
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
from the European international law

894
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to the international law of the world

895
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
has contributed a lot to China,

896
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Japan, Latin America, etc.

897
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
They want to tell you

898
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that the international law

899
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is a tool of oppression.

900
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We should not allow the international law

901
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
to become a tool of oppression again.

902
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
We must preserve these historical memories.

903
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This is what I think

904
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
the legal history is doing.

905
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Before I share my research,

906
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I would like to know

907
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
if you have any questions.

908
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I can answer first.

909
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I would like to know

910
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
what is the general history

911
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and what is the legal history.

912
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I think I have learned a lot.

913
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Even if I am a lawyer,

914
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think I have learned a lot.

915
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Should I continue?

916
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It seems that

917
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
everyone is still digesting.

918
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The information is a bit large.

919
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I will try to speak in plain language.

920
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I don't know if

921
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
everyone can understand.

922
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I think I have made it clear.

923
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I have heard a lot of concepts

924
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
for the first time.

925
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I am not sure

926
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
but you have made it clear today.

927
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The language is very good.

928
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I think it has helped me

929
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
to digest so much information.

930
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Can you hear me?

931
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yes.

932
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I have a question.

933
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I am curious

934
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
about the background

935
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you set up

936
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
in the beginning.

937
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What is history?

938
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The front part

939
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and the back part

940
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
are there any differences in views?

941
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
If so,

942
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
what do you think?

943
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Today's speech

944
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
is mainly to

945
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
deconstruct nationalism.

946
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
In the past, foreign law

947
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
was described as

948
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
a symbol of

949
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a third world people,

950
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Chinese, Japanese,

951
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
or non-Western people

952
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
being oppressed.

953
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But I will tell you

954
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that the actual operation

955
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
of this theory

956
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
is based on two things.

957
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The first is that

958
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I want to improve

959
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the meaning of the theory.

960
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
In the future,

961
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I may want to

962
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
use other methods

963
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
of political,

964
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
economic,

965
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and socialization

966
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
to make it more abstract

967
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and more applicable.

968
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I also hope you can

969
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
give me some advice.

970
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Many people

971
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
are not familiar with

972
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
law and history,

973
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
so I hope I can

974
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
give you a brief introduction

975
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
of what I am doing in this field.

976
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I also want to

977
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
take this opportunity

978
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
to let you know

979
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
what is the purpose

980
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
of the American Academy of Law

981
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and what is the purpose

982
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
of the American Academy of Law.

983
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Did I answer your question?

984
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yes, you did.

985
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Thank you.

986
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
If not,

987
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
please continue.

988
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Thank you.

989
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I think the training

990
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
from Northwestern University

991
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
is very interesting.

992
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Foreign students

993
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
have to take a class

994
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
in English.

995
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
The teacher will teach us

996
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
some tips.

997
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
When you don't know what to say,

998
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
just take a sip of water.

999
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
No one will ask you

1000
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
why you are drinking water.

1001
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Sometimes,

1002
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
you can relax

1003
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and think about

1004
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
what you want to say.

1005
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Let's move on

1006
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
to the topic of

1007
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
extracurricular law.

1008
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Extracurricular law,

1009
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
at least for me,

1010
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
is a term

1011
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
but we don't know

1012
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
what actually happens

1013
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
to it.

1014
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
To put it simply,

1015
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
extracurricular law

1016
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
is the privilege that

1017
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
foreigners are not

1018
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
under the jurisdiction

1019
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
of the local courts.

1020
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
In other words,

1021
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
in 1900,

1022
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
if an American

1023
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
stole or committed a crime

1024
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
in China

1025
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
or any other country

1026
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
wanted to sue him,

1027
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
the Chinese government

1028
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and the Chinese courts

1029
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
couldn't do anything

1030
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
because he was under the jurisdiction

1031
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
of the local courts.

1032
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Only the U.S. courts

1033
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
or the U.S. courts

1034
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
can deal with such cases.

1035
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This is extracurricular law.

1036
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Extracurricular law still exists

1037
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
in some countries.

1038
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
For example,

1039
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
if an American

1040
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
raped a woman

1041
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
or a child

1042
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
in a local court,

1043
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the Japanese courts

1044
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
couldn't bring him to trial

1045
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
because he was under the jurisdiction

1046
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
of the U.S. courts.

1047
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's not that the U.S. courts

1048
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
couldn't bring him to trial,

1049
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but the U.S. courts.

1050
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It sounds unreasonable.

1051
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Let's move on.

1052
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The first time that

1053
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the U.S. signed a treaty

1054
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
was in 1842,

1055
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
the Treaty of Nanjing,

1056
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
China signed a treaty

1057
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
after the Opium War.

1058
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
In this treaty,

1059
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
the U.K. required

1060
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
China to provide

1061
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
extracurricular law to the U.K.

1062
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The U.S. signed the treaty

1063
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
in 1844,

1064
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the Treaty of Wangxia,

1065
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
China.

1066
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
In Chinese textbooks,

1067
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
extracurricular law

1068
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
is a symbol of

1069
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
imperialism.

1070
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Today, our country's citizens

1071
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
are being bullied.

1072
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Why doesn't our country

1073
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
promote justice?

1074
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Why does the U.S. court

1075
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
have to bring him to trial?

1076
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
The U.S. court

1077
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
must be very biased.

1078
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
The U.S. court

1079
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
must tolerate

1080
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the U.S. people

1081
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
because the U.S. people

1082
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
betrayed the sovereignty

1083
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
of China.

1084
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The U.S. court must

1085
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
revolutionize the U.S.

1086
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The U.S. court

1087
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
must abolish extracurricular law

1088
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
so that the Chinese people

1089
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
will no longer be bullied.

1090
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Is it really like this?

1091
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Let's move on.

1092
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
For example,

1093
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
when the U.S. came to China

1094
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
to negotiate the Treaty of Wangxia,

1095
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the U.S. diplomat,

1096
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
William Cushing,

1097
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
gave a speech

1098
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
in the U.S. Congress.

1099
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
He said,

1100
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
his proudest moment

1101
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
was when the U.S. wrote

1102
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
the extracurricular law

1103
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
in the Treaty of Wangxia.

1104
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Because China

1105
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
is an uncivilized place.

1106
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The judges in their countries

1107
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
do not have three powers.

1108
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The county magistrates

1109
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
do not have three powers.

1110
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
How can the county magistrates

1111
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
be the judges?

1112
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
In Taiwan,

1113
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
can He Wen-je be a judge?

1114
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No.

1115
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Administrative and judicial

1116
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
should be separated.

1117
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
China is an uncivilized country.

1118
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
If you commit a serious crime,

1119
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
you will be imprisoned,

1120
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
you will be tortured,

1121
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
you will be beaten.

1122
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
If our people

1123
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
are the most advanced species,

1124
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
how can we obey the laws of the barbarians?

1125
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Therefore,

1126
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
obtaining the extracurricular law

1127
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
is a civilized victory.

1128
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It sounds like a good idea.

1129
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
However,

1130
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
historians have found

1131
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
that before 1868,

1132
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
we could not find

1133
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
any Chinese history

1134
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
against the extracurricular law.

1135
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
This is actually

1136
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
a very strange thing.

1137
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
If China is so powerful,

1138
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
why does China never object

1139
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to all the negotiations?

1140
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
China thinks it is good.

1141
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Why?

1142
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
If you want to extracurricular law,

1143
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
we will give it to you.

1144
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This question

1145
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is related to a very popular research topic

1146
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
in recent history,

1147
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
which is the multidimensionalism

1148
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
of the empire and the law.

1149
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
In fact,

1150
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the majority of human history

1151
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
is dominated by the British

1152
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and the Germans.

1153
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
In fact,

1154
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
the majority of human history

1155
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
is dominated by the Empire.

1156
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What is the Empire?

1157
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The simplest definition

1158
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
is that

1159
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
under a regime,

1160
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
there are many different

1161
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
ethnic groups

1162
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and activists.

1163
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
For example,

1164
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
the Qing Dynasty

1165
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
was an empire

1166
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
with Han people,

1167
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Tibetans,

1168
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Mongols,

1169
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
ethnic minorities

1170
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and Xinjiang people.

1171
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The next question is

1172
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
that we all know that

1173
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
there is a law called the Qing Dynasty Law.

1174
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But did the Qing Dynasty Law

1175
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
apply in Tibet?

1176
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Did the Qing Dynasty Law

1177
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
apply in Xinjiang?

1178
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
In fact, it did not.

1179
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Although the Qing Dynasty Law

1180
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
applied to most empires,

1181
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
the Roman Empire

1182
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
also applied the law to the Jews.

1183
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
In the Qing Dynasty,

1184
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the Mongols still applied

1185
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the traditional Mongolian law,

1186
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
while the Tibetans still applied the Tibetan law.

1187
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Only the Han people

1188
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
applied the Qing Dynasty Law.

1189
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This is understandable.

1190
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
When a country is very large

1191
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and is an empire,

1192
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
how could it be possible

1193
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to force a Mongolian

1194
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
to marry in a Confucian way?

1195
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This is also a question of

1196
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
the cost of rule.

1197
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
In order to maintain the operation of an empire

1198
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
and the coordination of the ethnic groups,

1199
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
you must use different laws

1200
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
to treat different people.

1201
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
This is now called

1202
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
the law pluralism.

1203
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Does Taiwan want to do the same thing?

1204
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Should the indigenous people

1205
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
apply the indigenous law

1206
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
or not?

1207
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
From the perspective of China,

1208
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
in 1842,

1209
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
the British said

1210
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that they wanted to

1211
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
apply the British law in China.

1212
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Think about it.

1213
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
What's wrong with

1214
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
the Mongolians

1215
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
applying the Mongolian law

1216
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and the British applying the British law?

1217
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
At that time,

1218
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
foreigners could only

1219
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
move around

1220
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
when they came to China.

1221
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Basically,

1222
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
it did not affect the original life of the Han people.

1223
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Therefore,

1224
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
there is nothing wrong with

1225
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
giving you a piece of land

1226
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and having your own law.

1227
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
In 1842,

1228
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
foreigners were limited to Guangzhou.

1229
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We call it the Guangzhou system.

1230
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Originally in Guangzhou,

1231
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
in 1842,

1232
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
China had already admitted

1233
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
that the Americans could apply the British law

1234
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
in Guangzhou.

1235
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Therefore, in 1842 and 1844,

1236
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
foreigners came to China

1237
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and told the negotiators

1238
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
that they wanted to apply the foreign law.

1239
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The Chinese thought it was good,

1240
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
so they gave it to them.

1241
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
However, in 1868,

1242
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
people found that something was wrong.

1243
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
At first,

1244
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
there were many cases

1245
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
in which

1246
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
foreigners committed crimes

1247
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
in China

1248
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and could not be punished.

1249
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
In these cases,

1250
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
too many countries had foreign law,

1251
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
so the legal vacuum was created.

1252
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Finally,

1253
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
in 1910,

1254
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
there were 23 countries with foreign law in China.

1255
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We often see in the files

1256
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
that an American

1257
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
committed a crime

1258
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and was arrested in the U.S. Court.

1259
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The first defense he made was

1260
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
that he was not an American,

1261
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
but an Englishman.

1262
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Because he had a lot of passports,

1263
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
he kept hiding.

1264
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Later, he made Shanghai the most

1265
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
famous criminal heaven in the world,

1266
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
because everyone would not be arrested.

1267
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
This problem became more and more serious,

1268
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
affecting China's security,

1269
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
China's economic development,

1270
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and so on.

1271
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Later,

1272
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
he began to think that

1273
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
it was a matter of right to enter the country,

1274
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and we had to oppose it.

1275
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
To this day,

1276
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
there is a modern meaning.

1277
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
For example,

1278
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
every year on January 11th,

1279
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
there is a Judiciary Day,

1280
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and the Judiciary Council

1281
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
holds a seminar and a celebration.

1282
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Why is there a Judiciary Day

1283
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
on January 11th?

1284
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Because January 11th, 1943

1285
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
was the day

1286
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
when China and the U.S.

1287
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
signed an equal treaty

1288
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and abolished foreign law.

1289
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
They thought that from that day on,

1290
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the judicial system of the Republic of China

1291
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
would no longer be dominated by the West.

1292
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Since then,

1293
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
the Nationalist government

1294
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
moved to Taiwan in 1949,

1295
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
so the Judiciary Day

1296
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
is still on January 11th.

1297
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Do you still remember

1298
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
the Lincoln case?

1299
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It was about a British man

1300
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
who died in Taiwan.

1301
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Later, he fled the country

1302
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and returned to the U.K.

1303
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
At that time,

1304
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the U.K. House of Representatives

1305
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
decided that Lincoln

1306
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
should be transferred back to Taiwan.

1307
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The representative of the U.K.

1308
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
was Ambassador St. Luke.

1309
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I attended his class with Ian.

1310
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Ambassador St. Luke was

1311
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
the Minister of Foreign Affairs

1312
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
when he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs

1313
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
at the University of Taitung.

1314
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
He said in a newspaper

1315
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
that Lincoln should have

1316
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
a symbolic meaning,

1317
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
because the law in the U.K.

1318
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
cannot be transferred

1319
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
to a country that is not civilized by the law.

1320
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
At that time,

1321
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Ambassador St. Luke wrote an article

1322
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
that the Lincoln case proved

1323
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that the U.K. had become

1324
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
a country that was civilized by the law,

1325
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
so the U.K. would be willing

1326
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
to transfer people back to Taiwan.

1327
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
However, when the second trial was overturned,

1328
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
the U.K. was defeated.

1329
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
However, in the hearts of many

1330
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
lawyers and diplomats,

1331
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
the rule of law

1332
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
in the U.K.

1333
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
must be carried on

1334
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
by a civilized country.

1335
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
My question is very simple.

1336
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Is foreign law really better?

1337
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
We can see that

1338
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
the U.S.

1339
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
must maintain a court

1340
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
in China,

1341
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and it must invest a lot of money.

1342
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
In fact, we can also

1343
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
intuitively find that

1344
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
if a U.S. court

1345
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
in China

1346
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
favors U.S. citizens,

1347
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Chinese people

1348
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
should not do business

1349
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
with U.S. citizens.

1350
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Chinese people do not want to

1351
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
get along with U.S. citizens,

1352
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
which will worsen Sino-U.S. relations

1353
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and damage U.S. business interests in China.

1354
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
My question is

1355
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
if foreign law is really better,

1356
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
how does it actually work?

1357
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Let's go to the U.S.

1358
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Can I ask a question?

1359
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Sure, go ahead.

1360
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'd like to ask...

1361
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You can go back to your seat.

1362
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay.

1363
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'd like to ask...

1364
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I'd like to ask...

1365
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Can you tell us

1366
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
who sent the question?

1367
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Can you introduce yourself

1368
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
so that we can understand

1369
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
the situation better?

1370
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Thank you.

1371
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Okay, I'm

1372
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Hong Shaoming.

1373
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm also a postdoc at Caltech.

1374
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I graduated from NTU Psychology.

1375
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'd like to ask...

1376
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
When you talk about

1377
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
foreign law,

1378
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
do you mean

1379
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
foreign law and

1380
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
multilateralism?

1381
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Are they the same?

1382
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
At least on the surface,

1383
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
when you talk about

1384
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
multilateralism,

1385
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
you're talking about

1386
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the international community.

1387
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But foreign law is about

1388
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
the relationship between

1389
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
countries.

1390
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
This can also be applied to...

1391
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
For example, you just mentioned

1392
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
that before 1868,

1393
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
China did not oppose

1394
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
foreign law.

1395
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It is possible that

1396
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
they have always felt that

1397
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
foreign law is one form

1398
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
of multilateralism.

1399
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
After 25 years,

1400
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
do you think

1401
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
foreign law and

1402
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
multilateralism are related?

1403
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Thank you.

1404
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I think

1405
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
everyone can accept

1406
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
multilateralism

1407
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
under the previous rule.

1408
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Because it is a low-cost

1409
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
way to maintain national governance.

1410
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So most of the current research

1411
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
believes that

1412
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
before 1868,

1413
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Chinese central government officials

1414
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
did not oppose

1415
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
multilateralism.

1416
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Because it is not necessarily

1417
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
within a country.

1418
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
For example,

1419
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
when Western missionaries

1420
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
came to China,

1421
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
China also respected

1422
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
the use of its own laws

1423
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
to deal with its own problems.

1424
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
After 1868,

1425
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I think it is because

1426
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
China wants to modernize.

1427
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So in the process of modernization,

1428
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
we can achieve the ability

1429
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
of central power and mobilization

1430
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
that modern countries want.

1431
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
We can also see that

1432
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
after the establishment of the Republic of China,

1433
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
China hopes that

1434
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang

1435
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
all use the laws of the Republic of China.

1436
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
China no longer respects

1437
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
China's autonomy.

1438
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
China's autonomy has become very limited.

1439
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
The current People's Republic of China

1440
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
also hopes that

1441
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang

1442
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
all use the laws of the Republic of China.

1443
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I think the same is true for Hong Kong.

1444
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
At the beginning,

1445
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
China thought that

1446
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Hong Kongers could continue

1447
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
to use the law of the Republic of China.

1448
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
However, when China wants to

1449
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
modernize Hong Kong,

1450
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
it wants to adopt

1451
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
a new law of monolateralism.

1452
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
After all, we are one nation,

1453
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
one country.

1454
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Why can't we all

1455
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
use different laws?

1456
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
If you are a Mongolian,

1457
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
a Tibetan, a Xinjiang or a Hong Konger,

1458
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
you should adopt the same law.

1459
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You are not different.

1460
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
If you are different,

1461
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
you are admitting that

1462
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
China is not a monolateral country.

1463
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I think the real difference

1464
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
between legal pluralism and

1465
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
legal monolateralism is that

1466
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
in the process of

1467
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
transferring from the empire

1468
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
to a democratic country,

1469
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
China wants to strengthen

1470
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Hong Kong.

1471
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
In your opinion,

1472
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
in a democratic country,

1473
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
legal pluralism is

1474
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
different from

1475
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
legal monolateralism,

1476
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
isn't it?

1477
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Not necessarily.

1478
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
It should be said that

1479
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
legal pluralism is

1480
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
different from

1481
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
legal monolateralism.

1482
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It should be said that

1483
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
in a democratic country,

1484
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
you should adopt the same law.

1485
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Foreigners adopt the same law

1486
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
because they want to

1487
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
show their national sovereignty.

1488
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Yes.

1489
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Your defense of

1490
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
legal pluralism is that

1491
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
it may show

1492
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
the spirit of

1493
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
legal pluralism.

1494
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But in some countries,

1495
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
legal pluralism and

1496
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
legal monolateralism are

1497
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
fundamentally different.

1498
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
First of all,

1499
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
legal pluralism can,

1500
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
but legal monolateralism can't.

1501
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Second, it can explain

1502
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
why China did not oppose

1503
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
at the beginning.

1504
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Because they thought

1505
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
it was different.

1506
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
At first, they thought

1507
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
it was the same thing.

1508
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Their opposition was

1509
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
when they found

1510
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
that it was actually

1511
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
different and

1512
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
they could not support

1513
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
whether it was good or

1514
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
bad.

1515
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But when I first

1516
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
talked about it,

1517
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
historians would ask

1518
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
why they could not

1519
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
find opposition in 1868.

1520
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
We would say that

1521
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
we thought that the subjective

1522
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
will of the activists

1523
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
at that time

1524
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
mixed it with

1525
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
legal pluralism.

1526
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
In other words,

1527
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
the reason why historians

1528
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
did not oppose

1529
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
is that they thought

1530
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
it was a mix of two things.

1531
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It is a bit like

1532
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
what I just said.

1533
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
At first, they thought

1534
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
it was the same thing,

1535
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
so they did not oppose.

1536
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
But later they found

1537
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
that it was different.

1538
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Anyway,

1539
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
we have spent too much time

1540
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I would like to add

1541
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
a cold knowledge.

1542
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
My ex-boss is an expert

1543
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
on the LinkedIn case.

1544
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Oh, really?

1545
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Did he prove that Taiwan

1546
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
is a civilized country?

1547
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
The main reason

1548
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
why he was invited

1549
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
was to ask

1550
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
whether there was a significant difference

1551
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
between the British and the Taiwanese

1552
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
in terms of quantity.

1553
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I see.

1554
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's all.

1555
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Please go on.

1556
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
OK.

1557
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Sorry,

1558
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I am running out of time.

1559
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So,

1560
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
in 1906,

1561
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
the U.S. carried out

1562
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
a judicial reform in Shanghai.

1563
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
From 1844 to 1905,

1564
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
the U.S. did not

1565
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
establish a formal court

1566
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
in China.

1567
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
We often hear the term

1568
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
that the U.S. sent

1569
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
a diplomat to be a judge.

1570
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
In other words,

1571
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
if an American committed a crime in China,

1572
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
he would be sent to the local consulate

1573
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
to be tried.

1574
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Who is the judge?

1575
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It is a diplomat.

1576
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Sometimes, the diplomat

1577
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
also has some legislative powers.

1578
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It is a tricky situation.

1579
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
When the U.S. criticized China

1580
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
for not having a separation of powers

1581
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and not being civilized,

1582
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
because the diplomat is an administrator

1583
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
and has the right to be tried,

1584
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
the U.S. is a system

1585
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
of three powers.

1586
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
The U.S. is not civilized at all.

1587
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The U.S. is more like

1588
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
the governor-general

1589
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
or the county magistrate of China,

1590
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
like Bao Qingtian.

1591
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
He is a mayor

1592
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and a judge at the same time.

1593
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Next,

1594
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
the U.S. was not a rich country

1595
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
at that time.

1596
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
The U.S. did not invest

1597
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
a lot of people,

1598
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
finance and legal experts

1599
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
in China.

1600
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
For example,

1601
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the U.S. did not have a prison

1602
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
at the beginning.

1603
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
The U.S. even rented a prison

1604
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
to the British and French,

1605
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
because the U.S. built

1606
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
the British and French prisons

1607
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
in Shanghai earlier.

1608
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Why did the U.S. have a legal reform

1609
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
in 1906?

1610
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I will explain in the next video.

1611
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
The U.S. began

1612
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
the expansion of the empire

1613
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
at the end of the 19th century.

1614
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
In this video,

1615
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
we can see two data.

1616
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
The first is the date

1617
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
when the U.S. acquired the colony.

1618
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Hawaii,

1619
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Wake Island,

1620
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Samoa, the Philippines,

1621
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and Panama were all

1622
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
acquired at the end of the 19th century

1623
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and the beginning of the 20th century.

1624
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
In other words,

1625
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
between 1844 and 1900,

1626
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
the U.S. did not trade much.

1627
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
In the second table,

1628
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
we can see that

1629
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
between 1900 and 1912,

1630
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
the average trade volume

1631
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
of China and the U.S.

1632
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
increased significantly,

1633
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and even doubled.

1634
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
The expansion of the U.S.

1635
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
brought a lot of trade between

1636
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
China and the U.S.

1637
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
At that time,

1638
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
the U.S. federal government

1639
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
responded that

1640
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
the Judiciary

1641
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
was not enough

1642
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
to solve the trade dispute

1643
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
between China and the U.S.

1644
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
because these judges

1645
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
were not legal people.

1646
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
They were just diplomats.

1647
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
As we all know,

1648
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
diplomats abroad

1649
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
were also responsible

1650
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
for business affairs,

1651
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
and they did not have

1652
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
much influence on the U.S.

1653
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
economy.

1654
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
In addition,

1655
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
as the U.S. expansion

1656
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
spread,

1657
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
a lot of smugglers

1658
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
came to China,

1659
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
including sex workers,

1660
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
gamblers, and vagabonds.

1661
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
At that time,

1662
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
the U.S. missionaries

1663
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
in China believed

1664
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
that these illegal immigrants

1665
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
had a serious impact

1666
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
on the sex workers

1667
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in the U.S.

1668
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So in 1900,

1669
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
all the white prostitutes

1670
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
in Shanghai

1671
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
said they were American.

1672
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
At that time,

1673
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
the word American Girl

1674
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
meant prostitutes,

1675
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
because every prostitute

1676
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
said she was American

1677
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
when she was arrested.

1678
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
If you were sent to the U.K.

1679
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
court,

1680
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
you would be a prostitute.

1681
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
At that time,

1682
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
there was a lot of discussion

1683
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
in the U.S.

1684
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
As we can see in this picture,

1685
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
foreign law was not

1686
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
an important concept

1687
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
for both China and the U.S.

1688
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It was not until 1900

1689
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
that the word

1690
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
extraterritoriality

1691
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and consular jurisdiction

1692
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
began to appear

1693
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
in foreign law.

1694
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
On the other hand,

1695
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
China also began to reform

1696
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
the modern country.

1697
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
In 1900,

1698
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
the Eight-Nation Alliance

1699
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
was established in Beijing.

1700
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
After the establishment of the Eight-Nation Alliance,

1701
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Beijing signed the New Deal,

1702
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and the Qing Dynasty began

1703
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
to reform the modern country.

1704
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
At that time,

1705
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
the modern country reform

1706
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
was to transform Chinese law

1707
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
into Western modern law.

1708
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
The origins of the Eight-Nation Alliance

1709
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
can be traced back to the

1710
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Ming and Qing dynasties

1711
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
published in 1906.

1712
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
If you ask a student

1713
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
of the Taiwan University Law Department

1714
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
who is majoring in

1715
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Law,

1716
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
he will use a classic textbook

1717
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
written by Wang Zhejian.

1718
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Many of the citations in that textbook

1719
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
are back to the Ming and Qing dynasties.

1720
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
The Ming and Qing dynasties

1721
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
were published in 1906.

1722
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
At that time,

1723
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
China had signed

1724
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
an agreement with the United Kingdom

1725
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and the United States.

1726
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
The agreement said

1727
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
that China was about to

1728
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
start legal and judicial reform,

1729
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
and Western states

1730
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
had to help it.

1731
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
If you helped,

1732
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
and later I succeeded in reforming,

1733
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
you would be expelled from foreign law.

1734
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
At that time,

1735
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
the United States was faced

1736
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
with a new legal system

1737
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
that needed to be improved

1738
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
in order to improve

1739
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Sino-US trade relations.

1740
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
On the other hand,

1741
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
China was about to start

1742
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
legal and judicial reform.

1743
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
What if China really became

1744
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
a modern civilized,

1745
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
three-powered court,

1746
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
using the same laws

1747
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
as the U.S. or Taiwan?

1748
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
If the U.S. still uses

1749
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
a three-powered,

1750
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
one-of-a-kind system,

1751
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
the U.S. established

1752
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
the United States Court for China

1753
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
in Shanghai in 1906.

1754
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
The U.S. sent

1755
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
a graduate of Yale University

1756
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
who was once the director

1757
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
of the Philippine Procuratorate

1758
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
to serve as a judge

1759
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
and establish a modern court.

1760
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The judge

1761
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
did three things.

1762
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The first thing he did

1763
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
was to declare that

1764
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
the U.S. did not do anything

1765
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
related to civil and commercial affairs.

1766
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
This was strange,

1767
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
because the U.S. business community

1768
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
wanted him to deal with

1769
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
some business cases and disputes.

1770
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Instead, he had to deal

1771
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
with brothels and casinos.

1772
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
He felt that

1773
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
many U.S. lawyers

1774
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
had a bad image of the Chinese.

1775
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So he called all the U.S. lawyers

1776
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
in Shanghai

1777
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
for a legal exam.

1778
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
80% of the U.S. lawyers

1779
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
failed the exam,

1780
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
which caused a great uproar.

1781
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
The U.S. lawyers

1782
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
were not allowed to come

1783
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
to the U.S. court.

1784
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
The next thing he did

1785
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
was to sue the boss

1786
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
of eight brothels

1787
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and four casinos.

1788
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
In the past,

1789
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
the U.S. lawyers used

1790
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
the original defense technique

1791
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
to say that they were not U.S. citizens

1792
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and that they were U.S. citizens.

1793
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
For example, he called

1794
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
U.S. Consulates in Shanghai

1795
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and asked them

1796
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
if they had ever used

1797
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
U.S. Consulates.

1798
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
He even asked

1799
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
U.S. Consulates

1800
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
to show their diplomatic documents

1801
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and ask them

1802
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
if they had ever

1803
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
filed a passport in the U.S. Consulate.

1804
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Some of them

1805
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
even said

1806
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
that the U.S. Consulate

1807
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
was a legal vacuum

1808
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
caused by U.S. law.

1809
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
This caused

1810
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
a fierce uproar

1811
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
among the U.S. community

1812
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
in Shanghai.

1813
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The U.S. lawyer

1814
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
was impeached

1815
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and resigned a year later.

1816
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
The next U.S. lawyer

1817
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
was not in charge anymore.

1818
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
In the future,

1819
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I think there are several

1820
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
different types of

1821
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
jurisdiction.

1822
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
This is common in the modern world.

1823
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
For example,

1824
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
if a Japanese

1825
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and a Singaporean

1826
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
sign a business contract,

1827
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
the law can be the law of New York.

1828
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
When there is a dispute,

1829
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
the law can be used in Paris

1830
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
to solve the dispute.

1831
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I think the situation in the world

1832
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
is similar to the past.

1833
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
There are many different types

1834
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
of jurisdiction.

1835
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I think China in the 19th century

1836
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
is a good place to develop theory.

1837
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
China has pushed the situation

1838
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
to the extreme.

1839
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
For example,

1840
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
there are nine states in Tianjin.

1841
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
In Tianjin,

1842
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
there are ten laws

1843
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
in the same city.

1844
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
There must be some

1845
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
place to develop

1846
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
theory and research.

1847
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Next,

1848
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I will talk about competition.

1849
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
We know that

1850
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
in the age of globalization,

1851
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
manufacturers will look for

1852
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
the place with the lowest cost

1853
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
of the system.

1854
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
For example,

1855
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
the labor law is relatively loose,

1856
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
the salary is relatively low,

1857
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
or the environmental law is relatively loose.

1858
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
At that time,

1859
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
in China,

1860
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
there were more than 20 countries

1861
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
with foreign jurisdiction.

1862
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
For example,

1863
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
there are nine states in Tianjin.

1864
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Is there any more theory

1865
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
that can be developed?

1866
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Next,

1867
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
there are some foreign law in the modern world.

1868
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
For example,

1869
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
there is foreign law in Chongqing.

1870
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Is there any way

1871
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
to push or deny

1872
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
the existence

1873
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
of foreign law

1874
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
from the implementation

1875
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
of the actual system

1876
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The last point is

1877
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
who benefits from foreign law?

1878
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
At that time,

1879
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
the United States had a very

1880
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
intense backlash,

1881
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
which made it believe that

1882
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
the United States should not

1883
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
throw taxpayers' money

1884
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
overseas for foreign law.

1885
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
In fact, the Americans have been

1886
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
faced with the fact that

1887
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
they can not manage

1888
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
the situation of their citizens

1889
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
in other countries.

1890
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So they were impeached

1891
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
and resigned.

1892
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Later, the judges also

1893
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
continued to ignore these things.

1894
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Is there really benefit?

1895
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
For example, if the image of the United States

1896
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
is so bad,

1897
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
if the court is not fair,

1898
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
the Chinese will resist your goods.

1899
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
So it seems that foreign law

1900
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
is not something that can be

1901
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
implemented indefinitely.

1902
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
In addition to the law itself,

1903
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
there are many other factors to consider.

1904
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
In the first part,

1905
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
the teacher will ask you

1906
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
to understand the content of the system

1907
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and then think about

1908
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
more theoretical and abstract

1909
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
things with your eyes.

1910
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So today I will briefly

1911
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
report to you.

1912
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Please give me your advice.

1913
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Thank you.

1914
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I think today's lecture is really wonderful.

1915
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I really learned a lot.

1916
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It's like a book.

1917
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I think it's pretty exciting.

1918
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Do you have any questions?

1919
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Please feel free to ask.

1920
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
If you can,

1921
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
please briefly introduce yourself

1922
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
before asking questions.

1923
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Can I ask another question?

1924
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Welcome.

1925
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Sorry, the question just ended.

1926
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I'm afraid it will delay your time.

1927
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
If I ask you now,

1928
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
if we want

1929
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
contemporary foreign law

1930
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
to continue to exist,

1931
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
what do you think

1932
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
is the best way

1933
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
to defend it?

1934
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
What is the direction?

1935
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Why does contemporary foreign law

1936
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
still need to exist?

1937
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
If I ask you to make

1938
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
the strongest defense,

1939
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
what should it be?

1940
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Thank you.

1941
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I think it depends on

1942
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
who you are talking to.

1943
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
For example,

1944
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
there are a lot of things

1945
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
that are close to foreign law.

1946
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
For example,

1947
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
investment in heavy industry.

1948
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
What is investment in heavy industry?

1949
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
For example,

1950
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
a Singaporean came to Taiwan

1951
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
to invest.

1952
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
He bought a piece of land.

1953
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
As a result,

1954
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
today our government

1955
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
does not support

1956
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
the acquisition of land.

1957
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
At this time,

1958
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
according to our domestic law,

1959
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
if he does not support

1960
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
the acquisition,

1961
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
he thinks it is illegal.

1962
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Then he should be sued

1963
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
by our administrative court.

1964
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
However,

1965
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
because we have an investment

1966
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
guarantee agreement with Singapore,

1967
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
at this time,

1968
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
this Singaporean

1969
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
did not support

1970
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Taiwan's domestic law.

1971
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Instead, he sued

1972
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
the World Bank's

1973
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Investment Heavy Industry Center.

1974
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
This is a bit like

1975
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
not being governed by the domestic court.

1976
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
We entrust him to a third party.

1977
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
In fact, foreign law

1978
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
is entrusted to his motherland.

1979
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Of course,

1980
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
in Africa or some countries

1981
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
where the law is not so stable,

1982
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
or you do not trust

1983
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
the law or the court,

1984
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
you have to entrust

1985
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
the solution of this dispute

1986
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
to a fair institution

1987
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
that you believe in.

1988
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Then this foreign law

1989
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
will be meaningful.

1990
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So some people ask,

1991
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
because there used to be a theory

1992
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
called the law and development theory.

1993
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
He believes that in the process

1994
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
of capitalist development,

1995
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
good courts must be coordinated

1996
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
to help each other.

1997
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Otherwise, there will be a lot of

1998
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
commercial disputes in capitalism,

1999
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
and you need a good court to solve them.

2000
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Some people ask,

2001
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
why is the Chinese court

2002
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
so biased?

2003
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Xi Jinping said that the court

2004
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
should trust the party.

2005
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Everyone knows that

2006
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Google sued Baidu,

2007
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
and Baidu won.

2008
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Why is the development of

2009
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Chinese capitalism so good?

2010
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Many people think that

2011
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
the problem of foreign law

2012
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
is not solved by the people's court,

2013
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
but you can entrust it to another

2014
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
third party institution

2015
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
that you believe in.

2016
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So I think that foreign law

2017
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
can replace certain legal developments

2018
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
at least in the commercial part,

2019
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
or the court is not so

2020
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
healthy and credible.

2021
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
It can help attract investment

2022
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
and people outside

2023
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
can go to the court

2024
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
with confidence.

2025
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It can help attract investment

2026
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and people outside

2027
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
can go to the court

2028
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
with confidence.

2029
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
In terms of the form,

2030
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I don't think that

2031
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
some countries

2032
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
still have meat

2033
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
or planets.

2034
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
In order to protect foreigners,

2035
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
in order to make foreigners

2036
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
willing to invest in your country,

2037
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
in order to make foreigners

2038
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
willing to travel to your country,

2039
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
in order to make foreigners

2040
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
willing to travel to your country,

2041
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
you have to give them

2042
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
some kind of protection of foreign law.

2043
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You can understand that.

2044
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
In fact, the most common foreign law

2045
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
is applied to diplomats.

2046
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
If a diplomat breaks the law locally,

2047
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
he is not subject to the local laws

2048
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and courts.

2049
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
This is part of the diplomatic privilege.

2050
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Of course, we believe that

2051
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
there is still some foreign law

2052
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
in respect of foreign history.

2053
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
But to me,

2054
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
it sounds like the reason

2055
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
why foreign law should disappear.

2056
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
If in the ideal reality,

2057
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
we have a very fair third party,

2058
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
let's say it's a certain court

2059
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
made up of 200 countries.

2060
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
If you want to deal with criminal matters,

2061
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
you can throw it to the criminal court.

2062
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
If you want to deal with civil matters,

2063
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
you can throw it to the civil court.

2064
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
This court can judge a person

2065
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
fairly.

2066
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
For example,

2067
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
if a Singaporean comes to Taiwan

2068
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
and does something similar,

2069
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
we don't need

2070
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Singapore's foreign law

2071
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
or Taiwan's foreign law in Taiwan,

2072
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
right?

2073
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I understand

2074
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
why

2075
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
the two questions are not interrelated.

2076
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Let's go back to

2077
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
the definition of foreign law.

2078
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
In fact,

2079
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
when we talk about

2080
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
foreign law,

2081
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
it means that foreigners are not

2082
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
privileged by the local

2083
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
legal courts.

2084
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
But it is not necessarily

2085
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
in accordance with

2086
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
the law of his motherland

2087
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
or the law of the third party

2088
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
or the jurisdiction of the third party.

2089
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So when I just answered,

2090
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I went back to the original definition

2091
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
of foreign law.

2092
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
But what you just discussed

2093
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
should be said

2094
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
that today a person

2095
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
is not privileged by the local

2096
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
legal courts.

2097
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But I don't think

2098
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
all cases

2099
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
can find

2100
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
a fair third party.

2101
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I understand.

2102
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
For example,

2103
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
in the case of criminal law,

2104
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I have not received any

2105
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
legal or historical training.

2106
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
In my imagination,

2107
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
for example,

2108
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
if the British

2109
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
come to Taiwan to commit a crime,

2110
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
and then you want to say that

2111
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
we British should have foreign law,

2112
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
we want to introduce it back to

2113
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
the British trial,

2114
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
it seems to prove

2115
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
why the British return to

2116
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
the British trial

2117
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
is better than

2118
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
the trial in Taiwan.

2119
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
One of the cases is

2120
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
that the legal system

2121
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
of some African countries

2122
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
has been changed.

2123
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
It is not easy to prove

2124
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
that your national

2125
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
legal system is worse than mine,

2126
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
so it should be introduced

2127
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
back to my own country.

2128
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Yes.

2129
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
There are some standards.

2130
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
For example,

2131
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
because European countries

2132
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
have abolished the death penalty,

2133
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
it will not be introduced

2134
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
into a country that will be sentenced

2135
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
to death in Taiwan.

2136
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It is quite obvious

2137
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
in some extreme examples.

2138
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
For example,

2139
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
if Lin Keying is a murderer in Taiwan today,

2140
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
because murderers in Taiwan

2141
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
will be sentenced to death,

2142
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
so when she returns to the UK,

2143
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
the UK will not introduce her

2144
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
back to Taiwan.

2145
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
But this means that

2146
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
the British have an assumption

2147
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
that a country with a death penalty

2148
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
or a death penalty

2149
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
is a country with a death penalty.

2150
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
But I think this matter

2151
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
also requires a process.

2152
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
If you want to have an extramarital law,

2153
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
you have to prove that

2154
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
my legal system is better than yours.

2155
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
In some cases,

2156
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
this process may be easier,

2157
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
but in some cases

2158
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
it may not be so easy.

2159
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Of course,

2160
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
now it happens

2161
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
whether it is easy or not.

2162
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
If I don't want to give you a death penalty,

2163
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
you have to ask yourself

2164
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
how strong or how weak

2165
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
your country is.

2166
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
You have to ask yourself

2167
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
whether you are strong

2168
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
in international negotiations.

2169
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I used to think

2170
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
that I could not prove

2171
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
that extramarital law

2172
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
is inefficient

2173
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
in the way of economics.

2174
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
This is one of the things

2175
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I might want to do in the future.

2176
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I think there are several levels of problems.

2177
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
The first one is whether

2178
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
extramarital law is inefficient.

2179
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Extramarital law will cause

2180
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
legal vacuum.

2181
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Legal vacuum is like

2182
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Shanghai in the early 20th century.

2183
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
No one can do anything.

2184
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
This is what we don't want to see.

2185
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
From this perspective,

2186
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
extramarital law is inefficient.

2187
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
On the other hand,

2188
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
many extramarital laws

2189
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
are competing in good systems.

2190
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
For example,

2191
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Tianjin is divided into

2192
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
ten land laws.

2193
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Is it because everyone

2194
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
wants to create a better land law,

2195
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
so Tianjin's land

2196
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
is better or worse now?

2197
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Extramarital law may be efficient,

2198
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
but it may also

2199
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
have other social norms

2200
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
or social norms.

2201
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
For example,

2202
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
if you are too good

2203
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
to your own country,

2204
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
you will be restricted.

2205
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
In the future,

2206
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I want to build a theory

2207
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
that extramarital law

2208
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
is inefficient or

2209
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
has some advantages

2210
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
and some disadvantages.

2211
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Or it has some

2212
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
more important social norms

2213
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
behind it.

2214
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I can also

2215
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
make a point about this.

2216
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
For example,

2217
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
a country like the United States

2218
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
sometimes

2219
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
doesn't care

2220
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
how much money

2221
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
is worth.

2222
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
For example,

2223
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
if it happens between

2224
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
China and the United States,

2225
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
the Americans think

2226
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
this person must be extradited

2227
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
or he may be treated

2228
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
unfairly in China.

2229
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
In this case,

2230
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
the economic calculation

2231
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
becomes very complicated.

2232
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But the Americans think

2233
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
this $10 million is to

2234
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
buy our face,

2235
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
so even if it is $100 million

2236
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
or $100 million,

2237
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I should do it.

2238
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Of course,

2239
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
each case has its own considerations.

2240
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
However,

2241
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I think the extramarital law

2242
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
in the end of the 19th century

2243
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
or the beginning of the 20th century

2244
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
is a more transparent case.

2245
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Of course,

2246
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Wang Dan was taken to the United States

2247
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
from Qinchen Prison to Harvard to study PhD.

2248
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I believe this must have

2249
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
his diplomatic image

2250
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
or American idealistic

2251
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
diplomatic policy considerations.

2252
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
However,

2253
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I think that

2254
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
the extramarital law

2255
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
in the end of the 19th century

2256
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
is a good example

2257
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
to respond to the issue

2258
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
of institutional competition

2259
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
or institutional competition

2260
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
in the United States.

2261
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
For example,

2262
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
most American companies

2263
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
are located in Delaware,

2264
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
which has the best

2265
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
company law.

2266
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
However,

2267
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
is it really efficient

2268
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
for each state

2269
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
to adopt different

2270
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
legal systems?

2271
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
To me,

2272
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
this is still

2273
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
a question

2274
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
that needs to be answered.

2275
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Thank you for your answer.

2276
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Thank you.

2277
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I have a question.

2278
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I'm not sure

2279
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
if it's too early

2280
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
or not.

2281
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
If

2282
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
the audience

2283
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
at the scene

2284
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
can leave

2285
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
if there is a problem,

2286
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
the recording will continue

2287
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
if the audience

2288
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
can leave

2289
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
if there is a problem.

2290
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
If you want to follow

2291
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
the Q&A,

2292
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
you can watch the video later.

2293
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
If you can leave

2294
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
now,

2295
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
you can continue

2296
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
the Q&A.

2297
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I have two questions.

2298
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
The first one

2299
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
is probably answered.

2300
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Let me ask you

2301
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
one more time.

2302
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
The second question is

2303
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
basically

2304
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
a legal study.

2305
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Since it's a legal study,

2306
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
my understanding is

2307
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
that it's a principle.

2308
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
We start from the principle

2309
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
and discuss it.

2310
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
However,

2311
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
from another perspective,

2312
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
it's a very political

2313
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and valuable act.

2314
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
It's a diplomatic act.

2315
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I can give credit to others

2316
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
to strengthen my control

2317
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
or dominance over others.

2318
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
What do you think

2319
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
about the economic

2320
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and diplomatic aspects

2321
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
of extramarital law?

2322
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You've answered a part of the question.

2323
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
This is my first question.

2324
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
My second question

2325
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
is about

2326
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
extramarital law.

2327
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
There is a word called

2328
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
external.

2329
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
There are internal and external.

2330
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
How do you define

2331
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
extramarital law?

2332
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Who is my citizen?

2333
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Who is not my citizen?

2334
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Who is my country?

2335
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Who is not my country?

2336
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Do you think

2337
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
extramarital law

2338
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
is enforced

2339
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
or dilutes

2340
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
the definition of a country?

2341
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Thank you.

2342
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
My first question

2343
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
is

2344
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
about extramarital law.

2345
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
You said that

2346
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
extramarital law

2347
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
is based on principles.

2348
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
For me,

2349
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
this is a more traditional

2350
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
study of legal ethics.

2351
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
For example,

2352
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I have a theory

2353
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
about what is justice

2354
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and what is fairness.

2355
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I have some principles

2356
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and I apply them

2357
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
in a logical way.

2358
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
This is a more empirical

2359
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
study.

2360
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I hope to draw

2361
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
some theories

2362
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
or calculations

2363
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
from the past

2364
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
so that we can

2365
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
have some new directions in the future.

2366
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It is a more

2367
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
social science method.

2368
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
There is a word

2369
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
in mainland China

2370
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
called social science law.

2371
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
In Taiwan,

2372
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I used to be an assistant

2373
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
of Mr. Zhang Yong-cheng.

2374
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
He also published a book

2375
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
called Social Science Law.

2376
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I think

2377
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
from my point of view,

2378
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
any law

2379
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
has politics in it.

2380
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
We cannot say

2381
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
that the study of law

2382
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
can be completely

2383
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
excluded from

2384
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
the diplomatic context.

2385
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
For me,

2386
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
the big question

2387
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
in my study

2388
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
is how the international law

2389
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
can change the domestic politics.

2390
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
This is what I wrote

2391
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
in my thesis.

2392
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
In 1945,

2393
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
the international law changed

2394
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
the legal operation

2395
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
and the domestic politics of the Republic of China.

2396
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I think

2397
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
under the example of an

2398
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
international law,

2399
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
we should consider

2400
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
the level of economics,

2401
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
politics,

2402
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
and social science.

2403
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Under such conditions,

2404
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
how will it affect

2405
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
the reasoning,

2406
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
logic,

2407
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and interpretation of the law?

2408
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
What should we pay attention to

2409
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
in the future

2410
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
when there are

2411
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
relevant systems

2412
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
of international law?

2413
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I will try to convince him

2414
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
that these are important backgrounds.

2415
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Your second question

2416
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
is that

2417
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I think in the near future,

2418
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
the international law

2419
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
will certainly strengthen

2420
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
the national boundary.

2421
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
It is like

2422
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
decoupling.

2423
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
For example,

2424
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
when foreigners enter Taiwan,

2425
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
they need to have

2426
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
a negative vaccination certificate.

2427
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I do not need it

2428
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
because I have a passport from the Republic of China.

2429
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
At this time,

2430
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
there is a difference

2431
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
between you and me.

2432
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
If I see someone

2433
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
who owes money like me

2434
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
but he is subject to legal jurisdiction

2435
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and the law he uses is different,

2436
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
this kind of

2437
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
internal and external distinction

2438
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
will strengthen

2439
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
our imagination

2440
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and views.

2441
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I think the international law

2442
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
plays an important role

2443
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
in the modernization

2444
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
of China.

2445
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Thank you.

2446
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Thank you.

2447
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Thank you.

2448
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Do you have any questions?

2449
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I think

2450
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
both the speech

2451
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
and the Q&A are wonderful.

2452
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Thank you.

2453
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Excuse me,

2454
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
can I ask a question?

2455
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Go ahead.

2456
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I am from Indiana.

2457
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I am studying information science,

2458
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
which is the term used in Taiwan.

2459
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I have studied history,

2460
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
so I know a little bit about history.

2461
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I am curious about

2462
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
legal pluralism and

2463
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
international law.

2464
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Although there are

2465
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
different contexts,

2466
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
for example,

2467
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
in the past,

2468
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
the rule of law

2469
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
of the colonial motherland

2470
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
was different but equal.

2471
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
In fact,

2472
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
it is not equal.

2473
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Is there any possibility

2474
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
that the same concept

2475
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
exists in the dispute

2476
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
of international law?

2477
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Is it the same

2478
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
as the rule of law?

2479
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
If I remember correctly,

2480
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
it is the same as the rule of law.

2481
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
There are many questions.

2482
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
The first one is

2483
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
the dispute between the rule of law

2484
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and the national security law.

2485
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
In fact,

2486
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
not only China implemented

2487
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
the national security law in Hong Kong,

2488
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Taiwan also discussed

2489
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
whether to implement a national security law.

2490
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It may already exist,

2491
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
but I wonder

2492
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
if there is a common origin

2493
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
or a common core

2494
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
in the dispute.

2495
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
The last one is

2496
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
if you know that

2497
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
you have to study history for seven years,

2498
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
do you still want to study

2499
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
a doctor of law?

2500
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
After you finish studying history,

2501
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
you can teach me in the history department.

2502
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Do you think that

2503
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
the law history of the U.S.

2504
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
is a more

2505
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
inclusive direction

2506
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
under the system

2507
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
of the U.S. Law School?

2508
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
There are many questions.

2509
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
You can pick the key answer.

2510
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Thank you.

2511
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
The first one is

2512
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
the issue of multilateralism

2513
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
and colonization

2514
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
of the United States.

2515
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
The term

2516
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
multilateralism

2517
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
originated

2518
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
from the study

2519
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
of the Great British Empire.

2520
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
The Great British Empire

2521
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
was famous

2522
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
for its

2523
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
high regard

2524
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
for local officials

2525
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
in every colony.

2526
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
In 1895,

2527
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
when the Japanese ruled Taiwan,

2528
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
they did not use the Japanese Civil Code

2529
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
or the Civil Code.

2530
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Taiwanese used old customs.

2531
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
It was not until 1900

2532
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
that it became a local colonization.

2533
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
The recent study of the empire

2534
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
in the history department

2535
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
is very popular.

2536
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
It re-evaluates

2537
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
the methods of governance

2538
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
of the previous empires,

2539
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
such as Rome and China,

2540
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
to see whether

2541
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
the British Empire

2542
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
did the same thing.

2543
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
The British Empire

2544
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
was well-known

2545
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
for its multilateralism.

2546
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
In Hong Kong,

2547
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
it used the old customs

2548
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
as a part of the United States' law.

2549
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
My main question is

2550
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
whether there is

2551
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
such a situation

2552
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
in the history department.

2553
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I think

2554
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
foreign law

2555
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
gives people

2556
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
an impression that

2557
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
foreign law is biased.

2558
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
However,

2559
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
foreign law

2560
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
seems to cause

2561
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
people to use

2562
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
different laws

2563
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
to achieve

2564
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
unequal results.

2565
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Yes,

2566
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
this is our impression

2567
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
of foreign law.

2568
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
However,

2569
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I am not sure

2570
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
about this.

2571
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Last December,

2572
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I went to

2573
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
the Second National Archives

2574
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
in Maryland.

2575
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
There were 10 boxes

2576
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
of documents.

2577
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
One of the things

2578
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I want to do

2579
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
is to look through

2580
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
these documents

2581
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
and do some coding

2582
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
and quantification analysis

2583
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
to see whether

2584
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
foreign law

2585
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
is biased against Americans.

2586
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I don't think

2587
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
there is such a situation

2588
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
in Shanghai.

2589
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I think

2590
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
this is a matter

2591
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
of fact.

2592
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
We need more evidence.

2593
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
The second question is

2594
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
why it was in 1868.

2595
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I think

2596
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
the Tongchi Restoration

2597
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
was established

2598
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
by the

2599
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Tongchi Center.

2600
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
After the Fourth War,

2601
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
it sent more students

2602
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
to Europe and America.

2603
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
They began to

2604
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
learn more about

2605
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
the concept of

2606
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
sovereignty and

2607
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
modern international law.

2608
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
They realized that

2609
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Europeans used

2610
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
the label

2611
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
of an uncivilized country

2612
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
to label China.

2613
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
The first person

2614
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
who opposed it was

2615
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Guo Songtao.

2616
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
He went to Europe

2617
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
and became

2618
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
a member of the

2619
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Tongchi Restoration.

2620
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
There were many

2621
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
religious crimes.

2622
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
One of the crimes

2623
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
was that Chinese people

2624
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
destroyed churches

2625
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and killed missionaries.

2626
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Why did this happen?

2627
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
In many cases,

2628
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
it was because

2629
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
a Chinese person

2630
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
believed in Christianity.

2631
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
The missionaries

2632
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
applied for foreign passports.

2633
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
For example,

2634
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
British and French passports.

2635
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Later,

2636
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
many Chinese people

2637
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
enjoyed foreign law

2638
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
and committed crimes.

2639
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
This led to dissatisfaction

2640
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
among the local people.

2641
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
The grassroots people

2642
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
began to think that

2643
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
there was a lot of

2644
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
injustice in it.

2645
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
If you look at the documents

2646
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
of the Xiamen Consulate,

2647
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
you can see that

2648
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Taiwanese also enjoyed

2649
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
foreign law in China in 1895.

2650
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Many people

2651
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
from Chaozhou

2652
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
went to Singapore

2653
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
and obtained passports

2654
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
from the British Empire.

2655
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
When they came back to China

2656
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
to do business,

2657
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
they advocated foreign law.

2658
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Many defendants

2659
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
are still being investigated.

2660
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
What is their intention?

2661
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Isn't it normal for a person

2662
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
to have two passports?

2663
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I don't understand

2664
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
why so many Taiwanese

2665
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
have two passports.

2666
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
If everyone in Taiwan

2667
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
has foreign law,

2668
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
how can he have foreign law?

2669
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Next,

2670
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
the issue of national security law

2671
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
and foreign law.

2672
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
As I mentioned earlier,

2673
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I think Hong Kong

2674
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
is like a

2675
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
legal multidimensional state

2676
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
to the People's Republic of China.

2677
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
However,

2678
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
it is a problem

2679
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
whether a modern country

2680
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
can tolerate

2681
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
legal multidimensionality.

2682
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I think the common cause

2683
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
is to expand

2684
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
the judicial sovereignty

2685
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
at the core of a sovereign state.

2686
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Therefore,

2687
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
there are many exceptions

2688
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
in the national security law.

2689
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
For example,

2690
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Taiwan's jurisdiction

2691
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
and so on.

2692
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
This is an interesting question.

2693
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I haven't figured it out yet.

2694
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I will share the results

2695
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
with you later.

2696
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I'm looking forward to it.

2697
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
The last one is

2698
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
about teaching.

2699
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
This is an interesting question.

2700
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I'm studying

2701
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
the history of Sino-US relations,

2702
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
but it doesn't mean

2703
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I'm going to teach Sino-US relations

2704
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
in law school.

2705
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
For example,

2706
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
a well-known American

2707
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
tax law teacher

2708
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
teaches law school

2709
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
in Michigan.

2710
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
He is a Harvard History PhD

2711
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and a Harvard JD.

2712
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
PhDs need to have

2713
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
academic training,

2714
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
such as writing papers

2715
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
and publishing papers,

2716
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
and have a good background in knowledge.

2717
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
In the end,

2718
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
what you teach in law school

2719
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
actually depends on

2720
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
the field of representation

2721
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
when you apply for a job.

2722
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Of course, it is difficult

2723
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
to find a good teacher

2724
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
in law school.

2725
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
In fact,

2726
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
American law schools

2727
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
are very special.

2728
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
In history,

2729
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I know that

2730
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
a law school

2731
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
rents a whole hotel

2732
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
in Washington DC

2733
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
every December,

2734
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and 200 law schools

2735
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
in the United States

2736
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
recruit new teachers.

2737
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So every year,

2738
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
there is a shortage of

2739
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
law school teachers.

2740
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I heard that

2741
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
there is a teacher

2742
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
who has never been

2743
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
fully recruited

2744
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
in the United States.

2745
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I read a lot of

2746
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
tax law books

2747
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
because I thought

2748
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
it would be easier to find a job

2749
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
in law school.

2750
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
In fact,

2751
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
law school teachers

2752
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
are very realistic.

2753
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
If you want to be fully recruited,

2754
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
your CV must be

2755
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
in a fixed format.

2756
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
In the Northwest,

2757
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
a law school teacher

2758
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
told me that

2759
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I should print out

2760
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
the blank form of my CV

2761
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
and put it under my desk.

2762
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Every year,

2763
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I should reflect on

2764
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
which part of my CV

2765
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
that I should print out.

2766
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
So,

2767
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
after reading for so long,

2768
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
should I continue to read?

2769
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
In fact,

2770
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
most people suggest

2771
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
that I should finish

2772
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
my 5-year history course

2773
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
and finish my PhD

2774
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
by the fifth year.

2775
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I should finish my PhD

2776
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
by the seventh year

2777
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
and finish my PhD

2778
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
by the eighth year

2779
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
and finish my PhD.

2780
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
In the U.S.,

2781
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
if you want to teach

2782
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
in a law school,

2783
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
you need two years of experience.

2784
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
So, I should graduate from J.D.

2785
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
and become a lawyer in the U.S.

2786
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
and then apply for a job

2787
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
in a law school.

2788
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Law school teachers

2789
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
apply for a job

2790
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
before 40 years old.

2791
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
So, I should finish my PhD

2792
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
and become a lawyer

2793
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
so that I can apply for a job in a law school.

2794
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
That's all.

2795
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Thank you so much.

2796
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Thank you.

2797
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
But,

2798
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
there is an interesting point.

2799
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Why are tax lawyers always dissatisfied?

2800
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Because

2801
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
tax lawyers in the U.S. make a lot of money.

2802
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
After being a tax lawyer for two years,

2803
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
many people don't want to come back

2804
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
to apply for a job.

2805
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
They make a lot of money.

2806
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
After all,

2807
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
a tax lawyer needs two years of experience.

2808
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
So,

2809
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
the more money you make, the less people want to apply for a job.

2810
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
That's true.

2811
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Just like C.S. is always looking for a teacher.

2812
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
That's right.

2813
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And,

2814
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
C.S. doesn't force you to have a lot of experience.

2815
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
In law school,

2816
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
you need to be a lawyer for two years before applying for a job.

2817
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
So, some people are very happy

2818
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
and apply for a job right away.

2819
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
It's like your love for law school.

2820
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Law school is your true love.

2821
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
That's right.

2822
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Because of time constraints,

2823
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
as a host,

2824
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I'd like to ask C.S.

2825
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
for a final answer.

2826
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Because this is a projectile speech,

2827
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
whether it's

2828
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
the audience

2829
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
here today or

2830
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
in the future,

2831
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I guess most of the people watching this video

2832
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
are Taiwanese.

2833
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I'd like to ask C.S.

2834
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
to tell us

2835
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
about your research

2836
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
and how you connect with people

2837
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
from different backgrounds

2838
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and fields.

2839
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Okay.

2840
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I think

2841
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Taiwan is Taiwan,

2842
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
but it's different

2843
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
from China.

2844
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I think

2845
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
the legacy of the Republic of China

2846
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
has a great impact,

2847
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
especially on the law.

2848
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Our Civil Law and Criminal Law

2849
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
were established during the administration period.

2850
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
The main purpose of the Civil Law

2851
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
and Criminal Law in Taiwan

2852
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
at that time was to complete

2853
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
the modernization of the law

2854
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
and abolish foreign law.

2855
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
So we still have a lot of legacy,

2856
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
such as the LinkedIn case

2857
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
or the Judiciary.

2858
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I always think

2859
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
that we need to understand

2860
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
the law of the Republic of China

2861
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
in the mainland

2862
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
in order to better understand

2863
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
the law we use in Taiwan.

2864
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
You need to understand

2865
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
why the Republic of China

2866
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
has such a law,

2867
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
and its bigger background

2868
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
is the contact

2869
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
between the Qing and the West.

2870
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
From a legal perspective,

2871
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
the biggest problem

2872
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
is that the Qing Empire,

2873
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
the Beiyang Government,

2874
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek,

2875
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
and the Communist Party of China

2876
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
all want to abolish

2877
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
foreign law.

2878
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
However,

2879
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
because of this political context,

2880
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
we have a lot of misunderstandings

2881
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
about foreign law

2882
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
and a lot of democracy.

2883
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
So I think

2884
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
this kind of research

2885
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
can be done

2886
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
and we can

2887
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
reflect on

2888
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
what it means to us,

2889
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
develop more theories,

2890
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
take off our democracy glasses,

2891
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
and re-understand

2892
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
the background of the law

2893
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
we use in Taiwan.

2894
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I think

2895
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
this is what I want to do.

2896
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I think it's super exciting.

2897
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
As someone

2898
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
who used to teach

2899
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
at a law school,

2900
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
now I'm a PhD student

2901
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
in different fields

2902
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
of law.

2903
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I'm looking forward

2904
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
to your future

2905
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
in history,

2906
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
and your

2907
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
PhD career.

2908
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I also hope that

2909
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
you can overcome

2910
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
your eight-year PhD life

2911
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
and get two J.D. and Ph.D.

2912
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
and become

2913
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
the first person

2914
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
at a law school.

2915
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Thank you for your time today.

2916
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I'm going to end

2917
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
the meeting now.

2918
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000

with your friends and family.
