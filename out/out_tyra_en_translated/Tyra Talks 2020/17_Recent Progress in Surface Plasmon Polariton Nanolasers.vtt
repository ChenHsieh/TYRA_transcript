00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tire Talk. I'm your host, Yen-Yong Zhang.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
We're very honored to have Timothy here today. He's a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Chengda University.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Today's topic is Recent Progress in Surface Plasmon Polariton Nanolasers.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Before we start, let me introduce Tim.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
First of all, I want to say that Tim's introduction is so cool and short.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
But I want to say that he only wrote a few words. He wrote,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Proud Kaohsiunger 666.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
This was sent to me a few days before the election.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
So I have to go to his personal website to see his self-introduction.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Yes, I have it now. You can take a look.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay, I have the website.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Let me introduce him.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Tim's background is physics.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
He majored in physics at Chengda University.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
He got his Ph.D. at Chengda University.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
In addition to physics, he is also passionate about investment, hiking, philosophy, and social movements.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
I know you got your Ph.D. at Chengda University.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
No, I got my Ph.D. at NCT.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, NCT. I misread it. Sorry.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay, you got your Ph.D. at Chengda University.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Did you go to Michigan and Tel Aviv to do a postdoc program for a period of time before returning to Taiwan?

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
No, I went to Michigan with a visa from the Ministry of Science and Technology.

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
My boss, Denghui, recommended me to go to the University of Israel.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
I went to the University of Israel and did a postdoc program for about a year.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
And then you went back to Chengda University.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Yes, that's right.

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
Okay, so this is the bio of Yuxun from the proud Kaohsiunger666.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Okay, let's get started.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Okay, today, considering that everyone has different backgrounds,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm going to talk a little bit about what we do in the light study department.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Roughly speaking, it can be shown as shown in the picture.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
We will create light.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
Then we will find a way to transmit light, detect light, and control light.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
This is what we do in the light study department.

02:40.000 --> 02:51.000
Our department covers all aspects of basic physics, including ray optics, wave optics, electronics, and quantum mechanics.

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
In the light study department, as you can see, we have a very wide range of applications.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
For example, you can see the screen on your phone or the LED light for lighting.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
There is also a solar panel that is currently out of energy,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
as well as the light you need to use when you go online.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
Some parts of your iPhone are cut off with high-power laser.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
A more advanced application is the part of the collective light path.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
So light basically covers a lot of subjects and applications.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
These are the parts that are usually easier to see.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I would like to emphasize a little further here.

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
The part of the light study field basically contributed 30% of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the past half century.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
This data was obtained from the OSA, the light study department.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
In other words, the part related to light won the 30% physics award.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
You can see that light technology is a very important subject.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
It is a very worthwhile project for everyone to invest in.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
Personally, I focus my research on how to create light.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
If you want to create light, you must know that energy and matter are basically inseparable.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
The creation of energy must involve matter, and the stability of matter must also involve energy.

04:29.000 --> 04:40.000
Here, I mainly focus on the interaction between light and matter, especially the polariton part.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Polariton is basically a mixture of light and exciton.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
Based on such a large structure, my current research topic is microcavity polariton laser,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
and surface plasmon polariton laser.

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
In order to produce these components, I did some basic research on some novel materials.

05:03.000 --> 05:13.000
Back to the laser part, as I mentioned earlier, my research focuses on the interaction between light and matter.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
I hope to be able to produce light, because light is the most basic part of light science.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
If you can't produce light, you won't be able to control light, guide light, or detect light.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Here, I want to talk about what a laser is.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
The abbreviation for laser is LASER.

05:36.000 --> 05:45.000
Its full name is Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
The concept of light amplification radiation was first proposed by Einstein around 1918.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
At that time, he proposed the interaction between light and matter, which can be roughly divided into three categories.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Laser absorption, laser emission, and self-emission.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Now, let me talk about what laser emission is.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
You will often see some animation characters on TV.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
They will start to emit gas, and then release gas, or release some big waves.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
A more famous example is the gas bomb in Dragon Ball.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Or like the famous character in the movie, Huo Ying Ren Zhe.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
The concept is similar to the concept of gathering Chakra.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
If you are watching a movie or anime, you can understand.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Laser is a bit similar to this concept.

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
Its principle is basically to amplify your signal, your energy.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
The process is like this.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
First, you will have a passive electron.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
It is in the high-energy state.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
Then, it is affected by a photon.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
So that it goes from high-energy to low-energy.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
As it goes from high-energy state to low-energy state, it will emit the same light.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
The same light as the input signal, including its position and wavelength.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Through this process, one chakra pushes two chakras.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Two chakras pushes four chakras.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
In this way, it can achieve the amplification of energy.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
If we can effectively use this passive radiation,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
we can create the so-called laser component.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
The laser component is very similar to what you have experienced.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Those who have played laser pen or laser know that

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
the more famous properties of laser are

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
it is monochromatic, it has directivity, and it has very good tonality.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
If you use these features,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
the laser can be used as a detector,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
it can be used as a scanner,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
it can be used as a DVD player,

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
it can be used for surgery.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
OK.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Here, you may think,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
why do I put a picture of Einstein?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
First of all, when it comes to laser,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
for people my age,

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
the first thing that comes to mind is the Death Star in Star Wars.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
The Death Star is a very iconic thing.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
In Star Wars, it only took 17 seconds to destroy an entire planet.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Then you will see that it starts to gather laser light,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
then it gathers a little more, and then it destroys a planet.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
So when it comes to Star Wars,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I have to mention Einstein.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
You may think, why?

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
First of all, in a recent interview,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
a reporter asked George Lucas,

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
where did the image of Master Yoda come from?

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Lucas said, it actually came from Einstein.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Because he needed someone who looked crazy,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
but also very powerful, to be the prototype of his image.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
So Einstein is basically the prototype of Master Yoda.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Einstein also inspired the development of laser.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
He was the first to propose laser beam magnification.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
After 40 years of hard work,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Tons and Shallow, these two excellent scientists,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
in the 1950s or so,

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
proposed a truly feasible model of laser components.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Of course, at that time, they didn't really make laser beam.

09:34.000 --> 09:44.000
This concept was learned by someone in the lab next door.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Then in the 1960s,

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
they made the first laser.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
So from the 1960s to 2020,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
it happened to be the 60th anniversary of laser.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
In the past 60 years,

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
at least 7 Nobel Prizes were awarded to laser technology.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Why do I say directly?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Broadly speaking,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Nobel Prizes related to laser technology are actually countless.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
For example,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
last year's Nobel Prize for Gravity Wave Experiment

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
was awarded to gravity wave detection.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Gravity wave detection also relies on laser technology.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Of course, it's not a Nobel Prize directly related to laser technology.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
However, gravity wave detection must rely on laser.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Last year's Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to astronomy.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
Astronomy also requires high-precision measurements using laser.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
So it can be seen that

10:50.000 --> 10:58.000
laser has a significant impact on the development of human science.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
The last Nobel Prize for Laser Technology was awarded in 2018.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
It was awarded to three very important scientists.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Yashijin, Mooroo, and Shukla.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
They have made very original breakthroughs

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
in the application of small and large-power lasers.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Yashijin in particular,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
has invented light-transmission technology.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Mooroo and Shukla

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
have used the method of bombardment

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
to compress the pulse of the laser to a very high energy density.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Today, we have all kinds of large-power lasers

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
that can be used in science and technology.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
When it comes to large-power laser applications,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
we think of destruction.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Not only can lasers be used to destroy,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
but they can also be used for precise destruction.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
This is an example I just gave.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
In the metal phone case you are using now,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
or some precision components,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
we use laser to cut metal surfaces,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
to cut surfaces of different materials,

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
to create micro-level, fine structures.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
However, in addition to destruction,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
lasers can also be used for creation.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
If you look up at the sun in the sky,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
although it should be night in North America,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
but here we are in the morning,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
and it's almost noon,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
so if you look up at the sky,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
you will see a bright red sun.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
It's actually a fusion phenomenon.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
We can use hundreds of lasers

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
to focus on the same small point

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
to create a fusion reaction.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
So lasers can not only be used for destruction,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
but they can also be used for creation.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
On the other hand, when it comes to small-power lasers,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
they are more peaceful.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
They are mainly used for detection,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
measurement, and transmission.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
According to the self-driving technology

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
that you often see on TV,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
there are about three or four detection technologies,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
including ultrasonic, visual recognition,

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
light sensing, and...

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Let me think about it.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It's about these three.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Among them, the so-called light sensor,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
which is called LIDAR in English,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
is mainly used by lasers

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
to accurately measure the surrounding environment.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Because lasers are very high-precision,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
they have very good synchronization.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
So when the laser beam hits the object,

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
it can very accurately detect

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
the distance between the object and the sensor

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
to avoid your self-driving car

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
hitting the objects around it.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
If you are not familiar with self-driving cars

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
or if you are not familiar with LIDAR technology,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
you can see the iPhone.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
If you have an iPhone 10

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
or if you have an iPhone 10 or above,

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
you can see that there is a sensor bar on it.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
In this sensor bar,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
there is a part of it

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
that is filled with laser sensors.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
Apple engineers have filled hundreds of vertical laser sensors

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
with LIDAR technology.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
These lasers can project more than 30,000 light spots

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
every second

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
to detect the surface of your face

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
to identify whether you are a legitimate user of this phone.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
So you might think that

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
we can already fill hundreds of lasers

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
in the size of a miliband.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Is it necessary to continue to reduce the number of lasers?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
In fact, it is necessary.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Let me give you a brief description of our needs.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
You can see the image in the upper right corner.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
It is from Intel's Tech News Room.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Okay.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
In the past few decades,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
you must have heard in the news

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
that TSMC has broken through the 14-nm technology.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
They built a 7-nm factory.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Next, a 5-nm factory.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Next, a 3-nm factory in the U.S.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Next, a 5-nm factory in the U.S.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Next, a 3-nm factory in the U.S.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The number of nanometers

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
refers to the width of the device.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
The number of nanometers

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
refers to the width of the device.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
You will find that the number

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
ranges from large to small.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
We have been making these devices smaller.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
When we make these devices smaller,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
there is a serious problem.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
First, let me jump off the topic of the speech

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
and talk to you about it.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
You can imagine

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
if you have 100 lines

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
from Taipei to Kaohsiung.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
In this case,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I can assure you that

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
there will be almost no traffic.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
But when you reduce 100 lines

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
to 50 lines,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
25 lines,

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
10 lines,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
5 lines,

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
3 lines,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
or even 1 line,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
the same traffic will cause

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
a very serious problem.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Your car may collide with each other.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
You may fall off the highway.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
The traffic may never be resolved.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
This is the problem we face

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
when using electronic components.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Electronic components rely on electronic transmission.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
The interaction between electronic and electronic

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
has the effect of the torque.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
This torque

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
is multiplied by the square of the distance.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
In other words,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
when your line width is getting narrower,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
the interference between electronic and electronic

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
will become very strong.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
This interference

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
will cause

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
80% of the signal

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
in the electronic component

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
to be lost

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
in interconnection.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
This value is

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
about 2 picojoules

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
per bit per centimeter.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You may think that

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
picojoules are about 10 to the power of 12.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
And it's per centimeter.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It feels okay.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
But don't forget

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
that in our daily lives,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
all kinds of applications

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
and all kinds of

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
online activities

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
are connected

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
to several megabytes at any time.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Even if you

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
want to watch

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
4K videos,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
you may be connected

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
to terabytes of

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
information.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
So,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
under these conditions,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
the world is

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
actually

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
wasting a lot of

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
energy on

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
electrical interconnection.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
If you don't have much

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
knowledge about information flow,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
you can think in another way.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
The mobile chip

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
and computer chip

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
we are using now

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
have billions of components.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Okay?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Each component consumes 2 picojoules

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
per second.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
In the long run,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
it's a huge energy loss.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So, under these

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
background conditions,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
people start to think about

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
using light transmission

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
instead of electronic transmission.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Okay?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Light will not

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
interfere with each other.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And you can put different

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
wavelengths of light

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
in the same optical channel.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
So, if you use light

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
to transmit a signal,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
it's about 10 picojoules

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
per centimeter.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
If you use electricity

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
to transmit a signal,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
it's about 1 to 2 orders

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
less,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
which is about 100 times less.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Okay?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
If we want to use light

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
to transmit a signal,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
there must be a wavelength.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
And this wavelength

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
must be the same

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
as the current

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
electronic component technology.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
The so-called matching

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
is that its volume

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
should be about the same.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Okay?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
If you want to use

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
a table-shaped laser

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
to replace our electronic

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
component transmission,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
it's actually unrealistic

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
because it's a little bit of ink.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
We ultimately hope

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
that we can make a component

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
that is completely different from

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
the electronic component

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
and can be perfectly integrated

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
into the existing technology.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Okay?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
So you might want to

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
reduce the volume of the laser.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
But there's a problem here.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And this problem

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
has been a problem

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
for engineers and scientists

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
for a while.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
This problem is

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
the optical wavelength limit.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
The optical wavelength limit

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
tells us that

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
if you want to limit a light,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
the size of your component,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
the dimension of your component

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
must be greater than

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
or equal to the wavelength of the light wave.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Actually, it's easy to imagine.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
If you want to put an elephant

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
in your refrigerator today,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
it's impossible because

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
your refrigerator is smaller

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
than the size of the elephant.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
So you can't effectively

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
put an elephant in your refrigerator.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
In the same way,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
in the field of optics,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
the wavelength limit is

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
a basic obstacle.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You can't

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
limit the light

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
to something

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
smaller than it.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
So,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
in order to overcome this obstacle,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
scientists

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
began to think

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
about other ways

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
to make

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
laser.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
They thought about other ways

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
to make nanoparticles.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
OK.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
First of all,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
back to what I said at the beginning,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I mentioned that

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
laser is like

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
a machine.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
If we look at some

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
elite novels or

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
elite movies,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
those masters,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
they sometimes need to

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
concentrate their energy

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
and then

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
send out their

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
air force.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
OK.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
So,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
when you can't

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
effectively execute

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
your work,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
you can accumulate

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
energy in another way.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
What does it mean?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It's like you change from

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
a computer system or a

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
magic system to a chakra system.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
In my opinion,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
they are all energy systems.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Each energy system

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
has its own characteristics.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
In our field,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
we transform

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
the process of

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
magnification of

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
laser into another form,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
which is called

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
surface electromagnetic field.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Today,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I don't want to practice

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Chinese martial arts anymore.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I want to practice western magic.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I can also let

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
magic operate in my body.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
And because magic

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
has a relatively small energy volume,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I can more effectively

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
accumulate energy in my body

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
to have a better output.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So, the concept is similar.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Engineers

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
and scientists

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
want to

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
replace a

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
smaller object

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
with a

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
smaller object,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
which is called

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
surface electromagnetic field.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Surface electromagnetic field

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
is the electromagnetization

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
of the collective vibration

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
on the metal surface.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
If it can

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
coalesce with light,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
it can produce a new thing

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
called surface plasma polarity.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Surface plasma polarity

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
has some features,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
such as its wavelength

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
is smaller than the wavelength

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
of light waves,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and it has a very fast

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
reaction speed.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
It can also be controlled

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
by electromagnetic field.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So, when I go into

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
the more detailed part,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I will first mention

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
the magical part of

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
surface plasma.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
If you have read this book,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
it is called

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Ligricus Cup.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
It is a cup

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
of a king

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
in the 4th century

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
in Rome.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
This cup has a

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
very special feature.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
When you hit the light

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
from the inside of the cup

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
to the outside,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
you will see red light.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
When you hit the light

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
from the inside of the cup

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
to the outside,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
you will see green light.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Scientists have been

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
confused about this problem

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
since the 1980s.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
They do not know

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
what the principle of operation

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
of this thing is.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Later, they did

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
elemental analysis

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
and found that

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
most of this cup

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
is made of silicon oxide,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
so that they can

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
react with the light

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and produce surface plasma.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
They can effectively

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
concentrate the energy

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
in a very small area

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
to absorb, diffuse

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
or magnify.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Let's go back to the Ligricus Cup.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Why does it have

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
this special feature?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
The outside of the cup

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
is red,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
but the inside is green.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
This is because

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
the gold nanoparticles

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
will be absorbed

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
by the green light

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
of 520 nanometers.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
The surface plasma will

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
absorb the energy.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
When you hit the light

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
from the inside to the outside,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
the green light is absorbed

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and only the red light

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
is reflected.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Why is the outside

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
of the cup green?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
When you hit the light from the inside

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
to the outside,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
the green light

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
of 520 nanometers

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
will be absorbed

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
by the gold nanoparticles

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
in the cup.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
The green light

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
will be absorbed

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
by the gold nanoparticles

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
in the cup.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
The green light

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
will be absorbed

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
by the gold nanoparticles

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
in the cup.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
This is because

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
the surface plasma

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
is very close to the gold nanoparticles.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
When we see red,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
we think it is ruby,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
and green means

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
it is emerald.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
But these two cups

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
neither have gold nanoparticles

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
nor sapphire nanoparticles.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
They are just

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
metal particles

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
mixed with silicon oxide.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Let's talk about

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
the basic properties of metal.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Metal

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
due to its low electromagnetic

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
coating,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
can not fill

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
the chamber effectively.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
So, in a metal block,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
the electrons can move freely

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
without any interference.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
It will be in an inverted state.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
So, for this type of block,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
its capacitance

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
can be described

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
by a model called

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Joule model.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
This model

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
uses background capacitance

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
to subtract the surface plasma

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
resonance frequency

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
minus the resonance frequency

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
plus a damping term.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Surface plasma frequency

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
refers to

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
what kind of frequency

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
it will resonate with.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
In the future,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
when we play in the park,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
we will often

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
swing a swing.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
A swing has

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
a swing frequency.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
When you sit on it,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
you will find that

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
if you can swing

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
along the swing frequency,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
you can swing

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
the swing high and far

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
very quickly.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
In the same way,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
every object

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
has its own resonance frequency.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
The resonance frequency of metal

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
we call it

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Joule frequency.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
This Joule frequency

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
refers to

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
when a beam of light

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
comes in,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
the electrons in the metal

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
will resonate

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
with the light.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
When the resonance frequency

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
is consistent with the resonance frequency of metal,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
it will have the greatest absorption.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
In this case,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
we call

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
this resonance frequency

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
as

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Joule frequency.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Joule frequency is

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
proportional to the

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
root of the electron number.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
This N is the electron number.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Q is the electron number.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Me is the electron quality.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Epsilon zero is the background

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
charge.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Normally,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
the electron density

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
of metal is

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
10 to the power of 25 to the power of 26

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
cubic meters.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
This is the electron density of metal.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
In the physics of quantum mechanics,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
we know that

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
light

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
is composed of frequency

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and wavelength.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Light is composed of frequency

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
and wavelength.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Once you know the resonance frequency,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
you can push

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
the wavelength

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
in the opposite direction.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Once again,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Omega P is the

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
resonance frequency of electron.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Once you know the resonance frequency of electron,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
you will know the wavelength of electron.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
This wavelength

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
is about

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
10 to 100 nanometer.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
It is smaller than

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
the wavelength of visible light.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
When we add a piece of metal

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
and connect it

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
to an electrolytic layer,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
it will form

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
a surface electrode.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
The electrode

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
we just talked about

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
is a three-dimensional electrode.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Now, we reduce

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
its dimension

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
to two dimensions.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
These surface electrodes

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
can only be compensated

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
on the surface of metal and electrolyte.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
This compensation

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
will produce

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
a smaller

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
resonance frequency,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
which is called surface electrode frequency.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Surface electrode frequency

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
is the electrode frequency

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
divided by the root of

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
E plus Epsilon D.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Epsilon D is the

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
capacitance of the electrolyte.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
So,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
the surface electrode

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
will have a dispersion curve

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
like this.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
From this

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
dispersion curve,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
we can see that

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
the surface electrode

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
has a dispersion curve

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
with a very large

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
momentum,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
which is close to

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
the water level.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
If it is close to the water level,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
it means that

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
its wavelength is zero.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
We know that

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
in basic light theory,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
the dispersion curve

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
of light

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
is divided by

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
its speed,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
which is the speed of light

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
in the ring.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Similarly,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
the surface electrode dispersion curve

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
is divided by

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
the speed of light

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
in the ring.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
And,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
the wavelength is zero,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
which means that

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
its speed of light

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
in the ring

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
is very slow.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Its speed of light

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
in the ring

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
is very slow,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
which means that

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
it will exist for a very long time.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
it will have a very strong interaction

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
between light and matter.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Let's imagine that

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
there is a smoke truck

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
in front of you

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and you inhale the exhaust gas.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
If the speed of the truck is very slow,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
you will inhale a lot of exhaust gas.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
If the speed of the truck is very fast,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
you will pass through the snow

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
and you will not inhale the gas.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
in our research,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
the slower the speed of

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
the surface electrode movement,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
the better.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
This means that

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
it can have a very strong interaction

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
with the ring.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
OK.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Now,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
let's take a look at

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
how to do it.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
It's actually very simple.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
That is to say,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
as soon as you see it,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
you will think,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
how can there be such a simple structure?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
In order to achieve the goal

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
of limiting energy

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
by using the surface electrode,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
we adopted the SIN structure.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
This structure

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
was proposed by

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Prof. Chang and his team

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
in 2009.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It is mainly made up of

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
a semiconductor nanocircuit,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
a metal layer,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and an insulator

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
in the middle

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
to form the SIN structure.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
The metal layer

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
is responsible for producing

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
the surface electrode.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
The nanocircuit

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
is responsible for providing

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
the insulator.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
The insulator

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
is responsible for

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
reducing the energy loss

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
and protecting

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
the metal layer.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
So,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
we can quickly understand

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
the whole process

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
through this animation.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
To make such a laser,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
we first have to

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
put a metal layer

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
on top of it

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and then

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
put a nanocircuit on top of it.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The nanocircuit will provide

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
a light-dissipation.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
The light-dissipation will

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
convert the energy

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
to the Surface Plasma Mode.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
The Surface Plasma Mode

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
can reach the collector

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
along the

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
natural laser rectifier

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
and finally

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
release the energy

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
at the end of the laser.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
The Surface Plasma Mode

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
has a wavelength

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
of tens of nanometers.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
In other words,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
we can break

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
the light-dissipation limit

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
and reduce the size

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
of such elements

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
to less than

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
the wavelength of the light wave.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Excuse me,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
can I ask some questions?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Sorry, my name is Ted.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Can we go back

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
to the previous video?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
The one before the animation.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The one before the animation.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
This is the one before the animation.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
What does SPP mean?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Sorry,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
this is one of the questions.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
SPP is...

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Surface Plasma Polariton.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
It is a mixture of

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
surface electrons and light-dissipation.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I see.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I remember that

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
laser requires

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
inversion population.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Can you describe

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
what is the

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
inversion population

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
in the

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
SPP?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
First of all,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
this is our

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
model.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
The traditional

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
laser uses

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
optical rectifier

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
to

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
rectify the light

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
in the rectifier.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
In other words,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
the light will eat

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
many optical gates.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
This type of

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
laser

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
has the same concept.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
It just changes

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
the light,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
which is replaced by

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
surface electrons.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
It uses SPP

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
to rectify the light

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
in the rectifier.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
You can look at

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
this picture.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
At first,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
we will

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
shoot a laser beam

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
to activate the

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
semiconductor material.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
During the activation,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
it will form

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
a crystal.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
This crystal

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
will contribute

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
energy to

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
the plasma.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Just like the traditional

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
optical laser,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
the light will

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
rectify the light

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
in the rectifier.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
This is

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
what I want to answer.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Did I answer

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
your question?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
No.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I think you

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
just mentioned it.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
It's okay.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You can look at

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
the length of the nanowire

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
and some basic

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
information.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
The animation

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
looks like

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
you don't know much about it.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Let me talk about

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
its history.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
When it was first

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
proposed by

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
the team at

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Berkeley,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
they used

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
cadmium sulfide,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
or CDS nanowire.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
The length of the nanowire

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
is several microns

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
along the

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
growth direction

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
of the nanowire.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
However,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
its cross-section

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
is more than

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
one micrometer.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
When it was first

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
developed,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
we were excited

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
because we could

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
effectively limit

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
the energy

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
in at least

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
two dimensions.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
However,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
although the nanowire

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
effectively limits

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
the energy

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
in at least

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
two dimensions,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
its cross-section

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
is more than

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
one micrometer.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
If I'm not wrong,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
it's several micrometers.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
However,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
as a pioneer

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
of paper,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
the result is

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
quite exciting.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
At that time,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Tsinghua University

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
wanted to

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
further reduce the size

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
of the nanowire

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
in three dimensions

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
to the limit of

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
light and snow.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Therefore,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
they adopted

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
a core-shell structure

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
called

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
InGaN-AtGaN.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
The core-shell structure

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
is composed of

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
GaN,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
and InGaN.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
In this way,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
they successfully

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
reduced the size

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
of the nanowire

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
in three dimensions

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
to the limit of

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
light and snow.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
In 2012,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
the first nanowire

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
in three dimensions

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
was reduced to the limit of

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
light and snow.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
However,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Tsinghua University

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
could not effectively

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
increase the operating temperature

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
to room temperature.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
After all,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
it is a more applicable research.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
In other words,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
we still hope that

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
it can play a role

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
in future projects

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
or future technology applications.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Therefore,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
if this type of component

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
cannot be effectively

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
reduced to the limit of

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
light and snow,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
we still hope that

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
it can play a role

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
in future projects.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
In 2014,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Tsinghua University

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
adopted

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
a core-shell structure

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
called InGaN-AtGaN.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
The difference between

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
InGaN-AtGaN and

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
InGaN-AtGaN

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
is that

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
InGaN-AtGaN can reduce

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
the loss of laser.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Reducing the loss of laser

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
is equivalent to

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
decreasing the pre-value.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
If the pre-value is reduced,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
there is no need to

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
consider too many thermal accumulation problems.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
In 2014,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
we started to do

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
laser operation at room temperature.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
My team,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
which is the team of

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Mr. Lu Ting-Chang,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
started to do laser operation

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
at room temperature.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Excuse me,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I have a question.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
My name is Zan Xiang-Yu.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I am a friend of Lanying.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I want to ask

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
since

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
you are using nanowire,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
you said that

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
the length of nanowire

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
may be limited.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Has anyone done

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
nanodots?

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
In fact,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
in 2009,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
there was

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
a team

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
that used

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
nanogold

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
to

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
attach

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
a

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
thin silicon

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
with many holes

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
to the wire.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
The thin silicon

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
with many holes

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
will absorb

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
the organic material.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
The organic material

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
is the GAPE material.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
The thin silicon with many holes

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
is the GAPE material.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
The gold particle

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
is the surfactant.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
It is the zero-dimension

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
surface plasmon.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
The zero-dimension surface plasmon

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
is called localized surface plasmon.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
So,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
in 2009,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
someone did

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
publish a study

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
on Nature.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
However,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
this study

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
never

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
stimulated

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
a single

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
particle.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
As I mentioned,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
it uses gold nanoparticle.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
The nanoparticle

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
is about 10 nanometers.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
However,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
it never

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
stimulated

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
a single particle.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
It never stimulated

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
a single particle.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
So,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
it never

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
stimulated a single particle.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
So,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
it never

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
stimulated

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
a single particle.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
The optical gain of

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
organic materials is very low.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
So,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
someone did this kind of study.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
However,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
the results are not that solid.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
However,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
the results are not that solid.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
The results are not that solid.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
The results are not that solid.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
The results are not that solid.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
The recent development

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
shows

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
that

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
the nanoparticle

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
is smaller than

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
the size of

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
quantum dot.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
In general,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
the size of quantum dot

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
is about 10 nanometers.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
is about 10 nanometers.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
However,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
the recent study

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
shows that

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
the nanoparticle

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
is smaller than

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
the size of

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
quantum dot.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
So,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
this is my understanding.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I may not have any updates recently,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
so if I missed anything,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
I can talk about it again.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Sorry,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
can I continue the question?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
No problem.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
You just mentioned

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
localized surface plasma.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
You just mentioned

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
nanoparticle.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
As far as I know,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
the research on nanoparticle

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
changes the shape of

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
the surface plasma per rhythm

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
frequency.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Does this actually

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
affect the design

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
of your software?

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
For example,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
do you use nanocube,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
nanosphere,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
or other nanoparticles

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
to change the frequency of the laser?

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Yes, it does.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
The surface shape changes

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
depending on

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
the per-cell effect.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
The per-cell effect

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
affects the

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
environment

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
around the

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
surface.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So,

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
the shape of the

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
per-cell effect

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
affects the

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
distribution of

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
light and matter

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
around the

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
surface.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
per-cell effect

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
affects the

surface.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
affects the

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Thank you for your

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
wonderful presentation.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I think it's very good.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Well,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
the next part is

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Q&A. Before you ask

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
questions, because some

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
friends have already

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
asked questions during

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
the conversation.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I will ask them first,

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
and others can

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
think about

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
the questions.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Thank you.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Got it. Thank you.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Okay.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Next question.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I think the next question is quite interesting.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Because I don't think it's a straightforward question.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Someone asked

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
He's a little confused.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
He thinks your excitation

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Your surface plasmon excitation

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Is it from the incident photon?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Or is it from the light excitation from the nanowire?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Okay.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
This part is a little...

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Because there's a cavity, right?

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
So I'm not sure how to answer.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
You tell me. Sorry.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Let me get into the more detailed part.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
First of all,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
How does this process occur?

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Let's start with a light.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
I don't know why the animation is stuck.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Then I'll just use this.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And then we come to the light.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
This light is in the nanowire.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
It's going to trigger the excitation.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And the excitation

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Because he's in

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
When it's a lot of power.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
His dispersion is still very

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
The situation is very fluid.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
So he can effectively take his energy.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Coupled to the surface plasmon mode.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Okay, this is actually quite important.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I didn't mention anything special just now.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
You can see this picture.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
We'll find that the surface plasmon

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Dark mode.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
What does dark mode mean?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
You can't effectively see the light.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
He can only be invisible.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
On the surface.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Because he's under the light line.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
All the dispersion is under the light line.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
You can't use the optical mode.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
The way to see him.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
So,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
This is how we trigger the process.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Through light first

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Exciton in the nanowire.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Exciton in the nanowire.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And the exciton dispersion.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
In a very large range of motion.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It's all very flat.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And he can happen to be with

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Surface plasmon mode.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
When he couples,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
He's going to produce a polariton.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And this polariton.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
He's going to become.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Okay, when he produces a polariton.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
After that, it's us.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Hey.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
That is.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Uh, wait a minute.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
The animation can suddenly be used.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Then I'll just say it.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
First of all, use the light to trigger that.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Semiconductor nanowire.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And then the exciton in the semiconductor nanowire.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
After it comes out, it will give the energy.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Couple to surface plasmon mode.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Polariton.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
That's what we see here.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
This thing that's fair.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
And then how did he release the energy?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
It's through the interface.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
The discontinuity that causes the dispersion.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I'm going to disperse this dark mode.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
So if you're going to go a little bit further.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
How about this kind of laser efficiency?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
To be honest, it's actually pretty bad.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
The first one is his mirror.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
It's based on.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
The interface formed by the change in the refractive index.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
His reflection rate is about.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Only about 20 to 40 percent.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
The limit is about 40.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
In fact, we're going to go through the software.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
It's about 20 percent.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
The other one is.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
He's going to go out of the way.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
He's going to go through the interface.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Continuous dispersion.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It's not enough.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
The part that's not enough.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
To be able to couple to light mode.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Otherwise, it's the same.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Dark mode.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So this is the part that I'm not going to talk about.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
In order to overcome this issue in the future.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
We have to be at his.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
The two ends of the point.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
To design.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Or design.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Such a structure.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
To be able to put these dark mode.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Energy in the highest efficiency way.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Come out.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
What about the current stage of research?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Almost no.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
He's on the edge of the place.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
To do any.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Reflective structure.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
It's not about the edge.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
To do any.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
The structure design.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
So the raw material.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
His energy conversion efficiency.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
It's actually very bad.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And his orientation.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
It's not as good as our traditional laser.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
So good.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Because it's through the dispersion.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
To make up for the insufficient momentum.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Let him be able to.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Couple to light mode.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Let him be able to.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Couple to light mode.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
This is what I want to say.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
This is what I want to say.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I didn't particularly talk about these details.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Because I want to say that everyone's.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
The background is south and north.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
If you have a more detailed part.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
If you want to ask.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
You are welcome to ask.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Okay.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Actually, I still have a problem.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
But I think we are today.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
It's a bit long.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I've been talking for too long.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I didn't eat anything.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I didn't pay much attention.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Most people are here.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
So it's very exciting.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Please open the microphone again.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Let's give it up again.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Thank you for the wonderful speech.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Thank you for the wonderful speech.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Thank you for the wonderful speech.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I'm going to put this here.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
The event is over here.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
But I'm just.
