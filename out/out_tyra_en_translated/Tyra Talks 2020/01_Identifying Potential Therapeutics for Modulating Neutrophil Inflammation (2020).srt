1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The recording has started.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good evening, everyone.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Sorry, let me talk first.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Welcome everyone to the Taira Talk on March 28th.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We are honored to invite Alan Xu to give a speech for us today.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Alan Xu was a medical student at Chenggong University when he was in college.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He majored in dengue and other blood-related diseases.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He is now a Ph.D. student at Purdue University.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today's topic is

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Identifying Potential Therapeutics for Modulating Neutrophil Inflammation.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Before the speech, let's give Alan a round of applause.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Remember to turn on your microphones when you applaud.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Please turn on your microphones.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thank you.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's give Alan some time.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Today, I would like to share something different with everyone.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As Jason mentioned,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
our research focuses on how to use new methods to get immune cells to control our immune system

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
in order to reach a low level of inflammation,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but at the same time, to fight against diseases.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
First, I will divide my talk into a brief background introduction.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then, I will talk about the so-called gene selection.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Finally, I will share with you what we found.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
First, I would like to introduce Neutrophil.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Neutrophil is commonly known as neutrophil.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You may have seen it on Facebook or YouTube.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
In 1953, David Rodgers photographed a neutrophil running after bacteria.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Next to it are red blood cells.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is the most common neutrophil in our blood.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
40% to 60% of the white blood cells in our blood are neutrophil.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Neutrophil is the fastest-moving cell in our body.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It can be seen in real time.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Neutrophil can be followed by bacteria.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Neutrophil is the first cell to reach the infection site.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Neutrophil is no longer divided or separated.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Neutrophil often has these lobes.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How does Neutrophil reach the infection site?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Neutrophil circulates in the bloodstream.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There are some adhesive receptors on the outside of our blood vessels.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Neutrophil will roll on the outside of the blood vessels and stick to the adhesive receptors.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Finally, the adhesive receptors are attached to the adhesive receptors.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The adhesive receptors are extrapolated or transmigrated.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The adhesive receptors enter the stem cell.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
After entering the stem cell, we will feel the so-called red hot pain.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
These are the adhesive cells.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When Neutrophil reaches the infection site, it will perform many functions.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It will release a lot of cytokines.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
These cytokines can let more Neutrophil in.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,000
These cytokines can also let other immune cells, such as macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, etc.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
However, cytokines are very important for the transmission of information and speech.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
However, too much cytokines can cause hemorrhage and shock.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Neutrophil can also perform phagocytosis.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Neutrophil can directly swallow microorganisms.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
After swallowing, Neutrophil will release some free radicals, ROS, to break them down.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
ROS can also be placed outside the cell to cause the whole organ to develop and attract more immune cells and a reaction to develop.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
However, too many free radicals will cause oxidation.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So, we often say that we should avoid drinking tea, reduce free radicals, and reduce aging.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is because these free radicals will cause organ damage, which is not good for too many people.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Neutrophil's most famous function is called Net Formation, or Neutrophil Accelerator Trap.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When Neutrophil finds that its own immune response is too strong or too many bacteria are around it, it can't do anything by itself.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When we watch movies, we see this hero or male supporting role.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,000
When Neutrophil finds that there are too many enemies, it will usually hold a hand grenade and directly return to these bacteria, or return to the enemy.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
At this time, Neutrophil will release its DNA, which is the DNA in this box, outside the cell to form a sticky web-like thing called Net.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This name is very similar.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It can trap these bacteria or viruses there.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There are also some enzymes on this Net that can help break them down.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This Net itself can also be used as a function to attract immune cells.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
However, too many of these Nets will actually cause body immunity.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Because our body's immune system does not recognize DNA as a substance by training, so sometimes it will cause body immunity.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Generally, in the ideal case, Neutrophil does not have excessive inflammation.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When Neutrophil plays its role, Neutrophil will have apoptosis and die.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
These impurities will be devoured by macrophages, which is another type of cell.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Then the inflammation will slow down.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Otherwise, Neutrophil can climb back to its blood vessels and continue to circulate.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I hope that through these functions, we can make it easier for everyone to understand.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The first cell to reach the inflammation site, how does it do it?

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
How does it decide?

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Often it will decide the outcome of our inflammation.

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Will it kill?

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Will it successfully eliminate our foreign bacteria or viruses?

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So we have to find a way to study if there is a new way to control the reaction of inflammation.

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why do we need to control the reaction of inflammation?

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
As I said four times, it is a balance.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It is like the cover of a science magazine.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We need it, but too much is not good.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because of the recent COVID-19 epidemic, I just took this example to tell you why people die from COVID-19.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is a lung cancer of our lungs, aviola.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Usually this aviola has air.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
At this time, the SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, will infect the epidermal cells of our aviola.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The epidermal cells will die.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The cells will also send out some life-saving signals.

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The neutrophils will run from the aviola to the lung tissue.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
At the same time, the inflammation of the aviola will also cause a rise in blood vessels.

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then the aviola will have a hemorrhage.

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So a lot of immune cells will eliminate bacteria and kill viruses here.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
At the same time, the aviola will have a hemorrhage.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The inflammation of the aviola will cause a positive feedback.

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This will cause a lot of bystander effects.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What is a bystander effect?

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
In addition to killing viruses, it kills the virus-infected cells.

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So the tissue of our lungs will be injured.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Injured, there will be a stronger inflammation.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then there will be more immune cells.

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So it will slowly make our lungs water.

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
At the same time, we can't have enough oxygen.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
When there is not enough oxygen, there will be shortness of breath.

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's breathing difficulty.

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
In the end, lack of oxygen will also cause our organs to lose oxygen.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you don't get oxygen, you will die from organ failure.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
People who die from organ failure will die.

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So basically 90% of people who die from COVID-19 are ARDS.

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ARDS is an over-infection-induced disease.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But we need it to eliminate the infection of our virus.

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So how to balance this is very important.

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In our lab, the model we use is an aviola model.

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let me introduce this aviola to you first.

118
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If you are not familiar with it,

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What you see in this video is a three-day aviola.

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Its neutral field is marked with GFP, a fluorescent protein.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It is found that its neutral field is divided into two groups.

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
One is in CHT, which is equivalent to our bone marrow.

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So it doesn't move much.

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The other is in the head.

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It will perform some random migration.

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It will move randomly.

127
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why is aviola a good reason to study neutral field?

128
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
First, because the whole animal is transparent.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So it's easy to shoot.

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So you can see if you make some genetic or pharmacological changes.

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You can see the behavior of these cells.

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can see it in real time.

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Second, because this aviola lives in the water.

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It is a organ.

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Because our organs, whether lungs or stomach, are basically soaked in our mucosa.

136
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It is mucosal immunity.

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Because it also lives in the water.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So its outer skin is equivalent to the inner skin of our lungs.

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So it is also a good reason to study immune cells.

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Some important reasons are that its immune system,

141
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Especially the adenovirus immune system.

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Neutral field is a member of the adenovirus immune system.

143
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It is very similar to mammals, such as mice or humans.

144
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So its shape, or its evolution,

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And some of its functions are actually very similar to our neutral field.

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Finally, a more practical reason is that

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Because this fish is very small.

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like this whole fish is only about three centimeters.

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's 0.3 centimeters.

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So it's very small.

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You can raise a lot of fish at the same time.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There is not much space to stand.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And a pair of male and female fish can give birth to more than 100 small fish.

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So it's good to do some medical research.

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is just a brief introduction to everyone.

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This zebrafish is a neutral field.

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is a zebrafish, a neutral field,

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
H.E. stain is the color of the blood.

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is a mouse.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is our human.

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So it's actually about the same size.

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There is also this so-called cell box.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is a form of compartmentalization.

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is just a few videos to tell you about the function of this zebrafish's neutral field.

165
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So this red one is the big intestine.

166
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's in the zebrafish.

167
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This green one is the zebrafish's neutral field.

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So he just saw that the green one would come and swallow the red one.

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's what we just talked about.

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is a free machine assay.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So this MPO myoperoxidase is a free machine.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It is marked as green.

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then we have this zebrafish's neutral field marked as red.

174
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So you see that this red and green are intertwined like this.

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In fact, it shows that the zebrafish's neutral field is going to release the free machine.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The last example is to talk about this neptosis.

177
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So we just said that we can release the net value of this neutral field.

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So this DAPI is a cell box.

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This cell box has DNA.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
DNA is scattered out of the package.

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So at the same time, you can also see the effects on it.

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
MPO elastase.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So it means that this zebrafish's neutral field is actually quite similar to the functions of humans.

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So it's just to introduce to you that it can be used to study a good model or model of neutral field biology.

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Let me give you a little bit of a change of flavor.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let me introduce another thing that we are interested in.

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's called microRNA.

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:36,000
MicroRNA is a very short 20 to 22-digit nucleotide.

189
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's DNA.

190
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It can exist from DNA.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It exists in exon and intron.

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It can exist anywhere in our gene.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When it is transferred by our polymerase transcription to RNA, it will have this hairpin structure.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
From this hairpin structure, it will be processed and transported to the outside of our cell box.

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
After it is transported to the outside of the cell box, it will be processed again.

196
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Then it becomes a single 20 to 22-digit RNA complex.

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It will identify the target mRNA, which is our messenger RNA, with its other machinery, which is called Ritz complex.

198
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This messenger RNA is usually used to make protein.

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
To suppress it.

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Either the whole mRNA will be broken down.

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Otherwise, it will stop its transfer and prevent it from becoming protein.

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So these microRNAs are like a small key.

203
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Instead of controlling whether this gene is expressed or not.

204
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It says it doesn't matter if you express it.

205
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But I can use this microRNA to suppress and adjust the amount of protein it expresses.

206
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Adjust it on the level of RNA.

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because this microRNA adjustment method is often not a one-off.

208
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Because the expression of your gene is a one-off.

209
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Either it's open or it's closed.

210
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Of course, you can adjust how much it is.

211
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But this is still a more absolute.

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
This microRNA suppression phenomenon can often be adjusted.

213
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
For example, 100 mRNAs can only inhibit or suppress half.

214
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So it becomes a fine tuning.

215
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Because we just said that we have to adjust the expression.

216
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We can't turn off the whole expression.

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Otherwise, people will die.

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So we have to adjust it.

219
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This microRNA actually has another feature.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Because it's a 22-nucleotide.

221
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A single microRNA can become a target for many mRNAs.

222
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
In other words, a single key can open many locks.

223
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Or match many transcripts.

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
In evolution, these microRNAs will often target a pathway.

225
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There are many related genes on a pathway.

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It means that I can inhibit you walking today.

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It can also inhibit you from eating.

228
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It can also inhibit you from sleeping.

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
All of these functions can be done by a single microRNA.

230
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
To make a person feel uncomfortable.

231
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This microRNA is evolutionary conserved.

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It is found in small insects and fruits.

233
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It is found in all biological phenomena.

234
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
From cancer to plant growth to cell division.

235
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There are probably microRNAs involved.

236
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because they have this feature.

237
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It has been reported as the next generation of medicine.

238
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We are also trying to identify some microRNAs.

239
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
To adjust or balance the development of neutrophils.

240
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sorry, I have a question.

241
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Can I go back to the last page?

242
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This may be a very basic question.

243
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But mRNA is messenger RNA.

244
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Is it converted to protein outside the cell?

245
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes.

246
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I thought RNA is inside the cell.

247
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let me explain.

248
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Our DNA is in the nucleus.

249
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It will be converted into the nucleus.

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
All RNAs are converted into the nucleus.

251
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Some of them will be on the nucleus.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Ribosome will be made into protein.

253
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Some of them will be transported to the nucleus.

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There are many ribosomes there.

255
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Most of them are in the ER.

256
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The so-called intracellular network.

257
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It is actually inside another cell.

258
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Can mRNA be transmitted between cells?

259
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No, between the nucleus and the nucleus.

260
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Our nucleus has two layers.

261
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I see.

262
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I understand.

263
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Sorry.

264
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I have a question.

265
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
About the next generation of medicine.

266
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
How can we avoid the off-target of microRNA?

267
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's a great question.

268
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I will talk about the next generation of medicine.

269
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There are two strategies.

270
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
One is to treat microRNA as our friend.

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
For example, microRNA34 can be used to suppress cell proliferation.

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
MicroRNA29 can be used to treat lung cancer.

273
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's right.

274
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There are two levels of off-target.

275
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
One is the off-target of human organs.

276
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
MicroRNA can be stored in liposomes or carriers.

277
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It can be used to treat liver cancer.

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Liver cancer is easy to treat.

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Liver and kidneys are the organs of human organs.

280
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There are many special markers in the lungs.

281
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
MicroRNA can be linked to these markers.

282
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It will be enriched in the lungs.

283
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
MicroRNA can be stored in other organs.

284
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
However, the amount of microRNA will be less than the target.

285
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The question you asked is very good.

286
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
MicroRNA therapy in the blood is difficult to do.

287
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because the blood cells are too complicated.

288
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We can't overcome this.

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
In other aspects, such as mRNA122.

290
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You can inhibit microRNA122.

291
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can avoid the infection of HCV.

292
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's the same as liver cancer.

293
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Inhibition 155.

294
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Inflammation.

295
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Inflammation of the whole body.

296
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Inflammation of the whole body.

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Another level of microRNA off-targeting is

298
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
whether the hairpin recognizes what you want to recognize.

299
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This can only be confirmed by experiment.

300
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Because each cell expresses a different gene profile.

301
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's why we have different cells.

302
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Because our dye cells are all the same.

303
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We can only verify and exclude the different gene profiles.

304
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Did I answer your question?

305
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes, thank you.

306
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You made it very clear.

307
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Thank you.

308
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This is the part of microRNA therapy.

309
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We can inhibit it.

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
How do we inhibit it?

311
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's easy.

312
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If we go back here, we can see that

313
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
the microRNA itself comes from a hairpin.

314
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's a hairpin.

315
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We can give it a complementary strand.

316
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We can absorb it like a sponge.

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Then it won't be able to work.

318
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is a way to inhibit it.

319
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What we are more interested in is

320
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
directly using this microRNA to off-target.

321
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Before I start, let me summarize for everyone.

322
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We are going to talk about this research today.

323
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Basically, we are going to identify which microRNA

324
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and its downstream mRNA

325
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
can be used for translational inhibition.

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That is to inhibit it or

327
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to separate the messenger RNA.

328
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
To inhibit Neutrophil migration.

329
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Why do we want to choose Neutrophil migration

330
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
as our readout?

331
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
First, because

332
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
we just introduced that

333
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Neutrophil has too many functions.

334
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It has a free machine, a package, and a net.

335
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So it's too difficult for you to look at it first.

336
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Why don't we

337
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
flatten the curve?

338
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's the same thing.

339
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But on a more human level.

340
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We don't want Neutrophil to enter

341
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
as soon as possible.

342
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We want it to enter slowly.

343
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So it's easier for your body to adjust.

344
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Your hair is easier to adjust.

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
This is our strategy.

346
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So we hope that

347
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
at the Neutrophil recruitment level,

348
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
we can flatten the curve

349
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to prevent over-inflammation.

350
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Whether it's asthma,

351
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
joint inflammation,

352
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
or multiple sclerosis.

353
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Including ARDS,

354
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
which is also an over-inflammation.

355
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But at the same time,

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
we still have to keep a function.

357
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Because now on the market,

358
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
all the treatments for this immune disease

359
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
are like our endocrine

360
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
or some corticosteroids.

361
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Or some specific immune suppressors.

362
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But the problem is that

363
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
these things will bring

364
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the defect of your immune system.

365
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Then you may have a very serious cold.

366
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So what we are going to answer today is

367
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
which microRNA can do this.

368
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Can prevent Neutrophil migration

369
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
from being so much.

370
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But at the same time,

371
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
it can keep our immune system.

372
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What are its MRNAs?

373
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Maybe we can go and study

374
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
which of its lower genes

375
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
can control Neutrophil.

376
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So this is the second part.

377
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We are going to start discussing this screen.

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Does anyone have any questions here?

379
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So the method we use

380
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
is an overexpression screen.

381
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So we are going to sequence

382
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
all the two types of cells.

383
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Neutrophil and epidermal cells.

384
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Why do we use this type of cell?

385
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Because I just mentioned

386
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Neutrophil is a type of cell

387
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that has a very large number of

388
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
active or unactive proteins.

389
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Or its turnover is very fast.

390
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It is very active.

391
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Compared to our epidermal cells,

392
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
like you and me,

393
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the epidermal cells are basically

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
not very active.

395
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So its cytoskeleton,

396
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
the cell skeleton,

397
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
is relatively stable.

398
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So we went to see

399
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
the microRNAs

400
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
between these two cells.

401
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And we found that

402
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
there is a difference

403
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
in the amount of microRNAs

404
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
in the epidermal cells.

405
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So there are

406
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
340 microRNAs

407
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
in the epidermal cells.

408
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We found that

409
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
90 microRNAs are lower in Neutrophil.

410
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Let me explain to you here.

411
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Neutrophil cells

412
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
because we know that

413
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
in most cases,

414
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
microRNAs suppress certain mRNAs

415
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
or suppress a certain

416
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
biological reaction.

417
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So what we want to take today

418
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
is to put it back

419
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
so that it can do its function

420
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and slow it down.

421
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So we let it

422
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
put something in a faster cell

423
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
to slow it down.

424
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So we choose this lower

425
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Neutrophil.

426
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
In these 90 targets,

427
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
after we classify it a little bit,

428
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
we have 50 candidates.

429
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So these 50

430
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
microRNA families

431
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
are relatively low

432
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
in Neutrophil

433
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
compared to the epidermal cells.

434
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So now we're going to put it back

435
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and see if we can

436
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
slow down the Neutrophil

437
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
recruitment.

438
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
This is a little bit

439
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
more complicated,

440
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
but this is our over-expression construct.

441
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
How do we

442
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
express this thing?

443
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We can't express it in Neutrophil.

444
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So we have to use

445
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
a thing called Neutrophil-specific promotion.

446
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This kind of start

447
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
will only open and express

448
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
in Neutrophil.

449
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This is called Lysine.

450
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We put our

451
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
microRNA hairpin

452
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
in an intron,

453
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
so it won't affect the gene expression.

454
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So it's like Neutrophil

455
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
expressing a microRNA.

456
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
At the same time, how do we know

457
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
this gene?

458
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We designed the exon 1

459
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
to splice the dendrite 2 protein.

460
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
This is very complicated,

461
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
but this dendrite 2 protein is basically

462
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
a green protein.

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Because it's all

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
a construct,

465
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
it's all a gene

466
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
that turns down.

467
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So if there is a microRNA,

468
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
this cell will be green

469
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and only occurs in Neutrophil.

470
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
This is more complicated.

471
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Then we put

472
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
all 50 targets here

473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
into the structure of the hairpin

474
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and replace them one by one.

475
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And then one by one,

476
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
this is a single cell

477
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
of the hematoma.

478
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is the hematoma.

479
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This is its egg yolk.

480
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This is its cell.

481
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Then three days later,

482
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
we will select

483
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
which hematoma

484
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
has Neutrophil

485
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and which hematoma has dendrite 2 protein.

486
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
After the selection,

487
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
we will

488
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
inject

489
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
pseudomonas

490
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
directly into the

491
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
hematoma's ears.

492
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
This will make it

493
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
look at the

494
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
green Neutrophil recruitment.

495
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So the phenomenon we see

496
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
is like this.

497
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This is the hematoma's ears.

498
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You can see the red bacteria here.

499
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
They will come to the ears

500
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
to do their immune response.

501
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
If we find

502
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
a microRNA over-expression,

503
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
which is to express this microRNA

504
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
by this construct,

505
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
you will see that

506
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
these Neutrophil

507
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
either haven't gotten here

508
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
or don't want to get here.

509
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So they didn't

510
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
get the successful recruitment.

511
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So from

512
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
our 50 candidates,

513
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
we sifted out

514
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
9 microRNAs

515
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
with similar phenomena.

516
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They will have less

517
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
to the ears.

518
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So this is

519
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
how we

520
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
raise these 9 microRNAs

521
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
into the so-called

522
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
stable line.

523
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Every cell

524
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
of this fish

525
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
has this construct

526
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
at the DNA level.

527
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But only in Neutrophil

528
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
will it be expressed.

529
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So these 9

530
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
are our microRNAs.

531
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
After we have

532
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
this stable transgenic line,

533
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
we verify again

534
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
to infect its ears

535
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
or use another

536
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
so-called sterile inflammation,

537
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
which is

538
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
non-infective

539
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
inflammation.

540
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So we cut it off

541
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and look at Neutrophil's

542
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
recruitment.

543
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You will find that

544
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
in general,

545
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
it is consistent

546
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
with our transgenic screen.

547
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
This is the screen

548
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
on the page above.

549
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
This microRNA199-3

550
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
has two models.

551
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Whether it's infection

552
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
or tail wounding,

553
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
the ratio of recruitment

554
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
is this gray bar,

555
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the contrast group.

556
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
After expressing this microRNA,

557
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
you will find that

558
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
it drops the most.

559
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So we want to study

560
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
some biological functions of

561
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
this microRNA199.

562
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
First of all,

563
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
we need to determine

564
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
the expression of

565
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
this microRNA199

566
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
compared to the baseline

567
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
in Neutrophil.

568
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Because it may only

569
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
cause this phenomenon

570
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
when the computer crashes.

571
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So we did a

572
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
microRNA QRT

573
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
to measure

574
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
how much microRNA199

575
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
will affect other microRNAs.

576
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We found that

577
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
microRNA223 and microRNA227

578
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
are high microRNAs

579
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
in Neutrophil.

580
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But microRNA199,

581
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
because we have overexpressed it,

582
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
is about 1,000 times higher.

583
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So it means that

584
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it is 1,000 times higher

585
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
than other microRNAs.

586
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So we are safe to assume that

587
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
the phenomenon of microRNA199

588
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
is really caused by

589
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the overexpression of microRNA199,

590
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
not because other microRNAs

591
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
are all dropped.

592
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
At the same time,

593
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
we need to see

594
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
whether the reduction of

595
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
recruitment is caused by

596
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
the overexpression of microRNA199

597
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
or its own

598
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
inability to develop

599
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
or functional differences.

600
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So we went to see

601
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
that the number of Neutrophils

602
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
in each fish

603
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
is similar to that of vectors,

604
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
which means that

605
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
it is not caused by

606
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
a total reduction of Neutrophils.

607
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Because the reduction of recruitment

608
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
you see today may be

609
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
because Neutrophils are less

610
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
so you can't see this phenomenon.

611
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So we need to see

612
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
whether the Neutrophils

613
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
are going to develop

614
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
or not.

615
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So this is a zebrafish.

616
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This is what we call a stable line.

617
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Each Neutrophil is green.

618
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
This is a vector.

619
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So you can see that

620
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Neutrophils are moving very,

621
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
very fast.

622
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You can see that

623
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Neutrophils are moving very,

624
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
very fast.

625
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So the question is

626
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
when the Neutrophils

627
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
are overexpressed,

628
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
the Neutrophils will still move.

629
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's just that

630
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
it will still move,

631
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
but it will move slower than others.

632
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So it's possible that

633
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
it really doesn't want to go

634
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
or it just walks slowly.

635
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
At least we know that

636
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the zebrafish walks slowly.

637
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
As for whether it doesn't want to go,

638
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
we will study it later.

639
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
What I want to introduce to you

640
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
is the zebrafish Neutrophil.

641
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
No matter how similar it is to humans,

642
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
it is still

643
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
not a human Neutrophil.

644
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But in our field,

645
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
the biggest problem

646
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
of Neutrophil research is

647
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
that this human Neutrophil

648
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
is no longer fragmented,

649
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
so it is difficult

650
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
to make any genetic

651
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
modifications or mutations.

652
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So in our field,

653
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
the zebrafish Neutrophil is a

654
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
cell type called HL60.

655
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
This cell type

656
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
is a Neutrophil's

657
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
anterior cell.

658
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
In this anterior cell,

659
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
it will be fragmented and split.

660
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
We can make some genetic

661
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
modifications to it,

662
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and then divide it into Neutrophils.

663
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But it won't be a complete Neutrophil.

664
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's just a Neutrophil similar to humans.

665
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
At least it's human.

666
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Because this is a microRNA,

667
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
we don't want this microRNA

668
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
to be affected

669
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in the process of splitting.

670
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So we had to adopt

671
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
an inducible system,

672
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
that is, we can use a switch.

673
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
What does this switch mean?

674
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It means that we first put this

675
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
new construct

676
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
into our HL60

677
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
cell,

678
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and then make a antigen,

679
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
puromycin, to select it.

680
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So as long as there is

681
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
an HL60

682
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
in its gene,

683
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
it can be immune to this antigen.

684
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
When we need

685
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
this microRNA to be expressed,

686
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
we give it a doxycycline,

687
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
a chemical substance,

688
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
a four-ring type,

689
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
which is also an antigen

690
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and an antibiotic.

691
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
This stimulates the

692
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
hairpin in the middle

693
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and the green one will be expressed.

694
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
This is a bit complicated.

695
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Anyway, because we don't want

696
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
this microRNA to be expressed at any time,

697
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
it will affect its splitting.

698
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So we use such an inducible system.

699
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We can share a few photos with you.

700
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So the normal cell is

701
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
dense, and then after splitting,

702
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
some of it will die,

703
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
but basically it is still splitting.

704
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You can see that this little bit of green

705
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
is the doxycycline

706
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
to turn it on.

707
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Of course, the degree of green

708
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
is different,

709
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
but these green cells successfully

710
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
split and express the microRNA we want.

711
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This microRNA199

712
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
is very important,

713
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and it is very lucky

714
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
that its Bermuda microRNA199

715
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
is exactly the same as the

716
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
human microRNA199 series,

717
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
which is the series of 20 to 22

718
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
editing we mentioned earlier.

719
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The part I circled

720
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
is the 2nd to 8th editing

721
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
in the microRNA,

722
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
which is called the seed sequence,

723
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
which is its core binding.

724
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It mainly relies on this seed sequence

725
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
to identify its target.

726
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So if you think about it,

727
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
it is actually a series of 6 to 7 edits.

728
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because we have 4 types of edits,

729
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
A, T, C, G,

730
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
so it's 4 to 6 to 7 squares.

731
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
This is actually quite specific.

732
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So the first thing we saw

733
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
was that we chose

734
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
this microRNA199 cell expression.

735
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We found that

736
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
it was only

737
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
when the switch was turned on,

738
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
it was only the top line of

739
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
microRNA199,

740
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and the other two microRNAs,

741
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the microRNA in the neutral field,

742
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
had no effect.

743
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
At the same time,

744
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
we also used another random microRNA,

745
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
microRNA100.

746
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
This is not something we are interested in.

747
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's just because I'm afraid

748
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
that this construct itself

749
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
will cause a sequelae.

750
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So we put these cells

751
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
in a thing called a transwell.

752
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
This transwell,

753
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'll explain it to you.

754
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's a kind of

755
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
nipple groove.

756
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
The groove above

757
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
is where we put our cells.

758
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
At the bottom of this groove

759
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
is a small hole.

760
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This small hole is not big enough

761
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
for the cells to fall in,

762
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
but the cells can squeeze in.

763
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's a bit like the neutral field

764
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that we introduced earlier.

765
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It can squeeze the transwell

766
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
into the tissue.

767
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
At the bottom,

768
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
we put something that can attract them.

769
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
In this case,

770
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
we put something called FMLP.

771
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's a small peptide

772
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that the bacteria release.

773
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We found that

774
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
if we

775
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
use FMLP

776
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
to attract it,

777
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and if we don't activate it,

778
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
these three cells

779
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
will go down

780
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
in the same way.

781
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You can see that the white bars are the same.

782
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Similarly,

783
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
if you give it a construct,

784
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
whether it's an empty vector,

785
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
199 or 100,

786
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
but you don't give it

787
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
anything that can attract it,

788
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
they won't go over.

789
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You have to squeeze this hole

790
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
to consume energy,

791
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
so it won't do anything meaningful.

792
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
However,

793
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
if you give it

794
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
FMLP again,

795
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
you will find that

796
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
this random microRNA

797
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
is similar to our empty vector,

798
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
but only when you express 199,

799
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
its penetrability

800
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
will decrease.

801
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's exactly the same as what we saw

802
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
in the Bermuda Triangle.

803
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It can't recruit

804
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
to the place we want.

805
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This proves that this microRNA 199

806
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
is useful in both

807
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
human and Bermuda Triangle systems.

808
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Next, we want to ask

809
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
what is the target of this 199

810
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
to make it useful.

811
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
We need to

812
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
identify the mechanism below it.

813
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This is a

814
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
adult Bermuda triangle.

815
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Bermuda triangle

816
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
is different from humans.

817
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Its structure is not in the bones,

818
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but in its growth.

819
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This Bermuda triangle is called kidney marrow.

820
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Let's take this kidney marrow out.

821
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You can see that these green cells

822
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
are the neutrophils we saw earlier.

823
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Let's use the method of

824
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
eukaryotic cells

825
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
to separate the cells.

826
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Because it's green,

827
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
it has green light,

828
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
let's use RNA

829
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
to measure its RNA level.

830
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Let's see

831
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
the expression of each RNA.

832
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Do you remember

833
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
what I said earlier?

834
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
This microRNA will target

835
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the target mRNA.

836
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
If it successfully targets,

837
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the mRNA may be reduced.

838
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So the level of expression

839
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
will decrease.

840
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Surprisingly,

841
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
as I mentioned earlier,

842
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
the neutrophils are not

843
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
separated.

844
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
However,

845
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
we can see from the

846
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
profile of the RNA

847
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that some cells are

848
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
separated.

849
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Some cells

850
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
are

851
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
separated.

852
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
This is very illogical.

853
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
These cells are not

854
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
separated.

855
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Why are these

856
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
cells separated?

857
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
First, let's see

858
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
if this is true.

859
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Let's verify

860
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
its expression

861
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
by using RNA.

862
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We found that

863
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
CDK1 is a cell cycle gene.

864
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It is not on our

865
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
reduction list.

866
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
CDK2 and CDK5

867
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
are all cell cycle genes.

868
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Indeed, when you express

869
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
microRNA199,

870
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the sequence is true.

871
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
However, there is no explanation.

872
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Let me explain to you

873
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
the cell cycle.

874
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
In the case of cell splitting,

875
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
there are two

876
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
same colored cells.

877
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The DNA replication

878
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
will be copied

879
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
into the so-called double cell.

880
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
The mitosis

881
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
will be captured by the

882
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
microtubule and split into two cells.

883
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
In general,

884
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
when we use

885
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
HL60,

886
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
we will find that

887
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
it depends on the amount of DNA.

888
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
There is a green peak.

889
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
This is the amount of DNA

890
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
in a single cell.

891
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
The S phase

892
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
is the replication.

893
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
When we go to the G2 phase,

894
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it is already determined that

895
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
it is a double cell.

896
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Therefore, the amount of DNA

897
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
in a single cell

898
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
is the same.

899
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Let's take a look at

900
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the neutrophil

901
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
represented by

902
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
the light-C promoter.

903
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Indeed,

904
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
the neutrophil is not

905
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
replicated.

906
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It is in the case of

907
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
G0 and G1.

908
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Before we start

909
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
to study CDK2,

910
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
we need to understand

911
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
the microRNA199 sequence.

912
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This is the seed sequence.

913
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It is the binding sequence

914
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
at the core.

915
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
In the human CDK2 gene

916
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and the Danish CDK2 gene,

917
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
there are places

918
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
that can bind directly.

919
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
G will bind to C,

920
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
A will bind to T, etc.

921
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
They are divided into 6-mer sites

922
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and 7-mer sites.

923
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
They are

924
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
predicted to bind.

925
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
We can use

926
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
computer algorithms

927
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
to predict that G0 and G1

928
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
can bind directly to CDK2.

929
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Is it true?

930
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
We need to verify it.

931
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Therefore,

932
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
we created

933
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
two versions

934
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
of CDK2.

935
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
One is that

936
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
the predicted binding site

937
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
can be

938
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
replicated.

939
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
If

940
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
G0 and G1

941
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
can be replicated,

942
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
then the predicted binding site

943
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
can be replaced.

944
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If G0 and G1

945
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
can be replaced,

946
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
then the predicted binding site

947
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
can be replaced.

948
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
We created

949
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
a Luciferase assay.

950
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Let me introduce it to you.

951
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
There are two constructs.

952
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
First,

953
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the CDK2

954
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
3'-UTR

955
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
is placed here.

956
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Next,

957
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
the R

958
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
is placed here.

959
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Finally,

960
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the F

961
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
is placed here.

962
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
These are the two constructs.

963
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
They do not change.

964
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
If

965
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
the CDK2

966
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
3'-UTR

967
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
is replaced,

968
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
then the R

969
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Luciferase

970
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
will be degraded.

971
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
If

972
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
the CDK2

973
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
3'-UTR

974
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
is replaced,

975
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
then the R

976
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Luciferase

977
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
will be degraded.

978
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
If

979
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
the CDK2

980
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
3'-UTR

981
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
is replaced,

982
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
then the R

983
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Luciferase

984
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
will be degraded.

985
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
If the CDK2

986
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
3'-UTR

987
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
is replaced,

988
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
then the R

989
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Luciferase

990
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
will be degraded.

991
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
If the CDK2

992
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
3'-UTR

993
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
is replaced,

994
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
then the R

995
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Luciferase

996
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
will be degraded.

997
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The reason why the CDK2

998
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
3'-UTR

999
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
is degraded is that

1000
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
the CDK2

1001
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
3'-UTR

1002
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
is replaced.

1003
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The CDK2

1004
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
3'-UTR

1005
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
is replaced.

1006
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The CDK2

1007
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
3'-UTR

1008
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
is replaced.

1009
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
When you express

1010
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
the vector,

1011
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
we set it as the baseline,

1012
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
because the vector is empty.

1013
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
However, when you express

1014
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
the 199,

1015
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
the CDK2

1016
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
3'-UTR

1017
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
will be degraded.

1018
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
If you change the position

1019
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
of the CDK2,

1020
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
the CDK2

1021
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
3'-UTR

1022
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
will be degraded.

1023
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The microRNA 199

1024
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
can suppress

1025
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
the mRNA of CDK2.

1026
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
An important experiment

1027
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
is to see

1028
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
if the 199 can suppress

1029
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
the CDK2,

1030
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
if I put the CDK2

1031
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
in a version

1032
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
that suppresses the CDK2,

1033
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
can I save

1034
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
or rescue

1035
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
or restore the CDK2?

1036
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So,

1037
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
we put the CDK2

1038
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
in the 199

1039
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and marked it

1040
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
with a red mark.

1041
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The CDK2

1042
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
cannot be suppressed

1043
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
by the 199,

1044
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
because we changed

1045
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
the suppression point.

1046
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
This is

1047
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
the result.

1048
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
As you can see in this video,

1049
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
red or white,

1050
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
because red plus green is white,

1051
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
the cells move faster

1052
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
than the green cells.

1053
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The statistics show

1054
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
that the CDK2

1055
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
can restore the CDK2.

1056
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The CDK2

1057
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
is not the only

1058
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
CDK2,

1059
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
but it is an important

1060
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
CDK2.

1061
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
As you can see,

1062
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
the CDK2

1063
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
is not the only

1064
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
CDK2,

1065
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
but it is an important

1066
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
CDK2.

1067
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
As you can see,

1068
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the CDK2

1069
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
is not the only

1070
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
CDK2,

1071
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
but it is an important

1072
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
CDK2.

1073
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
As you can see,

1074
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
the CDK2

1075
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
is not the only

1076
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
CDK2.

1077
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
As you can see,

1078
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
the CDK2

1079
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
is not the only

1080
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
CDK2.

1081
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
As you can see,

1082
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
the CDK2

1083
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
is not the only

1084
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
CDK2.

1085
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
There is another,

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000

elinfo.

1088
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
The CDK2

1089
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
is not the only

1090
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
CDK2.

1091
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
The CDK2

1092
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
is not the only

1093
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
CDK2.

1094
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
As you can see,

1095
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the CDK2

1096
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
is not the only

1098
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
There is another

1100
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
that is

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
not the only

1121
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
not the only

1122
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
CDK2.

1123
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
There is another

1124
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
CDK2

1125
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that is

1126
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
not the only

1127
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
CDK2.

1128
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The last one

1129
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
is

1130
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
basically

1131
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
the research of CDK2

1132
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
because it is a very important protein

1133
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
for cell cycle

1134
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
or cell division.

1135
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So most of the research is on cancer

1136
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
or cell division

1137
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
or cell division.

1138
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
In fact, other aspects

1139
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
have not been studied at all.

1140
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So

1141
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
the first thing we need to do is to make sure

1142
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
whether the CDK2

1143
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
is expressed in the cell of

1144
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
the protein.

1145
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
This is a previous study.

1146
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
They found that CDK2

1147
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
is not only expressed, but also

1148
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
if you do LPS, which is the stimulation of the endocrine,

1149
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
it will still rise.

1150
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
This means that it is not only functional,

1151
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
but also

1152
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
has a reaction

1153
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
to neutrophil stimulation.

1154
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
This is the

1155
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
level of RNA.

1156
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
If you look at the level of protein,

1157
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
you will find that most of the CDK2

1158
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
C is the cytosol, N is the nucleus.

1159
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Most of them are in the cell.

1160
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Although you may say that

1161
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
it will be a little bit after eating,

1162
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
most of them are still in the cell.

1163
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
In our system,

1164
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
we

1165
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
draw blood and then separate

1166
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
human neutrophils,

1167
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
such as the neutrophils on you and me.

1168
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
What we are talking about now is

1169
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
the cell skeleton of its actin.

1170
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It is found that after the cell skeleton

1171
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
has been stimulated,

1172
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
there is a single

1173
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
polarization.

1174
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
This depi is its nucleus.

1175
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You will find that CDK2

1176
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
is like the previous report.

1177
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Regardless of the fact that

1178
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
there is no CDK2 in the nucleus,

1179
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
most of the green part and the blue part

1180
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
are actually a little bit apart.

1181
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Most of them are actually in the cell tissue,

1182
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
not in the nucleus.

1183
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
This is also confirmed by the previous research.

1184
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It also proves that

1185
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the CDK2 we see in our system

1186
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
is actually in the nucleus.

1187
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
As mentioned earlier...

1188
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Sorry.

1189
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
The time is almost up.

1190
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Sorry.

1191
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I don't know how many pages you have left,

1192
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
but you may need to speed up later.

1193
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Okay, I got it.

1194
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
In order to separate

1195
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
the functions of the traditional CDK2,

1196
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
because the traditional CDK2 is studied

1197
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
and replicated in DNA,

1198
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
we use NU6140 today.

1199
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
This is the replication of the

1200
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
replicated CDK2,

1201
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and this is the replication of the

1202
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
replicated DNA.

1203
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
We found that only when you

1204
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
replicate the CDK2,

1205
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
but you replicate the DNA,

1206
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
there is an effect.

1207
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
So the role of CDK2 today

1208
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
is beyond the function of

1209
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
DNA replication

1210
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
that we traditionally recognize.

1211
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
In both of our

1212
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
research models,

1213
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
we found that only when you

1214
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
replicate the CDK2,

1215
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
there is such a replication recruitment,

1216
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
which is to replicate its

1217
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
path to the original place,

1218
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and then when you replicate the DNA

1219
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
replication, there is no effect.

1220
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
In order to be afraid that

1221
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
if we replicate the CDK2,

1222
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
it will directly kill the cell,

1223
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
we chose two inhibitors

1224
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
to replicate the CDK2.

1225
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It can be

1226
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
washed away.

1227
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
As you can see,

1228
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
the speed of the cell

1229
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
is still normal.

1230
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Once we give it this drug,

1231
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
it will slow down.

1232
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Once we wash

1233
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
this drug away,

1234
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
it will return to normal in 1-2 hours.

1235
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It means that we just

1236
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
brake it a little bit,

1237
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
we don't kill it,

1238
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
but do some irreversible reactions.

1239
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
This may be very helpful

1240
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
in terms of treatment,

1241
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
we can suppress it

1242
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
and wash it away.

1243
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It can solve

1244
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
such a problem.

1245
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
In addition, we need to see

1246
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
what the function of CDK2 is.

1247
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It is a gene model.

1248
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
If you look at it from the point of view of medicine,

1249
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
it will often have off-targeting,

1250
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
which is some non-specific functions.

1251
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So we just put the CDK2,

1252
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
this is CDK2 and its

1253
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
binding part 2,

1254
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
on the CDK2.

1255
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
After the CDK2 is off-targeted,

1256
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
it will not be able

1257
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
to neutralize

1258
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
its target.

1259
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The result of this

1260
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
is that it will

1261
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
occupy all of its

1262
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
targets,

1263
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
because it occupies

1264
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
the macromolecule.

1265
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Second, all the cyclins will also be occupied

1266
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
by the macromolecule.

1267
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So we call this strategy

1268
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
dominant-negative.

1269
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Then we put it in the bimolecule.

1270
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You will find that if you express

1271
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
such a red CDK2 normally,

1272
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
it will be very happy.

1273
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
On the other hand, if you express

1274
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
this dominant-negative,

1275
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
this CDK2,

1276
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
you will find that the cells will not move at all.

1277
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
But the interesting thing is that

1278
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
when you soak

1279
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
this whole fish in

1280
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
a chemical substance

1281
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
to attract these neutrophils,

1282
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
you will find that

1283
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
they will still move.

1284
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
They will still go to

1285
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
this macromolecule.

1286
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's just that it's going slower,

1287
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and the directionality seems to be lost.

1288
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
If you compare it to what you saw earlier,

1289
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
this is normal.

1290
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
In the absence of speech,

1291
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
they are lazy and don't move much.

1292
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
On the other hand,

1293
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
when they speak,

1294
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
they are still lazy.

1295
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's just that they move slowly,

1296
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
and the trajectory is not so straight.

1297
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Let's look at this thing

1298
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
with a higher degree of detection.

1299
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Let's look at their cell skeleton.

1300
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Generally speaking, in a moving neutrophil,

1301
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you will find that its stable actin,

1302
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
which is a mark

1303
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
of its actin,

1304
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
will be behind its cell.

1305
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So this green will follow the purple.

1306
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So this green is always a mark

1307
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
of the cell.

1308
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But when you express

1309
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
the dominant and negative constructs

1310
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
of CDK2,

1311
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
you will find that the cell is not dead or not moving.

1312
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It's just that the green doesn't know where to go.

1313
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's like walking left and right.

1314
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It doesn't know where to move.

1315
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So this also tells us

1316
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
that there may be some problems with thresholding.

1317
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
In order to make sure

1318
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
that what we see is

1319
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
caused by

1320
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
CDK2,

1321
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
we used

1322
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
a new cell

1323
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
to knock off

1324
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
this gene.

1325
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So we found that

1326
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
when we removed CDK2,

1327
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
our neutrophils

1328
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
didn't move much.

1329
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
At the same time,

1330
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
in order to make sure that this removal is a deliberate removal,

1331
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
if we put CDK2 back,

1332
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
you will find that

1333
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
there is a rescue

1334
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
to restore its movement speed.

1335
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So when you put

1336
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
this DNA back,

1337
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
of course, it has no effect.

1338
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So the phenomenon we see

1339
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
is specifically caused by CDK2.

1340
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
So what we just mentioned

1341
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
is that the cell looks drunk

1342
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and walks left and right.

1343
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So let me introduce to you

1344
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
this neutrophil.

1345
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
In order to make it move,

1346
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
we need to activate

1347
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
the leading edge

1348
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and the trailing edge.

1349
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
The signaling in the front

1350
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
uses two proteins

1351
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
as the readout.

1352
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
We found that

1353
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
in a human cell,

1354
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
if you knock off

1355
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
CDK2,

1356
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
not really knock it off,

1357
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
but just suppress

1358
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
its expression,

1359
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
the signal in the front

1360
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
will decrease.

1361
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
In contrast,

1362
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
the signal in the back,

1363
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
the myosin,

1364
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
is usually behind the cell,

1365
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and the fluoride

1366
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
will mark the leading edge of the cell.

1367
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
The leading edge and the trailing edge

1368
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
are separated,

1369
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
so we know that the cell is upward polarizing.

1370
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But when you take CDK2 off,

1371
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
the polarization disappears.

1372
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
This means that this cell

1373
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
is like what we see in the fish.

1374
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Finally,

1375
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
let's switch to

1376
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
a mouse model.

1377
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
After CDK2 is taken off,

1378
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
the mouse is only relatively small,

1379
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
and it can't reproduce.

1380
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But the problem is that

1381
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
some of its functions are unknown.

1382
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So we did a

1383
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
post-mortem on this mouse.

1384
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
We took a post-mortem on it

1385
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and then collected its saliva

1386
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
to see what happened.

1387
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Let's skip

1388
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
the graph first.

1389
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
As you can see,

1390
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
in this circle,

1391
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
when CDK2 is taken off,

1392
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
there are fewer dots

1393
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
compared to

1394
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
the dots here.

1395
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
This means that

1396
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
there are fewer neutrophils

1397
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
entering the germ.

1398
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
While there are fewer neutrophils

1399
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
entering the germ,

1400
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
we found that

1401
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
in a normal situation,

1402
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
the neutrophil

1403
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
in the germ

1404
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
has a higher proportion.

1405
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The neutrophil

1406
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
in the germ

1407
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
has a higher proportion than

1408
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
in a normal mouse.

1409
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
When it is taken off,

1410
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
the neutrophil

1411
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
will move to the surrounding blood

1412
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
and go to the circulatory system.

1413
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
That's why you see

1414
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
this decrease.

1415
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
However, if there is a problem

1416
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
with the neutrophil,

1417
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
the neutrophil will stay in the blood

1418
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
with a higher proportion.

1419
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
At the same time,

1420
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
the neutrophil will be

1421
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
less likely to be infected.

1422
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
To summarize,

1423
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
neutrophils move in

1424
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
2D and 3D.

1425
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
One of them moves

1426
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
on the surface,

1427
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
while the other

1428
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
moves on the leading edge

1429
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and trailing edge.

1430
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
We found that

1431
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
in human cells,

1432
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
if you suppress the CDK2,

1433
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
which is a 2D migration,

1434
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
the CDK2 will move

1435
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
on the leading edge

1436
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and trailing edge.

1437
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
When you suppress the CDK2,

1438
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
it will move on the leading edge

1439
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and trailing edge.

1440
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
However, the CDK2

1441
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
will move on the leading edge

1442
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
and trailing edge.

1443
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
This means that

1444
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
in the 3D ring,

1445
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
the CDK2 will move on the leading edge

1446
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and trailing edge.

1447
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
This means that

1448
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
in the 3D ring,

1449
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
the CDK2 will move on the leading edge

1450
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and trailing edge.

1451
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
However, if you suppress the CDK2,

1452
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the CDK2 will move

1453
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
on the leading edge

1454
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and trailing edge.

1455
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
This is the summary of

1456
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
the CDK2 migration in the

1457
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Bermuda Triangle.

1458
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It is a very useful

1459
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
in human and mouse systems.

1460
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It is a conserved feature.

1461
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It is a conserved feature.

1462
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It is a conserved feature.

1463
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
The last data

1464
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
is the model of

1465
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Bermuda Triangle.

1466
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It is a model of

1467
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
a bacteria-type

1468
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
all-body infection

1469
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
that will kill itself.

1470
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
It is a model of

1471
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
a bacteria-type

1472
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
all-body infection

1473
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
that will kill itself.

1474
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
It also increases

1475
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
the dose of the infection.

1476
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It also increases

1477
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
the dose of the infection.

1478
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
It also increases

1479
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
the dose of the infection.

1480
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It also increases

1481
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
the survival rate

1482
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
of Bermuda Triangle.

1483
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It also increases

1484
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
the survival rate

1485
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
of Bermuda Triangle.

1486
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It also increases

1487
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
the survival rate

1488
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
of Bermuda Triangle.

1489
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,300
Before wards

1490
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,000
followed by

1491
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
the hospital ward.

1492
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
All Wards

1493
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
™

1494
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
are related to

1495
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
cell migration.

1496
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
The CDK2

1497
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
is also needed

1498
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
by the neutral field.

1499
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
The CDK2

1500
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
and its downstream

1501
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
can improve

1502
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
the survival rate

1503
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
of Bermuda Triangle.

1504
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
We are working on

1505
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
the CDK2's

1506
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
downstream substrate,

1507
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
its target

1508
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and its binding factor.

1509
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
This is our lab.

1510
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
This is my boss,

1511
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Deng Qin,

1512
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
and my committee.

1513
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I have an excellent undergraduate

1514
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
who has been helping me with experiments.

1515
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Thank you.

1516
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

1517
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Remember to turn on the microphone.

1518
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Do you have any questions

1519
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
for Yihui?

1520
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I have a question.

1521
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
It's more detailed.

1522
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I don't have much knowledge

1523
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
about flow cytometry.

1524
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You used flow cytometry

1525
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
to quantify

1526
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
the amount of RNA.

1527
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Is it possible to

1528
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
label the RNA

1529
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
using FISH

1530
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and then run the flow

1531
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
to compare

1532
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
the changes in the amount?

1533
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I'm sorry.

1534
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I might be talking too fast.

1535
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Our RNA levels

1536
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
are all quantified

1537
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
using PCR.

1538
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
We don't use flow

1539
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
to quantify RNA.

1540
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So, in this slide,

1541
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
you don't use flow cytometry,

1542
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
but...

1543
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
We use flow

1544
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
to separate

1545
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
the neutral field

1546
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
from the entire substrate

1547
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
to do sequencing.

1548
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Each red dot

1549
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
is a cell.

1550
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
This is a flow chart.

1551
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
We separate the cells

1552
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
and extract the RNA

1553
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
to compare

1554
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
the amount of mRNA

1555
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
in each cell.

1556
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
In this chart,

1557
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
we only use PCR

1558
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
to verify

1559
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
whether the sequencing is correct.

1560
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I see.

1561
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Thank you.

1562
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Do you have

1563
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
any other questions?

1564
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

1565
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I might be talking too fast.

1566
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Okay.

1567
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
If you don't have any questions,

1568
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I'll stop the recording.

1569
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
You can continue

1570
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
to chat here.

1571
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
You can email me if you have any questions.
