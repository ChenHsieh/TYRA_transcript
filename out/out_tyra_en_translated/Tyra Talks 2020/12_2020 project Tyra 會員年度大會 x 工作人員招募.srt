00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello everyone, I am today's keynote speaker, Jason Hong.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I am now a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I am also a Project Taira staff member.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Project Taira stands for the Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The purpose of today's event is to provide suggestions and feedback.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We hope that Project Taira will continue to grow and improve.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
At the beginning, I would like to talk about what Project Taira is currently doing,

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and what questions we would like to ask.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This video is the summary of Project Taira.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We hope to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to connect with Taiwanese academics from all over the world,

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
to communicate about the development, results, and trends of overseas and Taiwan academic circles,

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and to provide each other with an effective platform for communication.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is basically the purpose of Project Taira.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We hope that young Taiwanese academics from all over the world can come to this platform,

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and share information with each other.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Our organization currently has two websites.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The first is our blog, where we publish our weekly speeches.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The second is our Facebook page, where you can find our information.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let me talk a little bit about what Project Taira has been doing in recent years.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The first thing we are doing is to prepare a regular speech every week.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We have been doing this speech from 2017 to now, about 4 to 5 years.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you go to our blog, the page will tell you what the topic of our next week's speech is.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There are many topics, and it will tell you the main time.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We hope that the main time will be around 6 to 7 p.m. in the west coast of the United States.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This time will be around 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the east coast of the United States.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you are in Taiwan, you may hear this speech at 10 a.m.

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We mainly do this on weekends, such as Saturdays and Sundays.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We hope that you can take the time to listen to our speech.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We hope that you can take the time to listen to our speech.

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Every week, our speech will be recorded and posted on our blog.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you have listeners who want to find the previous speech,

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you may find some important information in the previous speech,

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and you may go there to find it.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We hope that every week we can record the speech and put it in this space.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Sometimes, if the speech has not been published yet,

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
we can postpone the upload time.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
According to our previous results,

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
we have found speakers from various fields.

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is a small part.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This may be related to air pollution, biology, astronomy,

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
or computer science.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We will share the information of the speech every week.

44
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We use e-mail and the blog I just mentioned.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We will share it on Facebook.

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We will also share it on the Facebook page of major alumni associations.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Finally, if you are a speaker and you give a speech,

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
we will send you an Amazon gift card at the end of the year.

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It depends on our budget.

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The above is our regular talk.

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The second important thing we do is the summer special activities.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In the summer, because everyone is on vacation,

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
there is usually less time in the middle to give a speech.

54
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In the middle, we will invite some people from outside to give us some speeches.

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Some special and interesting speeches.

56
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In 2018, we invited Liu Junlin to tell us

57
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
how to use some academic speech or presentation software.

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
For example, how to use LaTeX, how to use DeepLeaf.

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know what these are.

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In 2019, we made some changes.

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Our main focus was the ZR development symposium.

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We invited two professors and an industry person

63
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
to share with us their experience in finding a job.

64
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I believe this is a topic that many people are interested in.

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This symposium has a very high attendance rate.

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In 2020, two weeks ago,

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
we continued to do academic work and development symposium.

68
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This event is co-organized with the Professor Association of Taiwan in North America.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This year, we invited them to co-organize the symposium.

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We hope that we can get more information from the professor.

71
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This year, there are some other activities.

72
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For example, the annual member's meeting.

73
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Two or three weeks later,

74
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
there will be a research project on Taiwan's first rocket.

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Finally, there will be a symposium on the reform of higher education.

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think this symposium is quite interesting.

77
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We invited the former president of the Research Student Association,

78
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
as well as some legal assistants and researchers from the Policy Research Center.

79
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I hope that more people can participate in this symposium.

80
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This symposium is very hard-earned by Professor Yan Yong, one of our staff members.

81
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There are two important things that Taira has done so far.

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There is a weekly speech and a special symposium or speech in the summer.

83
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's take a look at the growth data.

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can give us some suggestions for reference.

85
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The first graph shows the number of members and the time.

86
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
As you can see, we had a member system since the end of 2017.

87
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It has continued to grow.

88
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It looks pretty linear.

89
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I hope we can continue to maintain it in the future.

90
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So far, we have almost 300 members.

91
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We held a total of 122 speeches.

92
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If you look at our Facebook page, there are more than 2,000 members.

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The graph on the right is the breakdown of our speech.

94
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I divided it into several categories.

95
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because the topic is very complicated and diverse, I roughly divided it into several categories.

96
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's probably math, physics, chemistry, biology, other sciences, engineering, and humanities.

97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You can take a look at it.

98
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So far, physics and biology seem to be the most popular.

99
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Engineering is also quite a lot.

100
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The number of members is actually the most in these categories.

101
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But the number of speeches is not very clear.

102
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The number of speeches seems to be the most in biology.

103
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Next, if you add physics, it is also the most.

104
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is our breakdown.

105
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The following is the IP address of the audience.

106
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
70% of the audience is from the United States.

107
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
About 20% of the audience is from Taiwan.

108
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The rest are from Japan and some European countries.

109
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The number of people on the line seems to be smaller and more professional.

110
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So the number of people on the line is about 10 people.

111
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Unless there is a symposium, the number of people on the line may exceed 50 or 40.

112
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
These 40 or 50 people are usually in a symposium.

113
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is a special event in the summer.

114
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Finally, I would like to mention that there are organizations that cooperate with us and support us financially.

115
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
As mentioned earlier, we have some financial support.

116
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
These funds come from the Ministry of Education and TACO.

117
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We also found some partners.

118
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is the Taiwan University Graduate Association and the North American and Taiwanese Professor Association.

119
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There are also some activities from the Ministry of Science and Technology.

120
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Unfortunately, we can't hold activities with them this year, but we hope to hold activities with them in the future.

121
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We would like to hear some opinions from the ministers and scientists.

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I hope to leave more time for meeting discussion.

123
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have listed some things that we want to discuss with you.

124
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There are four main parts.

125
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Membership rights, PR team, seminar team, and IT team.

126
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:02,000
As for the membership rights, the priority is higher.

127
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We hope to change some membership rights and obligations.

128
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We also hope to change some conditions and frequency for speeches.

129
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's take a look at the following slide.

130
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You can take a look at it.

131
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In our blog, we mentioned the membership rights.

132
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is for doctoral students and post-doctoral students working in public or private institutions.

133
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The main problem is the membership obligations.

134
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:46,000
In our previous membership obligations, there is a rule that members should give a speech every two years and share recent research results.

135
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This rule is because a long time ago, the TARA group was actually a very small organization.

136
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There were more than ten people at that time, and we had to give speeches in turns.

137
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But now there are too many members, and it has become a big organization.

138
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We hope to discuss how we should upgrade our speeches in the future.

139
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What rights should we have as members?

140
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
How should TARA upgrade its speeches?

141
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:39,000
One of our proposals is to eliminate this obligation.

142
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
We don't need to give a speech every two years.

143
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Giving a speech is your right.

144
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
In the future, we will try to find members who have a membership status.

145
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We will try to find speakers from the members so that you can share your speech.

146
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's also a chance to practice speaking.

147
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is a change.

148
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:28,000
In addition, there are some job openings opportunities in universities and Taiwan.

149
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
They will provide us with job openings information.

150
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We will forward this information to the members.

151
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is a new membership right.

152
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
According to these conditions, what we hope to do in the future is this.

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If you are not a member and you are a non-member, you will go to a non-member registration form.

154
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You need to fill out a form.

155
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you are a member, you will receive our letters on a regular basis.

156
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You don't have to do anything. You just need to go online and participate in the speech.

157
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
In the future, we hope to change it to this.

158
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We will make two Google Groups.

159
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Basically, it's a group of non-members.

160
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
A group is responsible for the information of TeraTalks.

161
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Every week, TeraTalks will be sent out by this letter.

162
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You can freely choose whether you want to join or quit.

163
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's like a subscribe function.

164
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You just need to subscribe.

165
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It doesn't matter if you are a member or not.

166
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
For this reason, all members or non-members have to sign up for the speech.

167
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You need to fill out a form to participate in the speech.

168
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The second thing the Google Group does is to send the information of TeraTalks to everyone.

169
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
However, this is limited to the rights of members.

170
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So far, we hope to make such a change.

171
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Please listen to it.

172
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There are other things we can discuss.

173
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
For example, the PR group.

174
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
One important thing is that TeraTalks has no official logo.

175
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So we hope everyone can provide a logo.

176
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Or we can hold a logo presentation.

177
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We need to do something like this.

178
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you want us to work together, you can suggest it later.

179
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We will have Q&A time later.

180
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You can make a suggestion at that time.

181
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Another thing is that the number of registrants we have seen so far.

182
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If there are 30 people, only 15 people will participate in the speech.

183
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's weird. Where are the other 15 people?

184
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:30,000
For the seminar group, if you want us to make some adjustments in the field of speech.

185
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Or if you want us to do something special in the summer.

186
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Everyone can make a suggestion.

187
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If you want to open a journal club, or want to do a forum in your field.

188
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You can also discuss with us.

189
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
For the IT group, we mainly want to know the experience of using BlueDreams.

190
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,000
We want to know if there are any benefits of other online meeting software.

191
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It is very, very necessary.

192
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
OK.

193
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
My report is about to end.

194
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I hope everyone can, whether it's on this topic.

195
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Or if you have anything else you want to discuss, you can mention it later.

196
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This is our current staff.

197
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Let me read the names.

198
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Zhang Jianyuan, Zhang Yanping, Hong Shisan, Xu Youzhen, Wei Qunshu, Zhang Yanyong, Zhou Zhixian, Zhu Haoran, Su Yiyan, and Yang Jiayin.

199
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
OK.

200
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We will have about 20 to 30 minutes of Q&A.

201
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
After that, we will have a small presentation for recruiting staff.

202
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
If you want to join our Taira organization, you are welcome to stay.

203
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Our Taira organization needs new blood.

204
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We need new blood.

205
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The reason we founded this organization is that there are a group of young scholars.

206
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Everyone can share with each other.

207
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
As you know, if there is a professor here, a professor who may be 40 or 50 years old, everyone will feel uncomfortable.

208
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So we really want young scholars to join us.

209
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Then we can finish this project together.

210
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
OK.

211
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's start the discussion.

212
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Does anyone have any comments?

213
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Hello? I can't hear you.

214
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There seems to be a serious echo.

215
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Hello?

216
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Sorry, there was a problem with my microphone.

217
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I just told you that your video is gone.

218
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And now it's back.

219
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You are not playing, but it's back.

220
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So what should we discuss now?

221
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Should we discuss one group at a time or all at once?

222
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Let's start with the membership rights.

223
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This is what we want to know the most.

224
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Do you have any questions about the membership rights or membership obligations?

225
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Let me talk about why we proposed this.

226
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Jason and I were mainly collecting speeches and then arranging them into annual schedules.

227
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Then we found that there are too many people now.

228
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If you calculate a little, there are more than 42 weeks a year, right?

229
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
No, sorry, there are more than 50 weeks.

230
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Then deduct the holiday, we have to arrange 30 speeches a year.

231
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But we have more than 200 people, so we just have to say that we want to collect speeches.

232
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Even if we only limit the number of members to give speeches, we will usually line up far more than this year's slots.

233
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Then it will be too much.

234
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So we were a bit like a compulsory.

235
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That is, we ask everyone to give a speech every one to two years.

236
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This thing basically does not exist.

237
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Because everyone is forced to give a speech, otherwise you will line up for three years.

238
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This is also a strange thing.

239
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Instead, many people come to ask if I can use this platform to share my speech.

240
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Let me find potential partners.

241
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Or let people who are interested in the same field as me get to know each other.

242
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Then we can discuss.

243
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It becomes a kind of benefit.

244
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Basically, everyone who comes to participate now means that you are already members.

245
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
In theory, you can give your opinion on our policy.

246
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What do you think?

247
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Or do you have any other thoughts on this part?

248
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Everyone is very silent.

249
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Everyone seems to be very silent.

250
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yes.

251
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:43,000
If not, let's ask everyone else's opinion first.

252
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Everyone may have no feeling for this.

253
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Do you want to adjust the field of our speech?

254
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Or do you have any interesting summer activities that you want to provide?

255
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I can't see the chat.

256
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I saw a lot of comments on the chat just now.

257
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No, the chat is not important.

258
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The chat is self-introduction.

259
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It has nothing to do with what I told you.

260
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
OK.

261
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Let me talk about this part.

262
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's the same as me and Jason.

263
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We are having a speech.

264
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
We first found a problem.

265
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In fact, there are quite a few people who have given us suggestions.

266
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You may find that a very large part of TARA is focused on the speech in the field of science and technology.

267
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This is not our intention.

268
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We don't want to be biased in this way.

269
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:09,000
In fact, we really want to have humanitarian research, or even various kinds of research, to enter our organization.

270
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Because the ultimate goal is to connect young people around the world to engage in research.

271
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But the reason is simple.

272
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Our network is very polite.

273
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So our friends spread out like this.

274
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Then TARA becomes a very polite organization.

275
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
There are even other similar academic exchanges.

276
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
They all say, aren't you just a polite academic organization?

277
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
They think we are positioned like this.

278
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:54,000
We found that when we start to give others such an impression, positive feedback will continue to make us more like this.

279
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Then we have no way to break through the humanistic part.

280
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So I don't know what you think.

281
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
This is the first one.

282
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The other one is similar.

283
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We are a very American-based organization.

284
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
This is also because the founders are all in the United States, so our circle of friends is also in the United States.

285
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But we have always wanted to enter, that is to say, we can connect with European Taiwanese.

286
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But this has always been a bit of a difficult thing.

287
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I don't know what you think about this.

288
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Or what do you think? Or what can we do?

289
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Or if you want to provide a speaker specifically, you can also hope that he will give a speech.

290
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Hello is my name is Zhong Boting, and I just joined the first time to attend this meeting.

291
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And then I had not heard of any of your speeches at all.

292
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And then I just a little bit, I have a little look at your previous speech, is the head of the head of the head.

293
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And then I am a background in science and engineering.

294
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And then I feel from the start it seems to be quite professional.

295
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I do not know the content because I did not go to see the content, but just from the beginning to look at it, I feel very professional.

296
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And then even if I am a science and engineering, I will have a little bit of rejection.

297
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Because I do not understand the title at all.

298
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And then I think this may be more for those of you who are talking about other fields.

299
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Maybe those who are not science and engineering are not science and engineering.

300
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
They may be a little bit more sure.

301
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So I was thinking, is it possible to give some more general?

302
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Just from the title, it looks like a more general, everyone can participate.

303
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It will be more interesting.

304
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh, I see.

305
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yes, this is my feeling.

306
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But I just joined the first time, so I just looked at the title of the previous talk very quickly.

307
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yes, I can understand this thing.

308
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes, but the current title is actually written by the speaker.

309
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We will not make any changes.

310
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm not sure if your goal is to make it easier for everyone to understand and be interested.

311
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Then there may be more people who really participate.

312
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
There is a chance to attract more people.

313
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Sorry, can you hear my voice?

314
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You go first.

315
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Our current approach is that when the speaker comes, we will suggest that you can give a 10 to 20-minute background review.

316
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's about the general audience.

317
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But we can't control what the speaker is going to do.

318
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Some speakers will do it, some will not do it.

319
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
This is not something we can control.

320
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I think maybe in the future we can discuss the topic and content with the speaker.

321
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
In this case, can we make him more generous?

322
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What do you think, Yanyong?

323
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I have a different opinion, but Zhang Yiping just said something.

324
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes.

325
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Zhang Yiping, don't talk first.

326
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I told him not to talk first.

327
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
OK, I'll speak first.

328
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
No, Zhang Yiping, you go first.

329
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I want to talk about what Zhang Yiyong just said.

330
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I think our number of people, although it seems that if you compare, there are more volunteers.

331
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But if you compare the number of people in the research institute, in Taiwan, especially in the United States,

332
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't think we are particularly humanistic.

333
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Because there are very few people who are humanistic.

334
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So maybe...

335
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You don't think there are many volunteers?

336
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't think there are many volunteers because there are very few people who are humanistic.

337
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So our people are relatively humanistic.

338
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That's what I think.

339
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
There are not many, but I don't think this is a mistake.

340
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Of course, if your interpretation is that everyone has to do 50% or 55%,

341
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
it may look like that, but this is actually a mistake.

342
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I think this is a mistake.

343
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I can add to Zhang Yiping.

344
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's about 5 to 1.

345
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Hello everyone, I'm Yi An, and I'm a staff member.

346
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I think in the past five years, from the doctoral students who graduated from North America,

347
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
there are about 500 to 600 so-called science majors every year,

348
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and about 100 are humanities or humanities.

349
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's about 5 to 1.

350
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If you look at the number of doctoral graduates from North America.

351
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Another thing you just said,

352
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Zhang Yiping just talked about the number of people in different regions.

353
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I think there are very few people in Europe.

354
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I guess there's a reason.

355
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Maybe it's because their time is really not ideal.

356
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
In the United States and Taiwan, one in the evening, one in the morning.

357
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
The European time zone is 2 o'clock in the middle of the night.

358
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's really difficult.

359
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So maybe it's a barrier.

360
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Let me interrupt you.

361
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I don't know if I can interrupt your point of view.

362
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
We are now chatting.

363
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
There are different people with different problems.

364
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
We will discuss one by one.

365
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But let's finish the discussion now.

366
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So everyone just wait patiently.

367
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
What I'm going to talk about next is about the topic.

368
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
How broad or narrow the topic is.

369
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I guess what Zhang Yiping is going to tell me is about the same.

370
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Because I don't think ...

371
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
First of all, I am Zhang Yiping.

372
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I am studying social psychology.

373
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So I guess I am ...

374
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm not completely humanities.

375
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But I should be relatively social science.

376
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But from my point of view,

377
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I don't think the current topic is too special.

378
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The reason is ...

379
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The reason is ...

380
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I don't think ...

381
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
At least my understanding is that Tyra's goal is not to do science.

382
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We are not TED.

383
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So ...

384
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And we didn't force everyone to attend many times.

385
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So it seems that social science people have to sign up for a few things.

386
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
He obviously doesn't understand.

387
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
This is not ...

388
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
This is a free participation.

389
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Then our goal is actually more professional.

390
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
This ...

391
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Establish academic links with each other.

392
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So it was originally a professional academic link.

393
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
If I see that topic, I don't know at all.

394
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He wrote a few mathematical symbols on it.

395
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Even this ...

396
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
The symbol of the physical example has nothing to do with me.

397
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I just don't want to go.

398
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
On the contrary, such a more professional topic can actually help ...

399
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The speaker and the audience will go to establish a link.

400
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Instead of them talking ...

401
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
They ...

402
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The speaker and the original professional audience feel very shallow.

403
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
They don't know what they are doing here.

404
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Then I go ...

405
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I finished listening.

406
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I think it's very interesting.

407
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But when I go home, it has nothing to do with my academics.

408
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I think ...

409
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I think it's more of a difference.

410
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So I ...

411
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I don't think the topic is too short now.

412
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Let me talk about that ...

413
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Zhang Jiaming just said.

414
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That is ...

415
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
In fact, I think there is a point.

416
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Just ...

417
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Jason is not very correct.

418
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That is, we can't control the speaker.

419
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
In fact, we are communicating with the speaker.

420
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
When is the speech?

421
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
How do we usually arrange a process?

422
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
How much time do you need to do the introduction?

423
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
How long does it take to talk about the professional part?

424
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But ...

425
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We ...

426
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
At least I personally ...

427
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
If I do it ...

428
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I am doing some speeches.

429
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
If it's my field of chair.

430
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I will tell them that ...

431
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
We hope it can really be in ...

432
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Academically, it has enough impact on you.

433
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That is to say ...

434
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You can get a network that is useful to you.

435
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Or a partner.

436
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So if you come and give a ...

437
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Like ...

438
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
If you give a speech like a YouTuber ...

439
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It may make everyone feel very fruitful.

440
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But in fact, for our organization ...

441
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Or for ...

442
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The impact we really want to have.

443
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
May not be the best.

444
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Because you go ...

445
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah, it's TED Talk.

446
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Just listen to TED Talk.

447
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So I personally ...

448
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Usually positioned in this part.

449
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Then I will tell them that ...

450
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What academic speech do you want to say?

451
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You really let ...

452
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This thing can be played.

453
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That ...

454
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
He himself will not come.

455
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
We do not mind a speech.

456
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Only ten people.

457
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Or I do not mind.

458
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But in fact, I know ...

459
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Jason is actually more inclined to do ...

460
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
More ...

461
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Interdisciplinary.

462
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Or ...

463
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
More ...

464
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Lighter.

465
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But a wider speech.

466
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Then I think this is a ...

467
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Discussable direction.

468
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That is to say ...

469
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Everyone to our ...

470
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What do you think of the scope?

471
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
This way.

472
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I do not necessarily want to do ...

473
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Lighter speech.

474
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I hope that ...

475
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That is ...

476
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Speakers ...

477
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
In fact, you can ...

478
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Spend ten to twenty minutes to talk about the background.

479
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
That is to say ...

480
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
His field ...

481
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
That is ...

482
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Current development ...

483
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What is the current situation?

484
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
How?

485
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That is ...

486
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But later ...

487
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
He can say that ...

488
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
He ...

489
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What is he really doing?

490
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I would think ...

491
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
If this is the case ...

492
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I think this is actually ...

493
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
A large part is the current situation.

494
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Is not it?

495
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I think ...

496
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
If this is the case, I think ...

497
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I quite agree.

498
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I think ...

499
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Sure.

500
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
If you really want to produce this ...

501
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Cross-field cooperation ...

502
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You do not tell people ...

503
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You are in ...

504
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
What is your big picture?

505
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
In fact, it is very ...

506
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It is a hindrance.

507
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So I think ...

508
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
This ...

509
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes.

510
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But there is ...

511
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I think ...

512
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The audience just said ...

513
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
A good point is that ...

514
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
This is your name ...

515
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It can be better.

516
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You can write better.

517
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yes, I think my ...

518
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
My idea should just say ...

519
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Because you just discussed ...

520
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
How to let ...

521
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Some ...

522
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Different audiences ...

523
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Participate.

524
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Maybe I did not hear very clearly.

525
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But I just want to say ...

526
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Maybe you can ...

527
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
How to attract people.

528
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So I just feel from ...

529
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Title or ...

530
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Advertising ...

531
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You can attract people.

532
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Because ...

533
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Maybe you have discussed the content ...

534
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Background.

535
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But because I ...

536
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I do not know these things.

537
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yes.

538
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
OK.

539
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yes.

540
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I think his meaning should be like this.

541
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That is ...

542
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We should be advertising ...

543
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Promotion.

544
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Or ...

545
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Title should be at least ...

546
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Clear.

547
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Clear.

548
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And I think ...

549
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I do not know if this is too much trouble.

550
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But I think maybe ...

551
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Can be divided a little bit.

552
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Because like now ...

553
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Someone mentioned ...

554
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I just mentioned that ...

555
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We can be divided into areas.

556
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Or ...

557
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But I think maybe ...

558
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You can be divided a little bit.

559
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
There are some talks ...

560
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Maybe some ...

561
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Speakers would like to talk ...

562
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
General ...

563
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
A little bit.

564
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Or more ...

565
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Background part.

566
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Some of them may be ...

567
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
More professional ...

568
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Want to discuss with each other.

569
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But I think ...

570
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This may be a little bit ...

571
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
To distinguish.

572
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
This may also be helpful ...

573
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
To digest ...

574
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That is ...

575
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Speech requirements.

576
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I ...

577
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I ...

578
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I want to follow this suggestion.

579
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
My own position is more like ...

580
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Leave this freedom to the speaker.

581
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Let me give an example.

582
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like ...

583
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Uh ...

584
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
The freedom I'm talking about is ...

585
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
How deep, how much money, how much money.

586
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This freedom.

587
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Let me give an example.

588
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Suppose I am doing this today.

589
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Quantum computing.

590
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Then I did it very well.

591
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I am ...

592
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I am Zhang Taide.

593
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I am very professional.

594
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I am very good.

595
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Then I'm going to find another one.

596
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
With me ...

597
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
To ...

598
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
This ...

599
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Co-PI of a ...

600
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I am now looking for a co-PI.

601
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Then do a very professional thing.

602
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So I talked about a very professional speech.

603
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I wrote a very professional title.

604
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Others do not understand.

605
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Is ...

606
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
They just go to die.

607
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
This is my freedom.

608
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Then my goal is ...

609
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
This way.

610
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Then I also do this.

611
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I also achieved.

612
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I actually feel that there is no problem.

613
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But suppose I am doing today.

614
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Quantum computing.

615
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Then I want to go to the TSMC to ask for money.

616
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This way.

617
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Then I obviously can not write ...

618
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Such a title.

619
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So I will ...

620
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Uh ...

621
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I ...

622
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I predict who the audience is.

623
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So I wrote a relatively clear title.

624
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Then focus on not so much math.

625
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Maybe not so much math.

626
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Then write some ...

627
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The future possibilities of these.

628
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Then I may even be ...

629
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Write Chinese, etc.

630
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So I will be more inclined to ...

631
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Uh ...

632
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The speaker ...

633
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I think this is the responsibility of the speaker.

634
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
They ...

635
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Want to know their own ...

636
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Predict the audience.

637
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Who do they want the audience to be?

638
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Then go ...

639
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Cooperate with the audience.

640
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Control their depth.

641
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Achieve the goal they want to achieve.

642
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I will be more inclined to ...

643
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Leave this part to the speaker.

644
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Then if you really want the speaker ...

645
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
There is no no.

646
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, I ...

647
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I fully understand you.

648
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I mean ...

649
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The speaker can of course decide for himself.

650
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But it should be said ...

651
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Maybe your platform can ...

652
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Is that you can ...

653
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Maybe on the website.

654
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Or what can you say?

655
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Oh, we have ...

656
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
These ...

657
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That is, we may ...

658
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You can give these ...

659
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Types of ...

660
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That ...

661
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Speech.

662
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Then you can ...

663
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Just think about it.

664
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Which part are you more inclined to?

665
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That ...

666
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You can tell us first.

667
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Then we are doing advertising.

668
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Or in classification.

669
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Or when arranging.

670
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We are more able to ...

671
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Just ...

672
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Help you classify well.

673
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Or help you promote.

674
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Of course there is a speaker.

675
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Decide for yourself first.

676
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What type does he want to give you?

677
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It's not that we ...

678
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I did not say what to ask the speaker to give.

679
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Just say you are probably ...

680
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Just in advertising.

681
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Or classification.

682
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Or just ...

683
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
When giving everyone options.

684
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Just say, oh, we have these choices.

685
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
This feeling.

686
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Yeah.

687
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah.

688
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Ok.

689
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Understand.

690
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
This may be in the future.

691
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Just ...

692
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
To the speaker's ...

693
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Uh ...

694
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Instructions.

695
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah.

696
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Because I was thinking ...

697
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You just ...

698
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah.

699
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You just said ...

700
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Maybe you want to classify or classify.

701
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Then I just want to say ...

702
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
This may be ...

703
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Just ...

704
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You can try it.

705
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Just ...

706
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Because I have participated in it.

707
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm not sure.

708
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
No, no.

709
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I think this suggestion is very good.

710
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Just ...

711
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I think we might have to think about it.

712
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Is ...

713
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Sure.

714
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Our speech content.

715
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
There is probably no problem.

716
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
This is the 20-minute, 40-minute distribution.

717
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Then the depth of distribution.

718
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But we are ...

719
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Let others see this.

720
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
When people see this announcement.

721
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Unless you are really doing that thing.

722
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Or you will not know.

723
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What is this doing?

724
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That is either.

725
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
We can make the speech.

726
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The title can be set.

727
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It is easier to understand.

728
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Otherwise, we are.

729
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
We, for example, Facebook.

730
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That article in the post.

731
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
There should be one.

732
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
For example,

733
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What kind of this is.

734
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Or say this thing.

735
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
One word clearly said.

736
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
What is this doing?

737
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This is so that you can know.

738
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I think this may have to think about it later.

739
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I think this may have to think about it later.

740
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I think this may have to think about it later.

741
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I think this may have to think about it later.

742
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I wrote it down.

743
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
End of discussion.

744
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
We can write a difficulty index.

745
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars.

746
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Then every time.

747
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That is, you know.

748
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
1 star is a textbook speech.

749
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
5 stars.

750
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You may have to do academic discussion.

751
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You may have to do academic discussion.

752
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We can have one like this.

753
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
We can have one like this.

754
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Logo.

755
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
What is the type.

756
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
OK.

757
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
That was Zhang Yan-yong.

758
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
That was Zhang Yan-yong.

759
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I am not sure.

760
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I am not sure.

761
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
There is no.

762
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's me.

763
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But I was just...

764
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But I was just...

765
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Settings.

766
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I finished.

767
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I finished.

768
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I finished.

769
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And then...

770
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Er...

771
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So I think just now,

772
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The summary of Zhang Yan-yong is good.

773
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

774
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

775
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

776
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

777
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

778
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

779
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

780
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,400
In this speech,

781
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,500
In this speech,

782
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,000
Because of, for example,

783
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,000


784
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Because of, for example,

785
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Because of, for example,

786
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Because of, for example,

787
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Because of, for example,

788
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Because of, for example,

789
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Because of, for example,

790
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Because of, for example,

791
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Because of, for example,

792
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Because of, for example,

793
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Because of, for example,

794
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Because of, for example,

795
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Because of, for example,

796
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Because of, for example,

797
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Because of, for example,

798
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.

799
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.

800
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.

801
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The development of your career may be similar at that age.

802
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The development of your career may be similar at that age.

803
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That's probably what I am talking about.

804
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Well that's the answer to your question.

805
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Last time when I was looking for a job as a novice professor

806
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I found that most of the professors are very active.

807
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But I don't know if they are active when I am in a deeper speech.

808
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But I don't know if they are active when I am in a deeper speech.

809
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Or maybe they are not participating.

810
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I found that they may have been doctors at that time.

811
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I found that they may have been doctors at that time.

812
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But they are now in the workplace.

813
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Their contribution and their needs are different.

814
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
But we didn't follow them or update them.

815
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
But we didn't follow them or update them.

816
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
When we want to find a partner,

817
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
we can't find them.

818
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Another thing I want to mention is the scope.

819
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
In public health,

820
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
there is a committee of North American public health scholars.

821
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
The committee is very detailed.

822
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
We have a group about health policy on Facebook.

823
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
We have a group about health policy on Facebook.

824
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
If the members are willing to work with other professional groups,

825
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
If the members are willing to work with other professional groups,

826
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
it will increase the scope of their work.

827
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
But now I heard that the speech is all about science and technology.

828
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I participated in a few times.

829
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I participated in a few times.

830
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I really don't understand other things.

831
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I really don't understand other things.

832
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Who are you and what are you doing?

833
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Who are you and what are you doing?

834
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Who are you and what are you doing?

835
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I don't think there is a way.

836
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
If your profession has a special organization

837
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
that has been established for a long time

838
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and has developed into a good platform,

839
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I don't think we need to recruit people like that.

840
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I don't think we need to recruit people like that.

841
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
We can find a Taiwanese public service organization in North America

842
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
and hold a speech with them.

843
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I think this is the best way to cooperate.

844
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
For public service scholars,

845
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
they can speak on our platform.

846
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
They can speak to non-public service people.

847
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
They can speak to non-public service people.

848
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
In this way, they may be able to reach people

849
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
they usually can't reach.

850
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I think this is a way to cooperate.

851
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I think I can only agree with this.

852
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I just want to say

853
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
in our administrative experience,

854
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
in fact,

855
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I know there is a Taiwanese Biological Society in Boston.

856
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
They are in South California now.

857
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
They are in San Diego.

858
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Professional societies like this

859
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
have contacted us.

860
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
There are also other societies

861
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
that are similar to Taiwanese

862
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
in certain academic fields overseas.

863
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Many of them have contacted us.

864
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
We do want to cooperate with them.

865
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
We are also very welcome

866
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
if there is a practical plan

867
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
to discuss with us

868
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
or if you are interested in joining the staff.

869
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Because we don't have a lot of people.

870
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
This is also a problem.

871
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Another problem is that

872
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
we are thinking about how to do it better.

873
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
If you have any opinion,

874
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
we are very welcome.

875
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Obviously, everyone has this idea.

876
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
We also have this idea.

877
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
This is a good suggestion.

878
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I don't know what you think.

879
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Otherwise, we can go through the questions.

880
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I have a small question.

881
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Everyone,

882
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
for our actual system experience,

883
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
what I want to ask is

884
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
if you join the membership,

885
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
we will add you to the list of members.

886
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
All the members are on the list.

887
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
We will send out all the emails

888
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
using the mailing list.

889
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Basically, everyone will receive all the messages.

890
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I know that for many people,

891
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
this is not the best way.

892
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Some people may only want to receive

893
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
the membership information.

894
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
They don't want to receive

895
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
a speech announcement every week.

896
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Some people only want to receive

897
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
the speech announcement.

898
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
They don't want you to contact them

899
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
to update their rights.

900
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Whatever.

901
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I can accept it anyway.

902
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I just want to know the speech information.

903
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Some people only want to receive

904
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
the information like

905
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
where the job openings are,

906
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
or where people are competing.

907
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
This kind of information.

908
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
For this more detailed system operation,

909
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I don't know how your experience is,

910
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
or what kind of changes you want to see,

911
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
or what kind of upgrades you want to see.

912
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Do you have any opinions?

913
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Or share your feelings.

914
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Zhang Anping said,

915
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
you want to classify the mailing list

916
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
into several themes.

917
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Is that what you mean?

918
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
This may be a way.

919
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But how do you actually do it?

920
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Does anyone have similar experience?

921
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Or a better suggestion?

922
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You can share.

923
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I don't know how to do it backstage.

924
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But I think the front desk part

925
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
seems to have a lot of websites

926
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
that say you go in

927
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and there are several different themes

928
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
of newsletters you can book.

929
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Then you tick what you want.

930
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's like this.

931
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I think we have a little bit like this now.

932
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Because the main list of staff

933
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and the members are actually separate.

934
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So for me,

935
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
there are already two options.

936
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I can tick both.

937
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
That kind of feeling.

938
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I don't know how to do it backstage.

939
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Or you can divide it by frequency.

940
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
For example,

941
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
the type of work,

942
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
maybe several times a month.

943
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Or the type of speech,

944
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
several times a month.

945
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
By frequency.

946
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
What you said is

947
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
a pretty interesting idea.

948
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
In fact, this idea is like

949
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
you subscribe to some main list.

950
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Then you can say,

951
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
don't send it to me.

952
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You help me monthly digest.

953
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Then send it all to me.

954
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Similar concept, right?

955
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
OK.

956
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Let me write it down.

957
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Are we talking about the same thing?

958
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You go ahead.

959
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Just now, Lin Gaoxian

960
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
left a comment in the chat.

961
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
He said,

962
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
is it possible to divide the members into areas?

963
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Then each group has a person to gather.

964
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Each person gathers to give a speech.

965
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Each group may have

966
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
different areas at the same time.

967
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It can consume a lot of speech demand.

968
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
This feels a bit like

969
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
the question just now.

970
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
That is to say,

971
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
we have to divide into different areas.

972
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Then each create a group.

973
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
In fact,

974
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
this is what we have thought about

975
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
in the staff part.

976
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
There is a problem.

977
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
For example,

978
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
every week,

979
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
from carrying one speech

980
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
to carrying two speeches,

981
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
the number of staff we basically need

982
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
is to first order to multiply by 2.

983
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But we don't have enough people.

984
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
This is a problem.

985
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
But

986
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
we have recruited new staff this year.

987
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
If new staff are interested

988
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
in this direction

989
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
to produce such a project,

990
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
we can try it.

991
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I think we can try it.

992
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I am optimistic.

993
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
There is nothing wrong with it.

994
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
The actual details may be

995
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
what the staff

996
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
might want to do

997
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
when arranging it.

998
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
This is a good suggestion.

999
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I think most of the suggestions

1000
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
are similar to this.

1001
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
There is a guest

1002
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
who said

1003
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
there is a

1004
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
e-news platform.

1005
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I clicked on it.

1006
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
He said

1007
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
MailChimp.

1008
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I know this.

1009
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It can help you make e-news.

1010
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You Zhen is our IT team.

1011
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
She said

1012
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
thank you for considering this platform.

1013
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Let me add something.

1014
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I actually quite like this platform.

1015
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
But because

1016
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
currently we

1017
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
discussed it before.

1018
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
We hope

1019
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
the new staff

1020
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
can

1021
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
see the previous

1022
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
work opportunities

1023
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
or

1024
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
the speech

1025
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
announced this week

1026
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
but it hasn't happened yet.

1027
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
This kind of information.

1028
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Something like this.

1029
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You can look back.

1030
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
That's why we want to use

1031
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Google Groups.

1032
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It can be like

1033
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
you can see the website.

1034
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
There is a website interface.

1035
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
You can receive it

1036
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
from e-mail.

1037
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That's why we consider this.

1038
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
MailChimp

1039
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
is an e-news platform.

1040
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So we can't do this.

1041
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
This is the reason

1042
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
we don't consider it.

1043
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But it is good management.

1044
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Thank you for your advice.

1045
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Does anyone have any questions

1046
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
about logo?

1047
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Or does anyone want to...

1048
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Do we need a draft?

1049
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Pause.

1050
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Does anyone want to ask

1051
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
where the Facebook logo came from?

1052
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Sorry.

1053
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
This is my personal question.

1054
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You can explain.

1055
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
When I

1056
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
created it 2 years ago,

1057
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I thought

1058
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
there is no logo now.

1059
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I should put my son's photo.

1060
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
To protect his

1061
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
portrait rights,

1062
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I didn't put my son's photo.

1063
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It's okay.

1064
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What do you think

1065
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
about logo?

1066
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I think

1067
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
we should

1068
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
see

1069
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
if there is

1070
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
a person who is good at

1071
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
art.

1072
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
If there is,

1073
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
we can create our logo.

1074
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I don't think

1075
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
there is

1076
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
any

1077
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
opinion.

1078
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I don't think

1079
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
there is much opinion.

1080
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Okay.

1081
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Does anyone

1082
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
have any

1083
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
questions?

1084
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
If you don't,

1085
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
let's move on

1086
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
to the next part.

1087
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Okay.

1088
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Let's

1089

in fact

1685
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
I think we can

1686
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,880
invite those who

1687
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,880

01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:40,880
a little

1689
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,880
out of the sound

1690
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,880

1691
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,880
actually

1692
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,880
we

1693
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,880
that application form

1694
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:48,880
before sending out

1695
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,880
some people have already

1696
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,880
come to fill in

1697
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:54,880

1698
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,880
do not be so

1699
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,880

01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,880
more than 20 people

1703
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,880

1704
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,880
people who have

1705
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,880
already filled in

1706
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,880

01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,880

1709
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:06,880
right

1710
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,880
I can

1711
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,880
I can

1712
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,880
say that

1713
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:10,880
you are already

1714
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,880
a staff

1715
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,880
so

1716
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,880
I'm not

1717
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,880

01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,880

1719
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,880
sorry

1720
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,880
I'm

1721
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,880
really

1722
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,880
the first time

1723
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
to participate in

1724
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,880
this meeting

1725
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,880
I was just

1726
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,880
two weeks

1727
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,880
before the

1728
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,880
association

1729
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,880
gave the

1730
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,880
job

1731
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,880
seminar

1732
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,880
when I

1733
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,880
knew

1734
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,880
your association

1735
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,880
and then I

1736
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,880
went online

1737
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:34,880
to see

1738
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,880
and then fill in

1739
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,880
that form

1740
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,880
but

1741
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,880
this is really

1742
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,880
my first time

1743
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:40,880
to join

1744
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,880
so I

1745
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,880
actually

1746
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,880
have no experience

1747
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,880
and then

1748
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,880
I have not heard

1749
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,880
any of your

1750
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,880
seminars

1751
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,880
but

1752
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,880
now

1753
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,880
I can

1754
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,880
introduce myself

1755
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,880
is that

1756
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,880
I have been

1757
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,880
at home

1758
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,880
during the pandemic

1759
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
so

1760
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,880
I started

1761
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,880
to look at

1762
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,880
these things

1763
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,880
and I'm quite

1764
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,880
interested in

1765
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,880
joining

1766
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,880
if there is a

1767
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,880
chance

1768
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,880
oh

1769
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:06,880
ok

1770
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:07,880
ok

1771
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,880
welcome

1772
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,880
then

1773
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,880
which

1774
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,880
aspect

1775
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,880
are you doing

1776
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,880
I am doing

1777
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,880
my own background

1778
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,880

1779
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,880

1781
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,880
so I

1782
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
am doing

1783
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
some research

1784
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,880
on climate

1785
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,880
so

1786
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,880
I am

1787
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,880
