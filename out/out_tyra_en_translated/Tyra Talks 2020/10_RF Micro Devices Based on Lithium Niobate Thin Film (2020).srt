1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Recording has started.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All right.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In 2011 and 2015, he received his master's and Ph.D. degrees from the Narrow Engineering and Microsystems Institute of Tsinghua University.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He also served as a postdoc researcher at the University of Illinois's Urban Champion.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He is currently working as an assistant professor in the Department of Power and Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Today, Prof. Ming-Huang will be giving a presentation on RF Microdevices Based on the ThinFILM Lithium NeoBit.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Prof. Ming-Huang, please give us a warm welcome and applause.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you for your introduction. I am Prof. Ming-Huang Li.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I am currently working as an assistant professor in the Department of Power and Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
My background is the same as what I just introduced.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I received my master's degree in mechanical engineering from Tsinghua University.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
After that, I completed my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
After completing my Ph.D. degree, I briefly served as a postdoc for a year in Taiwan.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I then looked for opportunities to work as a postdoc in the United States.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Later, I was able to successfully work as a postdoc in the ECE Department of UIUC.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My main research topics are divided into two directions.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The first one is a funding project for me.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It is a DAPA Amoeba project.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The goal is to develop a low-frequency mechanical rectifier that can be used in the military.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
At the same time, we have another project under execution.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is the topic I am going to talk about.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is the topic I am going to talk about.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is the topic I am going to talk about.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My research interests are these.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Whether it is a static power supply or a power supply,

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
As long as it is a microcomputing component or a supercomputer component,

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They are all in my area of interest.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is my outline today.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
First, I will start with our motivation.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The motivation is divided into two parts.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The first part is why we want to apply the sound wave component to the RF system.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It has a very long history.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But maybe everyone doesn't know why.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I will start from this point.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Next, I will explain why lithium niobate is now considered to have a chance to become a star of the day.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will introduce a few classic components in the current field.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Then I will explain their characteristics one by one.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Finally, there are two simple case studies.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The latter two parts are what I am doing.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The first one is about the adjustment of the temperature coefficient.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And its theoretical calculation and simulation.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The second part is what I started to do after I returned to Taiwan.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Due to these small components,

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Usually, you have to make it with a seamless device.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If the device is not so useful,

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In fact, the performance of the components will not be so ideal.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So after returning to Taiwan, we hope to reduce the loading in the process as much as possible.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So we developed all the thin-shaped lithium niobate components.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
After returning to Taiwan, we hope to use the same concept.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We use surface-to-surface components to make.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We have also achieved some results recently.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The first part is my motivation.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Just like all human life requirements,

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We hope to obtain information quickly and conveniently.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is why the communication system has been improving.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
From 2G and 3G decades ago to 4G and 5G in recent years,

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We all hope that the communication system can meet all our needs.

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It also includes high-speed transmission, low latency, and high reliability.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Based on this requirement, 5G communication is divided into three categories.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The first is high-speed, the so-called ENBB part.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It mainly uses high frequency bandwidth.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Because when the center frequency is higher,

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The same ratio of bandwidth allows you to accommodate more communication channels.

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This can improve the transmission speed of your data.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
On the other hand, we also hope to have a low latency network.

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Low latency network is used for safety or special applications.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
For example, the network of a self-driving car.

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If the network is interrupted in the process of self-driving,

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It may not be able to receive important information.

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This will create some doubts about the safety of passengers.

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Therefore, this low latency and uninterrupted network is also an important part of 5G.

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In addition, in smart homes or smart cities,

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
In the future, we will hope to build an Internet of Things system.

76
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Therefore, we also hope to have some low-power transmission

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
To meet the applications of these sensor nodes.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Since 5G divides our needs into three categories,

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It is impossible for them to operate on the same frequency band.

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because the frequency band is limited,

81
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The number of channels or users that can be accommodated within the frequency band is also limited.

82
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So it is obvious that if we want to meet these three needs at the same time,

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It must be distributed in different frequencies on the distribution of frequency bands.

84
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we can see at the bottom of this picture,

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In fact, 5G is divided into three parts.

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Low-band is less than 1GHz,

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mid-band is between 1GHz and 6GHz,

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
High-band is between 6GHz and 100GHz.

89
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Generally, Low-band and Mid-band are divided into FR1,

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And MW is divided into FR2.

91
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Is there any difference between 5G frequency band, 4G and 3G?

92
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In fact, there is a big difference.

93
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The main difference is that 5G hopes to

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Use the limited frequency left by the communication system.

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And hope to give them a new mission.

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So in addition to the existing 3G and 4G infrastructure in the 5G communication system,

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It also needs to insert these new frequencies in addition.

98
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The biggest challenge of these new frequencies is that

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It is very different from the traditional 4G network or 3G communication.

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The frequency range of some bands is very large.

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
For example, we have the so-called band N77 and band N79.

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
These two frequencies may account for more than 10% of the frequency range.

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
In terms of N77, it accounts for 24%.

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
For higher frequency bands, such as band 258,

105
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Its frequency range is about 10%.

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The size of the frequency range has a great impact on hardware design.

107
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because at present, most of the radio waves used in the current communication system,

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Especially in mobile phones, are radio waves.

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The frequency range of these radio waves is limited.

110
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The frequency range of these radio waves is usually controlled by the characteristics of its voltage material.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So for the current frequency range of 10% to 20%,

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It is very difficult to achieve with the current technology.

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So this is a new challenge from the system to the hardware design.

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We also believe that we can get some new opportunities in this new challenge.

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This graph shows the communication system architecture used by 3G, 4G, EET, and 5G carriers.

116
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Compared with the traditional 3G and 4G,

117
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It is obvious that 5G wants to have more applications,

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So it has more usable frequency bands.

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
In order to properly process these signals, we need more filters.

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The filter is used to process a specific frequency band signal.

121
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
For example, if the center frequency band of my filter is 1GHz,

122
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And the frequency band is 400MHz,

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So I will probably go from 980MHz to 1020MHz.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The frequency in the middle is allowed to pass.

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I will try to suppress the signal beyond this frequency band.

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So I can use these filters alone to select the communication frequency band I want,

127
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And erase other signals.

128
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In this way, it will be more convenient for me to process the following signals,

129
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And the error rate will be lower.

130
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Since the frequency band keeps increasing,

131
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
As we described earlier,

132
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
When the frequency band increases, we need more filters.

133
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
These filters also hope to have large frequency bands.

134
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Therefore, the characteristics of the filter and its size need to be precisely controlled.

135
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Especially if we want the phone to be able to use 5G communication properly,

136
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So many filters have to be stuffed into the phone.

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Therefore, the size of the filter is very strict.

138
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This brings us to the first topic today.

139
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why do we want to apply the frequency band software to 5G communication?

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Especially 5G communication with strict size restrictions.

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The reason is that the frequency band is lower than the battery band.

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Therefore, the size of the frequency band will be smaller than the battery band.

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In the above picture,

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We can compare the EM duplexer in the form of a battery band,

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And the duplexer produced by the frequency band software.

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The size of the duplexer is 10 times smaller than the battery band.

147
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Therefore, we can expect a frequency band to be 100 times smaller than the EM duplexer.

148
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
In the same space, we can put more frequency band filters to meet our communication needs.

149
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The frequency band is a mechanical resonance component.

150
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
In general, the quality of mechanical resonance will be higher than that of the EM duplexer.

151
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Therefore, it usually has the characteristics of low insertion loss.

152
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The most important thing is that the EM duplexer still needs to go through the steps required by the general semiconductor manufacturing process.

153
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
For example, exposure, salinity, time, etc.

154
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
These technologies are very mature in the industrial world.

155
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Therefore, the EM duplexer can also be mass-produced and maintain a very stable salinity.

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Sorry, I have a question.

157
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Please go ahead.

158
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a bit of an outlandish question.

159
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because what I'm doing is resonator, but what I'm doing is superconductor.

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So, I don't understand.

161
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What is the reason for the fundamental physics?

162
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The quality factor of the resonator will be higher and the loss factor will be lower.

163
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Because it feels like it uses a lot of energy to vibrate something.

164
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It has the effect of EM in a space.

165
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I can't understand intuitively why its quality is better.

166
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:56,000
In my opinion, this wave can be limited to a certain range.

167
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Because mechanical vibration can be understood as

168
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
For example, I take a beam and let it vibrate.

169
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Its boundary is very clear.

170
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Because my beam is a beam with a fixed length and height.

171
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So when it vibrates, it's like it's in this object.

172
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It produces a beam.

173
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But if it's EM, I'm not sure if it has such a good boundary to limit its EM.

174
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's the distribution of electromagnetic waves in space that produces a beam.

175
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But I do know that there are some high-quality EM resonators.

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's like some dielectric resonators.

177
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It should be a transmission line mode.

178
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Its Q can reach several hundred.

179
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But in terms of deep wave components,

180
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At present, commercial components,

181
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We call it an amplifier component of a deep wave filter.

182
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Its Q can reach about 4000 to 5000.

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So I think it still has a difference of one or two quantities.

184
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh, I see. Okay, thank you.

185
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, I'll go on.

186
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
At present, 4G LTE has a lot of communication frequency.

187
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Usually, there are about 3 to 4 wireless modules in a mobile phone.

188
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
To meet the needs of different frequencies.

189
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
For example, Wi-Fi has 2.4G and 5G.

190
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
These two may be a module.

191
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The traditional GSM communication and CDMA communication may be another module.

192
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In such a module, it will contain a lot of active and passive components.

193
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
For example, in terms of this package,

194
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It contains 4 PA, which is the so-called power amplifier.

195
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
To generate enough energy for long-distance transmission.

196
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It has 18 filters and 5 switch modules.

197
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There is also a collective circuit for communication.

198
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There is also a chip for impedance matching.

199
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So in such a module, it actually contains 18 filters.

200
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So we can imagine that if there are three such modules in our mobile phone.

201
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It has more than 50 filters.

202
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
In the future, we hope that 5G can accommodate more bands.

203
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So we can expect that the number of filters will continue to increase.

204
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000
At the same size, we hope that these filters can be small and high-performance.

205
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So this is also the main challenge of the current filter design.

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The second part is to explain why we think that Li-Lian NIOBE is a material with a good prospect.

207
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Before the introduction of this LN, we can briefly review the three common transmitters.

208
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The first one on the left is the traditional transceiver.

209
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Its material is usually Li-Lian NIOBE or Li-Lian TENTALATE.

210
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
These two materials are all man-made crystals.

211
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So they generally do not appear in the normal environment.

212
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Because they are man-made crystals.

213
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because the traditional transceiver uses a thicker base.

214
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So when we use a very small indexing electrode to stimulate the sound wave on the surface.

215
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It usually forms a surface wave.

216
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There are many forms of surface waves.

217
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But the most common ones are usually Rayleigh waves or Leaky waves.

218
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The Leaky wave has the opportunity to get a relatively large magnetic resonance.

219
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But its loss will also be relatively large.

220
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
In terms of Rayleigh waves, its typical magnetic resonance factor is about 7%.

221
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,000
In our field, we are used to using KT² or KEffective² symbols to represent magnetic resonance.

222
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Its Q is about 1000.

223
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The second one is also the most popular model of transceiver at present.

224
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We call it FBAR.

225
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It is a transceiver with a film buck acoustic wave resonator.

226
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
After a long search and research,

227
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
we finally determined that aluminum nitride is the most suitable commercial application for FBAR.

228
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because other materials have more or less other problems.

229
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Its general magnetic resonance factor can give you about 6.5%.

230
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Its Q is about 3000 in 2GHz.

231
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But there are already some companies, such as Brokon, which is the predecessor of Avago.

232
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
In terms of Brokon, their Q should be able to do more than 45,000.

233
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In order to strengthen its magnetic resonance feature,

234
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,000
some researches will use KONG element to dope it into aluminum nitride.

235
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Generally, it is used to improve the transceiver.

236
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When aluminum nitride is sputtered, KONG element is used to dope it into aluminum nitride.

237
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The higher the content of KONG element, the higher its magnetic resonance factor will be.

238
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
However, due to the increase in the defect of KONG element,

239
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
KONG element's magnetic resonance factor will decrease as time goes by.

240
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The third type is the so-called LAMP wave.

241
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It is usually made from aluminum nitride.

242
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It is a fairly good material now.

243
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Its coupling is about 6.5%.

244
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Because its thickness becomes very thin,

245
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it is usually less than one wavelength.

246
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You can see that its electrode configuration is very similar to that of SOHL.

247
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
However, what it triggers is not a surface wave, but a body wave.

248
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The body wave will be described by another set of equations.

249
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So it will have completely different characteristics from SOHL.

250
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Since the coupling of aluminum nitride itself is not particularly strong,

251
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and its coupling will change according to the direction of the electrode and the form of the wave,

252
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
its coupling will generally be between 1% and 4.5%.

253
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The Q value is about 2000.

254
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
By combining the above three different components,

255
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
we can see that we are very concerned about its two characteristics.

256
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The first is its magnetic resonance.

257
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The second is the quality factor.

258
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The definition of magnetic resonance is probably the ratio of mechanical energy to total energy.

259
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Because we want to know how much energy is transferred from electricity to the mechanical field

260
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
when we give some energy to the electrode on the surface.

261
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So we generally use KT square as a very important indicator.

262
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The second indicator is the so-called quality factor.

263
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Q has a lot of definitions,

264
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
but the most widely known one is the ratio of the energy stored in our system

265
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and the energy lost by each cycle of movement.

266
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So the higher the Q, the lower the energy loss.

267
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
When the energy loss is lower, I have a chance to make a green wave that has a lower energy loss.

268
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Because KT square and Q are very important,

269
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
we will define our performance indicator,

270
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
which is to multiply Q by KT square.

271
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So we can use F bar as an example.

272
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Its performance indicator is probably between 100 and 200.

273
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This graph shows...

274
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Sorry, I have a question.

275
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Can I go back to the last page?

276
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You said that your excitation is at 2 GHz,

277
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
but my question is that,

278
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
for example, the受 is the surface wave,

279
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
or the lamp wave on the right is the body wave.

280
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Is the excitation mode 2 GHz or not?

281
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
My question is, what is its phonon frequency?

282
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's 2 GHz.

283
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, so that's only a few million EVs.

284
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Let me check the Planck constant.

285
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It should be.

286
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay, I see. Thank you.

287
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
In fact, according to the characteristics of IDT,

288
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
it has a periodicity.

289
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So its complete cycle will be a wavelength.

290
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So we will also use the size of these wavelengths

291
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and the relationship of IDT cycle to design a mode that suits them.

292
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That's how it works in practice.

293
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay, so I just checked.

294
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Okay, so I just checked.

295
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm more used to the unit of energy.

296
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Anyway, it's multiplied by h.

297
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So what I mean is,

298
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm curious about one thing,

299
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that is, if 2 GHz is multiplied by Planck constant,

300
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
it's less than 10 mEV.

301
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That is to say,

302
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
if I give this device at least 10 mEV,

303
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it will have a signal.

304
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It will trigger a quantum, right?

305
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
A quantum.

306
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm not so sure about the definition of physics.

307
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh, okay.

308
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But basically, its mode is 2 GHz mode.

309
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That's for sure.

310
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay, I see. Okay, thank you.

311
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This graph shows

312
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
the motion of these three different components.

313
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Generally speaking,

314
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
the Resonator of the Soul

315
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
is made on the surface of the crystal,

316
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
so there is no boundary around it.

317
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So we will artificially add

318
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the so-called Acoustic Reflector.

319
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It is made in the form of the so-called Block Reflector.

320
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That is, my grating,

321
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
its cycle,

322
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
is about a quarter of the wavelength.

323
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
This method of stacking

324
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
to enhance its ripple on the boundary reflection.

325
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
On the right,

326
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
you can see the motion of its surface wavelength.

327
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Its motion mode

328
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
has a ripple on the surface.

329
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Then in the depth of the crystal,

330
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
about a few lambda below,

331
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
it is a non-moving state.

332
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So its ripple exists on the surface of the system.

333
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What is different from the surface wavelength

334
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
is that the two graphs below,

335
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
which are FFAR and LandWave,

336
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
they are vibrating the whole structure.

337
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
FFAR is a longitudinal mode

338
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
in the center of the crystal.

339
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So its upper and lower surfaces

340
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
will move in different directions.

341
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Then the center of this material

342
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
is the node of the movement,

343
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
so its stress will be the greatest.

344
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
On the right,

345
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
it is the so-called LandWave motion mode.

346
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Although LandWave

347
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
also uses the IDT electrode as the trigger,

348
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
its upper and lower surfaces are free surfaces,

349
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
so it generally has two different motion modes.

350
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The first is the so-called symmetrical motion,

351
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
that is, the upper and lower surfaces

352
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
move in different directions.

353
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So its center plane

354
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
is a mirror mode.

355
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The second is the so-called asymmetric motion,

356
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
that is, the upper and lower surfaces

357
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
move in the same direction.

358
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So it is more like a high-speed fractal mode.

359
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
After understanding the basic components

360
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and their motion and some of its characteristics,

361
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
we can talk about

362
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
how to make a deep wave filter.

363
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
In fact, when we generally analyze,

364
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
we will only look at its physical behavior

365
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
at the level of a device,

366
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
that is, at the level of a single rectifier.

367
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But when it comes to designing a filter,

368
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
we generally use

369
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
the so-called ladder filter circuit.

370
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
With such a circuit,

371
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
we can treat each rectifier

372
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
as an independent component,

373
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
so we use a simplified model to describe it.

374
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
In terms of a rectifier system,

375
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
it can be seen as a combination of

376
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
quality, resistance, and strength.

377
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
On the circuit,

378
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
we can find that

379
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it has the same motion

380
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
as the connected

381
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
resistor, capacitor, and inductor.

382
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It has the same mathematical form.

383
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So we also tend to use

384
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
such a set of equivalent circuits

385
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
to describe it.

386
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because of this,

387
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
we can directly use

388
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
the circuit design tools

389
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
to design and simulate.

390
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It will be more convenient.

391
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
With such a set of equivalent circuits,

392
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
it also has a C0

393
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
parallel to the main

394
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
motional branch.

395
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The meaning of this C0

396
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
is that it is a static capacitor

397
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
produced between the

398
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
rectifier capacitor

399
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
or the electrode

400
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
.

401
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Such a model

402
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
is usually called

403
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Modified Butterworth-Van Dyck model

404
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
or MVVD model.

405
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Such a set of models

406
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
can be seen on the circuit

407
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
as a

408
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
rectifier and

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
a anti-rectifier model.

410
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Its rectifier frequency

411
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
is mainly connected

412
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
by the connected

413
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
RLC.

414
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The parallel rectification

415
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
is determined by the

416
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
ratio of Cm and C0.

417
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
After obtaining

418
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
a single rectifier

419
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
motion form,

420
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
we can start

421
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
designing the filter.

422
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
In the case of

423
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Ladder Filter,

424
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
it has a series resonator

425
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and a parallel resonator.

426
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
In general,

427
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
the wavelength of the parallel resonator

428
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
is slightly different from

429
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
that of the series resonator.

430
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We want to

431
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
match the

432
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
anti-rectifier frequency

433
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
of the parallel resonator

434
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
with the series resonator.

435
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Through such a circuit,

436
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
we can use

437
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
two parallel resonators

438
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
with different frequencies

439
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
to form the

440
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
passband of the filter.

441
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The passband can be controlled.

442
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
As long as

443
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
we carefully select

444
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
the separation

445
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
of the resonator,

446
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the parallel resonator

447
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and the anti-rectifier,

448
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
we can achieve the effect of

449
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
controlling the wavelength.

450
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
In theory,

451
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
there seems to be a way to

452
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
make it.

453
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
However,

454
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
by observing such a circuit,

455
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
we can find that

456
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
the K effective square

457
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
is limited by a factor.

458
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
After some

459
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
deductions,

460
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
we can find that

461
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
the K effective square

462
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
is related to

463
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Fp and Fs.

464
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Another potential factor

465
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
is that it is related to

466
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the opamp factor.

467
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
On the other hand,

468
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
the opamp factor

469
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
determines the size of

470
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
the K effective square

471
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and affects the separation

472
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
between Fp and Fs.

473
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
In order to meet the requirements

474
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
of 5G communication,

475
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
such as 10% and 20%

476
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
frequency,

477
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
we must find

478
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
the K effective square

479
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
as the basis of

480
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
the design of the resonator.

481
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Therefore,

482
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
let's look at

483
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
the material

484
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
lithium niobate.

485
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It is a material

486
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
with a long history.

487
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It was probably

488
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
synthesized

489
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
30 or 40 years ago,

490
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and it has a very

491
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
unique feature of

492
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
a three-dimensional

493
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
crystal structure.

494
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Therefore,

495
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
it has different

496
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
opamp characteristics

497
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
in different wave directions.

498
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It has also been widely used

499
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in the design of

500
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
this kind of

501
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
surface wave components.

502
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
For general

503
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
surface wave components,

504
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
its pixel speed is

505
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
about 4000mps.

506
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Its effective coupling

507
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
is about 17%,

508
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and its Q is about 1000.

509
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
However,

510
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
we have always thought

511
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
that we did not fully

512
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
apply the characteristics of

513
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
this material,

514
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
because its K effective square

515
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
is actually much lower

516
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
than the theoretical prediction value

517
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
of this material.

518
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Therefore,

519
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
about 20 years ago,

520
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
there was a famous paper

521
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
that mainly analyzed

522
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
the coupling of

523
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
lithium niobate crystal

524
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
in three different directions.

525
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Since lithium niobate

526
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
is a three-dimensional crystal,

527
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
it has different characteristics

528
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
for its X-cut,

529
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Y-cut and Z-cut.

530
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The so-called X-cut

531
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
refers to

532
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the X-axis of the material

533
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
as the Y-axis of the crystal,

534
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and the wave transmission

535
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
will be on the YZ plane.

536
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Similarly,

537
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
the Y-cut and Z-cut

538
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
respectively represent

539
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the wave transmission

540
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
on the ZX and XY planes.

541
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
This article

542
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
mainly discusses

543
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
the thickness

544
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
of the three different

545
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
cuts and

546
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
the thickness of the different

547
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
waves.

548
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It can be seen that

549
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
whether it is X-cut or

550
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Y-cut,

551
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
in terms of these three cuts,

552
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
we target

553
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
two modes respectively.

554
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The first is the so-called SH0,

555
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
which is the level-cut mode.

556
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It can be seen that

557
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
there is almost no up-and-down movement

558
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
on the surface,

559
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and its movement occurs

560
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
in the shear inside the plane.

561
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The second mode

562
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
is the so-called S0 mode,

563
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
which is similar to SH0.

564
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
There is no up-and-down movement

565
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
on the surface,

566
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
but its wave transmission

567
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
is in the shear inside the plane.

568
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Based on the analysis

569
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
of these two modes,

570
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
it can be found that

571
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
when you select the thickness

572
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
of the film properly,

573
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the K-square,

574
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
that is,

575
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
the thickness of the film,

576
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
has a chance to reach 30%

577
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
or more than 40%.

578
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
From this theory,

579
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
it can be found that

580
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
when we

581
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
thin the film

582
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
from the thick wafer

583
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
to a very thin film,

584
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
it actually has a chance

585
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
to get a very large

586
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
film thickness,

587
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
which can meet

588
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
our demand for

589
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
high-frequency green wafers.

590
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
As for this technology,

591
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
why did it start to develop

592
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
around 2010,

593
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
mainly because

594
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
lithium nitrate

595
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
itself is a material

596
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
that is not easy to process,

597
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and it has a very good

598
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
resistance to

599
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
all kinds of acids and alkynes.

600
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
This threshold

601
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
was broken about 10 years ago,

602
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
which is mainly the progress

603
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
of smart card technology,

604
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
which allows us

605
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
to do research

606
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
at a relatively

607
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
cheap price

608
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
to obtain such a crystal.

609
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The method of smart card

610
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
is like this.

611
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
We mainly prepare two wafers.

612
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
One is the pressure crystal

613
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
we need,

614
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
and the other is the

615
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
board we carry

616
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
the pressure film.

617
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So at the beginning,

618
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
we put a very thin layer

619
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
of electrolyte

620
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
on the pressure crystal,

621
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and then,

622
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
in addition to being used

623
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
for bonding,

624
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
it can also be used

625
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
to resist

626
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the depth of lithium nitrate

627
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and can be used

628
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
for bonding.

629
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So when we do smart card,

630
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
we use the

631
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
lithium nitrate arrangement method

632
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
to inject a thin layer of

633
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
lithium nitrate

634
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
into a certain depth

635
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
on the surface of the crystal,

636
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
and then,

637
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
after a simple surface

638
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
cleaning and bonding,

639
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
use a heat treatment method

640
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
to produce a stronger

641
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
heat resistance

642
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and then crack

643
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
on that layer,

644
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
separating the two layers of crystal.

645
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So finally,

646
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
after the bonded crystal

647
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
is exposed to the surface,

648
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
the surface is very smooth

649
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and the pressure material

650
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
is very thin.

651
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
This material is very suitable

652
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
for some subsequent processing

653
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
to get the lithium nitrate

654
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
we need.

655
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Okay,

656
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
do you have any questions?

657
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
If not,

658
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I will continue to the next part.

659
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Before we

660
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
design the components,

661
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
we will briefly

662
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
discuss these

663
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
thin boards

664
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and their transmission behavior.

665
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Generally speaking,

666
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
there are two main modes

667
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
for thin boards.

668
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The first mode

669
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
is called Rayleigh-Lamb Wave.

670
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
The second mode

671
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
is called Shear Horizontal Wave.

672
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
These two modes

673
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
are completely different.

674
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
However,

675
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
both Rayleigh-Lamb

676
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and Shear Horizontal Wave

677
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
have the same feature

678
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
that they

679
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
have the so-called

680
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Shear Horizontal Wave.

681
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The Shear Horizontal Wave

682
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
can be simply understood as

683
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the wavelength of the wave

684
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
for a certain mode.

685
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Its wavelength

686
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
will actually

687
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
depend on

688
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
the thickness of the thin board.

689
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
For this S0-Lamb Wave,

690
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
when my board

691
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
is very, very thin,

692
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
its wavelength

693
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
may be close to 10,000 ms.

694
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
However,

695
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
when I slowly

696
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
thicken my thin board,

697
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
it will actually

698
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
transform from Rayleigh-Lamb Wave

699
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
to Rayleigh-Wave.

700
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Therefore,

701
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
their final frequency

702
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
will be close to the thin frequency.

703
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Therefore,

704
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it can be clearly seen that

705
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
in these different waves,

706
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
in addition to

707
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the different waves,

708
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
the frequency will also

709
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
be affected by the thickness.

710
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Therefore, their frequency

711
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is very important.

712
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Since the frequency

713
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
has frequency,

714
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
other features

715
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and features

716
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
will also have frequency.

717
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
For example,

718
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the Shear Horizontal Wave

719
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
is also a parameter

720
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
with frequency.

721
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Next,

722
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
we will use

723
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
the so-called

724
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
30° Rotated Y-Cut

725
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Lithium Niobate

726
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
as an example.

727
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
This is a simulated

728
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
result.

729
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Let's assume

730
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
that the surface of

731
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
the Y-X Lithium Niobate

732
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
is coated with

733
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
periodic IDT electrodes.

734
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Through these electrodes,

735
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
we can trigger

736
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
a frequency

737
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
called

738
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
a0s0

739
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and a1s1.

740
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
In addition to

741
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
LandWave,

742
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
there are other

743
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
so-called

744
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

745
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

746
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

747
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

748
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Shear Horizontal Wave,

749
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Shear Horizontal Wave.

750
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
When the thickness of the electrode

751
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
is increased to a wavelength,

752
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
almost all the

753
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
frequencies of the wave

754
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
will decrease.

755
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Except for a special wave

756
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
called

757
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
a0s0 Shear Horizontal Wave,

758
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
which is almost a parameter,

759
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
other frequencies

760
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
will be significantly affected.

761
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
In addition to the frequency,

762
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
the periodic IDT

763
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
is also a parameter

764
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
that is very sensitive.

765
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So we can see that

766
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
these different modes

767
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
have a very big difference

768
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
in the thickness

769
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
of the electrodes

770
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
under different thicknesses.

771
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
In this picture,

772
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
with such a special section

773
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and a specific

774
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
wave direction,

775
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
we can find that

776
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
it actually has a lot of potential

777
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
because its periodic IDT

778
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
can be greater than 40%.

779
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Therefore,

780
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
such a material

781
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
with such a

782
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Shear Horizontal Wave

783
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
will obviously be

784
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
quite suitable for

785
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
wide-frequency wave design.

786
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I have a question.

787
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
This picture

788
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
is normalized by lambda,

789
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
but if it is actually

790
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
a few gigahertz,

791
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
is it one centimeter?

792
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Is it millimeter scale?

793
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It should be

794
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
in micrometer scale.

795
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Micrometer scale?

796
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Yes.

797
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Because it is related to

798
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
the frequency,

799
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
the frequency of each mode

800
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
is actually quite different.

801
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So for SH,

802
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
it is about

803
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
4,000 to 5,000 meters per second.

804
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So if it is operated

805
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
at 1 gigahertz,

806
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
its thickness should be

807
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
less than 1 micron,

808
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
in order to achieve

809
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
such a high coupling.

810
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I see.

811
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Thank you.

812
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I have a question here.

813
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Sorry.

814
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Does KT

815
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
square

816
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
equal 100%

817
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
have any special meaning?

818
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Does it mean that their energy can be exchanged?

819
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So far,

820
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I have not seen 100%.

821
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But I think

822
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
in theory,

823
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
in terms of definition,

824
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
it is true.

825
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
100% means that

826
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
if you add

827
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
1 mW RF,

828
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
it will produce

829
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
1 mW phonon.

830
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I don't know

831
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
if it can be directly

832
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
seen as phonon.

833
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We generally

834
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
see it as

835
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
an energy coin.

836
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Because

837
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
its

838
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
K effective square

839
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
is equal to

840
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Cm divided by C0.

841
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Cm represents

842
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
motional capacitance.

843
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It is actually related to

844
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
my mechanical strength.

845
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
C0 is my

846
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
capacitance,

847
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
and Cm is my

848
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
actual capacitance.

849
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
There are two kinds of energy.

850
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The first one is

851
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
1 mole

852
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
divided by

853
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
CmV square.

854
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It is a

855
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
mechanical domain energy.

856
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
The second one is

857
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
1 mole divided by

858
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
C0V square.

859
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It is an

860
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
electrical domain energy.

861
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It is 1 mole

862
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
divided by

863
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
CmV square.

864
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It is a

865
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
mechanical domain energy.

866
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
If we imagine it as

867
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
a wave source,

868
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
we can also use

869
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
the MCK system

870
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
to represent

871
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
the energy produced

872
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
by its spring energy

873
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and my

874
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
actual transducer capacitance.

875
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Can I use

876
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
your explanation?

877
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yes.

878
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
According to

879
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
their high coupling

880
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
characteristics,

881
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
these articles

882
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
were published

883
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
in 2015.

884
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
They are new

885
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
results.

886
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
According to

887
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
their materials,

888
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
they started

889
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
to look for

890
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
new components.

891
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
The first article

892
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
is a

893
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
level-cut module.

894
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It

895
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
uses

896
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
two

897
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
pairs of capacitors.

898
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It is similar to

899
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the form of a fingerprint capacitor,

900
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
but it has only one pair.

901
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It is a

902
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
level-cut module.

903
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It uses

904
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
two pairs of

905
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
capacitors

906
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
to generate

907
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
SH0

908
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
by

909
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
coupling

910
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
the

911
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
current

912
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and the

913
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
wave direction.

914
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
According to

915
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
their

916
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
research,

917
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
SH0

918
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
generates

919
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
SH0

920
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
by coupling

921
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
the current

922
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and the wave direction.

923
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
SH0

924
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
generates

925
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
SH0

926
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
by coupling

927
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
the current

928
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and the wave direction.

929
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
We can also see that

930
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
when we set the frequency

931
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
to a relatively low range,

932
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
because some special applications

933
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
do not require such a high frequency,

934
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
for example, 50 MHz is enough,

935
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
its Q can reach 5000,

936
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and

937
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
the coupling is also about 30%.

938
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
The overall

939
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
performance indicator,

940
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
which is KT square times Q,

941
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
is about 1500.

942
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
At present,

943
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
the highest

944
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
coupling we have

945
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
is about this level.

946
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Of course,

947
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
we also find that

948
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
the Q value of the material

949
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
is quite related

950
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
to the thickness of

951
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
the thin film of

952
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
LN.

953
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Because the

954
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
high-performance,

955
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
high-Q, high-coupling,

956
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and low-frequency capacitors

957
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
have a thickness of

958
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
about 2 microns,

959
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
but the example on the right

960
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
is a study of

961
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
EPFL.

962
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
What they use is very thin,

963
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
only 400 nm

964
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
of LN.

965
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So,

966
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
it can be seen that

967
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
even if it can reach a very high frequency,

968
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
its Q

969
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
will drop from 5000

970
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
to 700.

971
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It can also reach

972
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
a very similar

973
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
electro-mechanical coupling

974
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
under the same

975
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
H over LN,

976
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
that is,

977
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
under the thickness of

978
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
normalization,

979
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
which is about 30%.

980
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
The third case is...

981
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Sorry,

982
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I have a little problem

983
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
with the previous statement.

984
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
My intuition is that

985
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
the effect of

986
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
LN is very large.

987
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Is this right?

988
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Or is there another reason?

989
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
This is our current guess.

990
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Because we actually

991
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
used some AFN methods

992
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
to measure

993
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
some extremely thin

994
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
LN thin films.

995
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
The roughness of those surfaces

996
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
is less than 1 nm.

997
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So we are not sure

998
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
why the Q

999
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
or other performance

1000
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
will go up

1001
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
as long as the film

1002
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
is thin.

1003
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And when it is thin,

1004
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
the result will be worse.

1005
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Is there any reason

1006
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
not to make it very thick?

1007
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Is it going to take a long time?

1008
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Is it expensive?

1009
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Mainly based on

1010
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the previous picture.

1011
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
If my thickness is too thick,

1012
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I can't enjoy

1013
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Oh, I got it.

1014
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Thank you.

1015
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The third example

1016
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
is the so-called

1017
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
A1 mode resonator.

1018
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
This A1 mode

1019
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
is a high-level LN wave.

1020
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It looks like

1021
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
it connects

1022
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
many thickness-shear

1023
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
waves together.

1024
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So we can see

1025
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
its movement

1026
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
is horizontal

1027
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
instead of vertical.

1028
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The advantage of

1029
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
such a resonator

1030
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
is that

1031
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
its feature size

1032
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
is mainly controlled by

1033
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
its thickness.

1034
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Because its thickness

1035
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
direction becomes

1036
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
its real 1 in 2 wavelength.

1037
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So a very thin resonator

1038
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
can achieve

1039
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
a very high frequency

1040
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
of coupling.

1041
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So in this design,

1042
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
its Q is about

1043
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
300-400.

1044
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And its

1045
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
operating frequency

1046
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
is about 3.2 GHz.

1047
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The coupling is about 40%.

1048
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So by combining

1049
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
the above demonstrations,

1050
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
we can get

1051
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
that S0, SH0

1052
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
and A1 modes

1053
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
are very potent

1054
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
and can be applied

1055
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
in high-level and high-coupling situations.

1056
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
However,

1057
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
there are

1058
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
some relative

1059
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
shortcomings.

1060
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
For example,

1061
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
due to the thinner membrane structure,

1062
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
it becomes unusually fragile.

1063
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
There may be

1064
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
some problems

1065
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
with the coupling.

1066
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Secondly,

1067
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
lithium niobate

1068
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
is a material

1069
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
with a very low thermal conduction rate.

1070
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Its thermal conduction rate

1071
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
is only twice that of silicon oxide,

1072
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
which is about 1% or 2% of

1073
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
metal.

1074
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So it does not conduct heat very well.

1075
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So when communicating

1076
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
at high power,

1077
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
it can easily

1078
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
have some negative effects.

1079
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Thirdly,

1080
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
its temperature factor

1081
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
is quite high.

1082
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So when the temperature

1083
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
changes in the environment,

1084
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
when using mobile phones

1085
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
in the suburbs

1086
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
and in the northern and southern regions,

1087
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
the frequency will change

1088
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
with the temperature.

1089
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
In this case,

1090
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
it is difficult to convince everyone

1091
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
that it can do a good

1092
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and stable communication.

1093
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So this is mainly

1094
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
a few problems with this material.

1095
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
However,

1096
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
although it has some problems,

1097
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
some companies

1098
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
and some research institutions

1099
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
have also tried to use

1100
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
such components to make

1101
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
some durable and high-frequency

1102
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
lithium niobate.

1103
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
The N79 filter above

1104
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
satisfies the N79 band

1105
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
mentioned earlier.

1106
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
The frequency is about 10% of the strict conditions.

1107
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
The center frequency is about 5GHz.

1108
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It uses

1109
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
the so-called A1 mode

1110
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
rectifier.

1111
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Below is what I did

1112
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
with my colleagues at UIUC.

1113
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It uses a higher mode

1114
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
to make

1115
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
a 10GHz filter.

1116
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Of course, it is a demo,

1117
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
so you can see that

1118
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
its passband is not as beautiful

1119
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
as the company's design.

1120
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Next,

1121
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I will quickly talk about

1122
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
two case studies.

1123
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
The first one

1124
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
is our goal

1125
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
to reduce

1126
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
the dependence of

1127
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
this rectifier

1128
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
on temperature.

1129
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Due to this temperature factor,

1130
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
it is mainly related to

1131
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
the material.

1132
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
In terms of Ln,

1133
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
its temperature

1134
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
factor is

1135
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
about 70 to 90 ppm

1136
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
per degree C.

1137
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
According to different

1138
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
cutting surfaces,

1139
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
in order to

1140
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
improve this performance

1141
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
to be enough

1142
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
for the filter

1143
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
or rectifier to be used,

1144
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
we would like to

1145
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
reduce its TCF

1146
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
from 60 to 70 ppm

1147
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
to 20 ppm or less.

1148
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
In order to convince

1149
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
others that

1150
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
it is a candidate

1151
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
for the future

1152
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
wireless communication hardware.

1153
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Therefore,

1154
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
we do a simplified analysis

1155
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
of its TCF source.

1156
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
TCF actually

1157
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
refers to

1158
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
the frequency,

1159
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
the normalized frequency

1160
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
of temperature.

1161
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Therefore,

1162
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
in terms of mathematical form,

1163
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
it is partial f, partial t

1164
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
divided by its TCF frequency.

1165
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
After calculation,

1166
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
we can divide it into

1167
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
three elements.

1168
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Since the frequency

1169
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
is related to

1170
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
the frequency of my wave

1171
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
and the wave

1172
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
is related to the

1173
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
speed of my material

1174
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
and its density,

1175
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
the first element is

1176
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
the frequency of my wave

1177
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
with the change of temperature.

1178
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
The second element is

1179
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
the frequency of my material

1180
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
with the change of temperature.

1181
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The third element is

1182
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
the frequency of my material

1183
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
with the change of temperature.

1184
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
In addition to these three elements,

1185
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
there is another element

1186
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
that is related to

1187
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
the characteristics of

1188
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
the pressure current.

1189
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Therefore,

1190
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
we need to understand

1191
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
the characteristics of

1192
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
its material first.

1193
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Traditionally,

1194
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
the method of temperature compensation

1195
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
has been

1196
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
in modern technology

1197
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
for a long time.

1198
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
There is no better way

1199
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
than this,

1200
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
which is to select

1201
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
a material with

1202
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
a perfect ratio.

1203
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
For example,

1204
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
the temperature factor of lithium niobate

1205
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
is about negative 70 ppm per kelvin.

1206
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
However, silicon oxide,

1207
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
a very common material,

1208
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
has a positive temperature factor

1209
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
of about 90 ppm per kelvin.

1210
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Therefore,

1211
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
if we can

1212
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
perfectly

1213
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
mix these two materials

1214
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
with a perfect ratio,

1215
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
for example,

1216
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
silicon oxide,

1217
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
we can theoretically

1218
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
reduce Tcf to zero.

1219
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
However,

1220
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
in the process of

1221
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
such a production,

1222
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
we will find

1223
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that if we ignore

1224
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
the wave

1225
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and its electric field

1226
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
distribution

1227
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and its

1228
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
motion distribution,

1229
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
it is actually

1230
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
unpredictable.

1231
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Secondly,

1232
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
when the film becomes very thin,

1233
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
the metal electrode

1234
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
on the top

1235
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
will also have a certain degree of impact.

1236
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
In particular,

1237
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
the Tcf of the metal electrode

1238
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
is generally quite large.

1239
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Therefore,

1240
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
when we want to

1241
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
target some thin components

1242
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
with high electromagnetic cohesiveness,

1243
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
we must not ignore

1244
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
the Tcf of the metal electrode.

1245
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
As early as 1985,

1246
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Professor Kenya Hashimoto

1247
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
discussed

1248
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
some deep-wave

1249
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
temperature coefficients of delay

1250
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
on different surfaces.

1251
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
For example,

1252
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
a special op-amp material

1253
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
has a free surface

1254
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
with a metal electrode on the surface,

1255
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
but there is no power.

1256
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It is an open-strip.

1257
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
The metal electrode on the surface

1258
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
is short-circuited

1259
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
and becomes short-strip,

1260
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
or the whole surface is covered

1261
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
with metal and grounded.

1262
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Every situation

1263
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
will show that

1264
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
their Tcf is different.

1265
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
In particular,

1266
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
in the two cases,

1267
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
open-strip and short-strip,

1268
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
the mechanical structure

1269
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
of these two cases

1270
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
has not changed.

1271
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
The difference is

1272
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
whether the Tcf of the metal electrode

1273
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
is grounded or not.

1274
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It will also have a great impact

1275
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
on the Tcf of the metal electrode.

1276
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
In conclusion,

1277
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
when we deal with

1278
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
a material with

1279
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
high Tcf,

1280
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
we cannot ignore

1281
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
the Tcf of the metal electrode.

1282
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
To solve this problem,

1283
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
we use

1284
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
the so-called

1285
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
multi-section model.

1286
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Since

1287
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
our goal is

1288
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
relatively simple,

1289
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
it is a deep wave

1290
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
that only circulates in one dimensional space.

1291
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Therefore,

1292
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
we do not need to develop

1293
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
too complicated 3D analysis.

1294
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
We hope to

1295
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
transform

1296
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
such a complex structure

1297
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
with Tcf and metal

1298
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
into a

1299
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
multi-section model

1300
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
with Tcf

1301
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
and Tcf

1302
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
in different areas

1303
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
with different Tcf

1304
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
and Tcf

1305
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
in different areas

1306
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
with different Tcf

1307
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and Tcf

1308
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and Tcf

1309
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and Tcf

1310
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
and Tcf

1311
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and Tcf

1312
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and Tcf

1313
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and Tcf

1314
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and Tcf

1315
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
and Tcf

1316
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
We also found that

1317
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
in the case of

1318
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
하대기

1319
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
different areas

1320
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
require different models.

1321
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
For example,

1322
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
we divide the graph into three zones.

1323
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The first zone

1324
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
is the free surface

1325
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and the surface is open circuit.

1326
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
That is, the surface has no electric field.

1327
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
The second zone

1328
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
is the metal electrode

1329
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
on the surface

1330
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and it gives a fixed voltage.

1331
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
It may be

1332
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
a small signal

1333
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
that is dc ground.

1334
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Its condition will become

1335
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
a metallized surface

1336
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
and a short circuit

1337
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
boundary condition.

1338
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
The third zone is more complicated

1339
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
because it is between two electrodes

1340
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and it will

1341
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
have a horizontal electric field

1342
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
between the two electrodes.

1343
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So we guess

1344
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
when the metallization ratio

1345
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
is very high,

1346
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
we should think

1347
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
that the surface

1348
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
has no electric field

1349
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and it is a free surface

1350
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
with a short circuit boundary.

1351
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
When the metal

1352
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
is very small

1353
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
and the two electrodes are

1354
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
very far away,

1355
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
maybe we should use

1356
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
the open circuit boundary

1357
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
to describe it.

1358
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Based on this idea,

1359
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
we also use

1360
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
the method of

1361
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
finite element

1362
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
to simulate

1363
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
a thin film of

1364
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
lithium niobate

1365
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
to observe the temperature change

1366
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
and we can see

1367
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
that its result

1368
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
is quite similar

1369
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
to what we just guessed.

1370
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
When the wavelength

1371
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
is very long,

1372
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
it should be said

1373
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
that it will

1374
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
use the gap

1375
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
as a boundary

1376
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
of 2λ.

1377
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
When the wavelength

1378
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
is less than 2λ,

1379
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
we generally

1380
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
regard it as a short circuit

1381
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and if it is larger,

1382
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
we regard it as

1383
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
an open circuit boundary.

1384
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Based on this hypothesis,

1385
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
we can simulate

1386
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
the temperature coefficient

1387
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
under three different cases

1388
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
and then

1389
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
combine it

1390
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
with the mathematical formula

1391
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
we just introduced.

1392
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Theoretically,

1393
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
we can predict

1394
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
the temperature coefficient

1395
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
of the uniformly distributed

1396
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
resistors.

1397
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
In order to

1398
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
do the experimental verification,

1399
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
we made

1400
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
two different resistors.

1401
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
The first one

1402
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
has a mechanical electrode

1403
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
and a capacitor.

1404
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It can stimulate

1405
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
the magnetic field of the resistors.

1406
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
The second one

1407
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
has a capacitor and a capacitor

1408
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
to stimulate the magnetic field

1409
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
of the capacitors.

1410
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I have an idea.

1411
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Sorry.

1412
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Will it be published?

1413
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Well,

1414
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
you give it

1415
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
a DC bias,

1416
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
VIN,

1417
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
and GND.

1418
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Then you use the

1419
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
SIO2 to

1420
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
hold the material

1421
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
you want.

1422
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
If you give it

1423
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
a DC current,

1424
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
it will push

1425
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
each other away.

1426
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
If you give it

1427
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
a DC current,

1428
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
it will push

1429
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
each other away.

1430
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
If you give it

1431
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
a DC current,

1432
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
it will push

1433
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
each other away.

1434
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Then you can use

1435
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
the electrodes to

1436
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
hold the substrate.

1437
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
You can use

1438
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
the DC current

1439
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
to resist

1440
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
the temperature coefficient.

1441
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Is it feasible?

1442
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Let me think about it.

1443
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
The DC current

1444
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
is from the VIN, right?

1445
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Yes.

1446
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I didn't say that.

1447
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I made a mistake.

1448
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
The two pictures

1449
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
are the experimental

1450
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
components.

1451
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
The picture on the left

1452
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
has three electrodes.

1453
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Because it has

1454
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
a capacitive electrode,

1455
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
it is suitable to

1456
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
stimulate the osmosis.

1457
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
The picture on the right

1458
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
has two electrodes,

1459
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
but it is arranged

1460
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
as an array.

1461
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
The array

1462
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
doesn't affect

1463
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
the temperature coefficient.

1464
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
We use the array

1465
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
to connect

1466
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
all the electrodes

1467
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
to enhance the output signal

1468
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
for easy observation.

1469
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Then we can

1470
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
process the components.

1471
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
First of all,

1472
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
we take a lithium-niobate wafer

1473
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and

1474
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
use a low-temperature

1475
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
layer of

1476
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
oxidized gas

1477
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
on the surface.

1478
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
We use the exposure

1479
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
to define the

1480
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
assembly shape of the components.

1481
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Then we use

1482
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
a dry-etching method

1483
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
to remove

1484
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
lithium-niobate and

1485
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
silicon oxide at the same time.

1486
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
The dry-etching

1487
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
mainly uses

1488
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
some gas from the filter,

1489
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
which has a stronger

1490
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
activity relationship

1491
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
to successfully remove

1492
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
these two materials.

1493
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
After the assembly

1494
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
of the components is completed,

1495
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
another exposure

1496
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
is used

1497
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
to apply

1498
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
the metal electrode

1499
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
using the lift-off method.

1500
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Finally, we use the

1501
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
XF2 gas

1502
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
to remove

1503
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
the silicon oxide

1504
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
at the bottom

1505
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
to make the components.

1506
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
As you can see,

1507
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
there are two cuts

1508
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
around the components.

1509
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
These two lines

1510
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
not only define

1511
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
the area around the components

1512
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
with darker brown color,

1513
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
but also the area

1514
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
where the silicon oxide

1515
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
is removed.

1516
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
In the experiment,

1517
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
we measured

1518
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
two different

1519
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
electrode components.

1520
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
First of all,

1521
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
two electrode devices

1522
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
will trigger

1523
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
1,3,5,7,9 and so on.

1524
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Due to the high-strength

1525
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
silicon oxide,

1526
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
it also produces

1527
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
a lot of free smoke,

1528
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
so we don't

1529
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
specifically discuss

1530
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
those electrodes.

1531
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
We only discuss

1532
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
the first three

1533
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
electrodes of each design.

1534
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
For this device,

1535
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
its Q is 450,

1536
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
KT2 is 5.5

1537
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
for free smoke,

1538
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
and TCF can also

1539
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
be used.

1540
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Its displacement

1541
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and shear stress

1542
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
are different,

1543
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
but its electrode

1544
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
won't change with the mode.

1545
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So,

1546
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
these different modes

1547
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
also have different

1548
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
temperature factors.

1549
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
We can also observe

1550
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
similar phenomena

1551
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
from these three electrode devices.

1552
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
We trigger the so-called

1553
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Q, which is around

1554
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
1,000 or 3,000,

1555
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
KT2 is around 12%

1556
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
for free smoke,

1557
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
and its three

1558
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
temperature factors are also different.

1559
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
According to the previous theory,

1560
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
we can calculate

1561
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
its

1562
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
theoretical temperature factor

1563
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and compare it with the experiment.

1564
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
What we can see

1565
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
is that

1566
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
the simulation of model

1567
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
and finite element are quite similar.

1568
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Their error is less than 1%,

1569
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
but compared with the measurement,

1570
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
the error is around

1571
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
3%.

1572
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Although

1573
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
the expected result

1574
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
is slightly worse than

1575
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
the expected result,

1576
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I think

1577
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
its accuracy

1578
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
can be used

1579
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
to design more detailed components.

1580
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Or,

1581
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
we don't need to rely on

1582
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
finite element before

1583
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
actually making the components.

1584
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
We can directly calculate

1585
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
the value of our temperature factor

1586
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
to assist designers

1587
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
in the design of

1588
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
compressors and filters.

1589
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
This is the conclusion.

1590
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
We use some methods

1591
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
to calculate its temperature factor,

1592
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and

1593
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
its error is quite small

1594
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
compared with the previous theory.

1595
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
The second case is

1596
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
the research I did

1597
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
after I came back to Taiwan.

1598
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The main reason is that

1599
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
we encountered

1600
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
a big problem

1601
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
in the production of components.

1602
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It was found in the

1603
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Lillian Nile Basin Fin Action.

1604
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
The RF power required

1605
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
for this action

1606
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
is quite large,

1607
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
about 800-900W.

1608
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Generally speaking,

1609
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
there is not much RF power

1610
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
in the Lillian Nile Basin Fin Action,

1611
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
because the RF power

1612
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
is quite old.

1613
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So,

1614
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
before we start

1615
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
the research on

1616
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
RF components,

1617
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
we need to

1618
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
pull back our research

1619
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
to see the effect.

1620
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
At the same time,

1621
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
we hope to solve

1622
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
the problem of

1623
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
thermal conductivity.

1624
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
The thermal conductivity problem

1625
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
of LN-SINFIN device

1626
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
mainly comes from two reasons.

1627
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
The first one is

1628
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
the high temperature factor,

1629
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
and the second one is

1630
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
the poor thermal conductivity.

1631
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So, when you drive

1632
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
with high power,

1633
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
you will find that

1634
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
the frequency starts to decrease

1635
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
near the rectifier.

1636
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
So, when the temperature

1637
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
changes,

1638
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
the frequency starts to change.

1639
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Therefore,

1640
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
if there is no good thermal conductivity,

1641
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
the frequency will

1642
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
decrease

1643
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
as you drive

1644
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
with higher power.

1645
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So, there will be

1646
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
a non-thermal phenomenon.

1647
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
If there is a non-thermal phenomenon

1648
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
in the rectifier,

1649
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
it means that

1650
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
there will be a non-thermal phenomenon

1651
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
in the rectifier itself,

1652
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
which may cause

1653
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
a distortion

1654
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
when the signal is transmitted,

1655
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
or even increase

1656
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
the error rate

1657
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
of the code, etc.

1658
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So, in order to

1659
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
solve this problem,

1660
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
there is a group of

1661
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
ideas that

1662
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
we can come back

1663
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and use the concept of SOHL

1664
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
to bind the LN synth

1665
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
to a substrate

1666
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
with a block reflector.

1667
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
We can use

1668
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
these reflectors

1669
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
to virtually

1670
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
create a floating resonator

1671
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
that can

1672
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
reproduce the

1673
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
sound wave reflection

1674
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
characteristics.

1675
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
In fact, it is directly

1676
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
bound to the board.

1677
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
If it is directly

1678
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
bound to the board,

1679
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
it can actually

1680
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
enhance the efficiency of

1681
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
heat transfer,

1682
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
so that it can theoretically

1683
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
solve the problem of

1684
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
temperature non-thermal.

1685
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
In fact, this idea

1686
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
already had a series of

1687
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
patents in 2004 and 2009,

1688
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
but it has not been

1689
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
developed well.

1690
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Mainly because

1691
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
there was not enough technology

1692
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
to produce LN synths.

1693
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
However, it has become possible

1694
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
in recent years,

1695
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
so this also forms

1696
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
a new research direction.

1697
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
In particular,

1698
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
there are two professors

1699
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
from the University of

1700
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Tokyo, Japan,

1701
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Michio Katota and

1702
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Shuji Tanaka.

1703
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
They use

1704
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
the structure of

1705
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
LN synths.

1706
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
They successfully demonstrated

1707
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
that even if it is a

1708
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
SO type resonator,

1709
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
my coupling can also be

1710
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
greater than 40% and

1711
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
operate at high frequency.

1712
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
It is like the

1713
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
newly introduced

1714
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
release synth

1715
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
resonator.

1716
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I don't release it,

1717
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
but I bound it to

1718
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
the sound wave reflection layer

1719
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
with a very strong boundary.

1720
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It can be seen as a

1721
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
release component.

1722
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The same design concept

1723
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
was also adopted by the company.

1724
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Murata called it

1725
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
IHP-SOL,

1726
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Incredible High Performance-SOL.

1727
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Through some

1728
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
designs,

1729
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
its coupling

1730
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
can be maintained at

1731
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
about 9%.

1732
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Mainly, the company uses

1733
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
a relatively low coupling,

1734
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
but its Q can be greater than 3000.

1735
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Murata's idea is

1736
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
that they don't want to

1737
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
use so many layers of reflectors.

1738
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
For example, it needs

1739
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
two materials,

1740
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
silicon oxide and

1741
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
aluminum nitrate,

1742
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
to stack five or six layers

1743
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
to make this reflector.

1744
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
From the perspective of the company,

1745
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
this design method is not economical,

1746
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
so they hope to use

1747
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
a single silicon oxide layer

1748
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
as the simplest

1749
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
reflector.

1750
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
In fact,

1751
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
they have observed

1752
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
a pretty good effect,

1753
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
because it raises the Q

1754
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
to more than 3000.

1755
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Based on this idea,

1756
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
at least

1757
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
at this stage

1758
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
of my investment,

1759
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
no one has discussed

1760
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Synthene Lithium Niobate

1761
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
on silicon oxide

1762
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
on silicon.

1763
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So,

1764
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
we raise the Q

1765
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
to this level.

1766
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
The wafers we use

1767
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
are silicon

1768
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
500μm,

1769
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
silicon oxide 2μm,

1770
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and the transfer Ln

1771
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
is 0.7μm.

1772
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
We hope

1773
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
to use the so-called

1774
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
shear horizontal sole.

1775
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Its wave motion

1776
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
is like the picture on the right.

1777
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It is a cut wave on the surface,

1778
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
so its motion

1779
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
will decrease rapidly

1780
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
in the substrate.

1781
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So, we think it has a chance

1782
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
to become a high-Q,

1783
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
high-coupling model.

1784
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
By inserting a layer of

1785
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
oxide between

1786
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Synthene Ln and silicon substrate,

1787
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
it should be able to effectively

1788
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
reduce the leakage

1789
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
to the substrate.

1790
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
For this structure,

1791
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
we study

1792
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
its propagation direction.

1793
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
We use the Final Element

1794
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
to simulate

1795
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
its wave distribution

1796
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
at different thickness

1797
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
of lithium niobate

1798
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
when it is

1799
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
propagated on the

1800
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
two-dimensional plane.

1801
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
By

1802
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
setting the surface

1803
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
of the crystal

1804
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
as open

1805
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
or short-circuit condition,

1806
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
based on the

1807
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
so-called

1808
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
outerless approach,

1809
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
we can calculate

1810
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
the size of

1811
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
its base

1812
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
lithium niobate.

1813
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So,

1814
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
we can see that

1815
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
the SH sole

1816
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
has a very large

1817
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
difference in coupling.

1818
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
In order to get the highest coupling,

1819
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
the propagation direction

1820
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
will be selected

1821
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
at the angle of

1822
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
10 degrees

1823
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
backward on the y-axis.

1824
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
By combining

1825
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
the simulation results

1826
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
at different thicknesses

1827
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
of lithium niobate,

1828
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
we can also find that

1829
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
its lithium niobate

1830
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
is also a

1831
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
design parameter that

1832
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
we can control.

1833
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
After understanding the

1834
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
propagation direction,

1835
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
we start to study

1836
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
its dispersion behavior.

1837
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It can be seen that

1838
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
when there is no electric shock

1839
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
on the surface,

1840
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
such as the previous situation,

1841
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
when the thickness of lithium niobate

1842
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
is greater than 0.15,

1843
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
the coupling will

1844
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
decrease.

1845
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
This situation is

1846
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
quite similar to

1847
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
the plate wave of SH0.

1848
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
That is to say,

1849
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
the dotted line above

1850
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
and the purple dotted line

1851
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
below

1852
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
have a similar

1853
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
coupling reduction mode.

1854
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
However,

1855
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
we also find that

1856
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
when we apply some electric shock

1857
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
on the surface,

1858
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
especially the heavier metal,

1859
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
the higher the rate of increase.

1860
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Similarly,

1861
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
through simulation observations,

1862
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
we find that

1863
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
when the metal on the surface

1864
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
is heavier,

1865
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
it can actually help

1866
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
the horizontal wave

1867
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
to concentrate

1868
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
the strain energy

1869
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
on the surface.

1870
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Since most of the strain energy

1871
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
is concentrated in the opaque layer,

1872
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
it has a chance

1873
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
to get a higher coupling.

1874
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
That is to say,

1875
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
when the thickness

1876
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
of the metal electrode

1877
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
is limited,

1878
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
we should use

1879
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
the heavier metal

1880
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
to design

1881
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
to get a higher coupling.

1882
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
For example,

1883
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
this is a comparison

1884
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
between gold and aluminum.

1885
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
It can be seen that

1886
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
when the thickness of gold

1887
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
is 0.025 lambda,

1888
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
it can actually

1889
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
increase the coupling to 40%.

1890
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
However,

1891
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
aluminum, which is a lighter material,

1892
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
needs a thicker electrode

1893
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
to achieve a similar effect.

1894
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The last part

1895
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
is to discuss

1896
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
the impact of different modes.

1897
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Since

1898
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
we want to use SH

1899
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
as a target,

1900
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
we compare SH

1901
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
and Longitudinal Leaky Soul

1902
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
to see

1903
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
what is the difference

1904
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
between the two modes.

1905
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Through analysis,

1906
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
it can be found that

1907
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
SH Soul is more likely

1908
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
to be affected

1909
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
by the two-layer structure

1910
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
of lithium niobate and silicon arsenide.

1911
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
However, Leaky Soul

1912
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
has a larger position

1913
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
than SH Soul,

1914
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
which means that

1915
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
its wave is more likely

1916
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
to be lost by substrate transmission.

1917
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Therefore,

1918
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
it can be seen that

1919
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
the impedance ratio

1920
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
of Leaky Soul

1921
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
is about 20-30 dB higher

1922
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
than that of SH Soul.

1923
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Therefore,

1924
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
it is not a good choice.

1925
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Finally,

1926
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
in order to verify

1927
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
the effect of SH Soul,

1928
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
we use the

1929
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
OnePort single-layer

1930
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
SH Soul resonator

1931
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
with traditional IDT electrode

1932
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
and grating reflector.

1933
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
However,

1934
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
unlike the traditional one,

1935
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
we use a

1936
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Synthene-Lithium Niobate

1937
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
on silicon arsenide

1938
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
on silicon

1939
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
as a reference point.

1940
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
This is the

1941
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
one-port single-layer

1942
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
SH Soul resonator.

1943
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
In addition,

1944
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
SH Soul has a

1945
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
smaller position

1946
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
than SH Soul,

1947
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
which means

1948
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
that

1949
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
its wave

1950
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
leakage is

1951
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
relatively small.

1952
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Therefore,

1953
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
its wave

1954
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
leakage is

1955
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
relatively small.

1956
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
The picture in the lower right corner

1957
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
is the actual

1958
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
picture of the component.

1959
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
In this picture,

1960
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
its wave length is 8 microns.

1961
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Finally,

1962
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
this is the result of the experiment.

1963
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
We selected

1964
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
3 different components,

1965
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Lambda,

1966
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
8, 6, and 4 microns

1967
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
to compare.

1968
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It can be seen that

1969
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
the difference in Q

1970
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
is relatively large.

1971
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Here we use

1972
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
the definition of body Q,

1973
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
which is to use its group delay

1974
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
and its S11

1975
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
to calculate its Q value.

1976
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Its definition of Q is

1977
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
similar to the traditional one,

1978
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
but through a new formula,

1979
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
which is the formula of body Q,

1980
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
it can equalize

1981
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
every Q value

1982
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
on this resonance scale,

1983
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
and it can be seen that

1984
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
the highest Q value

1985
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
of the resonator

1986
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
we designed

1987
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
is about 960,

1988
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and the carbon

1989
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
is about 25.5%.

1990
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Therefore,

1991
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
FOM is about 245.

1992
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Compared with the traditional

1993
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
F-bar resonator,

1994
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
its performance indicator

1995
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
is between 100 and 200.

1996
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Therefore,

1997
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
more than 200

1998
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
indicates that

1999
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
the component we designed

2000
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
has a certain performance.

2001
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
At least,

2002
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
it may outperform

2003
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
some low-performance

2004
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
F-bar components.

2005
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
We also

2006
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
measured

2007
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
the power handling

2008
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
of this resonator.

2009
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It can be seen

2010
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
that

2011
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
compared with

2012
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
the previously released

2013
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
SYNFIN

2014
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
lithium-ion battery components,

2015
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
this SO-TYPE

2016
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
resonator

2017
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
does not have

2018
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
any significant

2019
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
fluctuation

2020
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
after 10 dBm RF power.

2021
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Therefore,

2022
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
it can be further verified

2023
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
that when I use

2024
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
SO-TYPE components,

2025
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
it can dissipate heat

2026
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
through the base plate,

2027
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
which can greatly improve

2028
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
the power handling problem.

2029
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
At the same time,

2030
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
we also used the combination

2031
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
of different thicknesses

2032
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
of L-N and C-NR

2033
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
to get a higher

2034
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
capacitance coefficient

2035
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
of more than 36%,

2036
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
but its Q is reduced

2037
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
to about 250.

2038
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
This is a prediction

2039
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
from the metal we used.

2040
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Due to the

2041
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
absorption of

2042
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
the acoustic of the metal,

2043
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
it is actually much

2044
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
stronger than aluminum.

2045
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
In other words,

2046
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
the loss of the metal

2047
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
is much greater than that

2048
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
of aluminum,

2049
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
which is about 4-5 times higher.

2050
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Therefore, we estimate

2051
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
that the Q of the components

2052
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
is the effect of the metal electrode.

2053
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
However, this still needs further verification.

2054
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Through such a high-coupling

2055
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
resonator,

2056
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
its coupling is about 38%-35%,

2057
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
we can use

2058
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
such a resonator

2059
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
to synthesize the filter.

2060
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
We used five

2061
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
resonators to synthesize

2062
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
the filter,

2063
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
and in the software,

2064
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
we made it

2065
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
sound

2066
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and input

2067
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and output matching.

2068
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
We can find that

2069
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
we can potentially

2070
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
increase the frequency to 29%,

2071
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and the insertion loss is less than

2072
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
the standard 3dB.

2073
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
This also verifies that

2074
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
the higher the coupling of

2075
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
my resonator,

2076
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
we will have the opportunity to

2077
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
make a wider filter to meet

2078
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
the growing needs of

2079
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
5G communication.

2080
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So this is my

2081
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
second part of the conclusion.

2082
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
We used

2083
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Synthene Lithium Niobate

2084
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
on Substrate to

2085
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
make the SOHL components.

2086
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
We can increase the coupling

2087
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
to more than 20% or 30%,

2088
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and the Q can be nearly 1000.

2089
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And we also

2090
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
verified that

2091
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
using these high-coupling devices,

2092
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
we have the opportunity to get

2093
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
a very large filter

2094
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and the insertion loss

2095
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
can also meet the needs of

2096
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
communication.

2097
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
The loss will be less than 3dB.

2098
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
In the future,

2099
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
we hope to

2100
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
improve our

2101
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
manufacturing capacity

2102
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
and make the frequency

2103
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
higher.

2104
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
In addition to

2105
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
our manufacturing capacity,

2106
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
we will also need

2107
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
to find

2108
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
more interesting models

2109
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
to support our research.

2110
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Finally,

2111
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
of course,

2112
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
there is a projection.

2113
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Lithium Niobate

2114
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
is a very strong

2115
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
supply material.

2116
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It also has a very interesting

2117
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
optical feature,

2118
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
but I don't understand this part.

2119
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Now there are also several more

2120
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
well-known groups

2121
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
to invest and research

2122
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
acoustic optical devices.

2123
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
For example, Stanford

2124
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
and Harvard have

2125
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
some teams

2126
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
to discuss this.

2127
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Finally, I would like to

2128
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
thank my founding

2129
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
research, my students,

2130
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
and my ex-bosses.

2131
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
My report ends here.

2132
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Thank you.

2133
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
OK, thank you Ming-Huang for

2134
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
bringing us such a wonderful speech.

2135
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Let me see

2136
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
if anyone has any questions.

2137
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
If you do,

2138
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
please turn on your microphone

2139
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
or leave your question

2140
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
in the chat dialog.

2141
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I can help you ask Ming-Huang.

2142
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I want to ask

2143
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
a question.

2144
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Can you hear me?

2145
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yes.

2146
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Hello, my name is Shreff.

2147
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I am a PhD student

2148
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
at Taitung University.

2149
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I have read

2150
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
several of your papers.

2151
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Previously,

2152
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Rob Candler

2153
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
from UCLA

2154
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
came to visit.

2155
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I worked with him

2156
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
at that time.

2157
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
However,

2158
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I was doing

2159
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
fieldwork.

2160
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
The papers you wrote

2161
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
were about piezoelectric radiation.

2162
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Now,

2163
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I am also working on this.

2164
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I am glad

2165
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
to hear

2166
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
your speech today.

2167
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
It is rare

2168
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
to find such advanced research in China.

2169
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
For example,

2170
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
there should be

2171
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
no manufacturers

2172
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
in Taiwan.

2173
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Yes.

2174
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I don't know

2175
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
if there are any

2176
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
in Taiwan,

2177
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
but there should be none.

2178
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I have read

2179
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
your papers.

2180
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
For example,

2181
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
piezoelectric radiation

2182
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
is done by UCLA

2183
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
and Northeastern.

2184
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Piezoelectric radiation

2185
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
is done by piezoelectric

2186
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and magnetic materials.

2187
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It is a big topic.

2188
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I want to know

2189
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
the difference between

2190
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
piezoelectric radiation

2191
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and magnetic materials.

2192
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I think

2193
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
there are many

2194
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
deep

2195
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
physical phenomena

2196
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
to discuss.

2197
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
When we were

2198
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
implementing the AMIBA project,

2199
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
our main competition

2200
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
was a Stanford group.

2201
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Their papers were published

2202
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
earlier than ours

2203
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
in Nature Communication.

2204
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
You can read it.

2205
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
They used a stick-shaped lithium-ion battery.

2206
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
It should be

2207
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
8 or 10 cm long.

2208
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
It was a

2209
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
metal stick.

2210
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
They used

2211
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
some suspension

2212
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
to float it in the air

2213
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and make it vibrate

2214
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
to radiate electromagnetic waves.

2215
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
There were

2216
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
several difficulties

2217
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
that they didn't overcome.

2218
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
First,

2219
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
the surface of the battery

2220
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
was exposed

2221
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
to electromagnetic radiation

2222
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
near the electrode.

2223
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It means

2224
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
the battery

2225
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
lost a lot of energy.

2226
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Second,

2227
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
its Q was too high.

2228
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I think it was

2229
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
between 100,000 and 1 million.

2230
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
It ran down very slowly.

2231
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
It seemed

2232
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
that such a system

2233
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
was not suitable

2234
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
for communication.

2235
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
It took a long time

2236
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
to go from 1 to 0.

2237
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So they could only

2238
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
use frequency modulation.

2239
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Frequency modulation

2240
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
may also be affected

2241
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
by its high Q.

2242
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
If you are interested,

2243
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I think you can read

2244
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
their papers.

2245
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
We decided to use

2246
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
PZT later.

2247
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We found a PZT manufacturer

2248
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
that could provide

2249
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
high-quality buck PZT.

2250
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Its Q was over 1,000.

2251
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
It was very rare.

2252
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
We used PZT.

2253
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But PZT had its own problem.

2254
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Its dielectric constant was too high.

2255
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
So it

2256
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
had almost no so-called

2257
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
field-to-field effect.

2258
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It went from the moment

2259
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
it left Resonator

2260
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
to its original state.

2261
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
But I think

2262
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
PZT was not suitable

2263
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
for communication.

2264
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Especially for measuring.

2265
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
We measured it for a month or two.

2266
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
But we found

2267
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
that it was wrong.

2268
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Actually,

2269
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I used

2270
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Urban Nitride.

2271
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But I asked

2272
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
UCL to make it.

2273
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
They measured

2274
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
the resistance

2275
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
of the resistor.

2276
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
So we couldn't measure anything.

2277
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
PZT is made of

2278
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
resin material.

2279
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
So it's not that easy.

2280
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Yes.

2281
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I saw

2282
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
they made

2283
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
some other

2284
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
alloy materials.

2285
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Not PZT.

2286
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Yes.

2287
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
In this field,

2288
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
you know

2289
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
they made

2290
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
PZT.

2291
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
They have a

2292
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
very strong

2293
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
material team in

2294
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Northeast University.

2295
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Otherwise,

2296
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
they are not

2297
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
specialized in materials.

2298
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
So I think

2299
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
it's not that easy.

2300
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Another question

2301
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
about architecture.

2302
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I don't have the answer yet.

2303
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
For example,

2304
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
they call it

2305
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
mechanical antenna.

2306
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Mechanical antenna.

2307
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
You can find

2308
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
some articles

2309
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
about it.

2310
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
For example,

2311
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
about radiation efficiency

2312
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and size,

2313
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
we talked about

2314
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
due limit.

2315
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I read some articles

2316
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
that say

2317
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
mechanical antenna

2318
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
but I

2319
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
don't understand it.

2320
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I don't understand it.

2321
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Yes.

2322
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
When I was in the US,

2323
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
our boss

2324
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
told us about it.

2325
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
He thought it could

2326
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
go beyond the limit.

2327
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
He wanted us to write

2328
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
a theoretical paper.

2329
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
But later,

2330
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
he wanted to meet

2331
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
DAPA's schedule.

2332
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
So we just ignored it.

2333
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It doesn't seem

2334
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
to have any new results.

2335
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Yes.

2336
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I'm not sure

2337
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
whether it can

2338
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
go beyond the limit.

2339
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
But I think

2340
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
we can calculate it

2341
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
from a theoretical point of view.

2342
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It might be a great

2343
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
theoretical paper.

2344
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
But we thought

2345
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
we couldn't handle it.

2346
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
The last question

2347
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
is a small one.

2348
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I'm curious.

2349
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
For example,

2350
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
when you simulate

2351
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
the design of

2352
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
multi-modem

2353
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
or two-sided,

2354
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
if it's complicated,

2355
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
how do you

2356
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
analyze it?

2357
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Because you can't

2358
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
just recognize it.

2359
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
From simulation?

2360
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I'll start from

2361
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
a so-called

2362
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
periodic session.

2363
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I'll go back to the beginning.

2364
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
For example,

2365
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
with this IDT-type

2366
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
resonator,

2367
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
we mainly

2368
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
trigger some modes

2369
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
with a horizontal capacitor.

2370
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
These modes are

2371
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
non-linear.

2372
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
So we usually

2373
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
start with a

2374
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
periodic structure.

2375
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
The advantage of a periodic structure

2376
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
is that it won't be affected

2377
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
by the boundary.

2378
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Its modes are beautiful.

2379
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
For example,

2380
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
with this A1 resonator,

2381
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
the upper part

2382
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
contains an electrode

2383
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
and its boundary simulation.

2384
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
The lower part

2385
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
contains an electrode.

2386
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
So I don't have a boundary.

2387
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
You can clearly recognize

2388
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
that this is A1 mode.

2389
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
With this simulation,

2390
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
you can roughly

2391
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
grasp the position of

2392
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
resonance frequency

2393
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
and the shape of

2394
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
its mode.

2395
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Then you can do a complete simulation.

2396
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Then you can probably

2397
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
find out from the comparison

2398
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
of frequency.

2399
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Basically, they are the same.

2400
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Then you can easily

2401
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
find the corresponding mode.

2402
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
This is my own approach.

2403
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
If you do a complete

2404
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
device simulation,

2405
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
you may not

2406
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
think that

2407
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
this is the mode you want to design.

2408
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
When I was doing

2409
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
research,

2410
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I would simulate

2411
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
a Bach resonator.

2412
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Sometimes its mode

2413
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
is quite complicated.

2414
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
If I do a very simple simulation,

2415
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
it will be difficult to identify

2416
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
whether it is the mode I want to design.

2417
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
If you use eigenfrequency,

2418
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
it will be more complicated.

2419
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Because eigenfrequency lists

2420
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
all possible mechanical modes.

2421
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
So I would suggest that

2422
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
when you confirm your electrode configuration,

2423
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
you can do frequency sweeping.

2424
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
This is the so-called frequency

2425
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
response simulation.

2426
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Although many mechanical modes

2427
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
exist,

2428
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
they can't be triggered by your electrode.

2429
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
They can't be received by your electrode.

2430
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So many modes will disappear.

2431
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Only a few

2432
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
are enough

2433
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
to be received

2434
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
by these electrodes.

2435
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
In this way,

2436
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
you can reduce a large part of

2437
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
the work.

2438
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Thank you for your answer.

2439
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I am also working on

2440
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
this field now.

2441
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
It is a difficult topic.

2442
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I hope to have more opportunities

2443
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
to communicate in the future.

2444
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
If there is a chance,

2445
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
you can

2446
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
write an email to me

2447
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
or make an appointment

2448
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
to discuss.

2449
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Thank you.

2450
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Due to time constraints,

2451
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
today's speech ends here.

2452
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
You can turn on your microphone.

2453
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Let's applaud

2454
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Professor Ming-Huang's

2455
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
wonderful speech.

2456
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Professor Ming-Huang's background

2457
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
is well known.

2458
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
If you want to get his email,

2459
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
you can easily

2460
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
search on the Internet.

2461
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
If you have any other questions,

2462
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
you can write to

2463
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Professor Ming-Huang and ask him.

2464
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Let's applaud

2465
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Professor Ming-Huang's speech.

2466
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Thank you.
