Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tire Talk. I'm your host, Yen-Yong Zhang.
We're very honored to have Timothy here today. He's a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Chengda University.
Today's topic is Recent Progress in Surface Plasmon Polariton Nanolasers.
Before we start, let me introduce Tim.
First of all, I want to say that Tim's introduction is so cool and short.
But I want to say that he only wrote a few words. He wrote,
Proud Kaohsiunger 666.
This was sent to me a few days before the election.
So I have to go to his personal website to see his self-introduction.
Yes, I have it now. You can take a look.
Okay, I have the website.
Let me introduce him.
Tim's background is physics.
He majored in physics at Chengda University.
He got his Ph.D. at Chengda University.
In addition to physics, he is also passionate about investment, hiking, philosophy, and social movements.
I know you got your Ph.D. at Chengda University.
No, I got my Ph.D. at NCT.
Oh, NCT. I misread it. Sorry.
Okay, you got your Ph.D. at Chengda University.
Did you go to Michigan and Tel Aviv to do a postdoc program for a period of time before returning to Taiwan?
No, I went to Michigan with a visa from the Ministry of Science and Technology.
My boss, Denghui, recommended me to go to the University of Israel.
I went to the University of Israel and did a postdoc program for about a year.
And then you went back to Chengda University.
Yes, that's right.
Okay, so this is the bio of Yuxun from the proud Kaohsiunger666.
Okay, let's get started.
Okay, today, considering that everyone has different backgrounds,
I'm going to talk a little bit about what we do in the light study department.
Roughly speaking, it can be shown as shown in the picture.
We will create light.
Then we will find a way to transmit light, detect light, and control light.
This is what we do in the light study department.
Our department covers all aspects of basic physics, including ray optics, wave optics, electronics, and quantum mechanics.
In the light study department, as you can see, we have a very wide range of applications.
For example, you can see the screen on your phone or the LED light for lighting.
There is also a solar panel that is currently out of energy,
as well as the light you need to use when you go online.
Some parts of your iPhone are cut off with high-power laser.
A more advanced application is the part of the collective light path.
So light basically covers a lot of subjects and applications.
These are the parts that are usually easier to see.
I would like to emphasize a little further here.
The part of the light study field basically contributed 30% of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the past half century.
This data was obtained from the OSA, the light study department.
In other words, the part related to light won the 30% physics award.
You can see that light technology is a very important subject.
It is a very worthwhile project for everyone to invest in.
Personally, I focus my research on how to create light.
If you want to create light, you must know that energy and matter are basically inseparable.
The creation of energy must involve matter, and the stability of matter must also involve energy.
Here, I mainly focus on the interaction between light and matter, especially the polariton part.
Polariton is basically a mixture of light and exciton.
Based on such a large structure, my current research topic is microcavity polariton laser,
and surface plasmon polariton laser.
In order to produce these components, I did some basic research on some novel materials.
Back to the laser part, as I mentioned earlier, my research focuses on the interaction between light and matter.
I hope to be able to produce light, because light is the most basic part of light science.
If you can't produce light, you won't be able to control light, guide light, or detect light.
Here, I want to talk about what a laser is.
The abbreviation for laser is LASER.
Its full name is Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation.
The concept of light amplification radiation was first proposed by Einstein around 1918.
At that time, he proposed the interaction between light and matter, which can be roughly divided into three categories.
Laser absorption, laser emission, and self-emission.
Now, let me talk about what laser emission is.
You will often see some animation characters on TV.
They will start to emit gas, and then release gas, or release some big waves.
A more famous example is the gas bomb in Dragon Ball.
Or like the famous character in the movie, Huo Ying Ren Zhe.
The concept is similar to the concept of gathering Chakra.
If you are watching a movie or anime, you can understand.
Laser is a bit similar to this concept.
Its principle is basically to amplify your signal, your energy.
The process is like this.
First, you will have a passive electron.
It is in the high-energy state.
Then, it is affected by a photon.
So that it goes from high-energy to low-energy.
As it goes from high-energy state to low-energy state, it will emit the same light.
The same light as the input signal, including its position and wavelength.
Through this process, one chakra pushes two chakras.
Two chakras pushes four chakras.
In this way, it can achieve the amplification of energy.
If we can effectively use this passive radiation,
we can create the so-called laser component.
The laser component is very similar to what you have experienced.
Those who have played laser pen or laser know that
the more famous properties of laser are
it is monochromatic, it has directivity, and it has very good tonality.
If you use these features,
the laser can be used as a detector,
it can be used as a scanner,
it can be used as a DVD player,
it can be used for surgery.
OK.
Here, you may think,
why do I put a picture of Einstein?
First of all, when it comes to laser,
for people my age,
the first thing that comes to mind is the Death Star in Star Wars.
The Death Star is a very iconic thing.
In Star Wars, it only took 17 seconds to destroy an entire planet.
Then you will see that it starts to gather laser light,
then it gathers a little more, and then it destroys a planet.
So when it comes to Star Wars,
I have to mention Einstein.
You may think, why?
First of all, in a recent interview,
a reporter asked George Lucas,
where did the image of Master Yoda come from?
Lucas said, it actually came from Einstein.
Because he needed someone who looked crazy,
but also very powerful, to be the prototype of his image.
So Einstein is basically the prototype of Master Yoda.
Einstein also inspired the development of laser.
He was the first to propose laser beam magnification.
After 40 years of hard work,
Tons and Shallow, these two excellent scientists,
in the 1950s or so,
proposed a truly feasible model of laser components.
Of course, at that time, they didn't really make laser beam.
This concept was learned by someone in the lab next door.
Then in the 1960s,
they made the first laser.
So from the 1960s to 2020,
it happened to be the 60th anniversary of laser.
In the past 60 years,
at least 7 Nobel Prizes were awarded to laser technology.
Why do I say directly?
Broadly speaking,
Nobel Prizes related to laser technology are actually countless.
For example,
last year's Nobel Prize for Gravity Wave Experiment
was awarded to gravity wave detection.
Gravity wave detection also relies on laser technology.
Of course, it's not a Nobel Prize directly related to laser technology.
However, gravity wave detection must rely on laser.
Last year's Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to astronomy.
Astronomy also requires high-precision measurements using laser.
So it can be seen that
laser has a significant impact on the development of human science.
The last Nobel Prize for Laser Technology was awarded in 2018.
It was awarded to three very important scientists.
Yashijin, Mooroo, and Shukla.
They have made very original breakthroughs
in the application of small and large-power lasers.
Yashijin in particular,
has invented light-transmission technology.
Mooroo and Shukla
have used the method of bombardment
to compress the pulse of the laser to a very high energy density.
Today, we have all kinds of large-power lasers
that can be used in science and technology.
When it comes to large-power laser applications,
we think of destruction.
Not only can lasers be used to destroy,
but they can also be used for precise destruction.
This is an example I just gave.
In the metal phone case you are using now,
or some precision components,
we use laser to cut metal surfaces,
to cut surfaces of different materials,
to create micro-level, fine structures.
However, in addition to destruction,
lasers can also be used for creation.
If you look up at the sun in the sky,
although it should be night in North America,
but here we are in the morning,
and it's almost noon,
so if you look up at the sky,
you will see a bright red sun.
It's actually a fusion phenomenon.
We can use hundreds of lasers
to focus on the same small point
to create a fusion reaction.
So lasers can not only be used for destruction,
but they can also be used for creation.
On the other hand, when it comes to small-power lasers,
they are more peaceful.
They are mainly used for detection,
measurement, and transmission.
According to the self-driving technology
that you often see on TV,
there are about three or four detection technologies,
including ultrasonic, visual recognition,
light sensing, and...
Let me think about it.
It's about these three.
Among them, the so-called light sensor,
which is called LIDAR in English,
is mainly used by lasers
to accurately measure the surrounding environment.
Because lasers are very high-precision,
they have very good synchronization.
So when the laser beam hits the object,
it can very accurately detect
the distance between the object and the sensor
to avoid your self-driving car
hitting the objects around it.
If you are not familiar with self-driving cars
or if you are not familiar with LIDAR technology,
you can see the iPhone.
If you have an iPhone 10
or if you have an iPhone 10 or above,
you can see that there is a sensor bar on it.
In this sensor bar,
there is a part of it
that is filled with laser sensors.
Apple engineers have filled hundreds of vertical laser sensors
with LIDAR technology.
These lasers can project more than 30,000 light spots
every second
to detect the surface of your face
to identify whether you are a legitimate user of this phone.
So you might think that
we can already fill hundreds of lasers
in the size of a miliband.
Is it necessary to continue to reduce the number of lasers?
In fact, it is necessary.
Let me give you a brief description of our needs.
You can see the image in the upper right corner.
It is from Intel's Tech News Room.
Okay.
In the past few decades,
you must have heard in the news
that TSMC has broken through the 14-nm technology.
They built a 7-nm factory.
Next, a 5-nm factory.
Next, a 3-nm factory in the U.S.
Next, a 5-nm factory in the U.S.
Next, a 3-nm factory in the U.S.
The number of nanometers
refers to the width of the device.
The number of nanometers
refers to the width of the device.
You will find that the number
ranges from large to small.
We have been making these devices smaller.
When we make these devices smaller,
there is a serious problem.
First, let me jump off the topic of the speech
and talk to you about it.
You can imagine
if you have 100 lines
from Taipei to Kaohsiung.
In this case,
I can assure you that
there will be almost no traffic.
But when you reduce 100 lines
to 50 lines,
25 lines,
10 lines,
5 lines,
3 lines,
or even 1 line,
the same traffic will cause
a very serious problem.
Your car may collide with each other.
You may fall off the highway.
The traffic may never be resolved.
This is the problem we face
when using electronic components.
Electronic components rely on electronic transmission.
The interaction between electronic and electronic
has the effect of the torque.
This torque
is multiplied by the square of the distance.
In other words,
when your line width is getting narrower,
the interference between electronic and electronic
will become very strong.
This interference
will cause
80% of the signal
in the electronic component
to be lost
in interconnection.
This value is
about 2 picojoules
per bit per centimeter.
You may think that
picojoules are about 10 to the power of 12.
And it's per centimeter.
It feels okay.
But don't forget
that in our daily lives,
all kinds of applications
and all kinds of
online activities
are connected
to several megabytes at any time.
Even if you
want to watch
4K videos,
you may be connected
to terabytes of
information.
So,
under these conditions,
the world is
actually
wasting a lot of
energy on
electrical interconnection.
If you don't have much
knowledge about information flow,
you can think in another way.
The mobile chip
and computer chip
we are using now
have billions of components.
Okay?
Each component consumes 2 picojoules
per second.
In the long run,
it's a huge energy loss.
So, under these
background conditions,
people start to think about
using light transmission
instead of electronic transmission.
Okay?
Light will not
interfere with each other.
And you can put different
wavelengths of light
in the same optical channel.
So, if you use light
to transmit a signal,
it's about 10 picojoules
per centimeter.
If you use electricity
to transmit a signal,
it's about 1 to 2 orders
less,
which is about 100 times less.
Okay?
If we want to use light
to transmit a signal,
there must be a wavelength.
And this wavelength
must be the same
as the current
electronic component technology.
The so-called matching
is that its volume
should be about the same.
Okay?
If you want to use
a table-shaped laser
to replace our electronic
component transmission,
it's actually unrealistic
because it's a little bit of ink.
We ultimately hope
that we can make a component
that is completely different from
the electronic component
and can be perfectly integrated
into the existing technology.
Okay?
So you might want to
reduce the volume of the laser.
But there's a problem here.
And this problem
has been a problem
for engineers and scientists
for a while.
This problem is
the optical wavelength limit.
The optical wavelength limit
tells us that
if you want to limit a light,
the size of your component,
the dimension of your component
must be greater than
or equal to the wavelength of the light wave.
Actually, it's easy to imagine.
If you want to put an elephant
in your refrigerator today,
it's impossible because
your refrigerator is smaller
than the size of the elephant.
So you can't effectively
put an elephant in your refrigerator.
In the same way,
in the field of optics,
the wavelength limit is
a basic obstacle.
You can't
limit the light
to something
smaller than it.
So,
in order to overcome this obstacle,
scientists
began to think
about other ways
to make
laser.
They thought about other ways
to make nanoparticles.
OK.
First of all,
back to what I said at the beginning,
I mentioned that
laser is like
a machine.
If we look at some
elite novels or
elite movies,
those masters,
they sometimes need to
concentrate their energy
and then
send out their
air force.
OK.
So,
when you can't
effectively execute
your work,
you can accumulate
energy in another way.
What does it mean?
It's like you change from
a computer system or a
magic system to a chakra system.
In my opinion,
they are all energy systems.
Each energy system
has its own characteristics.
In our field,
we transform
the process of
magnification of
laser into another form,
which is called
surface electromagnetic field.
Today,
I don't want to practice
Chinese martial arts anymore.
I want to practice western magic.
I can also let
magic operate in my body.
And because magic
has a relatively small energy volume,
I can more effectively
accumulate energy in my body
to have a better output.
So, the concept is similar.
Engineers
and scientists
want to
replace a
smaller object
with a
smaller object,
which is called
surface electromagnetic field.
Surface electromagnetic field
is the electromagnetization
of the collective vibration
on the metal surface.
If it can
coalesce with light,
it can produce a new thing
called surface plasma polarity.
Surface plasma polarity
has some features,
such as its wavelength
is smaller than the wavelength
of light waves,
and it has a very fast
reaction speed.
It can also be controlled
by electromagnetic field.
So, when I go into
the more detailed part,
I will first mention
the magical part of
surface plasma.
If you have read this book,
it is called
Ligricus Cup.
It is a cup
of a king
in the 4th century
in Rome.
This cup has a
very special feature.
When you hit the light
from the inside of the cup
to the outside,
you will see red light.
When you hit the light
from the inside of the cup
to the outside,
you will see green light.
Scientists have been
confused about this problem
since the 1980s.
They do not know
what the principle of operation
of this thing is.
Later, they did
elemental analysis
and found that
most of this cup
is made of silicon oxide,
so that they can
react with the light
and produce surface plasma.
They can effectively
concentrate the energy
in a very small area
to absorb, diffuse
or magnify.
Let's go back to the Ligricus Cup.
Why does it have
this special feature?
The outside of the cup
is red,
but the inside is green.
This is because
the gold nanoparticles
will be absorbed
by the green light
of 520 nanometers.
The surface plasma will
absorb the energy.
When you hit the light
from the inside to the outside,
the green light is absorbed
and only the red light
is reflected.
Why is the outside
of the cup green?
When you hit the light from the inside
to the outside,
the green light
of 520 nanometers
will be absorbed
by the gold nanoparticles
in the cup.
The green light
will be absorbed
by the gold nanoparticles
in the cup.
The green light
will be absorbed
by the gold nanoparticles
in the cup.
This is because
the surface plasma
is very close to the gold nanoparticles.
When we see red,
we think it is ruby,
and green means
it is emerald.
But these two cups
neither have gold nanoparticles
nor sapphire nanoparticles.
They are just
metal particles
mixed with silicon oxide.
Let's talk about
the basic properties of metal.
Metal
due to its low electromagnetic
coating,
can not fill
the chamber effectively.
So, in a metal block,
the electrons can move freely
without any interference.
It will be in an inverted state.
So, for this type of block,
its capacitance
can be described
by a model called
Joule model.
This model
uses background capacitance
to subtract the surface plasma
resonance frequency
minus the resonance frequency
plus a damping term.
Surface plasma frequency
refers to
what kind of frequency
it will resonate with.
In the future,
when we play in the park,
we will often
swing a swing.
A swing has
a swing frequency.
When you sit on it,
you will find that
if you can swing
along the swing frequency,
you can swing
the swing high and far
very quickly.
In the same way,
every object
has its own resonance frequency.
The resonance frequency of metal
we call it
Joule frequency.
This Joule frequency
refers to
when a beam of light
comes in,
the electrons in the metal
will resonate
with the light.
When the resonance frequency
is consistent with the resonance frequency of metal,
it will have the greatest absorption.
In this case,
we call
this resonance frequency
as
Joule frequency.
Joule frequency is
proportional to the
root of the electron number.
This N is the electron number.
Q is the electron number.
Me is the electron quality.
Epsilon zero is the background
charge.
Normally,
the electron density
of metal is
10 to the power of 25 to the power of 26
cubic meters.
This is the electron density of metal.
In the physics of quantum mechanics,
we know that
light
is composed of frequency
and wavelength.
Light is composed of frequency
and wavelength.
Once you know the resonance frequency,
you can push
the wavelength
in the opposite direction.
Once again,
Omega P is the
resonance frequency of electron.
Once you know the resonance frequency of electron,
you will know the wavelength of electron.
This wavelength
is about
10 to 100 nanometer.
It is smaller than
the wavelength of visible light.
When we add a piece of metal
and connect it
to an electrolytic layer,
it will form
a surface electrode.
The electrode
we just talked about
is a three-dimensional electrode.
Now, we reduce
its dimension
to two dimensions.
These surface electrodes
can only be compensated
on the surface of metal and electrolyte.
This compensation
will produce
a smaller
resonance frequency,
which is called surface electrode frequency.
Surface electrode frequency
is the electrode frequency
divided by the root of
E plus Epsilon D.
Epsilon D is the
capacitance of the electrolyte.
So,
the surface electrode
will have a dispersion curve
like this.
From this
dispersion curve,
we can see that
the surface electrode
has a dispersion curve
with a very large
momentum,
which is close to
the water level.
If it is close to the water level,
it means that
its wavelength is zero.
We know that
in basic light theory,
the dispersion curve
of light
is divided by
its speed,
which is the speed of light
in the ring.
Similarly,
the surface electrode dispersion curve
is divided by
the speed of light
in the ring.
And,
the wavelength is zero,
which means that
its speed of light
in the ring
is very slow.
Its speed of light
in the ring
is very slow,
which means that
it will exist for a very long time.
And,
it will have a very strong interaction
between light and matter.
Let's imagine that
there is a smoke truck
in front of you
and you inhale the exhaust gas.
If the speed of the truck is very slow,
you will inhale a lot of exhaust gas.
If the speed of the truck is very fast,
you will pass through the snow
and you will not inhale the gas.
So,
in our research,
the slower the speed of
the surface electrode movement,
the better.
This means that
it can have a very strong interaction
with the ring.
OK.
Now,
let's take a look at
how to do it.
It's actually very simple.
That is to say,
as soon as you see it,
you will think,
how can there be such a simple structure?
In order to achieve the goal
of limiting energy
by using the surface electrode,
we adopted the SIN structure.
This structure
was proposed by
Prof. Chang and his team
in 2009.
It is mainly made up of
a semiconductor nanocircuit,
a metal layer,
and an insulator
in the middle
to form the SIN structure.
The metal layer
is responsible for producing
the surface electrode.
The nanocircuit
is responsible for providing
the insulator.
The insulator
is responsible for
reducing the energy loss
and protecting
the metal layer.
So,
we can quickly understand
the whole process
through this animation.
To make such a laser,
we first have to
put a metal layer
on top of it
and then
put a nanocircuit on top of it.
The nanocircuit will provide
a light-dissipation.
The light-dissipation will
convert the energy
to the Surface Plasma Mode.
The Surface Plasma Mode
can reach the collector
along the
natural laser rectifier
and finally
release the energy
at the end of the laser.
The Surface Plasma Mode
has a wavelength
of tens of nanometers.
In other words,
we can break
the light-dissipation limit
and reduce the size
of such elements
to less than
the wavelength of the light wave.
Excuse me,
can I ask some questions?
Sorry, my name is Ted.
Can we go back
to the previous video?
The one before the animation.
The one before the animation.
This is the one before the animation.
What does SPP mean?
Sorry,
this is one of the questions.
SPP is...
Surface Plasma Polariton.
It is a mixture of
surface electrons and light-dissipation.
I see.
I remember that
laser requires
inversion population.
Can you describe
what is the
inversion population
in the
SPP?
First of all,
this is our
model.
The traditional
laser uses
optical rectifier
to
rectify the light
in the rectifier.
In other words,
the light will eat
many optical gates.
This type of
laser
has the same concept.
It just changes
the light,
which is replaced by
surface electrons.
It uses SPP
to rectify the light
in the rectifier.
You can look at
this picture.
At first,
we will
shoot a laser beam
to activate the
semiconductor material.
During the activation,
it will form
a crystal.
This crystal
will contribute
energy to
the plasma.
Just like the traditional
optical laser,
the light will
rectify the light
in the rectifier.
This is
what I want to answer.
Did I answer
your question?
No.
I think you
just mentioned it.
It's okay.
You can look at
the length of the nanowire
and some basic
information.
The animation
looks like
you don't know much about it.
Let me talk about
its history.
When it was first
proposed by
the team at
Berkeley,
they used
cadmium sulfide,
or CDS nanowire.
The length of the nanowire
is several microns
along the
growth direction
of the nanowire.
However,
its cross-section
is more than
one micrometer.
When it was first
developed,
we were excited
because we could
effectively limit
the energy
in at least
two dimensions.
However,
although the nanowire
effectively limits
the energy
in at least
two dimensions,
its cross-section
is more than
one micrometer.
If I'm not wrong,
it's several micrometers.
However,
as a pioneer
of paper,
the result is
quite exciting.
At that time,
Tsinghua University
wanted to
further reduce the size
of the nanowire
in three dimensions
to the limit of
light and snow.
Therefore,
they adopted
a core-shell structure
called
InGaN-AtGaN.
The core-shell structure
is composed of
GaN,
and InGaN.
In this way,
they successfully
reduced the size
of the nanowire
in three dimensions
to the limit of
light and snow.
In 2012,
the first nanowire
in three dimensions
was reduced to the limit of
light and snow.
However,
Tsinghua University
could not effectively
increase the operating temperature
to room temperature.
After all,
it is a more applicable research.
In other words,
we still hope that
it can play a role
in future projects
or future technology applications.
Therefore,
if this type of component
cannot be effectively
reduced to the limit of
light and snow,
we still hope that
it can play a role
in future projects.
In 2014,
Tsinghua University
adopted
a core-shell structure
called InGaN-AtGaN.
The difference between
InGaN-AtGaN and
InGaN-AtGaN
is that
InGaN-AtGaN can reduce
the loss of laser.
Reducing the loss of laser
is equivalent to
decreasing the pre-value.
If the pre-value is reduced,
there is no need to
consider too many thermal accumulation problems.
In 2014,
we started to do
laser operation at room temperature.
My team,
which is the team of
Mr. Lu Ting-Chang,
started to do laser operation
at room temperature.
Excuse me,
I have a question.
My name is Zan Xiang-Yu.
I am a friend of Lanying.
I want to ask
since
you are using nanowire,
you said that
the length of nanowire
may be limited.
Has anyone done
nanodots?
In fact,
in 2009,
there was
a team
that used
nanogold
to
attach
a
thin silicon
with many holes
to the wire.
The thin silicon
with many holes
will absorb
the organic material.
The organic material
is the GAPE material.
The thin silicon with many holes
is the GAPE material.
The gold particle
is the surfactant.
It is the zero-dimension
surface plasmon.
The zero-dimension surface plasmon
is called localized surface plasmon.
So,
in 2009,
someone did
publish a study
on Nature.
However,
this study
never
stimulated
a single
particle.
As I mentioned,
it uses gold nanoparticle.
The nanoparticle

The optical gain of
organic materials is very low.
So,
someone did this kind of study.
However,
the results are not that solid.

So,
this is my understanding.
I may not have any updates recently,
so if I missed anything,
I can talk about it again.
Sorry,
can I continue the question?
No problem.
You just mentioned
localized surface plasma.
You just mentioned
nanoparticle.
As far as I know,
the research on nanoparticle
changes the shape of
the surface plasma per rhythm
frequency.
Does this actually
affect the design
of your software?
For example,
do you use nanocube,
nanosphere,
or other nanoparticles
to change the frequency of the laser?
Yes, it does.
The surface shape changes
depending on
the per-cell effect.

Thank you for your
wonderful presentation.
I think it's very good.
Well,
the next part is
Q&A. Before you ask
questions, because some
friends have already
asked questions during
the conversation.
I will ask them first,
and others can
think about
the questions.
Thank you.
Got it. Thank you.
Okay.
Next question.
I think the next question is quite interesting.
Because I don't think it's a straightforward question.
Someone asked
He's a little confused.
He thinks your excitation
Your surface plasmon excitation
Is it from the incident photon?
Or is it from the light excitation from the nanowire?
Okay.
This part is a little...
Because there's a cavity, right?
So I'm not sure how to answer.
You tell me. Sorry.
Let me get into the more detailed part.
First of all,
How does this process occur?
Let's start with a light.
I don't know why the animation is stuck.
Then I'll just use this.
And then we come to the light.
This light is in the nanowire.
It's going to trigger the excitation.
And the excitation
Because he's in
When it's a lot of power.
His dispersion is still very
The situation is very fluid.
So he can effectively take his energy.
Coupled to the surface plasmon mode.
Okay, this is actually quite important.
I didn't mention anything special just now.
You can see this picture.
We'll find that the surface plasmon
Dark mode.
What does dark mode mean?
You can't effectively see the light.
He can only be invisible.
On the surface.
Because he's under the light line.
All the dispersion is under the light line.
You can't use the optical mode.
The way to see him.
So,
This is how we trigger the process.
Through light first
Exciton in the nanowire.
Exciton in the nanowire.
And the exciton dispersion.
In a very large range of motion.
It's all very flat.
And he can happen to be with
Surface plasmon mode.
When he couples,
He's going to produce a polariton.
And this polariton.
He's going to become.
Okay, when he produces a polariton.
After that, it's us.
Hey.
That is.
Uh, wait a minute.
The animation can suddenly be used.
Then I'll just say it.
First of all, use the light to trigger that.
Semiconductor nanowire.
And then the exciton in the semiconductor nanowire.
After it comes out, it will give the energy.
Couple to surface plasmon mode.
Polariton.
That's what we see here.
This thing that's fair.
And then how did he release the energy?
It's through the interface.
The discontinuity that causes the dispersion.
I'm going to disperse this dark mode.
So if you're going to go a little bit further.
How about this kind of laser efficiency?
To be honest, it's actually pretty bad.
The first one is his mirror.
It's based on.
The interface formed by the change in the refractive index.
His reflection rate is about.
Only about 20 to 40 percent.
The limit is about 40.
In fact, we're going to go through the software.
It's about 20 percent.
The other one is.
He's going to go out of the way.
He's going to go through the interface.
Continuous dispersion.
It's not enough.
The part that's not enough.
To be able to couple to light mode.
Otherwise, it's the same.
Dark mode.
So this is the part that I'm not going to talk about.
In order to overcome this issue in the future.
We have to be at his.
The two ends of the point.
To design.
Or design.
Such a structure.
To be able to put these dark mode.
Energy in the highest efficiency way.
Come out.
What about the current stage of research?
Almost no.
He's on the edge of the place.
To do any.
Reflective structure.
It's not about the edge.
To do any.
The structure design.
So the raw material.
His energy conversion efficiency.
It's actually very bad.
And his orientation.
It's not as good as our traditional laser.
So good.
Because it's through the dispersion.
To make up for the insufficient momentum.
Let him be able to.
Couple to light mode.
Let him be able to.
Couple to light mode.
This is what I want to say.
This is what I want to say.
I didn't particularly talk about these details.
Because I want to say that everyone's.
The background is south and north.
If you have a more detailed part.
If you want to ask.
You are welcome to ask.
Okay.
Actually, I still have a problem.

Thank you for the wonderful speech.
