1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, thank you all for being able to participate in our project today.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Tara's online speech.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then we are very honored today to invite Dr. Shihai Long to ask us a question about lower back pain.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
OK, please allow me to briefly introduce some of Dr. Shihai Long's experience.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He has a lot of experience, so I might just read it slowly.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
OK, I hope everyone can understand.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
His experience is that he used to be an assistant at Taiwan University's Motion Science Research Lab.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He was also a physical therapist in the Taiwan University's Sports and Fitness Team,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
a physical therapist in the Taiwan University Women's Volleyball Team,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
a physical therapist in the Taiwan University Medical School,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and a physical therapist in the Hsinchu Hospital.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the end, he was also an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina's Motion Science and Physical Therapy Department.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
His degree is from the University of South Carolina's Motion Science and Physical Therapy Doctorate.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He is about to participate in his graduation ceremony in August this year.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Today, it is a great honor for Dr. Shihai Long to introduce to us the potential impacts of lower back pain on the body.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How do we identify the problems that many middle-aged people face?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Dr. Shihai Long's topic today is the footprint of pain,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the investigating persistence of the outer trunk control in recurrent low back pain.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
OK, now let's have Dr. Shihai Long give us a speech.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
OK.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The floor is yours.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
OK.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
OK, thank you for the introduction.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The topic we're going to talk about today is actually my paper research.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I will try my best, because I know that the audience may not be in the same field,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
so I will try to explain it in more detail.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I will also omit some of the more detailed parts, so if you have any questions, you can ask me later.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
My paper research focuses on the recurrence of lower back pain.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Does it have anything to do with the way we change our posture after the pain occurs?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
First of all, lower back pain is commonly referred to as back pain.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sure many of you have had this experience.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In fact, it is a very common problem in modern life.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
About 80% of people have experienced lower back pain at least once in their lives.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The main problem is that most of the lower back pain

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,000
can't be explained in terms of image or structural deformation.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So it's more difficult to diagnose and treat.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Research has shown that about 56% of people experience lower back pain once,

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and the pain recurs within a year.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is a long-term problem,

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
because the pain is constantly going up and down in the lower back.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So it's a long-term problem.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now, in medical or physical therapy,

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
we can help people with lower back pain.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
However, we haven't done a good job of preventing the recurrence of lower back pain.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The main reason is that we can't find the cause of the recurrence of lower back pain.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So if we can find the cause of the recurrence of lower back pain,

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
we can find a way to treat it.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We've found that people who have had lower back pain before

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
may have more episodes in the future.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This doesn't give us any information.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
However, we have developed a set of hypotheses.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
People who have had lower back pain before may have had episodes in the past,

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
so they may have changed their behavior.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This behavior may protect them from lower back pain in a short period of time,

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or avoid the pain.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But will it have some negative effects in the long run?

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Will it affect their symptoms?

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Will it cause recurrent symptoms?

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So my research is mainly about

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
treating people with lower back pain,

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
but first, when they have pain,

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
we measure their behavior.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When they don't have pain,

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
we bring them into the lab and do the same test again.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
In this way, we can see

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
if there are behaviors that are different from those of healthy people without lower back pain.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Does this behavior continue to exist even when they don't have pain?

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So I'm going to talk about two directions today.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There are two directions for the behavior model.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The first is the sectional control part.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The second is the attention part.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm going to explain why these two are important issues for patients with lower back pain.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The first is the sectional control.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There are two groups of people.

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There are two groups of people.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The first group is people with lower back pain.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Their sectional control is relatively tight.

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What is tight?

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The muscles in their body continue to work hard.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In addition to working hard,

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
there may be some inefficient ways to work hard.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The muscles in the opposite direction may also exert force together.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In this case, it is more inefficient.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This may also lead to the separation of joints.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This may lead to the separation of joints.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:08,460
Since there is

89
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,460
only one motion in the chewing motion,

90
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,000
there is less tension between the joints.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In other words, the motion may bring constrictions.

92
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,000
In other words, the joint will not move in the same way as before.

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In other words, the joint will not move in the same way as before.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In other words, the joint will not move in the same way as before.

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,000
In other words, the joint will not move in the same way as before.

96
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In other words, if we have limited attention at a certain time,

97
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In other words, if we have limited attention at a certain time,

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:29,000
we may not be able to perform other tasks.

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
we may not be able to perform other tasks.

100
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
we may not be able to perform other tasks.

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
we may not be able to perform other tasks.

102
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We may not be able to perform other tasks.

103
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We may not be able to perform other tasks.

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We may not be able to perform other tasks.

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We may not be able to perform other tasks.

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We may not be able to perform other tasks.

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We may not be able to perform other tasks.

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We may not be able to perform other tasks.
