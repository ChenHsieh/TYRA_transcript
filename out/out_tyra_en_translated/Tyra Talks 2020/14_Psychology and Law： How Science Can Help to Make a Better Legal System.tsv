0	4000	Yes, okay.
4000	8000	Welcome to the first lecture after the New Year.
8000	12000	I'm glad to have Sui-An here today
12000	18000	to share with us about psychology and law.
18000	20000	Law? I don't think so.
20000	23000	The application of psychology in law
23000	27000	and the development of it.
27000	30000	Before we talk about the topic,
30000	32000	let's introduce our speaker today.
32000	37000	Sui-An is a law major in NTU.
37000	40000	She studied law in NTU.
40000	45000	Then she became a lawyer.
45000	47000	She did well in the exam.
47000	48000	In the process,
48000	52000	she participated in many research and activities in psychology.
52000	57000	After graduating from law school,
57000	60000	she interned in a law firm
60000	62000	and later became a professional lawyer.
62000	68000	She also studied psychology in NTU.
68000	70000	In the field of law,
70000	74000	she majored in the case of death
74000	78000	and the defense lawyer.
78000	80000	That's her major.
80000	82000	In the field of psychology,
82000	87000	she did a combination of law and psychology.
87000	94000	She studied the testimony of children
94000	96000	in the court.
96000	100000	How to do it accurately and accurately.
100000	103000	After graduating from law school,
103000	106000	she went to Cornell
106000	109000	to continue her research.
109000	112000	Her research is about
112000	115000	cognitive psychology,
115000	117000	psychological development,
117000	119000	and the combination of law.
119000	122000	We can hear more details today.
122000	127000	Sui-An will share the details with you.
127000	131000	Finally, I will share a fun fact with you.
131000	134000	Sui-An,
134000	136000	besides...
136000	138000	Did I tell you I wanted to say this?
138000	139000	I don't think I did.
139000	142000	Sui-An,
142000	148000	besides her extensive academic background,
148000	152000	she is interested in drama performance.
152000	155000	She is also passionate about it.
155000	158000	In my previous research,
158000	160000	I majored in social psychology.
160000	161000	In my previous research,
161000	165000	I needed an actor to play the victim.
165000	167000	I asked Sui-An to help me.
167000	169000	She is a professional actor.
169000	171000	Without further ado,
171000	173000	let's give the stage to Sui-An.
173000	175000	Let me give her a round of applause.
178000	180000	Thank you, Yen-Ping.
180000	182000	I feel a little shy.
182000	184000	Before we start,
184000	186000	let me give you a warning.
186000	188000	This is my first time
188000	190000	giving a live talk on the internet.
190000	190000	
190000	192000	This is my first time
192000	194000	giving a live talk on the internet.
194000	196000	I'm a little nervous.
196000	198000	Please bear with me if I make any mistakes.
198000	200000	Please bear with me if I make any mistakes.
200000	202000	I want to say that
202000	204000	the audience today
204000	206000	may be from different fields.
206000	208000	I want to say that
208000	210000	after the talk,
210000	212000	if you are interested in this field,
212000	214000	you can read a book
214000	216000	or watch a TED talk on the internet.
216000	218000	This talk will be divided into four parts.
218000	220000	This talk will be divided into four parts.
220000	222000	In the first part,
222000	224000	I will briefly introduce my background
224000	226000	and what is my relationship with this field.
226000	228000	I will also mention my relationship with Yen-Ping.
228000	230000	She is a great benefactor in my life.
230000	232000	She is a great benefactor in my life.
232000	234000	In the second part,
234000	236000	I will talk about the research topics
236000	238000	in the field of law and psychology.
238000	240000	In the second part,
240000	242000	I will talk about the research topics
242000	244000	in the field of law and psychology.
244000	246000	The last part is about my own research.
246000	248000	The last part is about my own research.
248000	250000	The last part is about my own research.
250000	252000	Sorry, I made a mistake.
252000	254000	I forgot to mention some housekeeping.
254000	256000	I forgot to mention some housekeeping.
256000	258000	Yen-Ping will talk to her PowerPoint.
258000	260000	Yen-Ping will talk to her PowerPoint.
260000	262000	She may not see
262000	264000	what you are talking about in the chat window.
264000	266000	If you have any questions,
266000	268000	you can leave a comment in the chat window.
268000	270000	I will read it for Yen-Ping.
270000	272000	Yen-Ping will find time
272000	274000	to answer the questions in the chat window.
274000	276000	to answer the questions in the chat window.
276000	278000	to answer the questions in the chat window.
278000	280000	Thank you.
280000	282000	Thank you.
282000	284000	Thank you.
284000	286000	Today's topic is
286000	288000	How can science help
288000	290000	establish a better legal system?
290000	292000	You can see three pictures here.
292000	294000	The left one
294000	296000	shows that although the legal world
296000	298000	is thought to be a humanistic
298000	300000	or socially scientific field,
300000	302000	the right one, the picture of DNA,
302000	304000	can help us
304000	306000	establish a better legal system.
306000	308000	The middle picture
308000	310000	is a classic
310000	312000	picture of legal psychology.
312000	314000	This is also a symbol of
314000	316000	American legal psychology.
316000	318000	It will also appear later.
318000	320000	It shows that psychology is a field
320000	322000	that studies human behavior.
322000	324000	that studies human behavior.
324000	326000	It shows that psychology is a field
326000	328000	that studies human behavior.
328000	330000	The picture on the bottom right
330000	332000	is a picture of the brain.
332000	334000	There are many researchers
334000	336000	in the field of neuroscience.
336000	338000	They are thinking about
338000	340000	how to help us
340000	342000	establish a better legal system
342000	344000	through their research.
344000	346000	I am Suyi An.
346000	348000	I am Suyi An.
348000	350000	I am a doctoral student
350000	352000	at Cornell University
352000	354000	Human Ecology
354000	356000	and Human Development.
356000	358000	Cornell University
358000	360000	has two different
360000	362000	fields of study
362000	364000	related to psychology.
364000	366000	One is psychology,
366000	368000	the other is human development.
368000	370000	I am in the field of human development.
370000	372000	There are three fields of study
372000	374000	related to human development.
374000	376000	I am in the field of
376000	378000	legal psychology and human development.
378000	380000	I am in the field of
380000	382000	children, witnesses,
382000	384000	and cognitive research.
384000	386000	As Suyi An said,
386000	388000	I graduated from
388000	390000	the Faculty of Finance and Law
390000	392000	at Cornell University.
392000	394000	During my time at the Faculty of Law,
394000	396000	I worked as a research assistant
396000	398000	in two different
398000	400000	fields of psychology.
400000	402000	I worked as a research assistant
402000	404000	in two different
404000	406000	fields of psychology.
406000	408000	At first, I wanted to study
408000	410000	legal psychology
410000	412000	because I thought
412000	414000	since it is related to human development,
414000	416000	it should be related to human behavior.
416000	418000	I have been interested in psychology.
418000	420000	One day,
420000	422000	I was wondering
422000	424000	how I could get a chance
424000	426000	to study psychology.
426000	428000	At that time,
428000	430000	Professor Zhang Yanping
430000	432000	asked me to work as a research assistant.
432000	434000	I accepted his offer
434000	436000	and he took me in.
436000	438000	I have been studying psychology
438000	440000	with Professor Zhang Yanping.
440000	442000	At first,
442000	444000	I was working in
444000	446000	a social psychology lab
446000	448000	with Professor Lin Yizheng.
448000	450000	I was doing research
450000	452000	related to social psychology.
452000	454000	In my senior year,
454000	456000	Professor Zhao Yishan
456000	458000	was a vice-professor
458000	460000	at NTU.
460000	462000	He was a psychologist
462000	464000	who graduated from
464000	466000	Jianqiao University.
466000	468000	He was also a child witness.
468000	470000	I was interested in this field.
470000	472000	At that time,
472000	474000	Professor Lin Yizheng was about to retire.
474000	476000	I started doing research
476000	478000	related to child witnesses with Professor Zhao Yishan.
478000	480000	During my senior year,
480000	482000	I studied psychology
482000	484000	with Professor Zhao Yishan.
486000	488000	I have listed two pictures here.
490000	492000	NTU has developed
492000	494000	a new cross-field course
494000	496000	for legal psychology.
496000	498000	There are four professors
498000	500000	in three different fields,
500000	502000	legal psychology,
502000	504000	data science,
504000	506000	and information science.
506000	508000	I'm not sure
508000	510000	if this course will be online.
510000	512000	However,
512000	514000	cross-field students
514000	516000	are becoming more and more
516000	518000	popular in Taiwan.
520000	522000	Here are some
522000	524000	researches I did
524000	526000	when I was in Taiwan.
526000	528000	The first one
528000	530000	was with Professor Zhang Yanping,
530000	532000	who is now a doctor,
532000	534000	during Professor Lin Yizheng's
534000	536000	research period.
536000	538000	The second one
538000	540000	was with Professor Zhao Yishan
540000	542000	during his research period.
542000	544000	We did a study on
544000	546000	child witnesses.
546000	548000	The study
548000	550000	was mainly
550000	552000	about
552000	554000	how witnesses
554000	556000	would react
556000	558000	to a crime
558000	560000	in a different place
560000	562000	after witnessing
562000	564000	a crime.
564000	566000	The last one
566000	568000	was a study on children
568000	570000	in my master's thesis.
570000	572000	We wanted to see
572000	574000	if there were
574000	576000	many cases
576000	578000	related to child custody.
578000	580000	In those cases,
580000	582000	the legal terms
582000	584000	were quite complicated.
584000	586000	We also wanted to know
586000	588000	if there were any cases
588000	590000	related to divorce.
590000	592000	We wanted to know
592000	594000	if children could understand
594000	596000	the legal terms
596000	598000	related to child custody
598000	600000	and if they could
600000	602000	imagine what it means
602000	604000	to be divorced.
604000	606000	Something like that.
606000	608000	The second study
608000	610000	was with
610000	612000	Professor Zhong Chengyu.
612000	614000	He is currently
614000	616000	working at the Chinese Academy of Law.
616000	618000	He is also our guest today.
618000	620000	After I graduated
620000	622000	from NTU Law School,
622000	624000	I worked as a lawyer
624000	626000	for a period of time.
626000	628000	I mainly worked
628000	630000	at an international law firm.
630000	632000	The lawyer I worked with
632000	634000	was Mr. Huang Zhihao.
634000	636000	Mr. Huang's specialty
636000	638000	was psychology
638000	640000	and law.
640000	642000	He helped Taiwan
642000	644000	with many cases
644000	646000	related to child custody.
646000	648000	The so-called
648000	650000	case related to child custody
650000	652000	could be
652000	654000	a crime
654000	656000	related to
656000	658000	a crime
658000	660000	that could be
660000	662000	sentenced to death.
662000	664000	We called it
664000	666000	a crime related to
666000	668000	a crime
668000	670000	that could be
670000	672000	sentenced to death.
672000	674000	Mr. Huang's specialty
674000	676000	was psychology
676000	678000	and law.
678000	680000	He helped Taiwan
680000	682000	with many cases
682000	684000	related to child custody.
684000	686000	If you are interested
686000	688000	in working as a lawyer
688000	690000	for a crime related to
690000	692000	child custody,
692000	694000	you may be interested
694000	696000	in the concept of
696000	698000	judicial psychology.
698000	700000	For example,
700000	702000	when we come across
702000	704000	cases related to death
704000	706000	or cases related to
706000	708000	child custody,
708000	710000	we often see
710000	712000	the words
712000	714000	in red.
714000	716000	For example,
716000	718000	the evidence in the case
718000	720000	could be
720000	722000	related to
722000	724000	Taiwan's
724000	726000	Child Custody Rehabilitation
726000	728000	Association.
728000	730000	Many cases
730000	732000	are
732000	734000	based on
734000	736000	scientific evidence.
736000	738000	We need to
738000	740000	examine
740000	742000	whether the scientific evidence
742000	744000	in the case
744000	746000	is reliable
746000	748000	and what is the
748000	750000	evidence
750000	752000	that can be
752000	754000	re-examined.
754000	756000	In Taiwan,
756000	758000	we often see
758000	760000	cases related to
760000	762000	interrogation
762000	764000	or the
764000	766000	possibility of
766000	768000	further testing.
768000	770000	We also need to
770000	772000	examine
772000	774000	whether the
774000	776000	evidence in the case
776000	778000	is reliable
778000	780000	and what is
780000	782000	the evidence
782000	784000	that can be
784000	786000	re-examined.
786000	788000	We also need to
788000	790000	examine
790000	792000	whether the
792000	794000	evidence in the case
794000	796000	is reliable
796000	798000	and what is
798000	800000	the evidence
800000	802000	that can be
802000	804000	re-examined.
804000	806000	We also need to
806000	808000	examine
808000	810000	whether the
810000	812000	evidence in the case
812000	814000	is reliable
814000	816000	and what is
816000	818000	the evidence
818000	820000	that can be

2084000	2086000	I'd like to share
2086000	2088000	a documentary I watched a while ago.
2088000	2090000	It's about
2090000	2092000	a country in Africa
2092000	2094000	whose name I don't remember.
2094000	2096000	In their
2096000	2098000	modern
2098000	2100000	judicial system,
2100000	2102000	a part of it
2102000	2104000	is about
2104000	2106000	how to control
2106000	2108000	their maids.
2108000	2110000	Because the maids fly away,
2110000	2112000	they need chains to
2112000	2114000	control their
2114000	2116000	maids.
2116000	2118000	They will be punished
2118000	2120000	if they
2120000	2122000	join a national
2122000	2124000	ceremony.
2124000	2126000	They even formalize
2126000	2128000	the existence of maids
2128000	2130000	and write it in their laws.
2130000	2132000	This is still a thing
2132000	2134000	in the modern world.
2134000	2136000	Wow, that's amazing.
2136000	2138000	Thank you for your complement.
2138000	2140000	That's a scary story.
2142000	2144000	Let's move on.
2144000	2146000	In fact,
2146000	2148000	the reason why
2148000	2150000	many maids
2150000	2152000	were found guilty
2152000	2154000	was because of their children's testimony.
2154000	2156000	It's interesting that
2156000	2158000	some books
2158000	2160000	say that after the children grew up,
2160000	2162000	they regretted
2162000	2164000	not seeing
2164000	2166000	what the maids
2166000	2168000	were doing.
2168000	2170000	Maybe they were
2170000	2172000	afraid of the adults
2172000	2174000	or other factors.
2174000	2176000	That's why they said those words.
2176000	2178000	They were doubtful.
2178000	2180000	In other words,
2180000	2182000	did the children lie
2182000	2184000	or did they
2184000	2186000	believe what they said?
2186000	2188000	Because of
2188000	2190000	external or internal reasons,
2190000	2192000	they
2192000	2194000	might not
2194000	2196000	believe
2196000	2198000	what they said.
2198000	2200000	They might not believe
2200000	2202000	everything they said.
2202000	2204000	It's interesting.
2204000	2206000	In the early 20th century,
2206000	2208000	the earliest research
2208000	2210000	came from Alfred Binet.
2210000	2212000	If you're a psychologist,
2212000	2214000	you might know him.
2214000	2216000	He was one of the
2216000	2218000	most important
2218000	2220000	researchers and
2220000	2222000	inventors
2222000	2224000	of modern IQ tests.
2224000	2226000	He had a legal background.
2226000	2228000	Although his research
2228000	2230000	was based on IQ tests,
2230000	2232000	according to
2232000	2234000	our Tibetan teachers,
2234000	2236000	his research
2236000	2238000	was based on
2238000	2240000	the credibility of testimony.
2240000	2242000	He published
2242000	2244000	a book in 1901.
2244000	2246000	He said that
2246000	2248000	through his research,
2248000	2250000	he thought that
2250000	2252000	the credibility of testimony
2252000	2254000	of men and women
2254000	2256000	was based on
2256000	2258000	the ability of human
2258000	2260000	to react to
2260000	2262000	the information
2262000	2264000	they received
2264000	2266000	from others
2266000	2268000	and
2268000	2270000	the ability
2270000	2272000	to
2272000	2274000	resist.
2274000	2276000	He was very interested in this.
2276000	2278000	From 1901
2278000	2280000	to
2280000	2282000	1960 and
2282000	2284000	1970,
2284000	2286000	no one paid attention to this.
2286000	2288000	In the 1960s and 1970s,
2288000	2290000	children's testimony
2290000	2292000	became a hot topic.
2292000	2294000	As women
2294000	2296000	and children
2296000	2298000	started to
2298000	2300000	pay attention to
2300000	2302000	children's rights,
2302000	2304000	many people started to
2304000	2306000	pay attention to
2306000	2308000	children's rights
2308000	2310000	in kindergartens,
2310000	2312000	and there were many cases
2312000	2314000	about
2314000	2316000	inappropriate contact
2316000	2318000	with their family members.
2318000	2320000	Under these circumstances,
2320000	2322000	the law and cases
2322000	2324000	changed the situation
2324000	2326000	so that most of the children
2326000	2328000	could not testify in court.
2328000	2330000	Suddenly, the condition
2330000	2332000	for children's testimony
2332000	2334000	to testify in court
2334000	2336000	and the age
2336000	2338000	for children to testify in court
2338000	2340000	led to many children's
2340000	2342000	testimonies
2342000	2344000	in court.
2344000	2346000	The judge didn't know
2346000	2348000	how to deal with it,
2348000	2350000	and the psychologist
2350000	2352000	didn't know what to do.
2352000	2354000	My teacher
2354000	2356000	was an expert
2356000	2358000	who studied
2358000	2360000	children's intelligence
2360000	2362000	and memory.
2362000	2364000	He was an expert
2364000	2366000	in pure academic theory.
2366000	2368000	He found that
2368000	2370000	a boy
2370000	2372000	was involved in a murder case.
2372000	2374000	The father
2374000	2376000	seemed to have hit his mother
2376000	2378000	with a stick.
2378000	2380000	He asked the boy
2380000	2382000	if he had seen
2382000	2384000	his mother
2384000	2386000	being dragged
2386000	2388000	to the back door
2388000	2390000	after the argument.
2390000	2392000	The judge wanted to know
2392000	2394000	if the child's testimony
2394000	2396000	was credible,
2396000	2398000	because it was related
2398000	2400000	to the father's crime.
2400000	2402000	My teacher thought
2402000	2404000	that as a well-known
2404000	2406000	child memory expert,
2406000	2408000	he couldn't answer the question.
2408000	2410000	So he gathered
2410000	2412000	about 30 experts
2412000	2414000	from the U.S.
2414000	2416000	to hold a meeting
2416000	2418000	in Cornell.
2418000	2420000	The purpose of the meeting
2420000	2422000	was to discuss
2422000	2424000	how to transfer
2424000	2426000	psychological knowledge
2426000	2428000	related to children
2428000	2430000	to the court
2430000	2432000	and make it
2432000	2434000	a practical knowledge.
2434000	2436000	So the experts
2436000	2438000	held a three-day meeting
2438000	2440000	in Cornell,
2440000	2442000	and came up with
2442000	2444000	a white paper
2444000	2446000	that slowly influenced
2446000	2448000	the combination
2448000	2450000	of psychology and law.
2450000	2452000	In the 1980s,
2452000	2454000	there was a famous case
2454000	2456000	called Mark Martin's
2456000	2458000	Family Trials.
2458000	2460000	It was about a kindergarten
2460000	2462000	run by a family.
2462000	2464000	Suddenly,
2464000	2466000	dozens of children
2466000	2468000	claimed to have
2468000	2470000	been sexually harassed
2470000	2472000	or sexually harassed
2472000	2474000	by various members
2474000	2476000	of the family
2476000	2478000	with different objects
2478000	2480000	of interest.
2480000	2482000	Most of the charges
2482000	2484000	were revoked
2484000	2486000	or turned into
2486000	2488000	conjury.
2488000	2490000	The reason was
2490000	2492000	that the child testimony
2492000	2494000	in the case
2494000	2496000	seemed to be
2496000	2498000	impossible to find physical evidence.
2498000	2500000	Many experts
2500000	2502000	used psychological research
2502000	2504000	to help determine
2504000	2506000	whether the child testimony
2506000	2508000	was true or not.
2508000	2510000	There's a documentary
2510000	2512000	about the case
2512000	2514000	that you can check out.
2514000	2516000	Mark Martin
2516000	2518000	published a book
2518000	2520000	in 1995.
2520000	2522000	After the meeting
2522000	2524000	in Cornell,
2524000	2526000	he began to receive
2526000	2528000	many letters
2528000	2530000	from lawyers
2530000	2532000	asking him
2532000	2534000	if he wanted to be
2534000	2536000	a part of the case.
2536000	2538000	The lawyer said
2538000	2540000	he didn't mind
2540000	2542000	as long as
2542000	2544000	the child testimony
2544000	2546000	was easy to understand.
2546000	2548000	You can check out
2548000	2550000	the documentary
2550000	2552000	online.
2552000	2554000	The documentary
2554000	2556000	is about
2556000	2558000	how psychological research
2558000	2560000	can be applied
2560000	2562000	to children.
2562000	2564000	Any questions?
2592000	2594000	Let's move on.
2622000	2624000	The child testimony
2624000	2626000	is about
2626000	2628000	a man who
2628000	2630000	is a good man
2630000	2632000	but a very careless man.
2632000	2634000	It's a pre-testimony.
2634000	2636000	There may be
2636000	2638000	some guidance issues.
2638000	2640000	The child testimony
2640000	2642000	is about
2642000	2644000	a man who
2644000	2646000	is a good man
2646000	2648000	but a very careless man.
2648000	2650000	The child testimony
2650000	2652000	is about
2652000	2654000	a man who
2654000	2656000	is a good man
2656000	2658000	but a very careless man.
2658000	2660000	The child testimony
2660000	2662000	is about
2662000	2664000	a man who
2664000	2666000	is a good man
2666000	2668000	but a very careless man.
2668000	2670000	The child testimony
2670000	2672000	includes
2672000	2674000	many additional
2674000	2676000	evidence
2676000	2678000	that may
2678000	2680000	have to do with
2680000	2682000	law and psychology,
2682000	2684000	including how
2684000	2686000	electric vehicles
2686000	2688000	can be applied to
2688000	2690000	law,
2690000	2692000	and when children
2692000	2694000	develop the ability to
2694000	2696000	lie.
2696000	2698000	In some specific crimes,
2698000	2700000	judges and judges
2700000	2702000	may have different
2702000	2704000	sympathies
2704000	2706000	for different
2706000	2708000	cultures,
2708000	2710000	social status,
2710000	2712000	and different
2712000	2714000	ways of
2714000	2716000	raising children,
2716000	2718000	so we are
2718000	2720000	currently doing
2720000	2722000	a research
2722000	2724000	to explore
2724000	2726000	the different
2726000	2728000	aspects of
2728000	2730000	the child testimony.
2730000	2732000	We hope
2732000	2734000	this research
2734000	2736000	can help
2736000	2738000	you understand
2738000	2740000	the different
2740000	2742000	aspects of
2742000	2744000	the child testimony.
2744000	2746000	I am also
2746000	2748000	working with
2748000	2750000	Charles Brenner
2750000	2752000	on a research
2752000	2754000	called Fuzzy Trace Theory.
2754000	2756000	Fuzzy Trace Theory
2756000	2758000	is a method of
2758000	2760000	memorization
2760000	2762000	in which
2762000	2764000	we try to
2764000	2766000	visualize
2766000	2768000	the memory
2768000	2770000	of the victim
2770000	2772000	in a specific way.
2772000	2774000	For example,
2774000	2776000	we try to
2776000	2778000	visualize
2778000	2780000	the victim
2780000	2782000	on the African
2782000	2784000	prairie,
2784000	2786000	and see if this
2786000	2788000	special way
2788000	2790000	can enhance
2790000	2792000	the memory
2792000	2794000	of the victim.
2794000	2796000	I am also
2796000	2798000	working with
2798000	2800000	a professor
2800000	2802000	in the Department of
2802000	2804000	Law on
2804000	2806000	whether
2806000	2808000	most states
2808000	2810000	in the U.S.
2810000	2812000	are able to
2812000	2814000	evaluate the
2814000	2816000	ability of
2816000	2818000	this method
2818000	2820000	of memorization
2820000	2822000	in the U.S.
2822000	2824000	I am also
2824000	2826000	working with
2826000	2828000	Cornell
2828000	2830000	on a research
2830000	2832000	called
2832000	2834000	World Anti-Torture Center.
2834000	2836000	We are also
2836000	2838000	working on
2838000	2840000	a book
2840000	2842000	on the
2842000	2844000	possibility
2844000	2846000	of
2846000	2848000	taking home
2848000	2850000	the message
2850000	2852000	that if you are
2852000	2854000	interested in
2854000	2856000	law and psychology,
2856000	2858000	you should
2858000	2860000	go to the
2860000	2862000	American Psychological Society
2862000	2864000	to learn more about
2864000	2866000	law and psychology.
2866000	2868000	In Europe,
2868000	2870000	there is a
2870000	2872000	law and psychology
2872000	2874000	association
2874000	2876000	called
2876000	2878000	the American Psychological Society.
2878000	2880000	I think
2880000	2882000	it is a great resource
2882000	2884000	for people
2884000	2886000	who want to
2886000	2888000	study abroad.
2888000	2890000	This book is
2890000	2892000	written by
2892000	2894000	Elizabeth Loftus,
2894000	2896000	an expert on
2896000	2898000	the study of
2898000	2900000	memory.
2900000	2902000	It is a
2902000	2904000	great resource
2904000	2906000	for people
2906000	2908000	who want to
2908000	2910000	learn more about
2910000	2912000	law and
2912000	2914000	psychology.
2914000	2916000	That's all
2916000	2918000	for today.
2918000	2920000	If you have
2920000	2922000	any questions,
2922000	2924000	please feel free
2924000	2926000	to ask.
2926000	2928000	Before we
2928000	2930000	start,
2930000	2932000	I would like to
2932000	2934000	ask you
2934000	2936000	a question.
2936000	2938000	You can turn on
2938000	2940000	the microphone
2940000	2942000	or leave a comment
2942000	2944000	and I will ask.
2944000	2946000	How to turn on
2946000	2948000	the microphone?
2948000	2950000	Go to
2950000	2952000	Blue Dream
2952000	2954000	and you will
2954000	2956000	find a
2956000	2958000	picture of
2958000	2960000	Blue Dream.
2960000	2962000	Click on it and
2962000	2964000	you can talk.
2964000	2966000	Please go ahead.
2966000	2968000	It's okay.
2968000	2970000	I just have a question.
2970000	2972000	No, I mean
2972000	2974000	you can ask now.
2974000	2976000	Okay.
2976000	2978000	Do I need to introduce myself?
2978000	2980000	Sure.
2980000	2982000	I am
2982000	2984000	Feng Mengzhang,
2984000	2986000	and I am studying social science.
2986000	2988000	Hi.
2988000	2990000	Hi.
2990000	2992000	So
2992000	2994000	I was thinking
2994000	2996000	about the issue of
2996000	2998000	the gap between
2998000	3000000	children's
3000000	3002000	testimony and
3002000	3004000	objective situation.
3004000	3006000	I am curious
3006000	3008000	about
3008000	3010000	how to
3010000	3012000	distinguish
3012000	3014000	the gap
3014000	3016000	between
3016000	3018000	the children's testimony
3018000	3020000	and the objective situation.
3020000	3022000	Is it the memory
3022000	3024000	or the memory
3024000	3026000	that is affected
3026000	3028000	or the expression
3028000	3030000	that is affected?
3030000	3032000	For example,
3032000	3034000	the stereotype
3034000	3036000	that the person
3036000	3038000	was affected
3038000	3040000	by the stereotype.
3040000	3042000	The description
3042000	3044000	of the stereotype
3044000	3046000	is the difference
3046000	3048000	between the control group
3048000	3050000	and the treatment group.
3050000	3052000	One possibility is
3052000	3054000	that the stereotype
3054000	3056000	may cause
3056000	3058000	some mistakes
3058000	3060000	in the process
3060000	3062000	of memory
3062000	3064000	or memory.
3064000	3066000	Another possibility
3066000	3068000	is that
3068000	3070000	the stereotype
3070000	3072000	may cause
3072000	3074000	some mistakes
3074000	3076000	in the process
3076000	3078000	of memory
3078000	3080000	or memory.
3080000	3082000	Another possibility
3082000	3084000	is that
3084000	3086000	the stereotype
3086000	3088000	may cause
3088000	3090000	some mistakes
3090000	3092000	in the process
3092000	3094000	of memory
3094000	3096000	or memory.
3096000	3098000	Another possibility
3098000	3100000	is that
3100000	3102000	the stereotype
3102000	3104000	may cause
3104000	3106000	some mistakes
3106000	3108000	in the process
3108000	3110000	of memory
3110000	3112000	or memory.
3112000	3114000	Another possibility
3114000	3116000	is that
3116000	3118000	the stereotype
3118000	3120000	may cause
3120000	3122000	some mistakes
3122000	3124000	in the process
3124000	3126000	of memory
3126000	3128000	or memory.
3128000	3130000	Another possibility
3130000	3132000	is that
3132000	3134000	the stereotype
3134000	3136000	may cause
3136000	3138000	some mistakes
3138000	3140000	in the process
3140000	3142000	of memory
3142000	3144000	or memory.
3144000	3146000	Another possibility
3146000	3148000	is that
3148000	3150000	the stereotype
3150000	3152000	may cause
3152000	3154000	some mistakes
3154000	3156000	in the process
3156000	3158000	of memory
3158000	3160000	or memory.
3160000	3162000	In fact,
3162000	3164000	there is no way
3164000	3166000	to distinguish
3166000	3168000	the information
3168000	3170000	given by
3170000	3172000	the person
3172000	3174000	and how he or she
3174000	3176000	remembers it.
3176000	3178000	In fact,
3178000	3180000	there is no way
3180000	3182000	to distinguish
3182000	3184000	the information
3184000	3186000	given by
3186000	3188000	the person
3188000	3190000	and how he or she
3190000	3192000	remembers it.
3192000	3194000	In fact,
3194000	3196000	there is no way
3196000	3198000	to distinguish
3198000	3200000	the information
3200000	3202000	given by
3202000	3204000	the person
3204000	3206000	and how he or she
3206000	3208000	remembers it.
3208000	3210000	In fact,
3210000	3212000	there is no way
3212000	3214000	to distinguish
3214000	3216000	the information
3216000	3218000	given by
3218000	3220000	the person
3220000	3222000	and how he or she
3222000	3224000	remembers it.
3224000	3226000	In fact,
3226000	3228000	there is no way
3228000	3230000	to distinguish
3230000	3232000	the information
3232000	3234000	given by
3234000	3236000	the person
3236000	3238000	and how he or she
3238000	3240000	remembers it.
3240000	3242000	There is another
3242000	3244000	big question.
3244000	3246000	I majored in
3246000	3248000	economics,
3248000	3250000	so I will
3250000	3252000	think about
3252000	3254000	what is
3254000	3256000	the cause and effect
3256000	3258000	of human behavior.
3258000	3260000	Back to the question
3260000	3262000	of children's
3262000	3264000	testimony,
3264000	3266000	I was thinking
3266000	3268000	about the cause
3268000	3270000	and effect of
3270000	3272000	children's testimony
3272000	3274000	in court.
3274000	3276000	I can imagine
3276000	3278000	the cause and effect
3278000	3280000	of children's testimony
3280000	3282000	in court.
3282000	3284000	For example,
3284000	3286000	adults know that
3286000	3288000	there will be legal responsibility
3288000	3290000	if they testify,
3290000	3292000	but children
3292000	3294000	may not understand
3294000	3296000	the legal effect
3296000	3298000	behind the behavior.
3298000	3300000	For example,
3300000	3302000	the prosecutor may like
3302000	3304000	the father or mother
3304000	3306000	and want to tell
3306000	3308000	the good words
3308000	3310000	to the one he likes.
3310000	3312000	The prosecutor may
3312000	3314000	want to please the authority
3314000	3316000	and obey the authority.
3316000	3318000	If there is a big difference
3318000	3320000	between the cause and effect
3320000	3322000	of children's testimony
3322000	3324000	and adults' testimony,
3324000	3326000	there may be
3326000	3328000	different contents.
3328000	3330000	I was wondering
3330000	3332000	if anyone has
3332000	3334000	analyzed this issue.
3334000	3336000	Yes,
3336000	3338000	I have seen
3338000	3340000	a lot of research.
3340000	3342000	You just mentioned
3342000	3344000	a lot of things.
3344000	3346000	For example,
3346000	3348000	some of the research
3348000	3350000	has been converted
3350000	3352000	into a method
3352000	3354000	to interrogate children.
3354000	3356000	The first method
3356000	3358000	is not to promise
3358000	3360000	the child
3360000	3362000	good or bad answers
3362000	3364000	or what kind of actions
3364000	3366000	the child will take.
3366000	3368000	For example,
3368000	3370000	if the police take the child
3370000	3372000	to McDonald's,
3372000	3374000	the child will not
3374000	3376000	be attracted to McDonald's.
3376000	3378000	The second method
3378000	3380000	is not to promise
3380000	3382000	the child good or bad answers
3382000	3384000	or what kind of actions
3384000	3386000	the child will take.
3386000	3388000	The third method
3388000	3390000	is to give the child
3390000	3392000	a chance to
3392000	3394000	choose the right answer.
3394000	3396000	For example,
3396000	3398000	most of the research
3398000	3400000	in Europe and America
3400000	3402000	does not recommend
3402000	3404000	the use of a telegram doll.
3404000	3406000	Telegram dolls
3406000	3408000	are very interesting
3408000	3410000	to most children.
3410000	3412000	If you tell the child
3412000	3414000	to do certain things
3414000	3416000	with the doll
3416000	3418000	and not to do
3418000	3420000	certain things with the doll,
3420000	3422000	it will affect
3422000	3424000	the child.
3424000	3426000	In this process,
3426000	3428000	if you tell the child
3428000	3430000	to do certain things
3430000	3432000	or not to do certain things,
3432000	3434000	it will affect the child.
3434000	3436000	We are working on
3436000	3438000	how to maintain
3438000	3440000	the focus of the child
3440000	3442000	in the process of
3442000	3444000	asking questions to children,
3444000	3446000	but not to give the child
3446000	3448000	too many external questions.
3448000	3450000	Many people are studying this.
3450000	3452000	I think this question
3452000	3454000	is professional and good.
3454000	3456000	Thank you.
3456000	3458000	You just answered
3458000	3460000	the questions I wanted to ask.
3460000	3462000	The next question I want to ask
3462000	3464000	is from
3464000	3466000	someone else.
3466000	3468000	Thank you.
3468000	3470000	Let me guess.
3470000	3472000	I used to work
3472000	3474000	at the Family Violence
3474000	3476000	and Sexual Assault Prevention Center
3476000	3478000	about six or seven years ago.
3478000	3480000	You just said
3480000	3482000	that telegram dolls are not recommended.
3482000	3484000	We use a lot of them.
3488000	3490000	We try to
3490000	3492000	at least
3492000	3494000	use them
3494000	3496000	if there are
3496000	3498000	research papers.
3498000	3500000	If you really
3500000	3502000	have to use a tool,
3502000	3504000	telegram dolls
3504000	3506000	are the last step.
3506000	3508000	They are too easy to use
3508000	3510000	because they have holes.
3510000	3512000	Children
3512000	3514000	may want to
3514000	3516000	insert different
3516000	3518000	body parts or objects
3518000	3520000	in order to
3520000	3522000	interpret the behavior.
3522000	3524000	So,
3524000	3526000	a better way
3526000	3528000	is to use a time line
3528000	3530000	or a pen
3530000	3532000	to
3532000	3534000	telegram the child.
3534000	3536000	Or,
3536000	3538000	if you really need
3538000	3540000	to point out a specific part,
3540000	3542000	telegram dolls
3542000	3544000	are less likely
3544000	3546000	to have body parts.
3546000	3548000	So,
3550000	3552000	if you have
3552000	3554000	DNA evidence,
3554000	3556000	children
3556000	3558000	are likely to be
3558000	3560000	sexually assaulted.
3560000	3562000	So,
3562000	3564000	I don't recommend using them.
3564000	3566000	Okay.
3566000	3568000	Next,
3568000	3570000	let me see his name.
3570000	3572000	Is his name
3572000	3574000	Mingxin?
3574000	3576000	Hi, everyone.
3576000	3578000	Thank you.
3578000	3580000	Can you hear me?
3580000	3582000	Yes.
3582000	3584000	Hi,
3584000	3586000	I'm Mingxin Zhu.
3586000	3588000	I'm a doctoral student
3588000	3590000	at Northwestern University.
3590000	3592000	Yiyan is my classmate
3592000	3594000	in the Department of Law.
3594000	3596000	Thank you, Yiyan.
3596000	3598000	I have two questions.
3598000	3600000	The first question is
3600000	3602000	when a child
3602000	3604000	gives his testimony,
3604000	3606000	the job of a lawyer
3606000	3608000	is to
3608000	3610000	incorporate his testimony
3610000	3612000	into the law.
3612000	3614000	So,
3614000	3616000	from a psychologist's point of view,
3616000	3618000	if you find that
3618000	3620000	the testimony is likely to be contaminated,
3620000	3622000	or if the contamination
3622000	3624000	is significant,
3624000	3626000	if the contamination is light,
3626000	3628000	is it possible
3628000	3630000	to correct it
3630000	3632000	or give it
3632000	3634000	a different weight
3634000	3636000	instead of throwing away
3636000	3638000	the entire testimony?
3638000	3640000	Is there a difference in the amount
3640000	3642000	rather than just having it or not?
3642000	3644000	That's my first question.
3644000	3646000	What about the second question?
3646000	3648000	Have I finished my question?
3648000	3650000	Okay,
3650000	3652000	let's start with the first one.
3652000	3654000	You asked about the evidence
3654000	3656000	and the evidence.
3656000	3658000	From a psychologist's point of view,
3658000	3660000	do you only discuss
3660000	3662000	the evidence and not the evidence?
3662000	3664000	In fact,
3664000	3666000	most people
3666000	3668000	in this field
3668000	3670000	are still trained
3670000	3672000	in psychology,
3672000	3674000	so they don't think
3674000	3676000	much about how
3676000	3678000	a lawyer or a prosecutor
3678000	3680000	or an attorney
3680000	3682000	should use the evidence.
3682000	3684000	For example,
3684000	3686000	let's say that
3686000	3688000	this case has repeated interrogation.
3688000	3690000	The contamination
3690000	3692000	may not have been discovered at the beginning,
3692000	3694000	but it was discovered later.
3694000	3696000	Of course, you can ask an expert
3696000	3698000	to verify that
3698000	3700000	in the first two interrogations,
3700000	3702000	there was no inducement
3702000	3704000	or contamination.
3704000	3706000	In the first two interrogations,
3706000	3708000	what was provided?
3708000	3710000	In the third interrogation,
3710000	3712000	there may be some external
3712000	3714000	inducement or
3714000	3716000	inappropriate reasons,
3716000	3718000	so the child's testimony
3718000	3720000	may have been contaminated
3720000	3722000	or even changed.
3722000	3724000	In fact,
3724000	3726000	it can be used in the first two interrogations.
3726000	3728000	Psychologists may evaluate
3728000	3730000	the possibility of
3730000	3732000	external contamination
3732000	3734000	in each interrogation.
3734000	3736000	As for
3736000	3738000	how lawyers
3738000	3740000	use scientific reports,
3740000	3742000	I think it's more like
3742000	3744000	a lawyer's strategy.
3744000	3746000	As far as I know,
3746000	3748000	ordinary children's legal psychologists
3748000	3750000	don't interfere
3750000	3752000	with how lawyers
3752000	3754000	use scientific reports.
3754000	3756000	On the one hand, it's not suitable
3756000	3758000	because it's a legal profession.
3758000	3760000	Ordinary children's legal psychologists
3760000	3762000	don't understand this profession,
3762000	3764000	so they provide
3764000	3766000	very pure scientific analysis reports.
3766000	3768000	This is what I know
3768000	3770000	from my experience.
3770000	3772000	I mean,
3772000	3774000	with your background,
3774000	3776000	from a psychological point of view,
3776000	3778000	is it possible that
3778000	3780000	the level of contamination
3780000	3782000	can be reduced
3782000	3784000	to a point
3784000	3786000	where there is no evidence?
3786000	3788000	Or is it possible
3788000	3790000	that it still exists
3790000	3792000	and only needs
3792000	3794000	some correction
3794000	3796000	on the basis of
3796000	3798000	the level of contamination?
3798000	3800000	I've discussed this with my teacher.
3800000	3802000	He rarely
3802000	3804000	accepts students
3804000	3806000	with dual backgrounds like me.
3806000	3808000	I asked him
3808000	3810000	if I needed to
3810000	3812000	give expert advice.
3812000	3814000	He said it's simple.
3814000	3816000	I can't be an expert
3816000	3818000	on the same case
3818000	3820000	and defend the same case.
3820000	3822000	He suggested
3822000	3824000	that this kind of thing
3824000	3826000	can be done
3826000	3828000	by
3828000	3830000	reducing the level
3830000	3832000	of contamination
3832000	3834000	to a point where
3834000	3836000	there is no evidence.
3836000	3838000	First of all,
3838000	3840000	even if I think this way,
3840000	3842000	my child can't
3842000	3844000	have no evidence.
3844000	3846000	It's not a scientific term.
3846000	3848000	It's a legal term.
3848000	3850000	I see.
3850000	3852000	In my scientific report,
3852000	3854000	even if I have a dual background,
3854000	3856000	I can't
3856000	3858000	cross-reference
3858000	3860000	the legal part.
3860000	3862000	I should leave it
3862000	3864000	to my legal team
3864000	3866000	to do it,
3866000	3868000	even if I have a dual background.
3868000	3870000	My second question
3870000	3872000	is that
3872000	3874000	your school has
3874000	3876000	a plan to
3876000	3878000	conduct an investigation.
3878000	3880000	Yes.
3880000	3882000	I'm curious
3882000	3884000	about the role of psychology
3884000	3886000	in the court in Taiwan.
3886000	3888000	For example,
3888000	3890000	is there any possibility of
3890000	3892000	cross-referencing?
3892000	3894000	After our legal department
3894000	3896000	was sentenced to death,
3896000	3898000	there are only some procedural
3898000	3900000	issues that can be reviewed.
3900000	3902000	For example,
3902000	3904000	are there any other
3904000	3906000	legal procedures?
3906000	3908000	However,
3908000	3910000	I'm curious
3910000	3912000	about the role of psychology
3912000	3914000	in the court in Taiwan.
3914000	3916000	I'm curious
3916000	3918000	about the role of psychology
3918000	3920000	in the court in Taiwan.
3920000	3922000	I think
3922000	3924000	it might be related
3924000	3926000	to the logic of religion.
3926000	3928000	There are two judgments
3928000	3930000	in the Supreme Court
3930000	3932000	for the death penalty.
3932000	3934000	The logic is that
3934000	3936000	a person can only
3936000	3938000	be held accountable
3938000	3940000	for the crime he committed.
3940000	3942000	If a person
3942000	3944000	has a mental state
3944000	3946000	during the execution
3946000	3948000	or even before
3948000	3950000	the execution,
3950000	3952000	which means
3952000	3954000	he can't be held
3954000	3956000	accountable for the crime
3956000	3958000	he committed,
3958000	3960000	he shouldn't be sentenced to death.
3960000	3962000	This doesn't mean
3962000	3964000	he should be sentenced to death.
3964000	3966000	In Taiwan,
3966000	3968000	as far as I know,
3968000	3970000	there is still
3970000	3972000	no assessment
3972000	3974000	on this issue.
3974000	3976000	The reason is that
3976000	3978000	there are three
3978000	3980000	common psychological
3980000	3982000	abilities
3982000	3984000	related to the death penalty.
3984000	3986000	The first one is
3986000	3988000	whether the person
3988000	3990000	has the ability to
3990000	3992000	communicate with the lawyer
3992000	3994000	and defend himself.
3994000	3996000	The second one is
3996000	3998000	whether he has the ability
3998000	4000000	to be held accountable
4000000	4002000	for the crime he committed.
4002000	4004000	The third one is
4004000	4006000	the ability to be executed.
4006000	4008000	As far as I know,
4008000	4010000	in Taiwan,
4010000	4012000	the ability to be held
4012000	4014000	accountable for the crime
4014000	4016000	he committed
4016000	4018000	is not necessarily
4018000	4020000	acceptable
4020000	4022000	or is still
4022000	4024000	a difficult concept.
4024000	4026000	It's even more difficult
4026000	4028000	when it comes to the ability
4028000	4030000	to save the life
4030000	4032000	in the later stage,
4032000	4034000	or the ability to be held
4034000	4036000	accountable
4036000	4038000	according to the law.
4038000	4040000	As far as I know,
4040000	4042000	Taiwan's judicial system
4042000	4044000	doesn't deal with the issue
4044000	4046000	of the ability to save the life
4046000	4048000	and the ability to be held accountable.
4048000	4050000	Some states require
4050000	4052000	the lawyer to apply
4052000	4054000	at the last minute,
4054000	4056000	so they are now
4056000	4058000	looking at
4058000	4060000	which states
4060000	4062000	don't allow
4062000	4064000	the application
4064000	4066000	of the ability
4066000	4068000	to be held accountable.
4068000	4070000	They are still
4070000	4072000	doing statistics
4072000	4074000	on the case
4074000	4076000	of the death penalty.
4076000	4078000	I see.
4078000	4080000	There's a minor point
4080000	4082000	that I'd like to add.
4082000	4084000	You mentioned that the witch
4084000	4086000	wanted to see
4086000	4088000	if there's a chance
4088000	4090000	to confirm the death penalty.
4090000	4092000	Yes, I saw that
4092000	4094000	and I think you're right.
4094000	4096000	It's a minor point.
4096000	4098000	Thank you.
4098000	4100000	Thank you, Cha-Zheng.
4100000	4102000	Okay.
4102000	4104000	Let me ask
4104000	4106000	another question.
4106000	4108000	You mentioned
4108000	4110000	that
4110000	4112000	a friend here
4112000	4114000	asked a tricky question.
4114000	4116000	He said,
4116000	4118000	it sounds like psychology
4118000	4120000	has a great influence
4120000	4122000	on food in the US and Europe.
4122000	4124000	I'm curious
4124000	4126000	if it has an influence
4126000	4128000	on Taiwan's courts.
4128000	4130000	You mentioned that
4130000	4132000	psychology
4132000	4134000	evaluates
4134000	4136000	the person
4136000	4138000	or the defendant
4138000	4140000	I'm guessing
4140000	4142000	whether the person
4142000	4144000	has the ability
4144000	4146000	to be held accountable.
4146000	4148000	But you didn't mention
4148000	4150000	that psychology
4150000	4152000	has a great influence
4152000	4154000	on the evidence
4154000	4156000	in Taiwan's courts.
4156000	4158000	Can you comment on that?
4160000	4162000	As far as I know,
4162000	4164000	there are five kinds of evidence
4164000	4166000	in Taiwan,
4166000	4168000	such as human evidence,
4168000	4170000	book evidence,
4170000	4172000	and so on.
4172000	4174000	As far as I know,
4174000	4176000	human evidence
4176000	4178000	has a great influence
4178000	4180000	on the evidence
4180000	4182000	in Taiwan's courts.
4182000	4184000	As far as I know,
4184000	4186000	for example,
4186000	4188000	Mr. Zhao Yishan
4188000	4190000	is a consultant
4190000	4192000	in the Ministry of Public Security.
4192000	4194000	Due to his influence
4194000	4196000	and the promotion
4196000	4198000	of some private groups,
4198000	4200000	there is a new law
4200000	4202000	called
4202000	4204000	Sexual Harassment Prevention Act.
4204000	4206000	According to the law,
4206000	4208000	it should be
4208000	4210000	carried out
4210000	4212000	by experts
4212000	4214000	in the field.
4214000	4216000	As far as I know,
4216000	4218000	there are many
4218000	4220000	psychologists,
4220000	4222000	clinical psychologists,
4222000	4224000	and so on.
4224000	4226000	Psychologists
4226000	4228000	are also
4228000	4230000	working on
4230000	4232000	the establishment
4232000	4234000	and modification
4234000	4236000	of articles
4236000	4238000	related to
4238000	4240000	sexual harassment.
4240000	4242000	As far as I know,
4242000	4244000	in the past few years,
4244000	4246000	Taiwan has been
4246000	4248000	more and more aware
4248000	4250000	that
4250000	4252000	first,
4252000	4254000	science can enter the court,
4254000	4256000	and second,
4256000	4258000	science is not only
4258000	4260000	the so-called hard science,
4260000	4262000	such as forensic evidence,
4262000	4264000	and so on.
4264000	4266000	There is also
4266000	4268000	the so-called soft science,
4268000	4270000	and so on.
4270000	4272000	I think more and more
4272000	4274000	legal figures
4274000	4276000	in the legal system
4276000	4278000	are paying attention to it.
4278000	4280000	Not only judges,
4280000	4282000	but also prosecutors and lawyers
4282000	4284000	are doing different
4284000	4286000	training.
4286000	4288000	I think it's pretty good.
4288000	4290000	That's the situation in Taiwan.
4290000	4292000	Okay.
4292000	4294000	I have a question.
4294000	4296000	It's my own question.
4296000	4298000	Do you have any other questions?
4298000	4300000	Do you have any other questions?
4300000	4302000	Do you have any other questions?
4304000	4306000	Let's think about it.
4306000	4308000	I'll go first.
4308000	4310000	Excuse me. Can you hear me?
4310000	4312000	Please go ahead.
4312000	4314000	I'd like to ask
4314000	4316000	that
4316000	4318000	the study design
4318000	4320000	you're using now
4320000	4322000	is based on quantitative research,
4322000	4324000	or
4324000	4326000	is it qualitative?
4326000	4328000	Because
4328000	4330000	in the evidence part,
4330000	4332000	I know that
4332000	4334000	I've seen the related research.
4334000	4336000	They are
4336000	4338000	using the model of
4338000	4340000	the Maga Jury
4340000	4342000	to look at the decision
4342000	4344000	between the patient groups.
4344000	4346000	They are in the qualitative part.
4346000	4348000	So I think
4348000	4350000	the first question is
4350000	4352000	that you want to do a
4352000	4354000	quantitative research.
4354000	4356000	Is it based on
4356000	4358000	the data you presented before?
4358000	4360000	Is it based on
4360000	4362000	the data you presented before?
4362000	4364000	Or is it based on the quality?
4366000	4368000	If it's a cross-border research,
4368000	4370000	we are considering
4370000	4372000	both quantitative and quality.
4372000	4374000	For quantitative research,
4374000	4376000	the easiest way is to look at
4376000	4378000	the level of guidance
4378000	4380000	in each country.
4380000	4382000	For the quality,
4382000	4384000	we are considering
4384000	4386000	the level of guidance
4386000	4388000	in each country.
4388000	4390000	So we are considering
4390000	4392000	the level of guidance
4392000	4394000	in each country.
4394000	4396000	So we are considering
4396000	4398000	the level of guidance
4398000	4400000	in each country.
4406000	4408000	The second question is
4408000	4410000	How old is the child?
4410000	4412000	How old is the child?
4412000	4414000	We currently have two groups.
4414000	4416000	One is 5 years old
4416000	4418000	and the other is 8 years old.
4418000	4420000	5 years old is
4420000	4422000	half of 8 years old.
4422000	4424000	8 years old is half of 8 years old.
4424000	4426000	5 years old and 8 years old.
4426000	4428000	5 years old and 8 years old.
4428000	4430000	I have seen
4430000	4432000	online
4432000	4435000	that the relevant
4435000	4437000	children's interviews
4437000	4439000	are usually not appropriate
4439000	4441000	for the age of 11.
4441000	4443000	for the age of 11.
4443000	4445000	for the age of 11.
4445000	4447000	for the age of 11.
4447000	4449000	So I am not sure
4449000	4451000	if the same problem
4451000	4453000	will occur
4453000	4455000	in the law psychology.
4455000	4457000	in the law psychology.
4457000	4459000	in the law psychology.
4459000	4461000	Thank you.
4461000	4463000	We are considering
4463000	4465000	two groups.
4465000	4467000	One is the kindergarten group and the elementary school group.
4467000	4469000	There are several reasons.
4469000	4471000	First of all, the children's testimony
4471000	4473000	is what I saw
4473000	4475000	or what we did in the lab
4475000	4477000	or what I did
4477000	4479000	when I was in the elementary school class.
4479000	4481000	Many of us will mention the age under 11.
4481000	4483000	Many of us will mention the age under 11.
4483000	4485000	Because in the field of children's testimony,
4485000	4487000	when it was created
4487000	4489000	or when everyone was doing research,
4489000	4491000	it was to solve the problem of food.
4491000	4493000	However, many cases
4493000	4495000	of child-like
4495000	4497000	disability
4497000	4499000	include victims
4499000	4501000	or witnesses.
4501000	4503000	They may be children
4503000	4505000	who are quite young.
4505000	4507000	In the United States,
4507000	4509000	most of them are children
4509000	4511000	in kindergarten age.
4511000	4513000	So in the field of children's testimony,
4513000	4515000	especially in the field of pedagogical research,
4515000	4517000	the kindergarten group is usually included.
4517000	4519000	As for the text of my testimony,
4519000	4521000	we are still thinking about
4521000	4523000	the issue of openness.
4523000	4525000	We are still thinking about
4525000	4527000	the issue of openness.
4527000	4529000	We don't know
4529000	4531000	how rich the content
4531000	4533000	of the child's testimony
4533000	4535000	will be.
4535000	4537000	However, there is a mystery
4537000	4539000	that can be solved.
4539000	4541000	If the child is
4541000	4543000	very child-friendly
4543000	4545000	and not too high-pressure,
4545000	4547000	the issue of openness
4547000	4549000	will be solved.
4549000	4551000	However,
4551000	4553000	the child can speak a lot
4553000	4555000	in kindergarten.
4555000	4557000	We are now
4557000	4559000	trying to solve the issue of openness
4559000	4561000	to collect the text of the testimony.
4561000	4563000	We don't know
4563000	4565000	how the result will be.
4565000	4567000	Sorry, I want to add one more thing.
4567000	4569000	If you want to work in Taiwan,
4569000	4571000	the IRB
4571000	4573000	may be a little
4573000	4575000	more difficult.
4575000	4577000	This is my personal experience.
4579000	4581000	Because Talking Age
4581000	4583000	is for children.
4583000	4585000	They will require these things.
4585000	4587000	The IRB is now running.
4587000	4589000	So,
4589000	4591000	fingers crossed.
4591000	4593000	The IRB in Taiwan
4593000	4595000	is probably the easiest
4595000	4597000	to work with
4597000	4599000	in the middle age hospital.
4599000	4601000	If it is in other medical institutions,
4601000	4603000	it may be very troublesome.
4603000	4605000	That's right.
4605000	4607000	Now,
4607000	4609000	the IRB in Taiwan
4609000	4611000	is running.
4611000	4613000	So,
4613000	4615000	fingers crossed.
4615000	4617000	Thank you.
4617000	4619000	Taiwan
4619000	4621000	involves children.
4623000	4625000	Thank you for
4625000	4627000	your encouragement,
4627000	4629000	support and advice.
4629000	4631000	Thank you.
4633000	4635000	So,
4635000	4637000	do you have any other questions?
4639000	4641000	Let me ask you a question.
4641000	4643000	Do you have time?
4643000	4645000	Yes.
4645000	4647000	Please go ahead.
4647000	4649000	I'm sorry.
4649000	4651000	You just mentioned a lot of research
4651000	4653000	about
4653000	4655000	the situation when children
4655000	4657000	were drawn for testimony.
4657000	4659000	Whether they were
4659000	4661000	sedated or
4661000	4663000	not,
4663000	4665000	and so on.
4665000	4667000	It's all about the situation
4667000	4669000	when children were drawn for testimony.
4669000	4671000	I'm thinking about
4671000	4673000	an extreme situation.
4673000	4675000	If the situation is not reliable,
4675000	4677000	let's say we get an article.
4677000	4679000	The article says
4679000	4681000	that this is the testimony of a child.
4681000	4683000	It's written as an article.
4683000	4685000	We don't know what happened.
4685000	4687000	Is there any way
4687000	4689000	to
4689000	4691000	estimate
4691000	4693000	the credibility
4693000	4695000	of the testimony?
4695000	4697000	Why do I think
4697000	4699000	it's like
4699000	4701000	we don't know
4701000	4703000	what happened
4703000	4705000	to the journalists.
4705000	4707000	But we can
4707000	4709000	see from the news
4709000	4711000	that it's fake news.
4711000	4713000	We have that ability.
4713000	4715000	Is there any way
4715000	4717000	to study the credibility
4717000	4719000	of the testimony?
4719000	4721000	I know that
4721000	4723000	a lot of people
4723000	4725000	would go directly.
4725000	4727000	If it's just a text,
4727000	4729000	and there's no recording,
4729000	4731000	let's first see
4731000	4733000	how the text
4733000	4735000	is made.
4735000	4737000	For example, in Taiwan,
4737000	4739000	a lot of text
4739000	4741000	is not written in text
4741000	4743000	because it's easier to record.
4743000	4745000	It's actually a sample.
4745000	4747000	It's hard to analyze
4747000	4749000	from a scientific point of view.
4749000	4751000	If the quality is better,
4751000	4753000	it's really a text.
4753000	4755000	There's a way
4755000	4757000	that
4757000	4759000	I'm not sure
4759000	4761000	if it's possible.
4761000	4763000	You can analyze
4763000	4765000	the form of the question.
4765000	4767000	Is it an open-ended question?
4767000	4769000	If not,
4769000	4771000	does the way it's designed
4771000	4773000	have any guidance?
4773000	4775000	For example,
4775000	4777000	is there any information
4777000	4779000	that hasn't appeared
4779000	4781000	during the interrogation?
4781000	4783000	For example,
4783000	4785000	did your dad
4785000	4787000	touch your sister?
4787000	4789000	It's obviously a guidance question.
4789000	4791000	But if it's
4791000	4793000	like,
4793000	4795000	hello, I'm a policewoman.
4795000	4797000	Can you tell me
4797000	4799000	what your dad did to you?
4799000	4801000	Your dad might be a guide.
4801000	4803000	If there is
4803000	4805000	a more complete text,
4805000	4807000	and you can tell
4807000	4809000	the form of the question,
4809000	4811000	you can analyze
4811000	4813000	the form of the question
4813000	4815000	and see how much
4815000	4817000	guidance it has.
4819000	4821000	I have no more questions.
4821000	4823000	Anyone else?
4825000	4827000	If not,
4827000	4829000	let's give Yilan another round of applause.
4829000	4831000	That's all for today.
4833000	4835000	Thank you.
4835000	4837000	Thank you.
