1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ok, let's start.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ok, first I need to introduce myself.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Please introduce yourself, thank you.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ok, I have prepared a few videos.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I will use them to introduce myself.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today, I will talk about the simple introduction of metal solvents.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Zeyu Lin, and I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
First, I will give a brief self-introduction.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
As I mentioned, I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My department is the National Research and Development Department of the Institute of Materials and Materials Research.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My main job here is...

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sorry, let me use the laser pointer.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
My main job here is to connect the material's microstructure with its mechanical properties,

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
as well as its related performance characteristics.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
At present, I am working on the development of high-strength and high-durability ferrous alloys,

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
as well as the microstructure of permanent magnets,

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
as well as the development of some raw materials.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Today, I would like to introduce my post-doctoral research...

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No, I mean my work accumulated during my post-doctoral studies,

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and my post-doctoral research in February this year,

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
which is about four years of work.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The field of research is mainly the solid-state integration of copper,

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
which is similar in nature, as well as liquid metal.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The integration technology used is a technology called ultrasonic integration.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Its principle is to use high-pressure and high frequency vibration to achieve the deformation of the material to form the node.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It can be used in steel, high-strength steel, or aluminum alloy, etc.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It can be used in...

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The main scene that can be considered is that the composite structure of multi-materials,

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
such as the structure of the car body,

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
can achieve the goal characteristics of lightweighting and high strength.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sorry, I just made a mistake.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I graduated from Tokyo University of Japan in 2019,

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and majored in material engineering.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
My other major is the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China,

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's all for the main self-introduction.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Next, I'm going to start introducing today's main speech topic,

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
which is mainly about the integration of solid-state and liquid metal materials that are similar in nature,

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and then use ultrasonic integration to observe the strength of its interface.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
First, I will give a simple background introduction.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In the engineering background,

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
listeners may be more familiar with the fact that

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
steel is a very solid base.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It is one of the basic and indispensable materials.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The picture on the left shows that

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
there are about 15% to 20% of steel in the world every year.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Because there are a lot of steel applications,

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
including architecture, general people, military facilities, transportation, etc.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It accounts for about 15% to 20% of transportation.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It is mainly applied to the construction of car parts and the structure of the car body.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There are a lot of types of steel used,

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
including soft steel, medium-strength, high-strength, and ultra-high-strength steel.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
At present, the development field of materials is mainly focused on

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
how to improve its extensibility and high-strength, etc.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The picture on the lower left is called DynamoCurve,

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
which is a curve distribution like a banana.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why is there such a distribution?

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It is mainly derived from the fact that the strength of the material increases,

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but the extensibility does not decrease.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Based on the background of traditional physics,

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
such strength and extensibility are indispensable.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
However, many scientists are using various methods

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to try to get out of this field.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The current research situation is to try to achieve the high strength and high extensibility of both, etc.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why do we need such a high-strength steel development?

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It is mainly used when the car body is hit by a heavy object.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
High-strength steel can often provide stronger support

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to avoid fatal damage to passengers.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In order to improve safety,

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the current material development is mainly focused on high-strength and high extensibility, etc.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What kind of steel is used?

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Different strengths of steel are used in different areas of the car body structure.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is a simple introduction.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can clearly see that

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
if the car is hit by a heavy object,

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the stress and gravity come from the front and back, etc.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
At this time, you need a high-strength structural material

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to support the entire car body.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The current high-strength steel developed by traditional physics

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
has reached 780, 980, 1180, etc.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This represents the strength of steel,

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
which is about 550 MPa.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The current mainstream high-strength steel is

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
concentrated in the front and back of 1000 MPa.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is the current situation in which the structural material is used.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
On the other hand,

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
if we don't use steel,

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and we use a high-strength material,

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
it will not be able to support the entire car body.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
On the other hand,

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
if we don't use steel,

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and we use a high-strength material,

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
such as aluminum, copper, and carbon fiber, etc.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If we use this material,

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it can be made very lightweight

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and has sufficient safety.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
However, the price is also very high.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
As you can see here,

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
for a good car like Audi R8,

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the recommended price in 2020 is about $70,000.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This price is hard to meet for ordinary people.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So we mainly use traditional steel

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and aluminum and carbon fiber.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
In this respect,

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you have to make a choice

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
in terms of cost and mechanical quality.

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The name of the car body structure we often use in our industry

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is a multi-material structure.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Multi-Material Structure

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
As you can see here,

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
in addition to steel,

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
it also has a lot of external body parts,

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
such as the door, engine cover, etc.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In order to make it lightweight,

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
we usually use aluminum alloy.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The main maintenance material is aluminum alloy.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
In this respect,

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
when the car body is assembled,

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
we mainly use

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
high-strength steel

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and aluminum alloy.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In this respect,

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
they need to be fixed and processed

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to form a complete structure.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It is conceivable that

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
some processes need to be processed

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to combine them together.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In recent years,

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
in addition to the emission of environmental regulations,

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the demand for lightweighting is increasing.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
On the right side of the slide,

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
there is a picture of

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the materials used in the field of cars

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
in 2030,

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
including aluminum and high-strength steel.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HSF stands for High Strength Steel.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The ratio of these two materials

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
will increase from 29% to 57%.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In the near future,

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
in order to establish high strength

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and lightweighting,

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
we will use more aluminum

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and more high-strength steel.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Therefore, how to combine

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
iron and lightweighting alloy

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
in the manufacturing process

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is quite important.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now we will introduce

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the traditional way

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
of combining materials

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and manufacturing technology,

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
i.e. welding.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Traditionally,

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
we define welding

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
as a process

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
in which two separate materials

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
are heated

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
to a high temperature

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and then combined

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to produce

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
sufficient quality

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
welding.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
In this process,

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the defects

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
will gradually disappear.

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
At such a high temperature,

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
along with the change

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
in the structure

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
of the fibers

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and the growth

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
of the center,

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
heat is also affected,

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and so on.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
In this regard,

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the material itself

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
is mechanically affected

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
by the change

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
in the structure

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
of the fibers.

180
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
After the welding point

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is formed,

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
all the fibers

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
around it

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
will undergo

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
huge changes.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Such changes

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
are sometimes not

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
completely positive.

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
How to prevent

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
low-performance

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
welding?

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The first point

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
is to use

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
a high temperature

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
to melt steel

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and aluminum.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There will be several problems.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The first is that

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
aluminum and steel

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
have very different melting points.

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The melting point of aluminum

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is about 600 degrees,

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
while that of steel

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
is about 1400 to 1500 degrees.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
At high temperature,

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
it will generate

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
a huge

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
for aluminum,

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
at such a high temperature,

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
it will generate a huge

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
firepower,

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and it will generate a lot of expansion.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Expansion will form

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
various compounds

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
between steel and aluminum

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
in the interface.

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This compound

218
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
has a very poor mechanical performance.

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why?

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because the problem it encounters

221
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
is very brittle,

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and it is very impenetrable.

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
After a little impact,

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
it will crack like ceramic

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
or glass.

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That is to say,

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the function of the melting point itself

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
will fail.

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
At the same time,

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
there will be cracks

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
in the interface

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
due to high temperature

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
.

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is quite disadvantageous

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
to mechanical manufacturing.

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That is to say,

237
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
at high temperature,

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
it is quite disadvantageous

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to combine steel and aluminum

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
with general combination technology.

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
In other words,

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
what we may consider next

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
is how to

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
reduce the temperature of the combination.

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That is to say,

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the combination technology at low temperature

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
can prevent

248
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
such a problem

249
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
to a certain extent.

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That is to say,

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
we will focus on

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
how to combine steel and aluminum.

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That is, we want to combine

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
at the melting point of steel and aluminum,

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
which is about 660 degrees.

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Combining at this temperature

257
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
is called solidification.

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That is to say, there is no

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
fusion between the two.

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Next,

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will introduce

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
solidification.

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
As I mentioned earlier,

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it can combine

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
two components

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
there will be no fusion

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
during the process.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Its heating is also

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
lower than the melting point of any material.

271
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What we need

272
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
is to introduce more

273
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
sufficient deformation

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
in the material interface.

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
At sufficient temperature,

276
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the interface will expand.

277
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
After the expansion,

278
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
the defects will gradually disappear.

279
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That is to say,

280
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the effect of combining.

281
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Here, our main

282
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
design concept is

283
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
that the main concept of solidification

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
is how to make

285
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the defects on the interface disappear,

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
including holes and

287
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
cavities, etc.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
At the same time,

289
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
most materials

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
usually have a layer of

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
pollutants on the surface,

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
such as carbon

293
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and oxygen,

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and other compounds.

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
At the same time,

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
there will be a certain

297
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
degree of oxidation film

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
on the surface.

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You may have heard

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that aluminum

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
is very easy to oxidize.

302
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It forms a layer

303
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
of very self-destructive oxidation film

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
on the surface.

305
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This oxidation film

306
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
is self-destructive enough

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
to protect the material inside

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
from further oxidation and deformation.

309
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This kind of oxidation film

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
is quite beneficial in the

311
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
combination.

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Traditionally, we still have to

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
achieve the contact between the

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
pure atom and the atom

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
in solidification.

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That is to say,

317
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
the contact between the

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
pure atom and the atom

319
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
or the metal atom

320
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
is formed.

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
On the other hand,

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
we can say that

323
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
we have introduced

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
enough deformation

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
at high temperature

326
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
to make it like clay

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to stir

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and form a

329
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
interlocking interface structure.

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
OK

331
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Here,

332
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I will

333
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
make a brief introduction

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
to solid-state integration.

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
In traditional

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
solid-state integration,

337
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the first method is called expansion integration.

338
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The main principle is to use

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
high pressure and high temperature

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
to apply on two objects

341
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
that need to be combined.

342
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
With such high temperature and high pressure

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
condition, it can form

344
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
interlocking structure in enough time.

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Such

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
integration method can be applied

347
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
on metal or ceramic

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
or metal

349
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
or even carbon fiber.

350
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But the problem is that

351
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
its integration time is quite long and

352
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
requires a higher integration temperature.

353
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
At the same time,

354
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
assuming that the interface is over

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
high temperature and over a long time,

356
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it will form an

357
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
overly complex structure,

358
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
including a metal-based object,

359
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
which is what we mentioned earlier,

360
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
forming a layer

361
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
like a ceramic,

362
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
a non-extensible middle layer.

363
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This middle layer

364
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
has a very weak mechanical nature,

365
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and is not conducive to the overall integration strength.

366
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
On the other hand,

367
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the other

368
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is friction-mixing integration.

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Its principle is

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to use a high-speed

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
rotating

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
welding head.

373
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The surface friction

374
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
forms a high temperature.

375
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
After the high temperature, the material

376
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
gradually softens,

377
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
but it is not yet at the melting point.

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So it will be like

379
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
clay.

380
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
After it softens,

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the welding head can be pressed down

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and start to move.

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Then move along

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
the seam between the two.

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let the interface

386
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
gradually pass through

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
the welding head.

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But on the other hand,

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
this material

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
can be used in all kinds of

391
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
aluminum alloy, aluminum-ferrous alloy,

392
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
etc. Its application range is quite wide.

393
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
For example,

394
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
let's take the

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Japanese alloy as an example.

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It mainly uses

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
this kind of

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
alloying technology

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
for the

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
combination of

401
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
materials.

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
On the other hand,

403
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
its shortcomings are

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that it takes a long time to

405
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
combine, and

406
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
after it is combined,

407
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
there will be some

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
differences in the interface.

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
At the same time,

410
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
on the other hand,

411
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the time it takes to combine

412
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
also takes a long time to

413
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
combine.

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
As a result,

415
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
based on

416
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
this background,

417
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
based on this background,

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
we use another

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
type of alloying technology.

420
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This is called ultrasonic welding,

421
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
which is ultrasonic welding.

422
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The principle of ultrasonic welding

423
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
may be mentioned earlier.

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It is a certain degree of pressure

425
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
on the two overlapping

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
blades,

427
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
which is about

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
15,000 to 24,000

429
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
degrees,

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and then the

431
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
interface is

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
friction-heated.

433
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
In this case,

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
the interface will

435
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
develop a

436
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
deformity

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that will

438
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
form a

439
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
fiber structure

440
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
that causes

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the surface

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
interface to

443
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
be damaged.

444
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Therefore,

445
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
it is not

446
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
conducive to

447
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
the production of

448
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
metal-fiber products

449
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
with mechanical strength.

450
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Therefore,

451
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
it is expected to

452
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
be used in

453
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
car lightweighting

454
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and high-strength

455
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
composite structure

456
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
materials manufacturing in the

457
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
future.

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
At the same time,

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
there is also a lower

460
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
combination temperature

461
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
compared to the

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
general ultrasonic welding.

463
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
At the same time,

464
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
the friction heat

465
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
formed in the

466
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
interface is

467
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
quite small.

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The friction heat

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
formed in the

470
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
small area

471
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
affects the strength

472
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
of the material

473
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and the machine itself,

474
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and it can be fully combined

475
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to produce less

476
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
micro-structural changes.

477
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is quite beneficial

478
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
to the overall production.

479
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
On the other hand,

480
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the picture below

481
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
is the application

482
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
of the current

483
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
ultrasonic welding

484
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
on the base

485
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and the

486
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
high-speed vibration of

487
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the water and the

488
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
friction heat of the

489
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
interface and the

490
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
transformation of

491
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
water and water

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
to form a

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
composite

494
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
carry out

496
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
the process of

497
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
mechanical manufacturing.

498
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
About the

499
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
1960s,

500
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
the main application

501
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
scene was used

502
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
on the

503
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
printing circuit board

504
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
to make the

505
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
chips.

506
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It is a technique

507
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
often used in

508
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
circuit board manufacturing.

509
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It also uses

510
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
pressure and vibration

511
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to complete the

512
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
combination on the

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
surface of the

514
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
chip.

515
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Combining the

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
main principles,

517
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
we can make a

518
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
more detailed introduction.

519
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Traditionally,

520
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
there may be hundreds to

521
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
thousands of newtons of

522
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
pressure on the

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
pressure.

524
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
After the

525
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
pressure is

526
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
fixed, the

527
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
vibration is usually

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
20 to 60 microns.

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The vibration is

530
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
about 15,000 to 24,000

531
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
per second.

532
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
In such a short

533
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and dense vibration,

534
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the interface will

535
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
generate a lot of deformation

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and a lot of friction

537
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
heat.

538
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The temperature of

539
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
friction heat and deformation

540
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
can be completed

541
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
by combining the

542
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
shape of the interface.

543
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
However,

544
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
due to the

545
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
high-speed deformation of the

546
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
interface,

547
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
various phenomena such as

548
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
heat and expansion

549
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
will occur.

550
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Therefore, in so many

551
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
interfaces, including heat,

552
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
expansion, and deformation,

553
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
the interface formation mechanism

554
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
is not easy to

555
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
understand, especially

556
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
when it comes to

557
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
soft metal materials.

558
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
For harder materials,

559
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
such as steel and

560
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
carbon,

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
it is quite rare

562
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
to use the

563
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
scene to

564
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
combine the

565
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
formation of the

566
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
interface mechanism.

567
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
If we now

568
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
further

569
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
progress to

570
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
how to use the

571
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
superfine fiber to

572
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
apply it on hard materials,

573
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
mainly in some

574
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
preliminary research,

575
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
most of the

576
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
superfine fiber is used

577
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
in aluminum alloy or

578
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
aluminum alloy, etc.,

579
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
which is called soft material.

580
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The interface will form

581
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
after it reaches a high temperature,

582
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
like clay,

583
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
such as deformation and compression.

584
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The deformation and compression

585
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
process causes a lot of

586
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
changes in the

587
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
fiber structure of the

588
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
interface.

589
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
However,

590
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
if the superfine fiber

591
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is used

592
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
on steel,

593
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
iron,

594
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and carbon,

595
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
this part needs to be

596
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
further explored.

597
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
On the other hand,

598
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
if it is used on hard materials,

599
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the combination of

600
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
iron and aluminum

601
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
has been done in

602
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
a lot of preliminary research.

603
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
They are mainly concentrated

604
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
in a short time,

605
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
within a few seconds,

606
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
they can form

607
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
about 30 minutes

608
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
in the expansion

609
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
process.

610
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
IMC is mainly

611
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
intermetallic,

612
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
which is not

613
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
conducive to

614
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
mechanical properties.

615
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Most of the research

616
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
is focused on this later stage

617
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
of intermetallic

618
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
formation.

619
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
On the other hand,

620
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
in the early stage,

621
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the material was rubbed,

622
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
molded, and then transformed.

623
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
After the transformation,

624
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
how will the

625
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
interface

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
form?

627
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
This mechanism is relatively rare,

628
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
but this part is also right.

629
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Superfine fiber

630
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
application

631
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
has a significant impact

632
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
on the combination of

633
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
iron and aluminum.

634
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Therefore,

635
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
we mainly

636
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
use superfine fiber

637
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
for the

638
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
interface of

639
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
superfine fiber and

640
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
iron.

641
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
First, we will

642
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
divide it into

643
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
interface reactions

644
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
when it is combined.

645
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
On the other hand,

646
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
we will use another type of metal

647
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
combination to discuss

648
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
how to combine

649
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
in a shorter time

650
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
.

651
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Here,

652
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I may have mentioned that

653
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
the first part is

654
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
to understand

655
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
its interface

656
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
when it is combined

657
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
.

658
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We will use iron and aluminum,

659
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and iron and iron.

660
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The main purpose is that

661
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
there is no interface reaction

662
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
between the two,

663
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
so we use iron and aluminum.

664
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
After the combination,

665
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the interface analysis will be more difficult.

666
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
As a contrast,

667
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
we use iron and aluminum to combine.

668
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
On the other hand,

669
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
from the principle introduction above,

670
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
it can be said that

671
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
only high-speed friction

672
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
will cause contact between the interface.

673
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The deepening of the contact point

674
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and the roughness of the material surface

675
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
have a significant impact.

676
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Research in this area

677
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
is not sufficient.

678
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
On the one hand,

679
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
one part of the research

680
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
focuses on the roughness of the surface

681
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and the impact on the strength of the combination.

682
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
On the other hand,

683
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
because we have to use iron

684
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and other materials to combine,

685
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the mechanical performance of iron

686
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
such as hardness and strength

687
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
will also have an impact

688
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
on the nature of the combination.

689
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Therefore, the hardness of the iron itself

690
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and the different micro-structures

691
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
will also have an impact

692
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
in the next introduction.

693
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
On the other hand,

694
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
why do we choose these two combinations

695
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
such as iron and aluminum

696
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and iron and titanium

697
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
?

698
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The main reason is that

699
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
aluminum and titanium

700
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
have different deformation capabilities

701
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
at high temperatures.

702
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Therefore, we plan to

703
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
explore the impact of

704
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
these two different materials

705
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
.

706
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Because of time,

707
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
we will directly enter the

708
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
experimental step.

709
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
First of all, it is the combination of

710
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
iron and aluminum.

711
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The material we use

712
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
is a soft

713
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
non-metallic atomic steel,

714
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
a medium-strength steel,

715
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and a pure aluminum plate

716
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
as a research subject.

717
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
On the surface,

718
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
it is exposed to the mirror.

719
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
After the exposure,

720
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
we will measure the roughness

721
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
of the surface.

722
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Next, we use superfine steel

723
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
to make superfine steel.

724
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The main combination

725
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
condition is that we use

726
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
a pressure of about 2000 newtons,

727
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
which is applied to

728
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
about 10 times the

729
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
thickness of the steel,

730
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
which is about 20,000 times per second

731
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and about 40 microns

732
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
.

733
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The combined time is about

734
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
0.01 seconds to

735
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
2.0 seconds.

736
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
After the superfine steel

737
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
is combined,

738
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the next step is to

739
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
stretch the time to judge

740
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
its combined strength.

741
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
After the stretching is broken,

742
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
suppose that it is broken on the interface,

743
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
we will observe

744
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the electronic microscope

745
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and analyze the microstructure.

746
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
On the other hand,

747
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
if it is not suitable for stretching time,

748
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
we will prepare another batch of

749
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
samples that have not yet been stretched.

750
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
After the sample is cut

751
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
into two halves,

752
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the surface is exposed

753
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and the electronic microscope

754
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
is used

755
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
to observe

756
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
its image

757
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and the deformation

758
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
of the interface

759
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
.

760
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
First of all,

761
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
suppose we use

762
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
steel and iron,

763
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and iron and iron

764
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and iron and iron and iron

765
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
on the interface,

766
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
we use

767
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
superfine steel to combine,

768
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
we can see that the horizontal axis

769
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
is the combined strength and the vertical axis

770
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
is the combined time.

771
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It is obvious that

772
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
it only takes about

773
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
2 seconds.

774
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Its strength

775
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
is about

776
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
2,000 newtons.

777
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
This sufficient pull strength

778
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
is enough to break

779
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the IF steel,

780
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
that is, the infrared atomic steel itself.

781
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It is greater than

782
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
the strength of the steel itself.

783
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
On the other hand,

784
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
if we compare it with other combinations,

785
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
such as expanding

786
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and combining iron and iron,

787
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
it takes a relatively long

788
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
time, about 50 seconds,

789
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and requires a certain degree of

790
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
high temperature.

791
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In this case,

792
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
if we compare

793
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
the microstructure of the interface

794
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
with the microstructure of the microscope,

795
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
we find that the deformation of the interface

796
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
is quite concentrated,

797
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
about only 10 micrometers

798
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
before and after.

799
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
On the other hand,

800
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
if we compare it with the FASW

801
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
combined with friction mixing,

802
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
it is about 15 to 20

803
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
micrometers.

804
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
At the same time, it is accompanied by a very serious deformation.

805
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Such a severe deformation

806
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
is reliable to the welding point itself.

807
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That is to say,

808
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
its durability is

809
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
also a subject to

810
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
consider.

811
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Therefore,

812
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
the superimposed interface

813
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
shows that it can be done

814
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
in a short time without

815
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
a lot of deformation

816
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
.

817
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
On the other hand,

818
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
if it is used on

819
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
the interface of iron and iron

820
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and iron and nickel,

821
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
this part

822
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
is that we did

823
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
electronic microscope

824
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and EBSD analysis on it.

825
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
We found that the

826
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
formation of the interface

827
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
will form a small

828
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
friction particle on the interface.

829
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
This friction particle will gradually increase

830
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and at the same time be accompanied by friction

831
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
to friction the upper and lower

832
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
nickel and iron body.

833
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
After enough time

834
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and temperature, it will

835
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
gradually be compressed.

836
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
After the compression,

837
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
it will produce a serious deformation

838
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and then spread to the entire

839
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
integrated interface

840
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
to complete the formation of the integrated interface.

841
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
At the same time,

842
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
it is accompanied by the

843
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
interface and

844
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
the

845
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
interface and

846
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the

847
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
interface.

848
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
If

849
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
with enough time,

850
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
the superimposed

851
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
interface

852
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
can form enough

853
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
partial and

854
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
serious deformation.

855
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It can be completed in a short time.

856
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
On the other hand,

857
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
the surface of the superimposed

858
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
interface is

859
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
on the other hand,

860
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
if we use a thicker

861
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
interface, the

862
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
time of the

863
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
interface will be shorter

864
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and the time of the

865
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
interface will be longer.

866
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
If it is a thicker

867
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
interface,

868
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
it will form a thicker

869
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and larger

870
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
situation such as

871
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
how to compress

872
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
these three peaks and three valleys.

873
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It takes a longer time and

874
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
pressure to compress it,

875
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and then the interface will form such a

876
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
deformed surface to form more

877
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
integrated interfaces.

878
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Therefore, a slightly smoother

879
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
integrated interface

880
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
does not have any

881
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
pollutants or oxidizers,

882
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
etc. It is powerful.

883
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
On the other hand,

884
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
if it is

885
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the type of steel itself,

886
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
if it is replaced,

887
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
because what we mentioned earlier

888
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
is that it uses a

889
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
relatively

890
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
average fiber structure

891
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
of ferrite

892
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
IF steel.

893
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Next, we will use

894
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
polystyrene

895
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and ferrite

896
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
neutral carbon steel

897
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and 14% nickel steel

898
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and 0.08%

899
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
low carbon steel.

900
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Their hardness and

901
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
microstructure will be

902
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
a relatively

903
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
close comparison.

904
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This part is

905
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
ferrite itself.

906
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
In addition to the

907
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
IF steel used at the beginning,

908
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
we also prepared different types of steel.

909
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Here,

910
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
ferrite, porcelain steel, and

911
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
martensite steel have different hardness.

912
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
As the hardness increases,

913
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the combination of strength

914
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
is getting lower and lower.

915
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Compared with the beginning,

916
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
nickel and IF steel only need

917
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
2 seconds to complete the combination.

918
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
On the other hand,

919
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
ferrite and ferrite

920
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
neutral carbon steel

921
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
need about 5 seconds to

922
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
complete the combination.

923
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
On the other hand,

924
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
once the hardness of

925
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
martensite steel is about

926
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
200 to 300 hardness,

927
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it needs more time to complete the combination.

928
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Why do we have

929
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
different situations?

930
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We analyzed the interface

931
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and found that

932
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
for the same steel photo,

933
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
the bottom is

934
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
porcelain steel,

935
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
the right bottom is ferrite.

936
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Ferrite and nickel

937
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
will form more friction resistance.

938
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This friction resistance has a

939
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
partial shrinkage and deformation.

940
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
On the other hand,

941
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
ferrite and nickel

942
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
have a relatively low deformation.

943
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
At the same time,

944
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the interface

945
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
still has a defect.

946
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That is to say,

947
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
steel steel

948
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
requires a long time to complete the combination.

949
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
At the same time,

950
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
we can get

951
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
a conclusion

952
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that

953
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
ferrite steel

954
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
has a relatively similar

955
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
hardness.

956
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It can provide

957
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
more

958
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
shrinkage and deformation.

959
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
This large-scale shrinkage and deformation

960
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
is conducive to the increase in the strength of the combination.

961
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Therefore,

962
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
this part is

963
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the friction

964
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
generated by the

965
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
combination.

966
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Friction has

967
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
different mechanisms.

968
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It is mainly divided into

969
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
ferrite and

970
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
nickel friction.

971
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The main difference between the two is that

972
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
the interface

973
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
on the ferrite and nickel

974
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
will form

975
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
something like a friction resistance.

976
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
On the other hand,

977
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
if it is nickel,

978
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
in the case of

979
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
nickel,

980
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
the harder material

981
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
on the ferrite

982
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
will break down

983
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and form

984
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
friction.

985
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
In other words,

986
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
such a situation occurs

987
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
when the hardness difference is relatively large,

988
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
such as nickel and ferrite.

989
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
In other words,

990
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the first part of the

991
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
conclusion here

992
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
focuses on the appearance of

993
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
friction particles

994
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
with a relatively large

995
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
friction resistance.

996
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
On the other hand,

997
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
if it is ferrite,

998
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
the friction loss

999
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
in the ferrite itself

1000
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
will take longer

1001
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to eliminate

1002
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
such interface defects

1003
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to complete the

1004
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
formation of the combination.

1005
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The second part

1006
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
is the

1007
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
strength of the combination.

1008
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
In other words,

1009
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
in the case of

1010
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
a reaction,

1011
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the formation of the

1012
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
combination interface

1013
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
will be skipped.

1014
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
In other words,

1015
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
at the initial stage,

1016
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
before the formation of

1017
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
the interface,

1018
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
how does the

1019
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
interface system evolve?

1020
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
This is the part

1021
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
to be discussed.

1022
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
First of all,

1023
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in the case of

1024
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
ferrite,

1025
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
we use the traditional

1026
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
IF steel mentioned earlier,

1027
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
as well as 5000-grade aluminum alloy,

1028
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and then superimpose the

1029
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
interface.

1030
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
During the process of

1031
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
interface, we will

1032
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
stick a thermocouple

1033
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
to measure the temperature of

1034
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the interface.

1035
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The picture on the right

1036
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
shows the change in

1037
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
strength of the

1038
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
interface.

1039
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
After 1 second,

1040
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the strength of the

1041
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
interface increased rapidly

1042
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
to 2.5 seconds,

1043
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and the

1044
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
interface was

1045
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
completed.

1046
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
After that,

1047
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
the strength of the

1048
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
interface decreased

1049
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
gradually,

1050
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and the

1051
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
temperature of the

1052
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
interface increased

1053
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
rapidly.

1054
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The temperature of the

1055
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
interface increased

1056
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
rapidly.

1057
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
In about 1 second,

1058
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
the temperature reached

1059
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
about 400 degrees.

1060
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We compared it with

1061
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
the previous study,

1062
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and found that the temperature

1063
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
obtained in 1 second was

1064
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
about 400 degrees.

1065
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The ability of the

1066
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
interface to transform

1067
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
increased rapidly,

1068
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and the

1069
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
interface's

1070
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
defective adjustment

1071
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and integration were

1072
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
enough to

1073
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
complete the

1074
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
interface.

1075
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
On the other hand,

1076
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
we used the

1077
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
electromagnetic microscope

1078
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to observe the

1079
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
defective adjustment

1080
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and integration of the

1081
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
interface.

1082
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The defective adjustment

1083
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and integration of the

1084
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
interface were

1085
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
enough to complete

1086
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
the complete

1087
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
integration of the

1088
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
interface in 2.5 seconds.

1089
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Therefore,

1090
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
we can classify the

1091
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
whole phenomenon

1092
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
as the initial

1093
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
phase of the

1094
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
interface.

1095
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
After the

1096
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
interface was

1097
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
frictionized,

1098
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
it would break off

1099
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
from the

1100
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
machine's side

1101
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and attach to the

1102
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
iron's side.

1103
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
As time went on,

1104
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
the interface's

1105
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
ability to transform

1106
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
under high temperature

1107
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
was not as obvious

1108
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
as that of aluminum.

1109
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
On the other hand,

1110
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
some basic

1111
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
physics concepts

1112
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
may know that

1113
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
iron is a hexagonal

1114
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
metal.

1115
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If the hexagonal metal

1116
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
is subjected to friction in

1117
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
transformation,

1118
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
it will have many

1119
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
limitations.

1120
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Therefore,

1121
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
we can see that

1122
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
the integration strength of the

1123
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
interface gradually

1124
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
reached a platform

1125
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
before 2 seconds.

1126
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It reached a

1127
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
stable state.

1128
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
However,

1129
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
after 2 seconds,

1130
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
the strength of the

1131
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
interface increased dramatically.

1132
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Why did this happen?

1133
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
At first,

1134
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
before the

1135
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
interface reached

1136
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
a stable state,

1137
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
we thought that

1138
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
after 2 seconds,

1139
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
we would find that

1140
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
once it passed

1141
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
600 degrees,

1142
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
it would

1143
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
produce a

1144
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
lower

1145
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
contact point

1146
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
on the

1147
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
left side

1148
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
of the

1149
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
interface.

1150
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That is to say,

1151
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
from the original

1152
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
HCP type

1153
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
to the BCC type.

1154
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
BCC's

1155
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
transformation ability

1156
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
is better than

1157
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
the hexagonal

1158
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
metal's

1159
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
HCP,

1160
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
the densest hexagonal metal.

1161
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
In the next step,

1162
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
in order to verify

1163
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
our assumption,

1164
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
we observed the interface

1165
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and found that

1166
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
at about 2.0 seconds,

1167
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
the interface would

1168
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
break off on the

1169
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
left side of the

1170
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
HCP type

1171
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and stick to the

1172
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
metal's side.

1173
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
After 2 seconds,

1174
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
the interface's

1175
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
original gap

1176
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
would disappear

1177
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
after 2.0 seconds.

1178
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The gap would

1179
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
gradually disappear.

1180
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So,

1181
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
3.0 seconds

1182
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
is enough to

1183
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
complete the interface.

1184
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
In contrast,

1185
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
the expansion interface

1186
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
mentioned earlier

1187
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
usually takes

1188
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
about 1-2 hours

1189
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
to complete

1190
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
the metal-type interface.

1191
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We also found that

1192
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
after about 2.0 seconds,

1193
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
the interface would

1194
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
break off on the left side of the

1195
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
HCP type.

1196
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
We also found that

1197
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
at about 2.0 seconds,

1198
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
the interface would

1199
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
break off on the

1200
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
HCP type.

1202
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
In contrast,

1203
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
after 2.5 seconds,

1204
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the interface would

1205
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
break off on the
